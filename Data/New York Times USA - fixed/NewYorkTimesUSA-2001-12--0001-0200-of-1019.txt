HEADLINE: SHELF LIFE; 
Why Western Soldiers Have Always Been Such Fierce Fighters

BYLINE:  By Edward Rothstein 

 BODY:
In 480 B.C., near Salamis off the coast of Greece, an armada of perhaps a thousand Persian ships attacked some 300 Greek vessels. This was, as the military historian and classicist Victor Davis Hanson writes in this provocative book, "one of the most deadly battles in the entire history of naval warfare." Lured by a brilliant Greek strategy through the narrow straits, and rammed by Greek ships, hundreds of Persian vessels were sunk; more than 40,000 Persian soldiers were drowned or killed.
 But Mr. Hanson, who teaches at California State University in Fresno, says this battle is more than just a textbook example of warfare. Herodotus pointed out that many of the Persian fighters were mercenaries or slaves; any soldierly hesitation was typically punished by beheading. Free citizens, Herodotus argued, made better warriors -- more motivated and more flexible. The Greeks were fighting, as Aeschylus pointed out, for their freedom; the Persians, out of fear or greed. 
 For Mr. Hanson, these differences were not only evident at Salamis. Mr. Hanson also examines nine battles extending over 2,500 years, including the defeat of the Romans by Hannibal in 216 B.C.; the battle between Christians and Muslems at Lepanto in 1571; the massacre of the British by the Zulus in 1879; and the confusion of the 1968 Tet offensive of the Vietnam War. In his view, the distinctive characteristics of Western culture ran through each of these battles. 
Western armies tended to rely on warriors who were not mercenaries but free citizens with something personal at stake. The mixture of discipline and autonomy led to a particular style of engagement. Unlike the Persians, the Aztecs, the Zulus, the Ottomans and the Japanese, who brutally enforced absolute obedience, Western fighters have been relatively free to react to shifting events. This flexibility helped determine the American victory in the bloody battles against Japan at Midway in World War II, Mr. Hanson says. 
It also permitted debate before, during and after battles, debate that has given Western accounts of military history extraordinary variety and authority. In addition, individualism and innovation, partly spurred by economies freer than those of opponents, led to the invention of weapons that have been adopted by every major military force in the world. 
In many of these battles, of course, Western culture could also contribute to its own defeat. Hannibal and his motley army took advantage of what Mr. Hanson characterizes as Western assault strategy to kill 50,000 Roman soldiers in 216 B.C. In Vietnam, the Tet offensive was widely considered a Western defeat (a mistaken judgment, in Mr. Hanson's view), partly because American planners "completely ignored the tenets of the entire Western military heritage"; the Western tradition of dissent, he suggests, also overwhelmed that heritage. But Mr. Hanson asserts that in the West, defeats have not been final; they have led to introspective revision. Rome rose again; the experience of Vietnam led to decades of analysis. 
In his interpretation, Mr. Hanson combines two visions of the West that have themselves been at war during the last 30 years: the celebration of the West for its democratic vision of human liberty, and the condemnation of the West for militarism and imperialism. The tendency is to see these positions as incompatible. 
Mr. Hanson argues that the reverse is true: they are inseparable. Democratic ideals have led to greater military power. "Adherence to structures of constitutional government, capitalism, freedom of religious and political association, free speech and intellectual tolerance," he says, has produced a soldier who can "kill like none other on the planet." These characteristics have made war between Western countries among the bloodiest, but have also led to the triumph of the West. 
In making this argument, Mr. Hanson joins a group of scholars who do not explain Western dominance as a result of modern imperialism. Jared Diamond (in "Guns, Germs, and Steel") sees geography and environment as the primary influences on the development of Western technology and power; David S. Landes (in "The Wealth and Poverty of Nations") argues that differences in cultural values and social organization made the difference. Mr. Hanson disagrees with Mr. Diamond but amplifies Mr. Landes's argument, suggesting that culture, however admirable, creates a "very deadly reality" in the outcomes of war. The West, he writes, possesses a "weighty and sometimes ominous heritage" in which its manner of war ideally "serves, rather than buries, our civilization."
Military historians will have to analyze Mr. Hanson's accounts. Indeed, not everything is convincing in his generalizations. Mr. Hanson also does not successfully address the nature of modern guerilla warfare, the nature of Islamic triumphs, the wide variations among Western nations or the ways in which Western strategic style grows out of Western culture.
But after Sept. 11, other issues come to mind while reading the book. Even applying Mr. Hanson's interpretation, the culture of Western warfare is being tested against a very different kind of opponent. Certainly, Western individualism and improvisation could remain important. His view of Western military technique could arguably be found in October's swift frontal assaults of air power on specific targets. And disagreements about strategy among the leaders of the war -- hidden or forbidden in many other societies -- have already become the subject of public debate. 
Yet given the international reach of the enemy, its networked cells, the absence of a traditional battlefield and the resilience of terrorist passions, that military heritage may be challenged. Both the Defense Department and the Rand Corporation have already called for a structural revision of the military by creating decentralized networks better prepared for new forms of battle. It may be that in this case not only will Western culture influence styles of war, but styles of war will also begin to transform Western culture.

HEADLINE: Whitney Museum Cuts Its Staff and Budget 

BYLINE:  By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

 BODY:
The Whitney Museum of American Art announced a package of layoff and budget cuts yesterday intended to pull the 70-year-old museum through a financial crisis that was largely precipated by a sudden and drastic drop in out-of-town visitors.
 The Whitney is the second major New York Museum to make painful cuts after the Sept. 11 disaster, which has kept many American and foreign tourists from coming to New York City. 
 Last month, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum announced that it would be laying off 80 people -- or almost 20 percent of its staff -- as it struggles to balance its budget for next year. The layoffs at the Whitney are less drastic, totaling 12 full-time and two part-time employees, out of a staff of 210 people. 
The Whitney, like the Guggenheim, is also planning to cut its scheduled roster of exhibitions in 2002. An exhibition of works by Eva Hesse, the minimalist sculptor, which was coming on loan from the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, has been canceled, while another exhibition by Michal Rovner, a contemporary artist, is now on hold while a search for sponsors continues, said Mary Haus, the museum's spokeswoman.
The museum's 2002 Biennial Exhibition, a traditional showcase for contemporary American artists, will take place as planned from March to May next year.
Maxwell Anderson, director of the Whitney, said these and other cutbacks would save about $1 million in the museum's current $23 million operating budget. The 2001-2 budget year, which began on July 1, had already anticipated a deficit, but Mr. Anderson said the decisions taken by the museum's board of trustees on Thursday should bring the budget almost into balance.
The Whitney is also getting a boost from a three-year, $4.5 million grant given by Tyco International Ltd. in support of the museum's traveling exhibitions. Mr. Anderson said that the grant would help both promote the museum's collection of American art and underwrite costs for the exhibition staff at the New York museum.
"We have no intention of keeping the institution from growing just because of a short-term problem," he said.
With the exception of one curatorial assistant, most of the staff cuts have come in the administrative and support staff, including those on the Whitney's Web site, which will now be managed outside the museum. 
Attendance at museums around New York has dropped sharply since the Sept. 11 attacks, but Mr. Anderson said the problem at the Whitney was not the number of visitors, but rather the number of visitors who pay the $10 admission fee. "Attendance is up," Mr. Anderson said, "but what is strange is that admission income is down to a dramatic extent."
The reason, he explained, is that the Whitney is now getting an average of 14,000 visitors a week, many of them members, students and others eligible for discounted admission. That number has apparently been increased by the success of an exhibit of works by Jacob Lawrence, the African-American artist, which opened Nov. 8. In the previous weeks, the Whitney was averaging closer to 9,000 visitors a week, which represented a drop from last year's average of 12,500 for the same fall period.
The 40 percent drop in paid admissions, which this year represents 11.4 percent of the museum's operating income, is largely attributable to the drop in out-of-town visitors. Studies show that, like the Guggenheim, half of the Whitney's admissions are non-New Yorkers.
As yet, there are no signs of a rebound in tourism, even as the typically heavy Christmas season gets under way, Mr. Anderson said. "The feeling is that we will have to wait a couple of months," he said. "But we are not waiting around to find out. That is what this decision is all about."

HEADLINE: Report Offers Conflicting Signals on Recovery of the Economy 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The economy shrank significantly more this summer than the government initially estimated, the Commerce Department said yesterday. The revised report offered conflicting signals about how long the current recession would last.
 In the third quarter, the economy contracted at an annual rate of 1.1 percent after being adjusted for inflation, its worst showing since 1991, during the country's last recession. The government had originally reported a drop of 0.4 percent, but new data, mainly for the quarter's final weeks, led to the steeper decline reported in the regularly scheduled revision. 
 The report depicted an economy that was even weaker than had first been thought, with corporate profits plummeting and state and local governments beginning to reduce their spending as tax receipts fall. At the same time, however, businesses are reacting to the downturn aggressively, offering hope to economists who think companies have set the stage for a recovery next year by clearing unsold goods off their shelves. 
A big reason for the revision was a decline in corporate inventories that was more rapid than the initial numbers had suggested. During the quarter, the value of inventories fell $60.1 billion, the largest decline relative to the economy's size since the early 1980's. "That's certainly a good sign," said Melanie Jain, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney. "The sooner those inventories are worked off, the sooner production can begin again." 
Because the government measures production when calculating the size of the economy, a decline in inventories acts as a drag on growth.
But the Commerce Department also reported that corporate profits fell 8.3 percent during the quarter and decreased 22.2 percent compared with the third quarter of last year. That is the largest 12-month fall since the government began keeping statistics in 1947, said Mark Vitner, an economist at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C. It suggests that the corporate sector is unlikely to be the force behind a recovery in the coming months, he said.
"In order to right themselves, companies are going to have to cut costs," Mr. Vitner said. "They are going to be really reluctant to hire new people."
That reluctance could deepen and extend the recession, which began in March, if continued increases in unemployment cause consumers to reduce their spending. So far, household spending has kept the downturn from being as severe as the recessions of the mid-1970's and early 1980's -- when nearly every large economy in the world was struggling at once, as is the case now.
During the quarter, American households increased their spending 1.1 percent, the government said, revising the number down from 1.2 percent. Spending on large, expensive items like appliances -- known as durable goods -- grew less rapidly than originally reported, but spending on services was slightly stronger.
Still, the spending was not enough to help retailers meet sales forecasts that had begun to grow during the summer, as a few signs of a recovery emerged, but fell drastically after the Sept. 11 attacks. Retailers' inventories rose $1 billion during the quarter while manufacturers' shelves became emptier.
American consumers also seem to be helping overseas companies, according to the new data. Imports to the United States fell 12.9 percent -- not 15.2 percent, as the initial report said -- in the third quarter. But exports dropped 17.7 percent, rather than 16.6 percent. 
The revisions widened the nation's annual trade deficit to $408 billion, in inflation-adjusted terms, and sliced almost one-half of a percentage point from total economic growth.
The 1.1 percent contraction in the $10 trillion American economy came after an overall growth rate of just 0.3 percent in the second quarter and 1.3 percent in the first quarter. In the late 1990's and in 2000, the economy grew more than 4 percent a year.
The revised numbers also showed that state and local government spending fell 0.1 percent in the quarter, instead of rising 0.4 percent. Many states have announced budget cuts recently as their revenues have sagged with the economy, and economists are concerned the reductions will accelerate if the recession continues and if the federal government cuts taxes further, as many policy makers are now discussing.
Tax cuts can stimulate growth by encouraging people to make purchases or investments they otherwise would not have, but they can also reduce government employment . Because many states base some of their tax rates on the federal government's tax code, a tax cut passed by Congress can ultimately leave states with less revenue.
Even without new tax cuts, state spending often lags private spending because government officials rarely cut their budgets quickly. In each of the last two recessions -- in the early 1980's and early 1990's -- state and local government spending remained weak even a year after businesses had begun growing again.
Wall Street forecasters, the majority of whom are predicting that a recovery will arrive soon, also pointed yesterday to an upward revision in companies' investments in new equipment and software. Such spending fell 9.3 percent during the quarter, up from an originally reported 11.9 percent drop and from a 14.6 percent decline in the second quarter. 
That suggests businesses are slowly but surely reducing the gap between how much capacity they have and much they need, the analysts say.
Many executives and other economists, however, say there is still little hard evidence about when the downturn will end.
"Nobody saw this thing coming," Craig R. Barrett, the chief executive of Intel, said in an interview yesterday, referring to the recession. "Therefore, all of the experts who are predicting its end have established their credentials."

HEADLINE: Getting at the Roots of Arab Poverty 

BYLINE:  By Alan Schwartz; Alan Schwartz is a professor of law and management at Yale.

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
Since the terrorist attacks, Americans have learned that in many Arab and Muslim nations there are large numbers of angry young men with time on their hands, unable to find jobs -- or jobs that make use of their education -- because of their countries' poverty. We've also learned that many Muslims blame us for their poverty. But in fact they are not poor because we are rich; they are poor because of the policies their countries pursue.
 What matters for economic growth is what a country does, not what it has. Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Israel have no natural resources, yet they have successful, developed economies; Nigeria and the Congo, with abundant resources, do not. Nor is the availability of capital, by itself, the answer. In many Arab nations, the local rich invest their money outside their own countries and may have good economic reasons for doing so. 
 Perhaps the most important cause for some countries' continuing to fall behind is the monopolies that many of them tolerate or even create. The bin Laden family, for example, is rich because it was given a monopoly over much construction activity in Saudi Arabia. A recent estimate for sub-Saharan Africa estimated that the growth rates in all but a few countries could triple with no infusion of additional resources if state-created monopolies were dismantled in businesses like buying and selling grain or exporting textiles.
Not only does the absence of competition in a business lead to inefficiency, but monopolies also sustain an elite class that may block new technology and new industries -- or permit them and tax them heavily -- as it guards its own power and wealth. In some Arab countries, state-protected monopolies distribute part of their profits to people in the government, creating a powerful coalition against change.
Some Muslim and Arab countries also fail to provide the basic certainties that investors receive from the rule of law. Without an independent, noncorrupt judiciary and transparent laws, the ability of an investor to reap the rewards of a good idea turns on the discretion of the ruler and his favorites of the moment. Where whims rule, investors vanish.
Then there is trade. Generally, income for each citizen grows by 0.5 percent to 2 percent whenever the amount of total national income that comes from trade grows by 1 percent. Yet many Muslim nations discourage trade with import duties, as well as with their broader economic policies.
And there is human capital. A modern economy cannot grow without a population able to do its work. A good measure is the skill of a nation's young people in science and mathematics. Since most Arab nations do not give the usual standardized tests, it is not easy to see how well their students are doing. But it is deeply disturbing that countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have either turned their national schools over to Muslim clerics or underfunded education so that the clerics' schools fill the gap. Because they seldom teach math and science or other modern skills, the ascent of these schools may retard economic growth for decades. And of major importance is the failure of many Muslim countries to invest at all in the human capital of half the population -- that is, women.
Even though the poverty of Muslim countries is not America's doing, the United States may be able to help these nations work their way out of it. We can push them toward more constructive economic policies with free-trade treaties, like the one we have with Jordan, and through our influence with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. We can explain, loudly and often, the link between local economic performance and local political institutions. We should support local democratic movements not only because of the intrinsic merits of democracy, but because it is more difficult to pursue bad economic policies when one's citizens can openly criticize them.
Sept. 11 has taught us anew how important it is for the United States to take this kind of active interest. If we do not promote economic growth in Muslim nations, we will by default promote growth in the supply of potential terrorists.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Last Month Looks Like One of Year's Best

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks edged up yesterday as upbeat news from the big retailer Home Depot Inc. buoyed economically sensitive stocks at the expense of technology shares.
 The session closed out November as the best month for stocks since April and what will probably be one of the best of the year. For the week, stocks fell over all, but technology stocks rose. 
 "We're no doubt still mired in economic weakness," said Paul McManus, director of research at Independence Investment. "But I sense growing confidence that our worst post-Sept. 11 fears aren't being realized and that we'll be seeing a recovery next year."
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 22.14 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 9,851.56, while the Nasdaq composite index dipped 2.68 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,930.58. Semiconductor stocks tumbled after Novellus Systems warned about weak fourth-quarter orders and possible losses in 2002.
The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.75 of a point, to 1,139.45.
Home Depot, the world's No. 1 home improvement retailer, scaled back its earnings outlook and slowed the pace of new-store openings. Wall Street, which had feared even worse news from the retailer, bid its shares up $2.63, to $46.65.
Regarding the broad economy, the government announced that gross domestic product, which gauges total economic activity, shrank at a revised 1.1 percent annual rate in the three months from July through September -- nearly triple the 0.4 percent drop reported a month ago and worse than the economists' forecast for a drop of 0.9 percent. It was the poorest G.D.P. performance since the last recession, in 1991.
Some analysts argued that the poor G.D.P. figure increased the odds the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates for the 11th time this year when it meets on Dec. 11. President Bush quickly renewed a call for Congress to approve measures to help stimulate the economy. --------------------

Treasury Prices Mixed
By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices were mixed yesterday, as some investors said they expected the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for an 11th time this year.
"Rising jobless claims, falling consumer confidence and a decline in Chicago manufacturing suggested the economy is not coming out of recession" anytime soon, said Kevin McNair, who oversees $1.5 billion at BB&T Asset Management in Raleigh, N.C. "This factors into what the Fed may do."
The 10-year Treasury note rose 2/32, to a price of 101 28/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.76 percent from 4.77 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 24/32, to 101 8/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.29 percent from 5.24 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Cable and Wireless Bidding For Assets of Web Operator

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
Cable and Wireless, a cash-rich but profit-poor supplier of corporate communications and Internet services, made a bid today to become the biggest manager of Web sites in the United States by acquiring data centers, customer contracts and other assets from the bankrupt Exodus Communications. 
 The move is the British company's most ambitious foray into the United States to date, and a big step in its effort to put to use a mountain of cash accumulated in the sale of older consumer businesses over the last four years. 
 Graham Wallace, the chief executive, said Cable and Wireless would pay $580 million in cash for 30 of Exodus's 44 operating data centers, and assume $270 million in debt. Exodus, of Santa Clara, Calif., listed $4.4 billion in liabilities when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September. 
"The big players effectively have a deathwatch list" for ailing companies with strong assets but poor business prospects, said Pascal Aguirre of the Adventis consultancy in Boston. Rather than buy going concerns, Mr. Aguirre said, they prefer to wait for trouble to strike, "and then pick them up at fire-sale prices." 
Cable and Wireless first moved into the American Web-site-operating business when it bought Digital Island for $340 million in May. Now, Mr. Aguirre said, the company's strategy is to "pick up assets on the cheap" and integrate them with other services to provide corporate clients with what he called "offerings that cut across the stack." 
In March 2000, at the height of the Internet boom, Exodus had a market value approaching $30 billion as it built up a series of data centers and expanded rapidly to become the world's biggest operator of Web sites. Its fortunes sank with the bursting of the dot-com bubble. 
Though the deal, still subject to bankruptcy court approval, values the Exodus assets at only about 30 percent of book value, it was nonetheless painted by some London analysts as a risky move for Cable and Wireless, whose stock has slumped this year as losses mounted. 
Excluding gains from asset sales, Cable and Wireless lost some $2 billion in the six months ended Sept. 30. It has said it will use much of its $6.8 billion cash hoard to pay a special dividend to shareholders and to buy back stock. Mr. Wallace said that would still leave the company with $3 billion for acquisitions. 
He also told reporters today that the company would have to spend $250 million to make the Exodus assets profitable by 2005, a prospect that did little to inspire investors. Cable and Wireless shares fell 5.7 percent before recovering to $14.29. 
The deal will give Cable and Wireless about one-quarter of the American site-operating market, with a concentration among high-traffic Web sites and companies that are especially heavy users of the Internet. The purchase will also bring in customers like Microsoft and Cisco Systems, Mr. Wallace said.

HEADLINE: The Victims' New Referee 

 BODY:
In a long career resolving complicated disputes, Kenneth Feinberg has never seen a case as tangled and emotionally volatile as the one he confronts now. Mr. Feinberg is the Bush administration's choice to run the multibillion-dollar, open-ended fund established by Congress to compensate families of people killed and physically injured in the September terrorist attacks. On the face of it, he seems the right man for the job. Mr. Feinberg, a Washington lawyer and arbitrator, has adjudicated claims in complex cases involving asbestos, Agent Orange and the Dalkon Shield, all the while earning a reputation for firmness and fairness. He will need both qualities in abundance as he goes about dividing the billions of dollars that will be the largest source of long-term financial support for thousands of families who lost a breadwinner in the attacks.
 As Mr. Feinberg proceeds, it is essential that the public understand the fund's basic purpose. It is not charity. It is a Congressionally mandated alternative to litigation that could have driven the airlines into bankruptcy -- a pot of money of undetermined size that is designed to substitute for awards that victims' families would have received had they taken the airlines to court. 
 This means that Mr. Feinberg will be obliged to treat people as if they had actually gone to court. That, in turn, means huge differences in the final awards. Using the traditional multipliers by which courts put a price on lost lives -- e.g., annual compensation times lost earning years -- a young stockbroker's family will obviously receive far more than, say, the wife of a middle-aged janitor. At the same time, however, Congress gave Mr. Feinberg considerable discretion in shaping the rules governing distribution -- and thus considerable power to minimize disparities to an extent that might not be possible in the courtroom.
Though it will be up to Mr. Feinberg to figure out how to do this, one approach would be to award all victims the same amount for non-economic damages for pain and suffering -- and set that figure high enough to provide a generous return to even the poorest families. Having thus provided a floor, he could then devise a ceiling at the other end of the scale to prevent obscenely large awards. That of course is the tricky part. Any ceilings set too low could persuade some families to take their cases to court, thus defeating the purpose of the program.
Another problem facing Mr. Feinberg is the thorny question of offsets. Under the new law, the federal awards must be reduced by "collateral sources" of compensation, including life insurance and pension benefits. These offsets could come in handy as Mr. Feinberg seeks ways to reduce awards at the top end. The law is silent, however, on whether payments from private charities should be deducted from the federal awards. Many argue that they should be so deducted, if only to reduce the burden on American taxpayers.
This seems a dubious idea. Remember, the federal fund is designed to substitute for court-ordered damages. Court-ordered damages would not be offset by charity. The federal awards should be similarly protected. In addition, such offsets would be unfair to donors whose original intent was to help victims, not the government's balance sheet.
Mr. Feinberg's appointment is a reminder of one final issue that the charities themselves must address. His fund is designed to help families of direct victims, not those who lost their jobs or homes or suffered in other, more subtle ways. These secondary victims deserve help too, and the institutions best able to provide it are the private organizations that are sitting on $1.3 billion in contributions and pledges. Moreover, there will inevitably be big disparities even among recipients of private charity. The families of uniformed personnel, for instance, are likely to fare far better than others simply because so much money has been specifically raised on their behalf. On both counts, prudence suggests that charities with the flexibility to do so keep something in reserve for those whose needs may have been slighted or left unattended.

HEADLINE: As McGreevey Urges Frugality, New Jersey Senate Votes to Spend 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS 

 BODY:
Six weeks before taking office, Governor-elect James E. McGreevey of New Jersey is already clashing with the State Senate over spending measures that Mr. McGreevey says will contribute to a state budget shortfall of more than $3.5 billion in the next fiscal year. 
 Mr. McGreevey has warned repeatedly about the deficit, and last week urged lawmakers to hold off on any new nonessential spending through the end of the year. But the Senate approved $100 million in new spending on Monday and the governor-elect, a Democrat, pleaded once again for a lid on new expenditures, only to see $350 million more sail through the Senate Budget Committee on Thursday. 
 With little disagreement along partisan lines, the committee approved several measures, including a $180 million aid package for Camden and a cut in the sales tax on cigars. The Senate Government Committee approved an increase in pensions for retiring legislators.
"Any dollar spent today, any appropriation passed today that's signed by the acting governor, is a dollar that has to be cut tomorrow," Mr. McGreevey's spokeswoman, Jo Astrid Glading, said yesterday. "It's pretty simple."
The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Robert E. Littell, dismissed Mr. McGreevey's projections, saying he was confident that the budget would be balanced at the end of the fiscal year in June. Senator Littell said that the end-of-session appropriations were not out of the ordinary and that Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco, a fellow Republican, had been "very responsible and very frugal."
"Governor-elect McGreevey knows that and still insists on trying to put the fear in members of the Legislature and the public in general on our financial condition," Senator Littell said.
Mr. McGreevey made his first plea for a spending freeze in a meeting with Mr. DiFrancesco at the governor's mansion two days after his election last month. The two also met on Thursday. 
Mr. DiFrancesco said then, and still maintains, that he will leave Mr. McGreevey with a surplus. Tom Wilson, a spokesman for Mr. DiFrancesco, said yesterday that the acting governor took office 10 months ago with a surplus of about $1 billion and has found additional savings of more than $500 million. 
Mr. Wilson said Mr. McGreevey had used the most pessimistic numbers in calculating the shortfall. "If you see how he did his math, it's pretty rudimentary, and basically a guess," he said. 
But Ms. Glading said estimates by Mr. McGreevey's transition team, projecting a shortfall of $1.9 billion in the $23 billion budget at the end of this fiscal year, were in line with independent economic analyses. That figure will rise to about $3.7 billion a year later, she said, if spending is not curtailed. 
When Mr. McGreevey takes office on Jan. 15, the General Assembly will be controlled by Democrats for the first time in 10 years, and the Senate will be evenly split between the parties, 20 to 20. But he has found little enthusiasm among Democrats for further spending cuts. 
Many Democrats also defended their votes for the new spending approved this week. 
The Camden aid bill was probably the most contested measure in the Senate hearings, though not so much on fiscal grounds as because Camden's mayor and some other municipal leaders opposed provisions giving the state increased control over their finances. 
The measure's chief sponsor, Senator Wayne Bryant, a Camden Democrat, said Mr. McGreevey's opposition to the plan, which is supposed to stimulate local tax revenue, was shortsighted in view of the state aid already sustaining Camden, New Jersey's poorest city. 
"The government's going to spend money no matter what," Senator Bryant said. Under the current aid formulas, he said, the city would require $25 million for direct operating expenses. "That's just to keep the lights on," he said. "The question is, do you do something to make a capital investment?" 
Whatever happens in the current budget and the next fiscal year's budget, which Mr. McGreevey's team is drafting now, borrowing costs are expected to increase sharply in the next decade. 
New Jersey Policy Perspective, a watchdog group in Trenton, said in a recent report that the state's fiscal health had been deteriorating for a decade as the state turned to long-term borrowing to avoid tax increases. The group estimated that debt repayments would double by 2010.

HEADLINE: A Black Author Hurls That Word As a Challenge 

BYLINE:  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK 

 BODY:
At halftime of a 1993 basketball game against Miami University of Ohio, Keith Dambrot, varsity men's basketball coach at Central Michigan University, called his team together to talk about the word "nigger." Mr. Dambrot, who is white, had overheard his African-American players call each other "nigger" to denote toughness and tenacity on the court. He asked the players permission to use the word in the same sense, and after they assented he adopted "nigger," too. A few weeks later, after administrative censure, sensitivity training and two campus protests, Mr. Dambrot lost his job and promptly filed suit.
 His case is one of dozens analyzed in "Nigger," a new book by Randall Kennedy, an African-American scholar at the Harvard Law School. Mr. Kennedy recounts many unpleasant episodes, like the embarrassing use of the term by Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia in a public appearance last march. But Mr. Kennedy also considers the newer, more complicated use of "nigger" as a term of affection by young African-Americans and their well-meaning white friends. All in all, he argues, the new uses are gradually helping to exorcise the word's power as America's "paradigmatic ethnic slur." 
 Even before the book's appearance in stores next month, its uncomfortable title has elicited considerable hand-wringing among the mostly white staff of its publisher, Pantheon Books, where some executives have even refused to say its name. It has also become the source of a certain mischievous amusement on the part of its African-American editor. And as advanced word spreads among other African-American scholars, the title has provoked denunciations from some who vehemently disagree with Mr. Kennedy's thesis even before they have read the book.
"When I show up on CNN, I get e-mails from racists calling me a nigger bitch, O.K.?" said Julianne Malveaux, an African-American economist and newspaper columnist, "so I don't think its use is taking the sting out of it. I think it's escalating at this point. You are just giving a whole bunch of racists who love to use the word permission to use it even more, like, 'I am not really using it, I am just talking about a book!' "
Patricia Williams, an African-American professor at Columbia Law School, objected to the title: "That word is a bit like fire -- you can warm your hands with the kind of upside-down camaraderie that it gives, or you can burn a cross with it. But in any case it depends on the context and the users' intention, and seeing it floating abstractly on a book shelf in a world that is still as polarized as ours makes me cringe." Houston A. Baker Jr., an African-American professor of English at Duke University, agreed about the title: "I see no reason whatsoever to do this, except to make money. It is a crude marketing technique unworthy of someone with the kind of penetrating intelligence that Professor Kennedy has."
For his part, Mr. Kennedy said he felt no qualms about the sensational title, adding, "I write a book to be read." 
He said he had come up with the idea for the book, which grew out of a series of lectures, after idly typing the word "nigger" into a database of court cases. He found over 4,000 entries. Even before prosecutors in the O. J. Simpson case argued that hearing a witness's use of the word might unduly bias a jury, courts have often grappled with the caustic power of the word's history. Some courts have ruled that hearing the word "nigger" constitutes a provocation to violence similar to receiving a physical blow. Others have determined that speaking the word as an insult can disqualify a prosecutor or judge from his job. Lawyers have argued that a juror's utterance of the word in earshot of other jurors can invalidate their deliberations.
Mr. Kennedy writes approvingly of entertainers' penchant for "nigger." The comedian Lenny Bruce expounded the idea that repeating the word "nigger" could defang its derogatory impact, capitalizing on the word's shock-value in the process. But Mr. Kennedy notes that African-American rappers and comedians do not concern themselves much with whether they are encouraging white racists or disarming them. "They say, 'We don't feel constrained that we have to burnish the image of the Negro -- we think this is fun and we are going to do it,' " Mr. Kennedy said. "Frankly, I felt inspired by that."
Erroll McDonald, Mr. Kennedy's editor at Pantheon and one of the few senior African-American editors in book publishing, was delighted with the manuscript. "I appreciated its importance instantly," he said, "It is just such a curious word that provokes atavistic passions in people, and I thought it was time for a proper reckoning with it." He continued: "I for one am appalled by that euphemism 'the N word.' It seems an elision of something that would be better off talked about. There are some people out there talking about the 'N-word' that do regard a certain section of the population as niggers."
Mr. McDonald enjoyed the reactions of colleagues, almost all of them white. He carried a piece of paper around the office with the word "nigger" written on it, asking people to pronounce it. Presenting the idea at a planning session in January, he asked about 45 editors and other executives to say it unison. In both cases, some refused. 
"I think it is pretty fun," Mr. McDonald said, imagining customers asking a bookstore clerk, "Can I have one 'Nigger' please? Where are your 'Niggers'?" He added, "I am not afraid of the word 'nigger.' "
Some of the sales and marketing executives, however, were nervous, partly about how to publicize a book some would not name aloud and partly about the subtitle. Mr. McDonald picked the subtitle, "A Problem in American Culture," which appeared in the Pantheon catalog sent to reviewers and stores. But at a sales conference in August, some executives worried that consumers might think "nigger" referred to African-Americans and that by implication African-Americans were the "problem," said Joy Dallanegra-Sanger, who is white and the marketing director of the division of Random House that includes Pantheon.
Mr. McDonald disagreed but acquiesced. "I always thought of 'nigger' as an imaginary construct, like 'goblins' or 'elves.' I never thought they actually existed, but apparently they do in the minds of some." The subtitle was changed to "The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word," clarifying that the subject was a word and not a person. 
In the past, librarians and bookstore owners have sometimes removed books from their shelves for containing the word "nigger" in the title, including "The Nigger of the Narcissus," by Joseph Conrad. But several bookstores, including some catering mainly to African-Americans, said that they planned to stock Mr. Kennedy's book. Several noted the comedian Dick Gregory's 1964 autobiography, "Nigger." He wrote at the time that he hoped the word would become obsolete, but he also joked that it was advertising for the book.
John McWhorter, an African-American linguist and the author of the forthcoming book "The Power of Babel" (Henry Holt), read an early copy. He said he shared Mr. Kennedy's hopeful fascination with the changing uses of the word among young African-Americans and even their white friends, suggesting that the book might further dilute the opprobrium the word carries. "Pretty soon we are going to have a book called 'Nigger' that is going to be sitting in front of every bookstore in the United States, and that will be one more step toward taking the power of the word away."
The most immediate effect, however, is likely to be an escalation of the debate over the politics of its use. Richard Delgado, a Mexican-American professor at the University of Colorado Law School, who has argued for restrictions on hate-speech, said that he, too, feared that Mr. Kennedy's defense of the term's novel uses would encourage racists. But Mr. Delgado also said that Mr. Kennedy risked slighting other ethnic groups by underestimating the power of other slurs. Calling "nigger" the "paradigmatic" ethnic slur was "parochial," Mr. Delgado said. 
For his part, Mr. Dambrot, the basketball coach who lost his job for using the word, said he favored open discussion, even of his own mistake. He lost his suit and worked as a stockbroker for five years before he found another job coaching basketball, for a high school in Akron, Ohio. This year he finally returned to coaching a college team, at the University of Akron. 
"I try to use the whole situation as an educational tool for the kids," he said. "I explain that you have to understand how different people understand your words. Be careful what you say. Every decision you make can effect the rest of your life, and my life can be case study for that."

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Americas: Canada: Economy Dips 

BYLINE:  By Bernard Simon (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Canada's gross domestic product shrank 0.2 percent in the third quarter, pulled down by a 2 percent decline in exports and a modest drop in consumer spending, Statistics Canada said yesterday. The economy expanded by a fractional 0.1 percent in the previous three months. The fall in exports was the fourth successive quarterly drop, making it the longest decline in more than two decades. The United States accounts for about 85 percent of Canada's exports. Statistics Canada said shipments of telecommunications equipment were half of their peak in late 2000, while exports of automotive products dipped 3.2 percent. The economy's overall growth over the last four quarters averaged 0.2 percent, down from 1.1 percent in the previous 12 months.

Wilpon Might Increase Payroll

BYLINE:  By TYLER KEPNER 

 BODY:
Fred Wilpon is trying to buy Nelson Doubleday's 50 percent share of the Mets, and the owners have spent months squabbling over the deal. But Wilpon insisted yesterday that the negotiations would have no impact on the way General Manager Steve Phillips constructs the team for next season, and he hinted that he might authorize Phillips to exceed the budget to sign a top player.
 "We have a 100 percent track record there," Wilpon said, referring to the times Phillips has asked for special permission to make a move. "We've said yes every time. Over four or five years, there have been several times; more than two." 
 The Mets would prefer to keep their payroll around $95 million for next season, but with trades for elite hitters failing to materialize, Phillips may turn to Wilpon for authorization to pursue a top free agent.
"Someone said to me, 'You're not going to get any free agents,' " Wilpon said. "I said, 'That's not entirely what Steve said.' Steve said we will more likely be getting our significant changes through the trade route because of the nature of our team. But he didn't preclude us from the free-agent market."
Several people in the organization still believe that signing Barry Bonds is a long shot. But Bonds's agent, Scott Boras, said the Mets had stayed in touch. "We've had discussions and they reflected their interest," Boras said yesterday. "We've talked on a couple of occasions."
Boras declined to discuss any negotiations he might have had with the Mets. But there were strong indications that Bonds would be willing to cooperate with the Mets' strategy of backloading a contract, in which the Mets would pay a lower salary next season and higher salaries in following seasons.
The Mets fell almost 350,000 fans short of their goal of three million last season, and Wilpon said the team lost money, though he would not specify how much. The Mets have not announced ticket prices for next season, but Wilpon said, "They will be substantially the same."
Still, Wilpon said that he could envision a scenario in which he granted Phillips permission to exceed the projected payroll and that his negotiations with Doubleday would make "not one iota" of a difference in what Phillips does.
Phillips, meanwhile, said he did not feel restricted. "There's nothing different for me and no limitations placed on me," he said.
Two star players the Mets have inquired about in trades are not available. The Los Angeles Dodgers are not interested in what the Mets have to offer for outfielder Gary Sheffield, and the Cleveland Indians almost certainly will not trade second baseman Roberto Alomar.
"Robby's the best player on our team," Indians General Manager Mark Shapiro said. "We're not shopping him, and we're having no active discussions with other clubs on him right now."
The Mets would be interested in Anaheim outfielder Darin Erstad, but an Angels official said it was "very, very doubtful" the team would trade him. Florida could trade outfielder Cliff Floyd, but the Marlins' plans are held up partly by questions over contraction. Milwaukee's Jeromy Burnitz is still a possibility.
The Mets are hoping the market for the free agents Bonds, Juan Gonzalez or perhaps Moises Alou is smaller than it has been recently for elite free agents. Some of the usual free-agent bidders, Phillips said, do not seem to be involved anymore.
"Last year's free-agent class was a compelling class," Phillips said. "It may have reduced the number of teams that have flexibility for this year. You can't often afford the magnitude and length of contracts some of the premium players have gotten the last few seasons."
The Mets are burdened by the contracts of free agents Phillips signed years ago: Robin Ventura and Todd Zeile combine to make $14.25 million next season. But there is a chance Phillips could make a convincing pitch to the owners.
"There are some very attractive players," Wilpon said, referring to the free-agent market. "Some don't fit for us, but some might."
In any case, Wilpon believes the Mets must reconfigure a team that went 82-80 and will be vying for fans' disposable income in a depressed economy.
"I think we have to make some changes," he said. "I think Steve does, and I agree with that."

Greenspan Remarks on Euro's Weakness

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
The relative weakness of the euro against the dollar reflects Europe's inflexible labor policies and worker productivity gains that lag those in the United States, the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, Alan Greenspan, said today.
 Rising worker productivity has increased returns on United States assets and maintained the dollar's dominance in the world economy in recent years, Mr. 
Greenspan said in a speech to the Euro 50 Group, an organization of former European finance ministry officials. 
 The euro, a currency shared by 12 European countries, was introduced in January 1999 and goes into public circulation in January. Since the end of June 2000, the point at which the United States economy began to slow, the euro has declined 6 percent against the dollar. Since its inception, the euro has fallen 25 percent.
That is because investors sought higher returns in the United States, he said. "The attraction of investing in dollar-denominated assets depends upon relative rates of return," he said.

HEADLINE: Research Cost For New Drugs Said to Soar 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
A new round in the national debate over prescription drugs opened today with a study from researchers at Tufts University estimating that the average cost of developing a new drug has more than doubled since 1987, to $802 million.
 Dr. Kenneth I. Kaitin, director of the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, which issued the report, said, "Bringing new drugs to market has always been an expensive, high-risk proposition, and our latest analysis indicates that costs have continued to skyrocket." 
 Dr. Joseph A. DiMasi, the principal author of the study, attributed much of the increase in the cost of drug development, beyond inflation, to the rising costs of testing new drugs in humans. Drug companies recruit thousands of people around the world to participate in such clinical trials before drugs are marketed in the United States. 
The Tufts researchers said it cost an average of $231 million to develop a new drug in 1987. If the cost had risen at the pace of inflation, they said, it would have reached $318 million in 2000. 
Typically, the researchers said, the cost of developing new drugs is spread over 10 to 15 years. On the average, Dr. DiMasi said, 12 years elapse from the time a new chemical compound is synthesized until it is approved by the government for marketing in the United States.
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade association for drug makers, welcomed the study, saying it confirmed their view that "drug development is staggeringly expensive." Alan F. Holmer, president of the organization, said the study underscored the need for policies, like patent protection, that encourage investment in drug research and development.
Some consumer advocates criticized the study as biased and said it overstated the costs of drug development. "This is just a thinly disguised advertisement for the pharmaceutical industry to justify continued price-gouging," said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of the Health Research Group, a consumer organization founded by Ralph Nader.
Clay O'Dell, a spokesman for the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, whose members use the fruits of research done by makers of brand-name drugs, said: "The methodology of this study is suspect. It ignores the fact that some of the drug development costs are tax deductible, and that some of the research is subsidized by the government through the National Institutes of Health." 
Data for the study were obtained from 10 drug companies, and the Tufts center receives financial support from drug companies, among others. But in issuing the study, the Tufts center said it was "widely respected as an independent source of information on drug development." Dr. DiMasi said there were "no strings attached" to the money it received from drug companies.
Previous studies by the Tufts center have become a political football in Congressional debates over drug costs, patent law and proposals to add drug benefits to Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly and disabled.
"The numbers on the cost of drug development become gospel even though they are flawed," Dr. Wolfe said.
Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, a longtime advocate for the elderly, said: "The Tufts study drives home the need for Medicare coverage of prescription drugs. The cost of drugs for seniors at the pharmacy counter is growing even more rapidly than the cost of drug development for the manufacturers. That's why seniors go to Canada and Mexico to get medicines that should be available and affordable here."
Standard measures of corporate performance show the drug industry as one of the most profitable in the United States. Drug companies often cite the Tufts data in trying to justify the prices they charge. Likewise, in discussing patent policy, they say they should have the exclusive right to market their products for many years because they must recover the costs of research and development.
Republicans and some Democrats cite the cost of developing new drugs as a reason to oppose federal regulation of drug prices. Price controls, they say, could deprive manufacturers of the revenue they need to develop life-saving drugs.
Prescription drugs, especially new drugs, account for a growing share of health care spending in the United States. 
The Tufts study included the costs of developing and testing drugs that never reached the market. The number of such drugs far exceeds the number approved for sale. Dr. DiMasi said the study also included some of the cost of capital -- what could have been earned if investors had put their money in securities of equal risk, rather than in pharmaceutical research and development.
Dr. DiMasi, an economist, said he had not audited the data provided to him by drug companies. But he said he thought the companies were being "quite straightforward and honest." Moreover, he said, the information on specific drugs was consistent with aggregate data published by the industry's trade association. 
Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, said: "The basic problem is that all pharmaceutical costs, including research, are in a black box, hidden from view. There is no transparency. That's the cause of all the skepticism regarding drug research costs and pricing." 
Federal auditors usually have access to the books and records of federal contractors. But drug companies have, for decades, resisted efforts by such auditors to measure the research and development costs of drugs sold to the government.
The Tufts study says that of every 5,000 potential new drugs tested in animals, only 5 are promising enough to be tested in humans. Only one of those five is eventually approved for marketing, the study said.

HEADLINE: Clamor Grows For Fiscal Aid To Hospitals 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
Amid a growing sense of desperation about the finances of hospitals in New York City, the state's political leaders, hospital chiefs and leaders of the powerful hospital workers' union met yesterday and agreed to step up the pressure on Congress and the White House for increased federal aid.
 The Republican leaders of the House and aides to President Bush have said they do not want to use a coming round of appropriations bills to add to the roughly $10 billion in aid already approved for New York's recovery from the destruction of the World Trade Center. But the hospital workers' group, 1199/S.E.I.U., New York's Health and Human Service Union, and hospital leaders signaled that they were, if anything, raising their sights, seeking more than $1 billion and looking for new ways to couch that request. 
 The two groups say that some of New York City's hospitals were already losing money before Sept. 11, while others were barely in the black, and that the attack has cost them more than $350 million. There were days of round-the-clock readiness and stocking up on supplies for a flood of patients that never came, patients went elsewhere for care or postponed treatment, hospitals added security, and the number of jobless people without health insurance grew sharply. The hardest-hit have been New York University Downtown Hospital and St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital, which were closest to the disaster and suffered the steepest loss of business.
Many of those at the meeting said they had little real hope that a significant part of the money will arrive from Washington in the near future, but a few were optimistic. "I don't think we're going to see much of anything this year," said Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee.
But Senator Charles E. Schumer said, "I think we can get some things for hospitals, though certainly not everything."
They and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton took part in yesterday's meeting by telephone from Washington. Attending in person at the union's West 43rd Street headquarters in Manhattan were the state Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver; the majority leader of the State Senate, Joseph L. Bruno; and aides to Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg.
"We gave an analysis of the economic situations of our hospitals, with respect to Sept. 11," said Dennis Rivera, president of the union, who convened the meeting along with Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association. "We basically agreed that we are going to work in a bipartisan way in Washington and in Albany."
Mr. Raske and Mr. Rivera command a multimillion-dollar political fund, and the union, with thousands of campaign volunteers, has one of the most sophisticated phone bank and direct-mail operations in the country. They have proved a formidable team in the past, mounting advertising campaigns for or against programs, forging alliances with Mr. Pataki, President Clinton, the Legislature and members of Congress, and winning billions of dollars in new government health care spending.
But many New York politicians say this is a much tougher challenge, because they are petitioning a Republican president and a Republican House leadership they barely know, and one that owes them nothing.
The meeting was inextricably bound up in state politics. Participants said Mr. Rivera and Mr. Raske warned Mr. Pataki against proposing any Medicaid cuts, as he does annually, in the budget he is expected to propose in the next few weeks. The governor, a Republican running for re-election next year, would dearly like to have the support of the hospital workers' union -- or, at the least, to ensure its neutrality.
State legislative leaders said they, too, would oppose cutting Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for the poor that is a major source of hospitals' revenue. "We're making huge demands of these institutions," Mr. Bruno said. "It would appear that we certainly shouldn't be making any further cuts."
Robert Hinckley, deputy commissioner of the state's Health Department, said, "We're working on a number of options, but I'm not going to discuss them at this point."
Mr. Pataki, who may need help from the national Republican party next year, is in the difficult position of asking a president and Congressional leadership of his own party for much more than they want to give. His aides say he wants to pressure them without publicly embarrassing them. Congress approved up to $20 billion in disaster aid, but the White House and Republican leaders in Congress have signaled that for the time being, they intend to spend only about half of that.
In October, the governor called for $54 billion in federal recovery aid, including items unrelated to Sept. 11, like money for the Second Avenue subway. That plan was summarily dismissed in Washington.
Mr. Rivera and Mr. Raske seem to be taking a page from the governor's playbook -- ask for the cosmos and hope for the moon. In addition to the $350 million in direct losses, they are also seeking $800 million to help hospitals prepare for bioterrorism threats.
"Our hospitals have become the first line of defense in this new war, and New York is a big target," Mr. Rivera said.
Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Clinton have proposed to use $140 million of the disaster relief money to aid hospitals. Mr. Schumer said that in the last few days, he had grown confident that the Senate would include that money in a forthcoming bill. But the money is not in the House version, leaving its fate murky, at best.
Mr. Schumer said he had also become more optimistic in recent days that Congress might increase payments to states for Medicaid, money that could, in turn, be used to help hospitals. That move has been proposed many times over the years, without success, and Mr. Rangel and others voiced serious doubts about its future.

HEADLINE: 2 Sides Turn More Heated In Exchanges Over Economy 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
Democrats today intensified their efforts to portray Republicans as more concerned about corporate interests than laid-off workers and to pin blame for the recession on President Bush.
 Republicans responded with a scathing counterattack, saying Democrats were trying to capitalize politically on the economic effects of the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 The exchange suggested that both parties saw the weakening economy as a potent political issue likely to return to the forefront of the national agenda as soon as the war in Afghanistan begins drawing to a close. 
Their initial skirmishes have been centered on efforts by Congress to pass an economic stimulus plan to help the nation recover from the first recession since Mr. Bush's father was in the White House. The two sides have been deadlocked on the issue for weeks.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said it would begin running radio commercials in House districts around the country next week criticizing Republicans for the stimulus bill they pushed through the House in October. The bill focuses primarily on tax breaks for business, including a provision that would repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax and allow profitable companies to claim 15 years of accumulated tax credits.
In addition, a liberal advocacy group headed by the Democratic strategist James Carville said it planned to run newspaper advertisements portraying corporate lobbyists as pigs gorging themselves at a Republican trough.
The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said the White House appeared sensitive about what he called "the Bush economy." Mr. Daschle also blamed the tax cut that Mr. Bush won earlier this year for tipping the government budget from surplus into deficit.
But what enraged Republicans most was a remark by Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, in an interview with USA Today. Mrs. Lowey said Republicans' vote in favor of the House stimulus bill was "unpatriotic, inappropriate, wrong" at a time of rising unemployment.
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, said it was "sad" that Democrats "would seek to profit politically from the slowdown in the economy caused in part by the events of Sept. 11."
Mr. Hastert said the intent of the House bill was to create jobs and help the economy. "Nita Lowey's language is unfortunate," he said, "and her tactics are inappropriate." 
Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, noted that the economy began cooling off in early 2000, during the Clinton administration, and that the slowdown was "well under way" by the time Mr. Bush took office in January.
But Mr. Fleischer said the president "thinks the job of leaders in Washington is not to point fingers but to find solutions." Mr. Bush has said the fate of stimulus legislation rests with the Democratic-controlled Senate, where a bill remains stalled.

Report Offers Conflicting Signals on the Recession
The economy shrank much more this summer than the government initially estimated, the Commerce Department said. The revised report offered conflicting signals about how long the current recession would last.
 In the third quarter, the economy contracted at an annual inflation-adjusted rate of 1.1 percent, its worst showing since 1991, during the nation's last recession. The government had originally reported a 0.4 percent decline, but new data led to the steeper drop reported in the scheduled revision. Page C4. 

Merrill Said to Dismiss Strategist
Merrill Lynch has decided to dismiss Christine A. Callies as its chief domestic stock strategist just 18 months after hiring her away from Credit Suisse First Boston, people at the the firm said. Since Ms. Callies joined the firm in June 2000, she has been one of the more bullish voices on Wall Street. At the end of last year, Ms. Callies predicted that the Standard & Poor's 500 would rise about 20 percent this year, to 1,600. Instead, it has fallen more than 13 percent. C2.

Web Site Finds Apple Upgrade Flaw
Apple Computer accused a Web site, MacFixit, of breaking laws that protect Apple's copyrights and that make it illegal to circumvent mechanisms intended to protect copyrights. The site published an article that revealed how to take advantage of a flaw in a recent Apple upgrade of its operating system, OS X. MacFixit complied by removing the article. C14.

Home Depot Expects Growth to Slow
Executives of Home Depot have reduced the company's expected earnings growth to an increase of 18 to 20 percent a year for the next three years. Last year, they had predicted a growth rate of 23 percent to 25 percent for the company. Wall Street investors, who had feared even worse news from the retailer, applauded the news and sent shares of Home Depot up $2.63, to $46.65, in the heaviest trading since September. C2.

Record Unemployment Rate in Japan
Japan's unemployment rate set another postwar record in October, rising to 5.4 percent, as home building contracted and prices continued a two-year downward drift. The government counted 3.6 million Japanese out of work last month, the most since World War II, and it acknowledged that the jobless rate is certain to rise further. C3.

Stocks Are Mixed as Nasdaq Falls
Stocks were mixed during a week when they mostly treaded water. The Nasdaq composite index dipped 2.68 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,930.58. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 22.14 points, or 0.2 percent, to 9,851.56, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.75 of a point, to 1,139.45. C4.

$1.36 Billion Deal for Power Plants
NRG Energy, which owns and operates power generators in the United States and overseas, agreed to buy four electricity plants in Ohio from FirstEnergy for about $1.36 billion in cash and the assumption of $145 million in debt to increase output in the area. C4.

Carrefour Expects Global Rebound
The retailer Carrefour plans to invest $2.7 billion next year to open new stores, refurbish others and expand in Asia and Europe in expectation of a global economic rebound. C3.

A Fire Truck Maker in Overdrive
The citizens of Clintonville, Wis., the four-stoplight town known as Truck City, are scrambling to build fire trucks faster than they ever have. New York City has placed a $25 million emergency order for 54 trucks, each of which would normally take nearly a year to build. Seagrave Fire Apparatus, which has made New York's trucks since 1917, has hired extra workers and added an overnight shift to meet the company's promise of delivering the first truck by January. B1.

 BODY:
LANDSCAPE DESIGN: A Cultural and Architectural History. By Elizabeth Barlow Rogers. (Abrams, $75.) In this magnum opus, Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, the founding president of the Central Park Conservancy and a longtime administrator of that celebrated oasis, stakes out and cultivates a breathtakingly vast terrain: the history of man-made landscape from Neolithic times to the present. Though Rogers focuses on a number of well-known gardens and parks -- from Hadrian's Villa of A.D. 118-38 outside Rome to Antonio Gaudi's Park Guell of 1900-14 in Barcelona -- her subject is less horticulture than the social interaction of various cultures with their natural settings. Encompassing city planning as much as garden design, this panoramic study is impressive not only for its encyclopedic scope but also for the author's authoritative command of so much diverse material and for her lucid writing. 
 It will become the standard survey for some years to come. The book, gloriously illustrated thanks to the intrepid photo research of John K. Crowley and Diana Gongora, is appropriately evenhanded in its emphases, with the exception of the classical gardens of Japan, which deserve more than the 15 pages allotted to them. Rogers is particularly strong on the modern era in America, giving due appreciation to the Garden City and New Town movements that flourished in the early 20th century and are approximated today by such efforts of the New Urbanism movement as the highly publicized town of Seaside, Fla. 
 Architecture in its broadest sense is the principle underlying Rogers's approach, and her carefully plotted organization suits her vast topic ideally. Time and again she makes impassioned pleas for the preservation of the planet's green heritage. "Our success in this endeavor will depend on many things," she writes, "including an understanding of the rich psychological and mythopoeic relationship of human beings to landscape throughout history." In those terms, it is impossible to think of a better synthesis than this magisterial overview. 
THE HOUSE BOOK. (Phaidon, $45.) The latest installment in Phaidon's successful "A to Z" series, this entertaining alphabetical compendium illustrates a single residence on each page, with one large color photograph and a small block of text. Written by a team of 35 contributors, those unsigned glosses run the gamut from shockingly inaccurate to gems of concision. Equally wide-ranging is the global roll call of domestic shelter, from the haus tambaran, or ceremonial house, of the Abelam people of New Guinea to the thatch-domed indlu of the Zulus of Natal. The high-style Western canon is fully represented also, from the Palace of Knossos on Crete (c. 1600 B.C.) to the House Near Bordeaux, by Rem Koolhaas of the Office for Metropolitan Architecture (1998).
Among the serendipitous pleasures of this eye-filling album are the random juxtapositions that occasionally pair designs with surprising affinities on facing pages, prompting memories of compare-and-contrast final-exam questions. The likenesses can be purely superficial, like the domed Breakfast Room of Sir John Soane's house in London (1812-13) vis-a-vis the retractable glass roof of Paolo Soleri's Dome House in Cave Creek, Ariz. (1949). But in other instances there's a new shock of recognition, as in the flat but intricately linear facades of a reed mudhif, or guest house, of the Madan (Marsh Arabs) of Mesopotamia and Benedetto da Maiano's masonry Palazzo Strozzi in Florence (1498-c. 1536). The striking similarities between the rondavel thatched huts of the Hutu people of Rwanda and the igloos of the Inuit in Greenland are made clearer across the spread. And the astonishing emergence of democracy during the 18th century is neatly signified by Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt's pompous Upper Belvedere Palace in Vienna (1721-22) confronting James Hoban's modest White House in Washington (1792-1801).
ARCHITECTS ON ARCHITECTS. Edited by Susan Gray. (McGraw-Hill, $39.95.) Practitioners of a wildly competitive art form, architects are always looking over their shoulders, not just at contemporaries with whom they must compete for jobs but also at the great predecessors against whom they'll be measured by history. The master builders that 24 present-day architects chose to write about for this revealing if somewhat repetitive collection tell as much about the authors as their subjects. Predictably, many of the participants (all men, with the exception of Diana Agrest) gravitated toward the big boys of modernism, and three architects are the focus of almost half the essays, with five on Le Corbusier, four on Paul Rudolph and two on Louis I. Kahn. 
Sometimes those pairings can seem willfully contradictory. It would have been far more interesting to find out what Richard Meier thinks about Le Corbusier, who has had such an overwhelming influence on his own aesthetic, than for him to draw tenuous analogies between his work and the diametrically different architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright. Likewise, there is more than a bit of irony in Michael Graves's praise for Le Corbusier, whom he routinely belittled in lectures earlier in his career. Much more edifying is Tadao Ando's epiphany on his first visit to Le Corbusier's Ronchamp chapel: "Because of the overwhelming spatial experience, which penetrated deep into my soul, I had to escape after staying less than one hour. I was awe-struck by a light unprecedented in my life."
Best among the other appreciations are Carlos Jimenez on Luis Barragan; Ricardo Legorreta on another Mexican, the little-remembered Jose Villagran; and Hugh Hardy on William van Alen, architect of the Chrysler Building. As Hardy writes of that idiosyncratic aluminum-spired skyscraper, "This iconic office building goes for broke, flaunting the exterior skin's independence as a costume pageant of pattern, gleaming profiles and symbolic panache. It's a theatrical gesture that identifies this as a building like no other, and gives New Yorkers proof that they are extraordinary." 
THE GENIUS OF ROBERT ADAM: His Interiors. By Eileen Harris. (Paul Mellon Center/Yale University, $85.) As an architect, the 18th-century Scottish multitasker Robert Adam had much less opportunity to build anew than to remodel existing buildings, and thus much of his prodigious energy was channeled into interior design. Though we think of the Gesamtkunstwerk, or total work of art, as a 19th-century concept, Adam anticipated it by orchestrating everything from urban planning to curtain trimmings with breathtaking assurance and demonic attentiveness. That is evident on every page of this sumptuous volume.
Written with complete command of archival source material by the architectural historian Eileen Harris, this minutely detailed study of 19 Adam houses in town and country is replete with the staggering sums his luxurious decorating schemes cost, as well as the names of the small army of artisans who executed them. Harris pursues an antiquarian, formalist investigation that overshadows much of the social history that would explain why Adam was indeed the genius her title proclaims him. No architect has ever possessed a shrewder intuition for the specific social uses to which his buildings would be put. Adam's knowledge of the complicated rituals and hierarchical needs of Britain's ruling class in a period of enormous change was the true secret behind his success, quite apart from the superlative quality of his art. 
FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT AND THE ART OF JAPAN: The Architect's Other Passion. By Julia Meech. (Japan Society/Abrams, $49.50.) One of the great self-taught connoisseurs of Japanese art in general and ukiyo-e (colored woodblock prints) in particular, Frank Lloyd Wright used his discerning eye both to apply the principles of Japanese design to his own work as well as to supplement his often erratic income. On his first trip to Japan, in 1905, Wright bought prints that he later sold back home, often to his own clients, including Darwin D. Martin of Buffalo, for whom he built one of his best prairie houses as well as an excellent print portfolio. 
Constantly upgrading his own holdings by deaccessioning lesser impressions for better ones, Wright was by no means in it only for the money; he steeped himself in the Japanese aesthetic as he lived with his prints. It is impossible not to see the architect's colorful, boldly outlined leaded-glass windows, asymmetrical development of interior space and dramatic compositional play of solids and voids as proceeding directly from his hoard of Hiroshiges, Hokusais and Utamaros. With all his ups and downs, Wright still owned some 6,000 prints at the time of his death in 1959.
"Frank Lloyd Wright and the Art of Japan: The Architect's Other Passion" was published to accompany the splendid exhibition of the same name that the art historian Julia Meech organized at the Japan Society Gallery in New York earlier this year. This handsome volume brims with wonderful pictures and illuminating anecdotes about Wright's mania for fine things; the forbearance of his loyal and generous patrons, whose trust he often stretched to the breaking point; and the boom-or-bust finances that kept his collection in a constant state of flux. Meech makes a convincing case for the centrality of the Japanese print in any full assessment of Wright's career, and if her proposition is hardly a new one, no commentator has yet done better than she in creating such a vivid picture of the architect's tireless pursuit of two-dimensional beauty. 
THE ARCHITECTURE OF R. M. SCHINDLER. Organized by Elizabeth A. T. Smith and Michael Darling. (Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles/Abrams, $65.) R. M. SCHINDLER. By Judith Sheine with new photography by Grant Mudford. (Phaidon, $59.95.) Though publicity alone cannot sustain an artistic reputation indefinitely, the degree to which the media can make or break an architectural career increased dramatically during the century just past. One of the chief victims of that trend was the immensely gifted Austrian architect Rudolph M. Schindler, who immigrated to the United States in 1913, worked with Frank Lloyd Wright for five years, supervised the master's work in Southern California and decided to resettle there. The double house and studio of 1921-22 that Schindler designed and built for himself, his wife and another bohemian couple on Kings Road in West Hollywood was constructed from concrete slabs poured in place on the site and tilted upward to form the outer walls. Low-cost, flexible and spatially innovative, that unconventional residence was justly described by the architectural historian Reyner Banham as "one of the most original and ingenious domestic designs of the present century -- and one of the most gratifyingly habitable." 
Nonetheless, Schindler lacked the public-relations skills and self-aggrandizing character of his fellow Viennese architect Richard Neutra, who claimed the lion's share of attention -- and of experimental commissions -- in the Los Angeles region at a time when it was the most receptive market for modern architecture in America. Though Schindler's output was more uneven than Neutra's, it was also more conceptually daring and emotionally richer -- reasons why a recent generation of talented California architects, especially the late Franklin D. Israel and Michael Rotondi, have revered Schindler as a spiritual father. So did his erstwhile drafting assistant Esther McCoy, who after the architect's death in 1953 mounted a successful journalistic campaign to elevate his critical stature.
The simultaneous appearance of two new Schindler monographs takes McCoy's cause a giant step farther. "The Architecture of R. M. Schindler," the catalog of the retrospective mounted by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and now on view in Vienna, is ravishingly illustrated and contains several penetrating essays, including Robert Sweeney's lively account of life in the Kings Road House. And Judith Sheine's "R. M. Schindler" provides a thorough, well-paced survey of his professional development, interweaving his biography and works to notable effect. 
LE CORBUSIER IN AMERICA: Travels in the Land of the Timid. By Mardges Bacon. (MIT, $59.95.) During the worldwide depression of the 1930's, those architects who could afford to travel hit the road not only to broaden their cultural horizons but also to drum up business. The ever-enterprising Charles-Edouard Jeanneret (better known by his pseudonym of Le Corbusier) made several international sojourns during the decade, and this absorbing account of his first visit to the United States, in 1935, is by far the most detailed yet published. Though ostensibly a lecture tour -- he spoke at the Museum of Modern Art, Columbia, Princeton, Vassar and Yale -- his true purpose was to find new commissions and absorb the lessons of the americainisme that was strongly affecting contemporary European architecture.
But it was far from all work and no play. Captivated by African-American culture, Le Corbusier in New York trekked up to Harlem's Savoy Ballroom, heard Louis Armstrong play in a Broadway nightclub and saw at least two performances of what he called opera negre: "Porgy and Bess," which had recently opened. And on college campuses he was sexually titillated and more than a bit frightened by the athletic, self-confident coeds he termed "Amazons," developing a crush on one statuesque Vassar student of "The Group" era by the name of Alma Clayburgh.
Although Le Corbusier found no jobs in America, he did take home to Paris several new ideas that he would apply in his own work, including the tension structures he admired here and the multifunctional skyscrapers that influenced his later tall building designs. He left a legacy on these shores as well, primarily in the "tower-in-a-park" housing projects of the postwar period that took their cues from his visionary urban planning schemes of the 1920's. The sociological problems that later befell those American public housing estates were used decades later to discredit their inspirer, though his own Unites d'Habitation in Europe are still sought-after addresses. Mardges Bacon, a professor of art and architecture at Northeastern University, conveys an authentic sense of the period in this exhaustively researched and engagingly written study of a telling episode in 20th-century architectural transformations. 
J. J. P. OUD. 1890-1963: The Complete Works. By Ed Taverne, Cor Wagenaar and Martien de Vletter. (Netherlands Architecture Institute/Distributed Art Publishers, $85.) At the peak of his career, in the early 1930's, the Dutch architect Jacobus Johannes Pieter Oud (rhymes with "proud") was regarded by many tastemakers -- including Philip Johnson and Alfred H. Barr Jr. of the Museum of Modern Art -- as the equal of Le Corbusier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Oud's pure white, sleek-lined, humanely proportioned low-rise buildings epitomized the early International style at its finest. No one at the time did better workers' dwellings, and projects like his Hoek van Holland Housing Scheme of 1924-27 in the Netherlands and row houses at the German Werkbund's Weissenhofsiedlung housing exhibition of 1927 in Stuttgart remain classics of low-budget, high-style modern design. Similarly esteemed is his Cafe de Unie of 1925 in Rotterdam, a landmark of the de Stijl movement with interiors by the artist Theo van Doesburg.
Then, with a single building, Oud wrecked his international reputation. His Shell headquarters of 1937-42 in The Hague was ornamented in a busy late-Art Deco manner that seemed a throwback to the folksy Amsterdam School of the 1920's. Though today a more inclusive view of modernism makes the International style prohibition of ornament seem silly, Oud's career-breaking structure was indeed a major clunker. He dug in against the stinging criticism, and played no important role in the postwar rebuilding of either the Netherlands or Europe at large. Toward the end of his career he returned to a lighter, cleaner manner reminiscent of his functionalist heyday, but never recaptured his former stature.
This monograph, the most complete to date, puts Oud's checkered development into its local and historical context, explaining the enlightened political circumstances that supported his publicly financed housing. It also suggests why contemporaneous developments in America lagged well behind the Dutch paradigm, and gives lie to the postmodernist canard that the International style was a soulless, oppressive conspiracy of technocrats bent on conformist social engineering. We should all be so lucky. 
WEEKEND UTOPIA: Modern Living in the Hamptons. By Alastair Gordon. (Princeton Architectural Press, $45.) The bloated postmodern McMansions that have despoiled the East End of Long Island over the past decade have reduced to a dim memory another local architectural tradition. In the optimistic aftermath of World War II, Long Island's South Fork became a "laboratory of leisure" for new forms of residential architecture. If not quite as significant as what was going on at the same time in Southern California with the houses of the Case Study program, the new vacation retreats of the Hamptons nonetheless contributed greatly to the acceptance of modern architecture on the East Coast.
Alastair Gordon, an architecture writer and longtime Hamptons summer resident, brings to vivid life a century in the architectural and social history of the East End, from its post-Civil War discovery as a summer colony to the demise of modernism and the revival of the Shingle Style in the late 1970's. Gordon resurrects such little-remembered pioneers as William Muschenheim, an M.I.T. graduate who worked in Germany in the 20's and came home filled with modern notions that he applied to a seaside house and bathing pavilions on his father's property in Hampton Bays. And who knew about the gracefully sited Carera beach house of 1940 in Montauk, designed with Prairie Style overhanging roofs by Antonin Raymond, a Czech-born Frank Lloyd Wright protege who had worked for the master in Japan.
Gordon shifts into high gear with the heady postwar years, which saw an influx of avant-garde New York artists to the East End, including Robert Motherwell, whose Quonset hut-like house of 1946 in East Hampton was designed by the early French modernist Pierre Chareau. Before long, Philip Johnson, George Nelson and Gordon Bunshaft were among the luminaries of midcentury modernism building on the dunes. So were lesser figures like Andrew Geller, whose determination to "unsquare the cube" resulted in eccentric designs like his Hunt house of 1959 on Fire Island, which resembled a huge box kite laid down on its side. And Geller's dreadful Elkin house of 1966 in Sagaponack, an angular mess that he called the "Reclining Picasso" but which neighbors saw as a train wreck, no doubt played a part in the subsequent retreat to tradition, however spurious and ill-executed the results have been. 
YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THE PUBLIC LIFE: Selected Essays of Charles W. Moore. Edited by Kevin Keim. (MIT, $45.) With the exception of Robert Venturi, no American architect of the postwar period has written with more erudition, elegance, insight and wit than Charles W. Moore. Regrettably, since Moore's death in 1993 at the age of 68 his once formidable reputation has been in decline, along with that of the postmodernism he helped advocate (though, like Venturi, he hated the word and always insisted he'd rather be pre- something else).
Moore's classic essays of the 60's, when he also did his best designs and served as the influential dean of the architecture schools at Berkeley and Yale, have been anthologized elsewhere. But it is good to have a full complement of those seminal pieces available for those who may have missed them previously, as well as for several articles, lectures and interviews unpublished until now. In his 1965 essay "You Have to Pay for the Public Life," Moore charted important new territory by admiring Disneyland as a serious piece of urban planning, as well as eloquently defending California's often-maligned civic architecture. Two years later, in "Plug It In, Rameses, and See if It Lights Up, Because We Aren't Going to Keep It Unless It Works," he caught the hip sensibility of the moment not only in his title but also in praising the kitschy pleasures of the Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo, Calif., a vernacular roadside extravaganza that epitomized what he called the "architecture of inclusion."
In his evocation of the spirit of place, Moore was peerless at extracting the essential qualities of a particular locale and explaining them to others, not least of all its inhabitants. "Southernness," written in 1975, is a superb brief introduction, as is his "Impressions of Japanese Architecture," published in 1978. And in "Architecture and Fairy Tales," a 1975 lecture printed here for the first time, Moore roams among many of his familiar touchstones -- from Baroque churches to Mexican villages -- as he takes his readers on an imaginary journey that captures to perfection his beguiling gifts as scholar, teacher and enchanter. 
SHIGERU BAN. (Princeton Architectural Press, $35.) Among the most interesting of the younger architects to emerge as Japan's bubble economy burst during the 1990's, Shigeru Ban, now 44, is one of those appealing cross-cultural figures whose work synthesizes the best of Western modernism and Japanese tradition. With his interest in lightweight construction, reminiscent of the classical architecture of his homeland, Ban is best known for his Curtain Wall House of 1995 in Tokyo. There he satirized the International style convention of a suspended, nonstructural glass facade by playfully replacing it with retractable glazing and an outer, two-story-high, white fabric curtain that wraps around the two street elevations and can be pulled back to fully open the interior in warm weather.
In a period when other architects have gravitated toward a host of new high-tech materials, Ban is fascinated by paper and cardboard, another throwback to Japanese precedent. He is equally concerned with making his expertise available for humanitarian purposes, and he has combined both impulses with admirable results. His cardboard-tube-framed emergency shelters for Rwandan refugees in 1995 solved several immediate problems brilliantly. With similar ingenuity, he took the large cardboard cylinders used for casting concrete columns and recycled them into temporary "log" houses (costing less than $2,000 each) for the victims of the 1995 Kobe earthquake. "Even in disaster areas," Ban writes, "as an architect I want to create beautiful buildings. . . . If I did not feel this way, it would be impossible to create meaningful architecture and to make a contribution to society at the same time." 
He can also use those humble materials with lyrical abandon, as in his Japan Pavilion of 2000 for the Hanover Expo in Germany, with its undulating paper-and-PVC roof supported by a lacy latticework of cardboard tubing. And the arborlike Paper Arch he erected over the Museum of Modern Art's Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden during the summer of 2000 was a worthy successor to the many inventive temporary structures displayed there over the years. Though this first English-language monograph on Ban's architecture can be a bit skimpy on factual detail -- one would like to know what fabric was used on the Curtain Wall House, for example -- it is a welcome introduction to an emerging talent who merits close attention.

The books are arranged alphabetically under genre headings. The complete reviews of these books may be found at The New York Times on the Web: nytimes.com/books.

FICTION & POETRY
 THE ABOMINATION. By Paul Golding. (Knopf, $26.) A smart, angry first novel full of beautiful surfaces, including that of the hero, if that's the word, who wanders through gay London seething with contempt for his milieu and hatred for the grown-ups who deformed his childhood. 
 ACCORDING TO QUEENEY. By Beryl Bainbridge. (Carroll & Graf, $22.) Samuel Johnson and his friend Hester Thrale are the subjects of this novel as they appear to Hester's daughter; her case of mother-daughter conflict urges her toward forgetfulness, not understanding. 
AFTERIMAGE. By Helen Humphreys. (Metropolitan/Holt, $23.) A Canadian writer's lyrical, alluring novel, a kind of gloss on the life of the Victorian photographer Julia Margaret Cameron; the character at its heart, however, is a passionately self-educated housemaid from starving Ireland who serves as a model and as the prize in a family tug of war.
AGAINST LOVE POETRY. By Eavan Boland. (Norton, $21.) Poems consistently feminist, domestic and devoted to the poet's native Ireland; Boland argues that the sweet, icky stuff that passes for love poetry is no such thing. Her concern is with polarities of love and control, against thoughtless submission but much in favor of sacrifices in partnership.
AIDING AND ABETTING. By Muriel Spark. (Doubleday, $21.) Spark at 82 can still manipulate characters so daringly their most improbable acts seem self-generated; in this instance, two men who claim to be the murderous Lord Lucan (missing since 1974) gang up to blackmail a Paris psychiatrist who is as unlikely as they are.
ALMOST. By Elizabeth Benedict. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) A nearly-mystery novel nicely constructed around a ghastly premise: Sophy, the narrator and protagonist, has found new love with Daniel in the last stage of her divorce from Will when Will is found dead in dreadful circumstances. Complications ensue, of course. 
AMERICAN SON. By Brian Ascalon Roley. (Norton, paper, $13.) Two half-Filipino brothers can pass for white, but their mother cannot; painful conflicts are in store for everybody in this novel's complex exploration of racism in California, starting in 1993, a year after the Rodney King riots. 
AMONG THE MISSING. By Dan Chaon. (Ballantine, $22.) This unnerving collection of stories concerns mothers who hit the road, fathers who fly the coop, a husband who keels over, a boy who steps behind a bush and is never seen again. The characters seem not to know what they are doing, but the author does. 
THE ARTIST'S WIFE. By Max Phillips. (John Macrae/Holt, $23.) Phillips's novel is narrated from inside the selfish, mean, witty head of Alma Mahler (1879-1964), who married, in succession, Gustav Mahler, Walter Gropius and Franz Werfel, when not playing around with Oskar Kokoschka, and outlived just about everybody.
BABE IN PARADISE. By Marisa Silver. (Norton, $23.95.) A disquieting first collection of short stories, set in Los Angeles, where fame and wealth are the core of life and Silver's characters rotate on the periphery, doing what they must to develop wisps of hope. 
BACK WHEN WE WERE GROWNUPS. By Anne Tyler. (Knopf, $25.) A kind of optimistic fatalism pervades Tyler's 15th novel, in which a 53-year-old mother, stepmother and widow abandons false starts and fantasy, realizing that "your true life is the one you end up with, whatever it may be."
THE BAY OF ANGELS. By Anita Brookner. (Random House, $23.95.) In her 20th novel, Brookner shifts her customary focus on an anomie-bedeviled heroine caught in the confusion between life and literature to ponder the freedom that accompanies the acceptance of limitations.
THE BEAUTY OF THE HUSBAND: A Fictional Essay in 29 Tangos. By Anne Carson. (Knopf, $22.) Poems are they, these objects? Whatever, they are bold and abbreviated, they fear no free association and no kind of knowledge or desire and are overtly concerned with the ways intellectual discernment can clash with erotic taste. 
BIG AS LIFE: Three Tales for Spring. By Maureen Howard. (Viking, $23.95.) A triptych of novellas somehow based on the seasons: a professor's love affair with an executive; an Irish beauty's moral and charitable discoveries in New York; and a thematic exploration of John James Audubon, the birdman who killed for his art.
THE BIOGRAPHER'S TALE. By A. S. Byatt. (Knopf, $24.) An exhilarating fable that divides the house of letters into theorists, scholars and practitioners; its hero, a small but "perfectly formed" scholar, is writing the life of a writer who wrote the life of a writer who wrote, or maybe intended to write or not, about Galton, Linnaeus and Ibsen.
BLUE DIARY. By Alice Hoffman. (Putnam, $24.95.) Sunny magic realism and weather to match give way to Hoffman's characteristic themes of loss and deception in this novel when the husband of an otherwise happy family is arrested for a rape and murder; he confesses the crime to his wife, who must figure out how much truth she will be able to tolerate.
THE BODY ARTIST. By Don DeLillo. (Scribner, $22.) A tiny, intimate metaphysical ghost story by a master creator of huge, panoramic fiction; it concerns a woman alone in a large seaside house, where a strange man appears in an unused room. DeLillo's pinpoint prose copes with big themes, like the structure of time and the artist's approach to calamity.
THE BONESETTER'S DAUGHTER. By Amy Tan. (Putnam, $25.95.) A novel of multiple narratives that puts to use the experiences, in very different countries and ages, of daughter, mother and grandmother to construct a family story and find the place in it for the youngest generation.
BORDER CROSSING. By Pat Barker. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $22.) An emotionally astute novel on public themes, in which a charming 23-year-old psychopath comes back to wreck the life of the child psychologist who helped send him to jail 13 years earlier.
THE BOSTONS. By Carolyn Cooke. (Mariner/ Houghton Mifflin, paper, $12.) A network of connections between these short stories illuminates from more than one point of view a sort of clique of aging, prosperous Bostonians and the rough, unprosperous Maine community where they traditionally spend their summers.
CARRY ME ACROSS THE WATER. By Ethan Canin. (Random House, $23.95.) The water is almost certainly the Styx, as contemplated from some small remove by this novel's protagonist, a Pittsburgh beer baron whose protective arrogance is compromised by the eruption, unbidden, of 78 years' worth of memory.
CARTER BEATS THE DEVIL. By Glen David Gold. (Hyperion, $24.95.) A grandly plotted novel with a framework of real history that recaptures a lost era of live entertainment; Carter, a brilliant stage magician with some connection to the death of Warren G. Harding, tangles with a Secret Service out to hurt him.
THE CENTER OF THINGS. By Jenny McPhee. (Doubleday, $22.95.) Marie Brown, the heroine of this engaging, amusing first novel, is an aspiring tabloid writer and quondam graduate student in philosophy of science. Now 39, she still hopes for true love, professional advancement and an understanding of physical reality.
THE CHEESE MONKEYS: A Novel in Two Semesters. By Chip Kidd. (Scribner, $25.) Fiction, by a notable graphic designer, that feels autobiographical and sometimes acts like a manifesto on graphic design; its hero, a student at a big state university in 1957-58, himself has heroes: a bold, sexy, bohemian woman and a challenging, confrontational design professor.
THE COLD SIX THOUSAND. By James Ellroy. (Knopf, $25.95.) America teems with conspiracy in this novel of the period between the Kennedy assassinations; the Klan, the F.B.I., the Mormons, the C.I.A. and Howard Hughes all seem to be involved, none of them on the side of truth or justice.
COLLECTED POEMS. By James Merrill. Edited by J. D. McClatchy and Stephen Yenser. (Knopf, $40.) A big, handsome volume that displays Merrill's absorption and re-emission, transfigured, of every kind of experience this planet has to offer.
COLLECTED STORIES. By Ellen Gilchrist. (Little, Brown, $27.95.) This thick sampling of Gilchrist's work over two decades gives plenty of scope for tracking her recurrent Southern heroines through her recurrent theme: that we are saved from regret and free-floating cynicism by the wonders of chance and love.
THE COLLECTED STORIES OF RICHARD YATES. (Holt, $28.) Yates's focus on human weakness and self-deceit never made him all that popular in his lifetime (1926-92), so it's a joy tempered with apprehension to see this unflinching volume in which people trick themselves into seeking what they don't want.
COME UP AND SEE ME SOMETIME. By Erika Krouse. (Scribner, $22.) Short stories populated by intelligent, wisecracking, bruised women, insecure, white and around 30; to find and keep love is what they want to do but can't, and Krouse's grasp of dark comedy lets her squeeze them beyond the limits we are used to.
THE COMPLETE WORKS OF ISAAC BABEL. Edited by Nathalie Babel. (Norton, $39.95.) The total product of the marvelous writer who tried to create a synthesis of the Russian, the Jewish, the literary and the revolutionary, a mix that bestowed life on his fiction but could not save him from death on Stalin's orders in 1940.
THE CONFESSIONS OF MYCROFT HOLMES: A Paper Chase. By Marcel Theroux. (Harcourt, $23.) The title is a tease about sibling rivalry; beyond it, there's a mystery involving a balance of forces somewhat like those in the author's real-life family, a burglary, a manuscript and an exercise of the novelist's imagination.
CRAWLING AT NIGHT. By Nani Power. (Atlantic Monthly, $24.) In this first novel by a young writer with a strong feel for the grim and the squalid, the central characters, a Japanese sushi chef in Manhattan and an alcoholic waitress, fall for each other and hit the road, intending reform but showing few of the necessary skills.
THE DEATH OF SWEET MISTER. By Daniel Woodrell. (Marian Wood/Putnam, $23.95.) An unattractive 13-year-old boy, Shuggie, is the narrator of this violent, intense novel set in the Ozarks, acute in its rendering of the boy's incestuous jealousy for his mother and his rage at the men who bid for her attention.
THE DEATH OF VISHNU. By Manil Suri. (Norton, $24.95.) A deft, confident first novel that rarely departs from the landing of a Bombay apartment building, where a servant with the name of a god lies dying, while upstairs a nominal Muslim struggles with spiritual difficulties, seeking "the rapture of faith."
DEMONOLOGY: Stories. By Rick Moody. (Little, Brown, $24.95.) Accomplished, fearless short stories that examine the exchange of energy between language and loss; inhabited mostly by young people whose heads are smarter than their hearts, and illuminated, sometimes, by barrages of emotional and rhetorical fireworks.
THE DEVIL'S LARDER. By Jim Crace. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $20.) Sixty-four brief fictions that require the reader to settle for not knowing exactly what is going on when tourists, for example, are tormented with snacks that induce "chemical mirth."
DIRTY HAVANA TRILOGY. By Pedro Juan Gutierrez. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25.) A ribald, earthy novel by a Cuban living in Cuba; the narrator, a former journalist who has fallen out with the Castro government, expertly evokes sensuous experience in his prose, and that experience is chiefly of poverty and sex, one of which helps him to survive the other.

the faithful narrative of a pastor's disappearance. By Benjamin Anastas. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.)

HONEYMOON: And Other Stories. By Kevin Canty. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $21.)

SISTER INDIA. By Peggy Payne. (Riverhead, $24.95.) Estelle, the ferocious 400-pound protagonist of this unsettling novel, lives in what isolation she can find in teeming Varanasi, India, with an awful sin in her past that she tries to keep out of her mind; once it is released, a kind of deliverance -- but no easy out -- becomes possible.

 BILLANCOURT TALES
By Nina Berberova.
Translated by Marian Schwartz.
175 pp. New York:
New Directions. $24.95.
 "I know this feeling increasingly: falling from our usual dimension into another." These words come from "The Italics Are Mine," the 1969 autobiography of Nina Berberova, who was born in Russia in 1901 and died in the United States in 1993. And while they refer specifically to the vertigolike sensation of living in St. Petersburg during the Russian Revolution, they could apply equally well to other dislocating episodes in Berberova's long life: her move in 1925, after interludes in Berlin, Prague and Italy, to Paris, where she lived for 25 years; her experience of occupied France as a Third Reich fief following the Nazi invasion; and her final migration, in 1950, from Europe to America.
Berberova eventually flourished in her adopted homeland, becoming a professor of Russian literature, first at Yale University and then at Princeton. But it was her life in Paris that figured most prominently in her fiction, notably her novels, "Cape of Storms" and "The Book of Happiness," and numerous shorter works, among them her brilliant novella "The Accompanist."
Her hallmark strengths -- a whimsy and cool resolve that, in tandem, functioned as a wry stoicism -- came together most powerfully in "The Resurrection of Mozart," a story set during the fall of France in 1940. Pitting a ghost of civilization (a bewildered Mozart who is accidentally summoned from beyond the grave) against "the omens of war," Berberova weighs what's at stake as German air raids shatter Europe's peace. While civilization appears momentarily eclipsed, there's an unspoken confidence that its ghosts will endure and eventually be resurrected, even if it is into a world altered beyond recognition.
At first glance, "Billancourt Tales," a freshly translated collection of Berberova's earliest fiction, seems unlikely to bear comparison with anything as fine as "The Resurrection of Mozart." Berberova herself was somewhat disparaging about these stories, written in the 1920's and 30's, which depict exiled Russians living in the industrial Parisian suburb of Billancourt. In "The Italics Are Mine," she described them as "a lyrico-ironical series of stories about Billancourt-Russian indigents, drunks, patresfamilias, Renault workers, courtyard singers, declasse eccentrics." She explained that "some were written in a hurry for money, with low-level results, but at least half a dozen of them were very much to the point."
Berberova didn't do herself justice. The 13 stories of "Billancourt Tales" are closely observed, potently phrased and dapperly shaped. Sly and heartfelt, they strike a note of picaresque melancholy as Berberova examines an eclectic assortment of Russian plights and fates.
The chronically unemployed Gerasim Gavrilovich, for instance, blows his chance at a movie career in "Photogenique" because he can't reconcile himself to playing the part of a thief, while 19-year-old Antonina Nikolaevna Selindrina unexpectedly becomes the title character in "The Argentine" after a brief, eventful passage through Paris. In these and other stories, life-changing moves (you can't call them decisions) are made on the fly. The wife of Ivan Ivanovich Kondurin says it best in "An Incident With Music" when she tells her pianist husband, stuck in a bookkeeping job and looking for a way out, "Fate is playing games with you."
Acting as master of ceremonies over these games is Grigory Andreevich, or Grisha, as his friends know him. A sometime employee at the factory of "Monsieur Renault," Grisha serves as narrator in most of the stories, a role inspired in part by his knack for playing the confidant to a wide circle of friends and acquaintances.
On occasion, Grisha is the star of his own tale, as in the cross-continental romance recounted in "Versts and Sleeping Cars." (Grisha, an infantryman on the run from the Red Army, becomes "engaged" to a woman who later turns up in Prague and Paris, sometimes remembering her fiance, sometimes not.) More often he's on the sidelines, observing all that goes on. Berberova, just offstage and pulling the strings, has plenty of fun with him, occasionally introducing a note of metafiction into the proceedings. When wrapping up "Photogenique," for instance, Grisha is forced to be frank with the story's failed movie star. "Nowadays," he explains, after hearing out Gerasim Gavrilovich's account of his failure as a silver-screen villain, "the papers prefer to write about the opposite, about jutting chins and people getting ahead. I'm afraid no one's going to want to read about you."
In one lurid tale of jealousy and murder, "A Gypsy Romance," Grisha doesn't narrate at all, but is glimpsed in the corner of the cafe where the action takes place, drunkenly toasting an endless lineup of "charming" Russian-born Parisiennes. Whether he's acting the fool or bluntly acknowledging the hard knocks of his fellow exiles ("What man in our day hasn't been tempered in life's battles? For us, there is no such man"), he's crucial in maintaining the book's fine balance between the droll and the poignant.
Marian Schwartz's English translation deftly captures the fanciful twists and turns of Berberova's imagination, whether she's waxing acerbic on the stifling nature of the city's industrial suburbs ("If it weren't for the Paris wind we'd have nothing to breathe in Billancourt") or detailing male Sunday attire circa 1929: "Parts ran across heads like bright shoelaces, took a turn eight and a half centimeters above the ear and, rounding the crown in a free line, descended to a starched collar." Berberova can write more straightforwardly, too. But even the most sweeping or plaintive outbursts of her lost souls ("Your spaces, your seasons, your climate -- none of them suit me") have a downbeat verve.
By the end of the book, Billancourt emerges as a character in itself, a working-class enclave whose very name serves as shorthand for keeping tough in tough times. "There is no end or limit to Billancourt," Berberova writes in the book's closing story, "nor will there ever be."
With this volume in hand, the realities of a long-vanished Russian emigre community reach far indeed beyond their original temporal and geographical limits. It may have taken them over half a century to touch our shores, but now that we have them, they feel indispensable.

 BODY:
Take the long view. What will New York be like on Sept. 11, 2011? It's not difficult to imagine a rather wretched future. You need only visit one of those cities -- Jerusalem or Belfast -- that have been fractured by terrorism and religious strife to get a glimpse. Imagine a segregated city, with a kind of Muslim ghetto in an outer borough that non-Muslims can enter only -- if they dare -- with a special endorsement on their ID cards. Imagine security checkpoints at every tunnel and bridge leading into Manhattan, where armed antiterrorist troops check every vehicle for traces of explosives and prohibited toxins. 
 Does that mean you also have to count on even worse gridlock on the Van Wyck Expressway? No, because you also need to imagine a decline in the number of cars on the road. For by 2011, the third and final oil shock will have heralded the end of the internal-combustion era. 
Still, there will be some comfort to be found downtown. There, rising like a phoenix from the rubble of the World Trade Center, will be that gleaming monument to American resilience: the twin towers of the Nafta Center. Even if world trade couldn't be rebuilt after the Great Depression of 2002-03, at least the city's beloved landmark could. And the new towers will be even taller -- thanks to the antiaircraft turrets on top. 
In its immediate aftermath, the destruction of the World Trade Center looked like one of those events -- the assassination at Sarajevo, the bombing of Pearl Harbor -- that set history on a new course. Some excitable commentators began talking about "World War III" almost the same day the twin towers fell. That's one possible future. Much more likely, however, is the nightmare scene sketched above. That's because this outcome could arise out of already discernible trends, all of which predated Sept. 11, 2001. Tragic and spectacular though it was, that event was far less of a turning point than is generally believed. 
We should be wary, in fact, of ever attaching too much importance to any single event. It was not Gavrilo Princip alone who started World War I. In his great novel, "The Man Without Qualities," Robert Musil dismissed the idea that history moves in a straight line like a billiard ball, changing direction only when struck. For Musil, history was more like "the passage of clouds," constantly in flux, never predictable. That quality is what makes it impossible to predict where exactly we will be 10 years from now. 
Yet Musil's analogy of history and clouds illuminates something else. Though the weather is hard to forecast, the range of possible weathers is not infinitely large. It may not rain tomorrow, but we know that if it does, it will rain water, not boiling oil. It may not be quite as warm as yesterday, but we know that it will not be minus 50 degrees. 
In other words, Sept. 11 was the historical equivalent of a violent and unpredictable storm. But the storm did not alter the fact that summer was slowly shading into fall. In just the same way, the attacks on New York and Washington, however shocking, did not alter the direction of several underlying historical trends. In many respects the world will not be so very different in 2011 from the world as it would have evolved under the influence of those trends, even had the attacks not happened. 
The first deep trend is obvious enough: the spread of terrorism -- that is to say the use of violence by nonstate organizations in the pursuit of extreme political goals -- to the United States. This kind of terrorism has been around for quite a while. Hijacking planes is certainly not new: since the late 1960's, when the tactic first began to be used systematically by the Palestine Liberation Organization and its sympathizers, there have been some 500 hijackings. As for the tactic of flying planes directly at populous targets, what else were the 3,913 Japanese pilots doing who killed themselves and many more American servicemen flying kamikaze missions in 1944 and 1945?
All that was really new on Sept. 11 was that these tried-and-tested tactics were applied in combination and in the United States. Between 1995 and 2000, according to State Department figures, there were more than 2,100 international terrorist attacks. But just 15 of them occurred in North America, causing just seven casualties. It was the successful extension of international terrorism to the United States that was the novelty.
A novelty, yes, but hardly a surprise. Terrorism had been a fact of life in major cities around the world -- including New York's elder sister London -- for decades. The only surprising thing was that New York was spared for so long. Put it this way: if economics could be globalized, why not political violence? The two are in fact connected. Year after year it becomes easier for small bands of fanatics to perpetrate mass destruction because the means of destruction get cheaper and more readily available. The last time I checked, a used AK-47 assault rifle could be purchased in the United States for $700 and a new one for $1,395, almost exactly the price of the portable computer on which this article was written. 
In the same way, the real cost of a nuclear warhead -- and certainly the real cost of a kiloton of nuclear yield -- is lower today than at any time since the Manhattan Project achieved its goal. That cost two billion 1945 dollars. Converted into 2001 prices, that figure rises roughly tenfold, which is enough to buy more than 400 Trident II missiles. (Let's face it: if nukes were expensive, Pakistan wouldn't have them.) It seems reasonable to assume that the same process has reduced the cost of biological weapons like refined anthrax.
The bad news is that no amount of warfare against the states that harbor terrorists will rule out further attacks. The Western European experience of combating leftist and nationalist terrorism shows that the real war against terrorism has to be fought on the home front by domestic intelligence agencies, police forces and humdrum security guards around all potential targets.
So, welcome to the world of the daily security check, the fortnightly bomb scare and the annual explosion. Ten years from now, New York firefighters and Washington postal workers will feel the same weary resignation that Londoners developed during the I.R.A.'s bombing campaign.
The second trend that Sept. 11 did nothing to change is the economic downturn. The asset bubble of the late 1990's peaked a year and a half before the terrorists struck. And despite their proximity to Wall Street, the real crashes of Sept. 11 did not cause a metaphorical crash on the stock market -- just its temporary closure. 
Admittedly, in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, investors had to grit their teeth as prices threatened to go into free fall. Yet so far, the deflation of the late 1990's asset price bubble has been a gentle affair compared with the cataclysmic meltdown that followed the bubble of the 1920's. To give some orders of magnitude, a crash on the 1929-32 scale would take the Dow down from over 11,723 -- where it stood at its peak in January last year -- to about 1,266 by November next year. On Nov. 15, it stood at 9,872, less than 3 percent down from Sept. 10. When Alan Greenspan coined the phrase "irrational exuberance," the index was 6,473. In this light, the most striking thing about the economic consequences of Sept. 11 would seem to be their insignificance. A 3 percent drop in the Dow is nothing. Oil prices, too, have continued their yearlong decline. And there has been virtually no movement in long-term interest rates, which might have been expected at a time of increased political risk.
Nevertheless, the world economy has two serious economic weaknesses -- also predating Sept. 11 -- that cannot be ignored.
The first is the nonglobal nature of globalization. Far from being perfectly integrated, the world's markets for goods, capital and labor appear to have become remarkably segmented. Thus, the overwhelming bulk of American, Canadian and Mexican trade now takes place within the North American Free Trade Area, just as most European trade takes place within Europe. Back in 1913, international capital was truly international: about 63 percent of foreign direct investment in 1913 went to developing countries. But in 1996, the proportion was just 28 percent. Labor mobility is also distorted, with the United States able to cherry-pick the best-qualified and most-talented workers from European and Asian economies under its various visa programs while letting in many more unskilled (and untaxed) Latino workers through the Mexican back door.
This is one key reason that the process we call globalization has tended to result in widening inequality between nations. In the 1960's, the richest fifth of the world's population had a total income 30 times as great as the poorest fifth's; in 1998, the ratio was 74:1. In 1965, real gross domestic product per capita in Chad was one-fifteenth of the U.S.'s ; in 1990, one-fiftieth. If there was a substantial measure of convergence of incomes during the first age of globalization, in this age there is a pronounced divergence. And such inequality seems likely to increase the resentment felt in poorer countries toward the super-rich United States. (That said, we should not make the mistake of assuming that this poverty is the principal cause of support for organizations like Al Qaeda, most of whose recruits come from relatively prosperous backgrounds.)
Even more worrying is the medium-term outlook for global energy supplies. The rise of the S.U.V. as a status symbol shows how complacent Americans are about their supply of oil and petroleum. They should not be. True, oil prices are low right now: a barrel of West Texas crude sells for about $20, less than half the price (in real terms) as at the peak of the oil crisis in 1982. But what made prices go through the roof in the 1970's and early 1980's was political instability in the Middle East: the anti-Israel Arab oil embargo, the Iranian revolution and the Iran-Iraq war. It's no great stretch to imagine something similar happening again. (Even the demand-side shock of the recent U.S. boom trebled the oil price between December 1998 and October 2000's $33 peak.)
The realities are stark. The Middle East accounts for 31 percent of world oil production but just 6 percent of consumption. North America accounts for about 18 percent of world oil production but consumes 30 percent. Even more sobering, however, are the figures for world oil reserves: North America has just 6 percent of them; the Middle East 65 percent.
Feeling comfortable? Total U.S. energy consumption -- of which petroleum accounts for about two-fifths -- has risen about 27 percent since 1972, while oil reserves have fallen by about 30 percent. Right now, the United States depends on the Persian Gulf -- mainly Saudi Arabia -- for about 12 percent of its oil imports, but that figure is bound to rise as OPEC countries account for an ever-increasing share of the world's available oil.
The time frame may be much tighter than S.U.V. manufacturers realize. Kenneth S. Deffeyes of Princeton University predicts that global oil production will start to decline from 2004. At a conference at the Royal United Services Institute in London in October, experts warned that from 2008 supplies of non-OPEC oil will fall steeply -- reaching close to zero in 2040 -- and that, barring some major technological breakthroughs, there will be an effective world shortage from 2010.
Yet even that estimate could prove to be overoptimistic if there is a regime change in Saudi Arabia. Like "the coming oil crisis," the fall of the Saudi monarchy has been prophesied so often that many people have stopped believing it could ever happen. Don't be so sure. The position of the ruling dynasty increasingly resembles that of the shah of Iran in the late 1970's. Low oil prices may have been good for the West, but they have produced a significant fall in per capita income in Saudi Arabia, creating a reserve army of disenchanted young men who are the natural recruits of Al Qaeda. 
Make no mistake: radical Islam -- especially the Wahhabist strain found in Saudi Arabia -- is a revolutionary movement that has set the Middle East ablaze before now (in the 1880's for example, when a Sudanese holy man calling himself the "Mahdi," or "expected guide," emerged as the Victorian Osama bin Laden). A revolution in Saudi Arabia would be as traumatic a blow to the world economy as the Iranian revolution of 1979. 
The days of the S.U.V. -- perhaps even the days of the internal-combustion engine -- are therefore numbered. American car manufacturers have less than a decade to come up with an alternative and affordable energy source to gasoline. If they fail, the world economy could well find itself reliving the stagflation of the 1970's.
There is a third trend that has been at work for more than a decade: the transition of American global power from informal to formal imperialism.
Since 1945, the United States has largely been content to exercise influence around the world indirectly: exercising economic leverage through multinational corporations and international agencies like the International Monetary Fund and political power through "friendly" indigenous regimes.
As Britain discovered in the 19th century, however, there are limits to what can be achieved by informal imperialism. Revolutions can overthrow the puppet rulers. New regimes can default on their debts, disrupt trade, go to war with their neighbors -- even sponsor terrorism.
Slowly and rather unreflectively, the United States has been responding to crises of this sort by intervening directly in the internal affairs of faraway countries. True, it has tended to do so behind a veil of multilateralism, acting in the name of the United Nations or NATO. But the precedents set in Bosnia and Kosovo are crucial. What happened in the 1990's was that those territories became a new kind of colony: international protectorates underwritten by U.S. military and monetary might.
Since the United States and Britain went to war against Afghanistan -- with the avowed intention of replacing the Taliban regime -- I have found myself quoting Rudyard Kipling on "the White Man's Burden," particularly those lines (written just over a century ago) that enjoined Americans to fight what he called "the savage wars of peace" while at the same time filling "full the mouth of Famine." (Kipling would certainly have grasped the rationale of simultaneously dropping cluster bombs and food parcels.) Of course, no one today would be so politically incorrect as to call governing Afghanistan "the White Man's Burden." Even in his messianic speech at the Labor Party conference in October, British Prime Minister Tony Blair talked innocuously about "partnership," "the politics of globalization" and "reordering this world." Yet the underlying message of that speech was pure Kipling. 
There are good reasons to wonder how readily Americans will assume the Victorian burden, of course. The strengths of the U.S. economy may not be the strengths of a natural imperial hegemon. The British Empire relied on an enormous export of capital and people, but since 1972 the American economy has been a net importer of capital (to the tune of 15 percent of G.D.P. last year), and the United States remains the favored destination of immigrants from around the world, not a producer of would-be colonial emigrants. Moreover, Britain in its heyday was able to draw on a culture of unabashed imperialism dating back to the Elizabethan period. The United States -- born in a war against the British Empire -- will always be a reluctant ruler of other peoples. 
But reluctance isn't the same as renunciation. And the obvious lesson the United States can draw from the British experience of formal empire is that the world's most successful economy can do a very great deal to impose its preferred values on less technologically advanced societies. It is nothing short of astonishing that Great Britain was able to govern about a quarter of the world's population and land surface -- and to control nearly all of its sea lanes -- without running up an especially large defense bill (an average of just 3 percent of net national product between 1870 and 1913, lower for the rest of the 19th century). And today the United States is vastly wealthier relative to the rest of the world than Britain ever was. In 1913, Britain's share of total world output was a shade over 8 percent; the equivalent figure for the United States in 1998 was just under 22 percent. Nor should anybody pretend that, at least in fiscal terms, the cost of expanding the American empire -- even if it meant a great many little wars like the one in Afghanistan -- would be prohibitive. Last year, American defense spending stood at just 2.9 percent of G.D.P., compared with an average for the years 1948-98 of 6.8 percent. 
I have not yet raised one trend, much commented on -- the supposedly inescapable "clash" between a democratic West and an intolerant Islam. From this viewpoint, Sept. 11 was a moment of revelation rather than redirection, as America belatedly woke up to a struggle the Muslim world has been fighting for years. I don't buy this. 
Primarily that's because the most striking features of modern Islam are its amazing heterogeneity and geographical dispersion. Violence between ethnic or religious groups is not dividing the world into great blocs. As we have already seen in the Balkans (where we were inclined to side with the Muslims, don't forget), the tendency is for existing political units to fragment. So any clash of civilizations will occur not on conventional battlefields but in the streets of multicultural states like Bosnia -- or even cities like Bradford in England, where gangs of Muslim youths rioted last summer.
Think of it as deglobalization: for one of the great paradoxes of our time is that the economic integration of the world has coincided with its political disintegration. Excluding sub-Saharan Africa, there were 64 independent countries in the world in 1871. Forty-three years later, on the eve of World War I, imperialism had reduced the number to 59. But since World War II, there have been sustained increases. In 1946, there were 74 independent countries; in 1950, 89. By 1995, the number was 192. 
In this context, the main significance of movements like Islamic fundamentalism may lie in their centrifugal as opposed to centripetal effects. Rather than anticipating a clash between monolithic civilizations, we should expect a continued process of political disintegration as religious and ethnic conflicts challenge the integrity of existing multicultural nation-states. Civil war has, after all, been the most frequent kind of war since 1945: something like two-thirds of all postwar conflicts have been within rather than between states. From Yugoslavia to Iraq to Afghanistan, what the United States keeps having to confront is not a united Islam but a succession of fractured polities, racked by internecine war. (The same could be said about Somalia, Sierra Leone and Rwanda.) 
Why has economic globalization coincided with political fragmentation in this contradictory fashion? One possible answer is that globalized market forces increase regional inequalities within traditional nation-states. Another is that the superficial homogenization of popular culture -- through Hollywood, the pop-music industry and the Anglicization of technical communication -- promotes an accentuation of parochial identities as a kind of a reaction. But the best answer may be that as more and more ethnically heterogeneous countries adopt (with American encouragement) the combination of economic openness and political democracy, their rationale simply falls away. Central government loses its legitimacy as the planner of the economy, and ethnic minorities vote for separatist parties.
These, then, are the four deep trends shaping the early 21st century. First, the globalization of terrorism. Second, the approach of a second energy crisis. Third, the formalization of American imperialism. And finally, the fragmentation of the multicultural polity.
What are the implications for the world of Sept. 11, 2011? With the caveat that this is only one of a number of possible futures, let me repeat my earlier predictions. Terrorism will be a part of everyday life. Meanwhile, American troops will be patrolling both Kabul and Kosovo. And the divisions between ethnic and religious groups in the United States -- indeed throughout the world -- will be even more pronounced. So much for the bad news. The good news? There will be fewer S.U.V.'s clogging up the streets.
Let me conclude with a fifth prediction. Most people will regard all of these things as direct consequences of the terrorist attacks 10 years before. Indeed, The New York Times Magazine will carry an article saying that Sept. 11, 2001, was one of the great turning points of modern history. 
Wrong. The unpalatable truth is that it would all have happened anyway.

HEADLINE: Luxury In Hard Times 

BYLINE:  By Lynn Hirschberg; Lynn Hirschberg, a contributing writer for the magazine, writes regularly on fashion topics.

 BODY:
The second week of September was Fashion Week in New York, and Tom Ford, the designer of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, was in town to meet with investors and to host a glitzy party for the newly redesigned YSL store on Madison Avenue. "I'm a Virgo," Ford told me a week later. "So I see all the problems." As usual, he was obsessive about the store's decor. He moved a white stool, he worried that the handrail would give shoppers splinters and he set little marks on the stereo volume so the music would provide the proper ambience. The New York store, Ford reasoned, would set the YSL tone for the label nationwide. 
 Ford, who is 40, splits his time between homes in Paris and London -- and spends the rest of his time in the luxury neighborhoods of other great cities. He was the first designer to envision the world as a global marketplace that could be linked by a sensibility -- his sensibility -- and he systematically and effectively made Gucci the first real high-end global fashion brand. In only six years, Gucci has gone from $263 million to $2.26 billion in revenue, and that growth can be directly traced to a spending-happy, luxury-loving world population that has been attracted to Ford's sexy jet-set, vaguely 70's idea of the Gucci universe. He has the unique gift of being able to design an easily identifiable, must-have item that is different, but not too different, that will conjure a transforming image for a wide range of customers, whether they live in Tokyo, Moscow or Miami. Gucci appeals to more than just the fashion intelligentsia -- it is mass luxury, selling to aspirants at every price point, from the housewife who buys a Gucci wallet to the starlet who wears the line head to toe. 
 Because of his highly developed business perspective, Ford is sometimes considered not to be a pure designer. This perception of him as more businessman than fashion innovator irks him. Still, it's Ford's philosophy that Gucci, and now YSL, are not meant to be works of art; they are designed with an eye toward a much larger landscape. Through clothes and advertising and the decor of a store, Ford, perhaps more than any other designer, is trying to both gauge and manipulate mood, to anticipate and also control the global zeitgeist.
Which is why, on Sept. 11, Ford, who first saw the terrorist attack on television in his suite at the Carlyle Hotel, was horrified and dismayed, but also, as a businessman, quick to act and put it in perspective. Stuck in his room, Ford immediately canceled the YSL store party, and his investor meeting was postponed. "I get daily sales figures," Ford said, "and on Sept. 12, there was a big drop in our business all over the world. Precipitous. But the swing in fashion didn't start with Sept. 11. The recession in luxury started last season, about six months ago. What happened on Sept. 11 was the period at the end of the sentence. On Sept. 11, the 90's ended."
Ford says this calmly, matter of factly, in a soothing voice that must be reassuring to investors, store managers and customers alike. From the early days of Gucci, Ford recognized the power of branding not only everything that is Gucci (the clothing line, the stores, the perfume) but also himself. His appearance has not changed in 10 years -- his skin is always the exact same shade of nut brown; his jeans always hang just so and his white shirt is always unbuttoned to below his sternum, the cuffs open and ever so slightly too long. Ford has excellent manners -- remembers names, asks after your mother. As a former commercial actor, Ford knows which angles of his face are most flattering, and he also knows that admitting that he knows which angles of his face are most flattering is appealing. Narcissism revealed seems fastidious and self-aware rather than vain. 
"I'm not a fool," Ford explains. "No one ever likes the way they look, but I understand the power of a face attached to something. Fashion has always been that way. Designers were always charismatic personalities you wanted to be a part of, and that is one thing that will not change with Sept. 11."
Even though Ford and Gucci Group had a growing awareness of the impending downturn in the world's economy, they had, in the last two years, embarked on a program of rapid expansion. In 1999, following a lengthy takeover battle with rival luxury titan LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Gucci Group was allied with Francois Pinault, one of the richest men in France. Fueled by a $3 billion influx of cash from Pinault, Gucci Group went on a spending spree. Yves Saint Laurent was its first purchase in 1999, followed by Bottega Veneta (leather goods), Boucheron (jewelry), Sergio Rossi (shoes) and part ownership of the design houses of Stella McCartney, Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga, which is run by Nicolas Ghesquiere.
"We're treating fashion like the old studio system in Hollywood," Ford explains. "We have different sorts of stars, and I can help build and develop them. The old studios in Hollywood created a world that you aspired to. And aspirational things are so important, especially now when the world is so grim. Every field is now about compromise, and I want to fight against that." Ford pauses. "Of course, right now might not have been exactly the right moment to fight that battle. But what can you do? Let's just hope we don't have another collapse of the studio system."
Traditionally, luxury items are hit hard in a recession, and in the weeks following the attack on the World Trade Center, no one in America wanted to buy much of anything, let alone a Gucci handbag. Even if a customer had the cash, shopping seemed frivolous when so many had lost their lives or their loved ones. Prada, another luxury brand, indefinitely put off its long-scheduled I.P.O. and suspended construction of a store in Hong Kong. Fear of flying brought tourism to a virtual halt, and luxury strongholds like Hawaii and Las Vegas were severely hit. Sales of perfume, which is the fuel of the fashion industry -- a scent costs pennies to produce and, unlike a handbag or a suit, is affordable and never goes out of style -- were drastically affected by the downturn in travel. Duty-free shops in international airports account for half of all perfume sales and, in the wake of Sept. 11, they canceled orders. Similarly panicked by the expected downturn in their business, department stores like Bergdorf Goodman also tore up their outstanding fall orders, leaving prominent designers like Comme des Garcons and Christian Lacroix with clothes en route to New York without a buyer in sight. Domenico De Sole, Gucci's chairman and chief executive, successfully fought their Neiman Marcus cancellations, insisting that the stores honor their commitments, but less powerful brands were turned away.
Financial analysts were unwilling to be doomsayers, but, privately, they voiced concerns that luxury brands, with their imprimatur of status, would be a hard sell in this new, suddenly austere climate. "But I am trying to remain optimistic," says an analyst at Merrill Lynch, who is unwilling to be named for fear of sounding pessimistic. "Because if I sound like doom and gloom, then it may be a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you say no one is shopping, then no one will shop. And I do think that if any brand will endure, it will be Gucci. They have created brand loyalty, and Tom Ford is a brilliant designer."
De Sole is trying to remain optimistic too. "The situation in the United States is difficult," he says, "but we are a global brand, and sales in Europe and Japan are stable. The only question is, what will happen if there are more attacks or further worldwide economic and political deterioration?" 
Remarkably, despite an overall downturn in domestic retail spending, YSL has sold like crazy, posting a 157 percent increase over the same period last year. Gucci was down significantly, but, then, they didn't have YSL's secret weapon, the shirt of the season: the YSL gypsy peasant blouse, with puffy sleeves in purple silk for $2,500. The shirt is a classic illustration of why Ford has been so successful. The blouse is festive and sexy and oddly familiar, since it is a reworked version of the rich hippie look that Yves Saint Laurent made popular in the 70's. On Sept. 11, the YSL store on Madison Avenue received more than 40 calls asking when it was opening and if the shirt would be available. 
"I'm very aware of the need to create a piece that will sell," explains Ford, displaying the businesslike manner that separates him from other designers. "I was happy when I realized that that shirt was fabulous and it looked good on almost everybody and it probably was going to be the right price. I have always believed that fashion has a purpose. It's created to be used, to be worn, to be sold."
After the Sept. 11 attacks, all the remaining shows of Fashion Week were canceled. American designers invited small groups of buyers and editors into their studios, and there was speculation that the shows in Milan and Paris would be similarly streamlined. "I didn't think of not having those shows," Ford said, a week after the attacks. "But it was hard to think about the show, because after Sept. 11, who cares? That was my mood in New York, but I felt very differently when I landed in London five days later. In Europe, they're upset, but they lived through World War II. They've had their share of horrific acts. And then I thought, This is not the moment to go into a dark, minimalist fog.
"I did, however, revamp the Gucci show. I had been working on girls coming down from poles and lap-dancing the audience. Obviously, I had to dilute that concept. And I had these little worker jackets, and if you looked at them the wrong way they could have been seen as Afghan jackets, but we put one on a girl that looked like the 60's model Verushka and called it the Verushka jacket, so that took the emphasis away from Afghanistan."
Ford pauses. "I've thought about this a lot," he continues, "and going dark is not the answer. Fashion is more than just clothes -- if you include the growing of crops to make fabric, the manufacturing and all the stores, it's the biggest business in the world. And luxury brands set the standard. More than ever, I think this is a time for beauty."
Even if this is a rationalization, it paints the right picture. Which is important. Christmas is on the way, traditionally the biggest shopping time of the year. If this holiday season is a disaster, Gucci will be hurt. Since Sept. 11, stores like Barneys New York and Bergdorf Goodman have been virtually deserted, and the marking down of merchandise began early, in the first weeks of November. While retail sales rallied in October, that was mostly good news for only the discount stores like Wal-Mart. LVMH sales dropped 5 percent in October. 
On Sept. 16, Domenico De Sole flew to Italy, where Gucci has its headquarters, to address the factory workers outside Florence. "I bring everyone to the cafeteria," explains De Sole, over breakfast at the Ritz Hotel in Paris in mid-October. "I do this every quarter to explain our company's financial results. These workers have been with Gucci forever -- 30 years or more -- and they remember when the company was broke in 1994. But even then they were not as worried as they are now."
De Sole is calm, direct, seemingly unflappable. This morning, he is, as always, elegantly dressed in a dark blue suit, and he has the eagle-eyed manner of an interested host who has both the guest at the door and the meal in the oven on his mind. Throughout his career, De Sole has been consistently underestimated, and this misperception has served him well. When, in 1999, Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, whose empire includes Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Givenchy, thought it would be simple to capture Gucci by buying up it stock (which is publicly traded), De Sole surprised him by allying with Francois Pinault, whose assets include Christie's auction house, Converse sneakers and Samsonite luggage.
The LVMH-Gucci power struggle was particularly nasty, even by fashion-world standards. "The fight went on and on and on," Ford says. "It was very distracting. But the LVMH battle reaffirmed how important the company was to me and Domenico."
On Sept. 10, after two years of steady fighting, Gucci Group and LVMH reached a final agreement at a court in the Netherlands. It was an arranged stock deal, with Pinault's company, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, paying $94 a share for 40 percent of LVMH's stake in Gucci. LVMH made more than $200 million on the transaction; De Sole protected his minority shareholders, many of whom are factory workers who have been given options over the years, and he flew to America for the YSL store opening, relieved that the deal was finally signed.
"I went, 'Ahhh, it's done,' " De Sole recalls, taking a bite of pink grapefruit. "Things will be easy now." He sighs. "But nothing with this company is ever easy." 
Founded in 1921, Gucci has withstood internecine battles among family members, the 1995 murder of Maurizio Gucci arranged by his ex-wife, the megalicensing of the name and cheapening of the brand to raise money (remember Gucci toilet paper?) and the sale of the company to Investcorp, an international investment bank. De Sole, who was born in Italy and received his law degree at Harvard, had been Maurizio Gucci's lawyer, and in 1995, Investcorp named him C.E.O., assigning him the seemingly insurmountable job of fattening up Gucci so they could sell it. 
"That is when Tom" -- Ford was a junior designer at Gucci at the time -- and I forged our bond," De Sole explains. "Maurizio wanted me to fire Tom. Instead, I gave him Gucci to design. I saw that Tom, like me, is a maniac. We're totally determined. But, I must admit, on Sept. 10, when the LVMH deal was finished, I thought, I'm going to have so much time on my hands because the war is over. And then, it's Sept. 11, and a new war begins." He pauses. "But what are you going to do about it? Cry? That doesn't work. That's not my job. I'm responsible for 10,000 people, and I can't be crying."
Following the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, a rumor began circulating in financial circles that the deal between LVMH, P.P.R. and Gucci was not going to go through as scheduled. During the week of Sept. 17, while the world was in a state of shock and mourning, money managers, counting on disasters, were shorting Gucci stock. They assumed that Sept. 11 would invalidate the LVMH agreement. By Sept. 20, the Gucci stock price had fallen from $82 to $62, the lowest it has been in five years.
On Sept. 25, when Gucci Group released its second-quarter financial results, there was more bad news: the yearly revenue projections, because of the events of Sept. 11, were lowered from $2.45 billion to less than $2.4 billion. But even with the adjustment, there were analysts who thought Gucci's projections were just best guesses, and perhaps a bit rosy. "No one knows what's going to happen next in the world," Paola Durante of Merrill Lynch told Women's Wear Daily. "This is a difficult situation for all luxury-goods companies that rely on tourists for at least some of their income."
On Sept. 26, The Financial Times hinted that the LVMH-P.P.R.-Gucci agreement would not be enforceable, and De Sole erupted. "It's very simple," he told the paper. "If those guys don't pay, I'll cut their expletive off and sue the hell out of them for specific performance." By the end of the week, with the deal signed, Gucci's stock price rebounded to $85, where it has pretty much stayed.
The fashion business is particularly ill equipped to adjust to abrupt shifts in the cultural mood. A collection is designed nearly eight months before it hits the stores. Although Ford studies sales patterns and is highly aware of shopping trends, no one could have anticipated something as cataclysmic as Sept. 11.
"The last months have been very difficult," De Sole told me. "But you must have a long-term view. I believe there will also be opportunities now. The price of real estate is going down. A lot of brands are not going to be advertising, and each page in a magazine will now become more visible." He pauses and takes a sip of coffee. "My view is that, in the end, people don't change. They still want beautiful things. They may buy less, but, long-term, consumers will consume."
It's a Thursday afternoon in late September, and Tom Ford is doing the final edit on the coming spring Gucci show, which will be held in Milan in 10 days. He is in his office in London, which is decorated in 70's-style minimalist boy tech -- brown leather sofa, a dark brown fur carpet, a white desk with a white chair and silver bits accessorizing here and there. It is the prototype for a half-dozen other Tom Ford offices scattered around the globe. It is also remarkably similar to the decor of the Gucci stores and Ford's own homes. They even smell the same. Figuier, a Diptyque candle that fills the room with the aroma of figs, follows Ford around the planet.
This studied, controlled universality is emblematic of Ford's design and business philosophy. "Tom has a global vision," says Carine Roitfeld, the editor of French Vogue and a stylist for Gucci from1995 until last year. "Tom is artistic, but he has such a strong business side, and that is very rare. For most designers, it's the cut of a jacket. With Tom, it's the cut of the jacket and all the accouterments. He thinks about the car the woman drives, the kind of place she likes to live, how she likes to have sex. Tom considers all these things when he thinks about Gucci or YSL or any of the new companies he has acquired." 
Ford and Gucci Group have been canny in their acquisitions, especially with the designers, who are all promotable personalities, with strong identities and talent. Stella McCartney has, perhaps, one of the 10 most famous fathers in the world and knows how to design skinny pants and pearl-encrusted bustiers for the Gwyneth Paltrow set. Alexander McQueen combines a gift for flamboyant presentation, expert tailoring and a skinhead bad-boy reputation that has made him notorious in his native London. And Nicolas Ghesquiere is the most gifted new designer to emerge in years. His ability to reawaken Balenciaga, a great but moribund fashion house, is reminiscent of Ford's success at Gucci. Ghesquiere has everything: beauty, commercial sense and an ability to create clothes that are unexpected and, yet, absolutely of this moment.
Just as Ford prides himself on having high-end mass taste, being able to pick the shoe or purse that will be a best seller, he is careful in Gucci Group's investment choices. The designers have to be stars or, at least, have star potential. While Gucci Group quietly gave money to Hussein Chalayan, a reclusive fashion designer whose brilliant shows are really performance-art events, Ford ultimately decided that he did not want to take on a designer who creates tables that turn into dresses. Ford may think Chalayan is a thrilling conceptualist, but he is also aware of his unmarketability -- he refuses to be photographed, for one thing -- and chose not to bankroll his company. 
Ghesquiere is that rare breed of designer who is able to create the handbag every fashion insider craves (last fall's slouchy leather satchel with lariats and buckles) and win every award, while never appearing in a gossip column. Meanwhile, McCartney designed Madonna's wedding dress last year and the whole world got the news.
"At some point," Ford explains, "we had to have more than one brand. It's the natural evolution of this company. The process was accelerated when LVMH tried to buy us, but at a certain point, the Gucci brand will reach its maximum growth potential."
Even though they sensed a change in shopping habits pre-World Trade Center, Ford and De Sole have consistently believed that big, bigger, biggest is the only strategy for Gucci Group. "Big is better because you can save enormous costs," Ford maintains. "Globalization may be a dirty word right now, but it is inevitable. You can't hold back a gigantic movement. And big is better because you have synergies that can work. Alexander McQueen can have a beautiful new store in Milan that he could not have had on his own. Nicolas Ghesquiere can now manufacture the shoes he couldn't get produced last season. Stella McCartney will have a perfume in the stores much faster than she would have before. At Gucci Group, we can almost control production because we give the factories so much business that they will work for us first. Department stores will give us more floor space, and we can buy advertising in bulk. The bigger you are, the more power you can wield." Ford pauses. "Unless," he continues, "everyone stops shopping." 
Historically, war has been good for fashion. During World War II, embargoes on foreign goods and travel created the American designer fashion business. Before that, Americans just knocked off European designs, but beginning in 1942, designers like Pauline Trigere, Norman Norell and Claire McCardell rose to prominence in New York. Until then (and, frankly, after then), high style was seen as the province of the French, with a few Italians mixed in for variety. Many believed that World War II officially ended when Christian Dior showed his "New Look" dresses in Paris in 1947. His opulent, full skirts took yards and yards of fabric and were considered a return to the luxuries that had been rationed during the war.
During the 60's, while she should have worn American, Jackie Kennedy dreamed of dressing like Audrey Hepburn, who wore Hubert de Givenchy. When she was scolded for buying foreign, she had her dressmakers copy the lines of his gowns. The Vietnam conflict had no effect on consumerism in America, and in the 70's, Yves Saint Laurent became the designer to wear, or to copy. It wasn't until the 80's, when Ralph Lauren created his haute-WASP universe and Calvin Klein emblazoned his name on underwear, that American designers became as famous in their own country as their foreign counterparts. Their names, however, did not export well -- despite their huge domestic success, Lauren and Klein have never had global success. Their sensibility did not translate overseas.
"The truth is, Americans are afraid of style," Ford says. "We are descended from Puritans, and it is still in our culture. You can put an American woman and a French woman in the same clothes, and the French woman will just look different. The French woman's hair will, perhaps, not be as clean. She'll tie her scarf in a different way. She'll stand differently. But she'll look chic. The American woman will be too clean. That's the Puritanical strain. And too clean is not sexy."
This is, perhaps, why Ford has been so successful. He has married two worlds, grafting a Euro sensibility on a solid American base. He's then taken that image and sent it out globally. With Gucci and, now, with YSL, it is a subtle meshing of worlds that sells Ford's brands. In Japan, they buy Gucci because it seems American. In America, they buy Gucci because it seems exotic, but not too exotic. In his advertising, Ford knows how to sell sex that is provocative enough to seem European and yet polished enough to appeal to Americans. "That was the whole idea behind a global vision," explains Ford. "But now, and even before Sept. 11, the positive spin is off globalization. I still feel it is inevitable. I'm not saying I like globalization or I don't like globalization, but I think the generation under me -- people in their 20's -- know nothing else. To them, the world is the Net. They are exposed to exactly the same things at the same time, and that creates a new culture in which, all over the world, people want the same things in their lives at the same time. At Gucci, we capitalized on that."
Ford pauses. "I think, perhaps, we now need to reinterpret globalization. It can also mean that everyone wants to look different at exactly the same moment. Now, I'm exploring how we could come out with limited-edition stores and merchandise. For instance, our handbags at Gucci have increased 22 percent this year, but we don't have an icon handbag, one handbag that is our signature. We have 10 top-selling bags and then we have 20 right below it that also sell strongly. What this tells us is that the Gucci customer doesn't want the same bag as her friend. So if the company can figure out how to personalize everything, that may be the key to our business in the future."
This is a smart strategy, smarter still for the fact that Ford said, more or less, the same thing before the World Trade Center collapsed. Now that he has created this jet-set world, he's going to turn down the volume and let the Gucci customer define herself a little. It will still be Gucci, but it won't scream Gucci. This is how a brand evolves: it starts out loud and then gets quieter. Of course, Ford can always make it loud again.
The problem is that a limited-edition handbag is still an unnecessary purchase, and, post-Sept. 11, the luxury customer in America may be afraid to buy anything that seems decadent, even if it is personalized decadence. Ford is aware that terrorist activity can be viewed as an outgrowth of globalization, a wish to rid the world of materialistic Western impulses and imagery. "I don't want to sound callous," Ford says, "but if you don't want to let the terrorists defeat us, have that extra piece of cake and third drink." Ford smiles. "All of us feel a sense of transformation, but into what, I'm not sure. Would you buy a big car right now? I doubt it. But it's hard to judge how far and how long this mood will linger. People want to be soothed. And when words fail, I think beauty can fill the void. Anything with edge feels wrong right now, but I doubt that will last. The fashion world thrives on irony and bitchiness and meanness. This attack is making people sincere. I'm not sure that will be good for fashion." Ford laughs, but he is not really joking.
Tom Ford, as he will tell you again and again, is a Virgo. He defines himself through his astrological sign, beginning sentences with "As a Virgo . . . " or ending them with: "What can I say? I'm a Virgo." Virgos are, according to Ford, determined, organized, compulsive, creative and unable to sleep. Ford, like many in the fashion world, assumes that everyone is consistent with their signs of the zodiac. "We're both Virgos," Stella McCartney says of Ford. "As long as we don't work with each other, it's fine." Carine Roitfeld says: "Oh, yes. Tom and I are both Virgos. That can be very good, or very bad."
Ford says: "As a Virgo, I am focused, but I always have an exit plan. In a hotel room. Here. Everywhere. That's why I don't sleep." It's mid-July, before the world went crazy, and Ford is standing in an upstairs studio on the Rue Boissiere in Paris, surrounded by 20 nearly naked male and female dancers. It is a moment from the recent past, the pre-Sept. 11 universe of lavish perfume launch parties and galas celebrating a designer's celebrity friends who are, of course, photographed in the designer's clothes. Pre-Sept. 11, the fashion world thrived on this sort of publicity -- it fed the jet-set image of the brand.
Scents are particularly important to the success of a house and, pre-Sept. 11 -- he wouldn't do this now -- Ford needed a way to promote YSL's new perfume, called Nu, which means nude in French, so he decided to stage a kind of stylized orgy as the centerpiece of the YSL perfume launch party. The ad for Nu is a tangle of male and female body parts and, as always, Ford is thematic in his approach. Right now, he's trying to decide whether the dancers should wear underwear of some sort to cover their genitals when they writhe around on top of one another. "Body grooming will be done," says Kevin Krier, who is coordinating the production. Ford nods. "People look best naked," he says, tilting his head and staring hard at the dancers. "But if some of the guys get excited. . . . "
It is decided that YSL will provide specially designed flesh-colored thongs, even though Ford really wants the dancers to be completely bare in the spirit of his scent. He looks exhausted, but this launch is important. YSL has a worldwide sales goal for Nu of 100 million, and the scent could introduce YSL to a mass audience. Ford is wearing his usual uniform of jeans and a half-unbuttoned white shirt, but he looks as if he'd like to take a nap, if he could only fall asleep. It has been a particularly hectic week. Last Sunday, he showed his YSL men's collection. Before Gucci Group purchased YSL, the men's division was overseen by Hedi Slimane, a gifted designer who became known for his narrow-cut suits. After only two seasons, Slimane was heralded as the first important new men's-wear designer, and his suits, which were too skinny and stylized for most men (although the ever-fashion-forward Brad Pitt was married in a custom Slimane suit), often sold to chic women, like the fashion bellwether Madonna.
When Gucci Group bought YSL for $1 billion, there was an outcry in Paris. "The French love Mr. Saint Laurent," says Roitfeld, the editor of French Vogue. "And the French were, and continue to be, very mean to Tom. Saint Laurent is a part of French history. Even now, when his collection is not as good, he's a symbol for the whole country. As an American -- it was very risky for Tom to take over Saint Laurent."
Slimane did not want to work under Ford and accepted a deal from LVMH to design the Christian Dior men's collection. Pierre Berge, Yves Saint Laurent's longtime partner, decided to embrace Slimane and LVMH as a way of announcing his anti-Gucci Group stance. "They were awful to Tom," McCartney says. "Paris is the city of fashion. They take their fashion very seriously, and the Parisians hate this Gucci power mogul for ousting their king."
In a rare public appearance, Saint Laurent -- the master himself -- showed up at Slimane's first show last year. Saint Laurent embraced Slimane after the show, as if they were old friends. "I think that was the first moment they met," Ford sniffs. 
But it worked for LVMH and Berge: the kiss made every newspaper, and Ford was seen as the avatar of anticultural globalism out to destroy nothing less than a master of French couture.
Ford was upset by the blah reviews of his men's wear for spring -- and the raves for Slimane. "You put your personality out there and then they slam it," he says now, still studying the dancers as they intertwine to some slow electronic music. "I don't wear my heart on my sleeve, and people feel that I don't agonize, that I make it look easy. But making things look easy is one of the hardest things in the whole world." Ford pauses, noticing that one dancer does not seem to be moving with the rest. "I don't believe in being one of the those people who, when you ask them how they are, says, 'Terrible,' " Ford continues. "You should always say, 'I'm great.' But, then, I'm a Virgo. And I have so much to do. I can't let these things impact me for more than a day."
Monday, the day after his show, Ford flew to Florence to edit the early spring collection for Gucci. On Tuesday evening, he left for London, where he had design meetings for two days. He came back to Paris for a series of YSL meetings, specifically focusing on Nu and the cosmetics line. "The first thing I did when I arrived at Yves Saint Laurent in May of 2000 was the Opium ad," Ford explains. "I wanted to reintroduce that perfume and immediately set the idea for my YSL woman, even before I'd designed any clothes."
That first ad was classic Tom Ford: a voluptuous woman, very pale, lies naked, seemingly drunk on some heady combination of sex, alcohol and, of course, opium (the perfume, naturally). "The YSL woman is about excess," Ford says, as the dancers illustrate his point. "She eats too much, she drinks too much, she smokes, she has sex. She's lush. The Gucci woman -- you know what she wants, you know what she's after. The Saint Laurent woman -- she's going to torture you a little bit. You might have sex, but she will drip a little hot wax on you first. This," he continues, waving his hand at the dancers, "is a more decadent world. It's refined, but very rough."
And, if that strategy fails, there's always YSL blue, which is not exactly blue really, but a bluish shade of violet. Ford appears to be branding this label by color. Violet is the hue he favored in the last collection and the shade of the Nu perfume bottle. These dancers will be in a 30-foot glass container, and they will be bathed in blue light. The invitations for the party are the same shade, and the ads for YSL are predominantly filtered with blue tones. "I like the pinky, sexy flesh in the middle of all that cobalt," Ford says.
That is also the palette for the Nu ads, which would not be altered after Sept. 11. The ads are sexy, but not overtly decadent. They hint at an orgy, which, Ford believes, is always an attractive notion. "I think we should make the pillows blue," says Ford, as he prepares to leave the dance studio for another appointment. Kevin Krier makes a note. "Blue pillows," he repeats, "but is anyone really going to see anything other than gorgeous naked bodies?" Ford smiles. "People always take in more than you think," he says.
Three months later, after the world Trade Center disaster, Ford has not changed his view of the YSL woman. "There's a vocabulary for every brand," he says. "And the vocabulary for YSL -- sexy, mysterious, strong- still works after a terrorist attack." Ford even sounds confident about Nu reaching its projected financial goal. "That's going to be tough," he acknowledges. "I had a fragrance meeting yesterday, and there are real concerns with regards to the duty-free shops. Travel retailing has been greatly affected by Sept. 11, but we have to keep designing products. And, even more than before, the clothes or the bag or the scent has to be potent. A dull plain shirt doesn't mean anything right now. In an economy like this, people buy clothes like they're accessories. A jacket needs to do this and do that and be completely potent. If I'm in a design meeting and I'm bored, the customer's going to be bored. There's so much stuff in the world, I have to find a way to attract people." Ford laughs. "Now all I have to do is translate that mentality into key pieces. That's what I'm concentrating on for the YSL spring show next week. I'm a Virgo -- I'm happiest when I have a plan."
Richard Buckley, the editor of Vogue Hommes International and Ford's romantic partner for the past 15 years, says: "Tom has always been steady and determined. On our first date, when Tom was just a design assistant for Cathy Hardwick's" -- a midprice American sportswear company -- I asked him what he wanted to do. Tom said: 'Well, in 10 years, I'm going to be a millionaire, and I'll be showing in Paris because it's the center of global fashion. And I'll change the business like Ralph Lauren did, but not in the States.' I thought, Poor naive kid, but Tom accomplished all that, and more, in nine years."
When I bring this up with Ford, he says: "It sounds very cocky and egotistical, but, yes, absolutely, as a child, I knew I would be successful at whatever I did. Virgos are very focused. All my life, whatever is in front of me gets my undivided attention. And Virgos are very confident. That blind confidence propelled me as a child."
Growing up in Santa Fe, N.M., Ford was restless. His parents were partners in a real-estate-development business, but Ford was more ambitious than his father. "I remember when I graduated from high school, I was very depressed, and my father said: 'Who cares? You won't even remember this day,' " Ford says. "He is the opposite of me. As a child, I always wanted more. I wanted this, I wanted that. I was probably awful."
In 1979, when he was 17, Ford moved to New York to attend N.Y.U. and pursue an acting career. At one time, he had 12 national advertisements running simultaneously, but when the hairstylist on a Prell commercial told him that he would lose his hair, Ford quit acting. He switched to Parsons School of Design and studied interior design and fashion. In 1990, after jobs with Hardwick and Perry Ellis, he was hired by Dawn Mello, then the creative director of Gucci. "I knew he could do anything," Mello says. "Tom is just one of those people who grabs you."
The rest is the stuff of fashion history. From his second show in 1995, Ford turned Gucci into the brand of the decade. "I was skeptical," recalls Roitfeld, who was key to the Gucci look in advertising. "In 1994, Tom came to ask if I would work on his first campaign. I thought Gucci was a bit old for me. The loafers and all. But Tom was so beautiful, so charismatic, so sexy, that I thought, I must work with him."
The fashion-conscious agreed. Over the years, Ford has given the world velvet hip-huggers, fringed and beaded jeans, rhinestone encrusted jackets and any number of slinky gowns. He dressed Helen Hunt in Jackiesque pale blue satin when she won her Academy Award and befriended Hollywood wives like Rita Wilson (married to Tom Hanks) and celebrities by the dozen. They loved that he looked like a movie star and made them look like movie stars.
But by 1998, Ford wanted to dream a new dream. After 8 years at Gucci, he had played out his 10-year plan. "I had the life I wished for as a child," he says. "I had hit it. And then I thought: Is this really it? Should I quit?" He talked to Stella McCartney about taking over Gucci, but her unwillingness to design fur or leather goods made hiring her an impossibility. He thought about abandoning fashion altogether and directing a movie, which he views as "the ultimate design project."
"I started planning my exit," Ford recalls. "I'm a Virgo. I bought a house in L.A. I started spending more time there. I read scripts. But, then, LVMH happened, and we bought YSL, and the business got interesting again."
Ford pauses. "But I think you do have to be realistic about age," he continues. "We are all a product of our times, and there's a window for us to do certain things. Right now, I'm 40, which is the age of our customer. My generation is the world now. But our window is sliding, and you can't hang on when what you do is no longer valid. As a designer, it's a struggle, a constant struggle, to stay current. I grew up watching 'I Dream of Jeannie' and they didn't. Things that seem hollow and shallow to me seem normal to them. I can't do this forever. At some point, I'll be picking the shoe that only the people over 50 will pick."
Ford stops a second. "And there's Sept. 11. . . . " His voice trails off for a moment. "Actually, there's a little bit of challenge in that for me. It makes everything more difficult, and difficulties are exhausting, but they can force you to think harder." Ford laughs. "As if I needed another thing to keep me up at night."
It's 5 p.m. on Oct. 10, three days after the United States began bombing in Afghanistan, and a shrunken version of the international fashion world -- press, photographers and very few buyers -- are gathered on the steps of the Cite Internationale Universitaire de Paris waiting for the showing of the Yves Saint Laurent spring collection for 2002. Anna Wintour, the editor of American Vogue, has flown back to America, and only Barneys, Bloomingdale's and Henri Bendel have sent representatives to shop. The Japanese, an important market for YSL, are not traveling, and, in three days, the elaborate black custom-built YSL pavilion, which is the size of a small opera house, is being put on a boat and traveling to Tokyo. On Nov. 28, Ford will show the entire spring collection again, with the same models, the same makeup, music, the works, for the Japanese. "It's very, very important," says Mark Lee, president of YSL, who has just greeted Jonathan Newhouse, the head of Conde Nast International, in front of the YSL house. "Tom has to go to Japan and explain the position of the brand. That's critical for YSL. We have to secure that business."
Today, the mood among the remaining fashion flock is a mix of nervousness and somberness. Normally, the editors and writers are like high-school seniors -- cliquish and superior and deeply concerned with who is wearing what and what could they be thinking. And if this is high school, then the designers are the cute boys. The fashion flock angles to get an audience with Tom, Stella or Nicola (which is the insider nickname of Ghesquiere). They dress to dazzle the designers, who are the ruling bodies of this galaxy.
Today, in their post-Sept. 11 mood, the fashion press appears becalmed. With some startling and welcome exceptions (Isabella Blow, a fashion muse to a number of designers, in a sequined sheath, Hamish Bowles of Vogue in a lavender shirt), they seem to be dressed for a stylish funeral. Heels are sensible, makeup is pale and the talk is not of handbags but of which Parisian doctor is willing to write Cipro prescriptions.
Francois Pinault and his wife, who is carrying a large brown Hermes alligator Kelly bag (a small scandal since it is not a brand her husband owns) arrive and, like the rest of the audience, make their way through security. There have been X-ray machines and metal detectors at other shows, but YSL has only three armed, but stylishly dressed, men inspecting purses and asking for photo ID.
Backstage, past the racks of clothes and the girls having their hair blown straight, Ford, dressed in his usual jeans and shirt, is scrutinizing a model. She is wearing a sheer leopard-print blouse with a beautiful hand-laced leather skirt that sits low, on the top of her hipbone. The skirt is tan and has an artisany feel, as if a hippie craftsman sold it in his shop in San Francisco in 1975, except this particular hippie used a fine glove leather and had a refined sense of tailoring. "I think women want something that feels touched by human hands," Ford says. This will become his mantra for the spring "African" collection: "Clothing needs a sense of authenticity in this climate. It's my job as a designer to strip away the artifice and give women something that feels touched by human hands."
It's fashionspeak and, like all fashionspeak, it works for only those willing to believe. And yet, it is somehow comforting to hear Ford talk about style as if the world were not turning into a battlefield. "I'm really disappointed that Anna Wintour left Paris," Ford said, taking a short break in a small curtained-off, backstage area that, yes, looks exactly like a miniversion of one of his offices. "And the buyers should have come. The stores said they didn't want their people to get stranded. Well, then, we have to take the collection to New York. I guess it is O.K. for us to get stranded." 
Ford smiles tightly. "I should shut up," he says. He looks even more exhausted than usual. He returned from Milan 10 days ago. "I changed the Gucci collection," he says. "I took away some things that were inspired by New Mexico, that had naked girls taken from velvet paintings and from the sides of vans. And I changed the presentation. I lowered the runway and I put pink flowers in the lobby. I changed the music to Peter Frampton's remix of 'Baby, I Love Your Way,' which is one of my favorite songs ever. And I think it really worked."
Gucci received positive reviews, and Ford is already planning the new advertising campaign, which will not be as overtly sexual as this season's, which featured an out-all-night party girl with her hand in the crotch of her zippered pants. This spring's Gucci girl will be a strong warrior type. "A survivor," Ford explains. "I think that's right for now. Even for six months from now."
Stephano Pilati, Ford's chief YSL assistant, interrupts with a question about an animal-print caftan that will be shown tonight. They decide that it should be worn with a certain bag. "I love this collection," Ford says. "And it didn't change after Sept. 11." He takes a sip of water. "The point of a fashion show is to convince the world that your way is the only way," he says. "When the audience leaves that room, they should think that there is only one way to dress, only one way to look, and that's the way I want to be. Sept. 11 hasn't changed my mind about fashion. I am still egotistical. I still want to say, 'The world should look like this.' "
Ford laughs. His show is going to start in 20 minutes, and he has to work. "But I also know that timing is everything. You have to know the right moment. And, tonight, at this moment, it's a time for beauty. I think people who say fashion is trivial are wrong. I was reading somewhere that World War II was the end of frivolity, not the end of gaiety. Beauty has its own power. And I think this collection is so beautiful." Ford gets up to go. "I love this collection," he repeats, "and I hope I'm not wrong."
Outside, the audience is waiting, wrapped in YSL blue light beaming from above. The room has been sprayed with Nu, and De Sole is standing to get a better view of the collection, which he has not seen. The music begins -- I Put a Spell on You," sung by Bryan Ferry -- and a succession of leopard-print chiffons and hand-stitched leathers make their way down the runway. The show is what Ford does best, an amalgamation of different styles -- some vintage YSL (the animal prints), some counterculture 70's (the crisscross hand-stitching on leather) and some zeitgeist (a military feel which adds strength to the shapes). The show has strong individual pieces -- a leather skirt with metal rings going up the side and a brown saddlebag that loops across the body, gaucho style, seem instantly desirable. There is something very Tom Ford about mass-producing garments that are supposed to look handcrafted. It's a clever way to assuage the guilt of consumerism -- something hand-stitched feels earthy and wholesome, rather than slick and designy.
After the show, there is applause, and an enthusiastic line forms backstage to congratulate Ford, who has changed into a black YSL suit. When he spies De Sole, they hug and disappear into the inner mini office. "I thought it was amazing," De Sole exclaims, leaving to go to dinner. Ford has to stay. He has interviews to do, the message of human hands to get across. "Now," he repeats to the 10th television reporter, "more than ever, there is a need for beauty in the world. Later Ford says: "I hope they believe me. I think we should all cry for beauty. That may be the only way to get through this."

HEADLINE: A Plunge into the Present 

BYLINE:  By Ron Suskind; Ron Suskind is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and the author of "A Hope in the Unseen."

 BODY:
Ruben Dican adjusts the television, as everyone waits. A picture comes into focus. It's Bryant Gumbel. There's a shot of United Flight 175 ramming the south tower. Then it's run again. And again.
 It is Sept. 12, and 22 men, women and children sit, rapt, at the end of the earth. They've never actually seen a skyscraper. Or a Bryant Gumbel. Or a plane, other than the tiny ones that infrequently alight on a grassy strip near the volcano. 
 Yet they watch. An older man peers out from behind a door. Children, past their bedtime, sit on the floor in a daze. Their parents study the flickering images, perplexed. Are those people living in the same world as we are? 
Twenty-five years ago, the inhabitants of Babuyan Claro, a tiny, unapproachable island that lies a hundred miles of churning Pacific north of the Philippine mainland, were animistic and without written language. Called the Ibatan, they lived in almost total isolation for much of the 19th and 20th centuries, a quirk of ocean currents, geography and fate. In just over two decades, since the arrival of a pair of headstrong, freewheeling missionaries, they have raced up man's 5,000-year developmental arc, embracing monotheism, free enterprise and CNN. They have evaluated each step with the fresh, appraising eyes of the arriviste. 
Familiar accouterments have lately fallen into place: knockoffs of Fila shorts and Nike T-shirts (worn lovingly into faded crepe) have been acquired from passing fishing boats; new babies are being called Joe and Russell, Americanizing the mostly Iberian names that spread across native populations when the Spanish colonized this region in the 1600's; the metallic light of the television flickers tonight across a rare, upstairs room in the island's nicest home, a simple two-story box with carved mahogany trellises, cement floors and running water from faucets.
Since the 40-year-old Ruben Dican, the wealthiest man on the four-mile wide atoll, got a satellite dish a few weeks ago, his house has become the local megaplex. A quietly cheerful man who has grown portly on an island where life's rigors keep almost everyone slim, Ruben is one of the few English speakers here. Since most of the 54-channel selection is from the United States, he must also act as a translator of strange words and even stranger images. 
"It feels like we are rushing forward, trying to decide what to keep of the modern world and what to throw away, while not losing hold of what has given us life and happiness for all time," he says, softly, in his halting, precise English, before his attention is drawn away by Lisa Beamer, who is talking about the last call from her husband, Todd, before he fought the hijackers. Everyone watches. 
"It seems so real, the pictures," Ruben murmurs, "sometimes more real than our own lives."
It was nothing more than a coincidence that I was on my way to Babuyan to examine the accelerated development of its society on the very day that the United States was attacked. Later, when I returned home, I learned that the shock and bewilderment the Ibatan registered was not so different from what was felt in a lot of other places. I also came to understand that what I found on the island, away from the television set, was a kind of microcosm of what the world was suddenly fighting over -- not simply West versus East or Judeo-Christian versus Islam, but the very idea of modernity and what constitutes human progress.
Many on Babuyan still remember the "before time," when there was a settled egalitarianism rather than every-man-for-himself enterprise, when no one here knew that the Ibatan were poor in a world of vast wealth. Within their tiny civilization of 1,400 people, you can see so clearly the effects of modernity and measure what is gained against what has been lost. And in the person of Ruben Dican, the richest and most modernized figure on the island, you can see the struggle to manage a problem that is new to them, but quite familiar to the rest of the world: the divide between haves and have-nots.
The story of the Ibatan starts in the late 1860's, when a nameless, Malay-Polynesian tribe was swept off course in a typhoon and steered their outrigger toward a single point of hope, a 4,000-foot volcano poking up from the horizon. They discovered an island enveloped by treacherous rocks. It's a place you wreck onto, which is what they did, seven of them, demolishing their vessel and becoming castaways. Exploring the dense jungles, with wild pigs, pythons, monitor lizards and strange, large-footed chickens, they found remnants of ancient structures and burial urns, with bones and artifacts.
From these relics, the Ibatan would develop their own brand of mysticism: the island, they came to believe, was occupied by a community of "invisibles," wise, unseen inhabitants who were custodians of the flora and fauna, the winds and tides. From this vision grew a theology, replete with ritual offerings, shamanic cures and burial rites, all directed toward the ideal of machitonos, the Ibatan word for "balance" or "harmony."
A few other shipwrecks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries added hybrid vigor to the gene pool, and a discrete language evolved, with several names for each of six winds, shaded terms for hundreds of varieties of plants and no words for war, envy, jealousy, property, buy, sell or own.
The Ibatan passed the decades in a kind of serenity. Though they did dispense with a few unlucky visitors, they were otherwise peaceful. They wore clothes of pounded bark and found herbal remedies in python gallbladders. Their world evolved with a gentle, premodern rhythm -- until the day, in 1977, when a 29-year-old missionary named Rundell Maree slipped off a boat into the water, carrying his shortwave radio overhead, and scraped his way across the rocks toward shore.
Rundell had come to advance the mandate of the Wycliffe Bible Translators, also known as SIL International (derived from its original name, Summer Institute of Linguistics). The organization sends missionaries trained in linguistics to the most remote corners of the world, places that do not yet have written language, a concept first developed by the Sumerians more than 5,000 years ago. Their mission is to construct a written language from an ancient spoken tongue, teach the indigenous population to read, translate the entire New Testament (and portions of the Old) into the people's "mother tongue" and then give copies to one and all. They say this is the best way to spread God's word.
But that was a long way off for Rundell. First, he had to just coexist with the Ibatan, a task he approached with characteristic Western confidence. He fancied himself a survivor and citizen of the world, having moved through childhood from his birthplace in Rhodesia, to England, Canada, then Bible college and a graduate theology degree in California, before catching the itinerant crosswind of a missionary's life.
He was the only Caucasian most islanders had ever seen, and in his first two years on the island, he was run ragged, poisoned, almost killed by malaria and made a "plaything" by the Ibatan. As he tried to learn the language -- using an elegant system developed by SIL's founders -- the Ibatan, now numbering about 600, joyously substituted common words with the names of body parts. Trying to find a lost hammer, for instance, Rundell would ask if anyone had seen his penis, that he'd lost it somewhere. Ibatan would roll on the ground in hysterics, ask him, "How big is it?" and then add new words. The subtext, though, was all too serious: some elders saw him as a threat and wanted him dead.
At the moment Rundell was ready to abandon the project and his sanity, he caught a 10-year-old boy trying to scam him out of pads and pencils. Under interrogation, the boy explained how the Ibatan had made a fool of him.
Rundell broke down, a moment he remembers vividly even after the passage of two decades. "I'm not a fool," he said to the boy. "There are things I can teach you, amazing things, about a world beyond your imagination, about a God that will love you no matter what. But you must help me. We must be friends. Do you understand?"
That boy, whose name was Frank Simon, did understand. "I can teach you what you need to know to survive here," the boy said. But there was one condition: "Someday, I want to go over the horizon in a boat. You'll help me do that, right?"
"Yes," Rundell said, seeing a first glimpse of his future. "Yes, I will."
It was a bargain, and each would hold up his end: Rundell learned the ways of the Ibatan; Frank, a youngster with endless questions, learned much about the world and heard the story of Christ. A period of heady optimism and activity unfurled, as, year by year, the cornerstones of the "developed" world were laid on Babuyan. Rundell was joined on the island by his wife, Judi, a Chinese-American, and their baby daughter. (A second daughter was born on the island.) The family settled into a hut made of rattan and split palms. Curious Ibatan, mostly teenagers, nosed in, many of them soon learning to read and write the Roman alphabet that had now been woven into a representation of their native language.
The arrival of written language, scholars say, creates an architecture for a civilization to become "sticky," making it possible to transmit knowledge more effectively, in greater volume and detail, and to build on advances. Rundell and Judi began their own vanity press with titles like "Stories Concerning Us Here on Babuyan" -- a collection of folk tales -- and "Atlas Book," with drawings and text that showed where the island sat in relation to the Philippines, the wider Pacific, the world . . . and where earth sits within the solar system. Judi created a cookbook, which, along with recipes for preparing indigenous crops and grains, described the uses of flour, something never seen on the island. Soon enough, one of the women had sent her husband out to barter with a passing Taiwanese fishing junk; the next day, a sack of white powder appeared on the Marees' doorstep.
Rundell, meanwhile, had two-man handsaws delivered by a plane so that the men could more effectively cut the island's precious nara trees and make boards. A school was built, and sturdier houses began to appear, one of which belonged to the Marees. In their own dwelling, they set up a medical clinic, which consisted of Rundell using the text "Where There Is No Doctor" and whatever medicines he could scrounge on infrequent trips to the mainland.
Three boys emerged as a kind of "bridge generation." There was Frank, the young Ruben Dican and his young uncle Orlando Thomas. Together they helped Rundell on one of his first and most significant transformational projects: the building of a water system. At that time, the island was still what anthropologists call a "spring culture," where everyone gathered at a few large springs to fill buckets and discuss everything each day. So the building of a rudimentary system of sisterns and pipes -- a baby step toward modernity -- represented a significant disruption of traditional Ibatan culture.
Indeed, as the water flowed, Christianity began to take root. In the early 1980's, Rundell took a few Ibatan for short stints to a rural SIL center in the northern province of the Philippines, where they helped with translation of the New Testament. They tended to be young, in their late teens or early 20's, and this group, including a core trio of Frank, Ruben and Orlando, were among the first "believers."
This new nondenominational Christian faith, based on an intimate, humanized deity who would love each believer unconditionally, appealed to converts as an alternative to the mystical, earthbound complexities of the "invisibles." Being worthy of this God's love seemed to offer a new sensation of self-worth. People were suffused with the Judeo-Christian octane of individual destiny, a perfect fit with the new ideas about education, business and personal behavior that Rundell and Judi were also introducing.
Ruben and Orlando, and their soon-to-be wives, Miriam and Nancy, were sent to college on the mainland by the Marees. The missionaries, for their part, were supported by a far-flung group of about 75 regular contributors, who wrote checks from kitchen tables, church pews and offices around the world. These contributions averaged about $32,000 a year, and the couple, with their two growing daughters, spent modestly on themselves and gave away the rest.
Frank, however, would take nothing from Rundell, neither compensation for Bible translating nor grants for education. "He always looked at me as a peer, an equal," Rundell says. "He said he didn't want money to be part of our relationship."
Rather than go off to school, Frank became the island's innovator and explorer, its Magellan. When nearly all the houses on the island were destroyed in a typhoon in 1987, it was Frank who decided they needed to build a great boat. The island's fleet of outriggers was limited in size by what could be lifted over the rocks and brought to safety inland. But Frank went ahead and designed a 50-foot ship; he and Rundell built it; and then they sailed it 210 miles to the mainland and back with cement, wood and other supplies. Hundreds of Ibatan men carried the vessel to an inland lagoon as another storm approached. Soon, a separate medical clinic was built, and the Marees were living in the island's first cement house; a cement church followed, as well as the squat, solid A-frame of a new school.
In 1992, Frank sailed off in his outrigger and pantomimed his way onto a Taiwanese fishing junk. He spent six months as a fisherman, then six months in jail once the boat docked and he was found to have no immigration papers. When he returned to Babuyan a year later, two things occurred; his mildly felonious sojourn became a career path for other young men; and using the Taiwanese he learned in prison, he negotiated deals on a shortwave with passing junks, offering fresh water, fruit and fish that the Ibatan were specialists in catching. Soon, 40 Ibatan outriggers fanned out to fill orders on the fly.
By the mid-90's, a modern beat was becoming audible: frenzied daytime hustling matched, on evenings and weekends, with repentant prayer. The population grew fast (as it will in places where there is no electricity), and by 1995, there were 1,000 Ibatan, 400 of whom were devout Christians, a community of fervent Puritan ethicists that would make Max Weber take notice.
And Marx too. With growing disparities in income, possessions and the sizes of homes came class division: an upper class, living around a town center by the water, anchored by a small cooperative store; and the rest, mostly living in the mountain jungles, feeling their first tug of envy and resentment.
At the uppermost strata were a dozen or so Ibatan whose education the Marees underwrote, led by Ruben and his wife, Miriam. By the 90's, both had become emblems of what de Tocqueville called bourgeoisie virtue, studying furiously for their teaching certification exams, tirelessly educating the island's children, ever resourceful and frugal. Here, in what teachers everywhere would consider a perfect world, they became the highest-paid people on the island, earning a combined 20,000 pesos a month (about $400) from the Philippine Department of Education. On Babuyan, this is a fortune, and it enabled Ruben and Miriam to build their grand, fenced two-story house, with the island's first indoor kitchen.
While Frank provided the bursts of ingenuity, Ruben, supported by his government salary, established the kind of sustained, patient enterprises upon which economies are built. After Judi taught Miriam accounting skills, she and Ruben effectively ran the island's main cooperative, a 15-foot-square cement box with basic dry goods and packaged foods. Ruben became the island's banker, lending money for all needs; the head of its power company, stringing wire from his diesel-powered generator to lighthouses; its ice company, selling ice from his diesel-powered freezer; and its communications system, checking radio reports for the weather and making emergency calls. Step by step, he became a civic man and contributor to the community, a centrist, a moderate, in all things, but with an eye always on a kind of enlightened self-interest wherein people's needs and wants could be served . . . at an attractive margin.
Meanwhile, the sensitive Orlando, who from his youth assisted Rundell in the medical clinic, became a teacher as well. But from the start, Orlando asked hard questions, often from the sidelines, about what was suitable and what was not, for the Ibatan. With his educational advantages, he moved into the realm of service, ministering to the sick on weekends, as well as helping Rundell and Judi in their translation of the Bible and the creation of an Ibatan dictionary. In his spare time, he wrote songs and poems. He poked fun at Ruben's growing portliness -- Yes, yes, there goes a wealthy man"; and Frank's yearning: "My friend will only rest when he has no choice. . . . "
Like Ruben's, Orlando's role on the island represented the arrival of specialization, a crucial step in human development -- it took hold in the Fertile Crescent 7,000 years ago -- in which a few elites are paid by society for their unique skills, freeing them from physical labor. It's a principle upon which diversified, developed economies surely rest. Though the Philippine government had dropped a few teachers on the island in the 1960's, they were mostly there on what seemed like extended vacations, occasionally drilling some children in perfunctory recitations of Tagalog, the national language. None had ever bothered to learn the local tongue. Ruben and Orlando, local boys who got credentials and came home, became the first genuine elites, wearing hats, it often seemed, for an entire professional class.
Frank, for his part, pushed forward without a formal education. Despite his brilliance and grasp of several regional languages, he chose to remain on a lower rung of the ladder with most of the Ibatan. Each day, he struggled to support his young family with a patchwork of subsistence farming and grand schemes, always at the pitiless whims of weather and tides.
By 1996, the beginning of the new Babuyan was nearly at an end. Rundell and Judi drew close to finishing the Ibatan Bible, a 1,000-page translation of the New Testament, plus Genesis, into Ibatan. The project had stretched across 20 years and was now ready for final proofreading. When it was done, there was great fanfare. Rundell and Judi's extended families, friends and supporters arrived from the United States and Canada, along with SIL leaders and Philippine officials, for the dedication of the completed book. There were 350 copies passed out to the Ibatan. The parties and prayers lasted a week.
With their daughters now off to college and their specific SIL mission completed, Rundell and Judi prepared to leave for their next project. Everyone gathered on the landing strip to see them off. A daily conversation across time and cultures, lasting 20 years, was about to end. Songs were sung, and Orlando, Ruben and all the others hugged Rundell and Judi amid tears. And Frank, fighting back a sensation of being left behind, watched the plane vanish through a point in the sky, far above the horizon.
It is nearly five years later. Ruben rides the island's only bike down the dirt main street. He parks it near a banyan tree where burial urns were found more than 130 years ago, an ancient, twisted presence long thought to be the home of "invisibles."
The tree, its trunk recently burned out by vandals, now overlooks the cooperative store that Ruben helps run. It has become the town's gathering place. Supplies for the store are transported from the mainland by a boat he owns, the island's largest. His mercantile energies are visible everywhere: a man planing wood in the town square, cradling his portable electric planer like a newborn baby, says that Ruben bought it for him, and he's paying it off, bit by bit.
Ruben says he is expecting a new, diesel-powered five-kilowatt generator, meaning more houses will soon have light. "It helps make the days longer, the nights shorter and less boring than just sitting in the dark telling stories," he says. He steps back to let a man on a water buffalo pass. "Yes, my bike is better," he says, shaking his head at the beast. "No question, this is progress." He pats the handlebars and smiles. "Eventually, everyone will agree."
I am here with Rundell and Judi, on one of their longest visits since their mission was formally completed. Judi, a woman of tireless precision, is gathering data for a book on the geneaology of the island, dating to 1860. Rundell, who now helps oversee the Philippine region for SIL, is mostly on a sightseeing mission, comparing the "then" with the "now." The islanders had long anticipated our arrival; they had even heard about me, a Jewish reporter from the United States, and they joyously greeted us at the airfield and accompanied us into the village.
Ruben has "become like Santa Claus, with one new thing after another," says Rundell, unpacking suitcases in the bedroom of their old house, which has since been converted into a library. "Even Orlando is being sucked in."
Ruben's electricity has carried a growing current of visual images. He first got a television, a small one, three years ago, and attached it to a VCR. There are now four VCR's on the island, with some of his competitors charging guests to view bootleg tapes procured from passing boats.
As a church elder, Ruben has tried to exert quality control over what is shown. A recent hit at his house was "Ben-Hur," the 1959 classic with Charlton Heston as a he-man Jewish slave and chariot champion during the time of Christ. "We thought the Jews were the world's toughest people," Ruben tells me that evening, as he switches away from CNN to a station from Manila. "Everyone thought you'd be bigger."
A weekly, hourlong Philippine drama begins. After a car chase and some shooting, the protagonists, a handsome pair, end up in bed. The Ibatan men snicker, then, taking their cue from the women, quickly hush. Everyone slips into a kind of group trance, sitting absolutely still, as the couple roll beneath the sheets and the music swells. 
Orlando is here, sitting a few feet away with his appraising look. He says he worries that these images "will make us feel dissatisfied with our life here. This will be very bad and wrong. But it's so hard to turn away."
Ruben, seeking a midcourse of enlightened self-interest, shrugs. "Maybe it will make people strive more. To get to this life they see. Maybe that won't be so bad."
The next morning, Rundell, Judi and I go for a walk in the jungle with Frank, who brings along his 18-month-old son, Joe. We are in search of the oldest people on the island so that Judi can interview them for her book. Along the way, Frank tells us how the children, learning about the larger world, are growing away from adults. Once, he says, "you could leave money out and not worry about it. Now the teenagers steal it to buy what they can, to watch videos at someone's house or buy cigarettes or liquor." The island's second liquor store was recently opened across from the school by a Filipino teacher who got his posting on the island as a political favor. The first one is run by Frank's older brother.
After walking an hour in the midmorning heat, we come across Joaquin, an ancient, loinclothed man in a tiny hut, chewing on areca nut, a local narcotic. Judi, after a few questions, determines Joaquin was born in 1917, probably in May. The man, it turns out, is Frank's great-uncle, his grandmother's brother. This is not too surprising -- almost everyone on the island is related. Frank, holding his son, gently eases under the grassy eaves of the hut's doorway, and with her digital camera, Judi takes a picture of the three of them, crossing four generations, for the book.
It is striking how far their paths have diverged in such a short period. Frank spends his days worrying about the yield of his rice crop, businesses he might start and how he'll ever manage to send his son to college. Joaquin is concerned about feeling in harmony with the "invisibles" and spearing wild pigs. After the photo is taken, they chat briefly about relatives. The old man, squatting on the floor of his hut, looks quizzically at Frank, who is dressed in a polo shirt, and says, "It does not look like we are related."
After we leave Joaquin, Frank seems reflective. Rundell pokes at him to get a sense of why. "Written language gave us a way to capture our history and compare ourselves to people everywhere," Frank says after a moment. "Now that we have a past, I find that I think only of the future. I always feel a clock ticking and time rushing by. But Joaquin, he lives always in the present. He hears no clock. Once, that's the way we all were."
A few mornings later, an exhausted Orlando, up too late watching television, studies the sky. He takes in a wisp of cloud passing low, and raises an eyebrow: "Usually, monsoon doesn't come this early, but that wind . . . it is the wind that brings it."
Ruben arrives, and together they analyze the breeze, its altitude, speed and precedents for monsoon season -- five months of almost nonstop rain and wind -- to start this early. At moments like this, they are most visibly "a bridge generation," at the very forefront of change, yet still employing the skills of "the before time." They will be the last generation of islanders, most likely, to know all six Ibatan names of the wind.
The rain begins to arrive in large drops. Children crack off shiny leaves of elephant cabbage from the jungle foliage and disappear under a laughing green canopy that twists up the mountain. Orlando possesses a precious luxury, an umbrella, and he and I crowd under it as the full, humbling ferocity of nature pours down.
"If we stick together, work together, we can get all that we need right here," Orlando says. "This is what I tell people. If we stay close, the umbrella is big enough for us all to stay dry."
As it turns out, monsoon season is not arriving. All we have is a typhoon, with 100-mile-an-hour winds. As the storm approaches, the Ibatan go into a frenzy, tying down boats and securing the foundations of huts. Since early morning, Frank has been furiously racing through his rice terraces, trying to harvest whatever he can. Men and women scramble madly in fields on all sides of him. Despite his creativity and sense of personal destiny, Frank is still bound to moments of profound helplessness and humility. The timing of the typhoon is inauspicious: the rice needs a few more weeks to ripen. 
Ruben is not worried about rice, and he retreats to the front porch of his safe, solid house, in a cluster of nara trees just across from the school. He talks about the struggle with nature, about the amazing resourcefulness of the old Ibatan to survive here during typhoons and volcanic eruptions. Then, smiling brightly at me, he says, "If you have nothing better to do, why don't we go watch TV?" He turns on the generator, saunters across the tiled porch floor, past a tiny plastic chirping bird, with motion sensor, that you might find in a souvenir shop on Sunset Boulevard, and upstairs to the TV.
George Bush's address before Congress is just coming on, and we watch intently, listening to the speech and the thunderous applause. "That's what it is always about, deep down," Ruben says. "About the haves and the have-nots. Whether they will admit it or not, bin Laden's followers are jealous of America." He pauses. "It is not easy having a lot when others have so little. I know."
Ruben's view on how a wealthy man, like a wealthy country, avoids ill will, is pragmatic: he charges next to nothing for ice and electricity -- and nothing for watching his satellite TV -- offers modest terms for people who owe him money and contributes heavily to the common projects. When his boat fortunately arrived at dawn this morning, loaded with enough supplies to fill his cooperative through monsoon, Ruben made sure, as is his custom, to dive into the surf for the hardest job: dragging the small skiff out and back between the rocky shore and the boat to haul the goods to shore. An hour later, after 60 men had helped lift the 40-foot outrigger from the water, Ruben, wet and exhausted, murmured, "It's important that I do the worst work and the hardest, so they know I'm not different from any of them."
But, with each day, class exerts its divisions. Ruben's education and use of capital have freed him from the shared burdens of the Ibatan and from the shared purpose that flows from it. Safe and warm, he flips from Bush's speech to the National Geographic channel, a favorite of his, as the typhoon begins to roar. 
For five straight days, everyone is trapped indoors, until the rain and winds recede and the Ibatan emerge to take stock. The banana trees have been decapitated, but most of the coconut trees have held. Quite a few grass huts and some wooden houses will need repair. The island is awash in mudslides.
Ruben, with Orlando at his side, ventures over to Frank's house, near the shoreline. Like most of the Ibatan, he has lost his rice crop, which means he will have to sell the nine pigs he has acquired over the past few years, essentially his life savings, so that his family has enough to eat through the monsoon season.
His latest idea -- an ice-making cooperative to freeze fish and sell ice to the growing number of large fishing boats in the nearby waters -- is now out of reach. He was planning to sell the excess of his rice crop and a few pigs for seed capital. This is hard for Frank, the eternal optimist, to swallow. "Again, for me it's about survival," he says, forcing a smile as his wife looks on.
The next morning everyone gathers at church, the crowd flowing out the doorway and standing in a light Sunday mist. Rundell, naturally, is the guest preacher this morning, and he dives confidently into Matthew 25, called "the Parable of Talents." He summons a little girl, a teenage boy and a man to the stage and has them try to lift different-size rocks. Eventually, after much laughter, each picks up a rock suited to his or her strength, allowing Rundell to intone about how "God does not judge us based how many talents each of us have, but what you do with whatever talents you are given." The service closes with Frank on guitar and Ruben playing a portable organ he just bought, as the Ibatan let loose with a thunderous rendering of an old Baptist chant, "Stand Up, Stand Up for Jesus."
A few days later, when the landing strip is dry enough for a plane to land, Rundell radios the mainland for a pickup the following morning. As darkness falls, he invites Frank, Ruben and Orlando to his house, and we gather at the table. They talk easily, chiding, laughing, challenging one another's sense of what's needed and what's possible. Rundell leaps up to the blackboard and starts scribbling notes, assessing, first, the progress that has been made; the church is vibrant, the education up to sixth grade is strong. (After that, if parents want their children to continue their education, they have to be sent off the island to boarding academies, which are too expensive for most Ibatan.) Commerce is growing, if slowly. More than half the houses have running water, and electricity is spreading. 
Then the conversation shifts to the thing most needed, and Rundell starts drawing the outlines of a high school. For half an hour, they talk fast, imagining it, free form, until the drawing has a gym, a science lab, a home-economics center, a library, "with more books than we have chickens on this island," Orlando says. Looking wistfully at the chalk marks, they smile and fall silent.
One trap for the Ibatan, as for so many across a world connected by sound and image, is becoming overwhelmed with yearning. In the bracing first months of a new globalism, one thing seems plain: people need to feel some sense of forward motion, or hope collapses. It is dangerous to dream of things that are so far out of reach, and the school they have just conjured on the chalkboard is precisely that -- a fantasy.
"What about the bridge?" Frank pipes up. Everyone knows about the bridge, and Rundell erases the school and starts drawing horizontal lines. The problem: a dry bed running from high on Mount Babuyan to the ocean turns into a swift river during monsoon. The children from half the island have to cross a rickety wooden bridge to get to school. It's hazardous. Parents have complained. Some kids have stopped attending.
Everyone, including Rundell, is a self-taught engineer -- they've had to be -- and there's rapid, purposeful talk of how to build a cement bridge, another first for the island. 
Orlando stops the proceedings. "The long metal rods inside the cement. There's no boat big enough on the island to transport them here." He's right. Hiring a large boat for the long trip to Babuyan Claro would be too expensive.
"There's one way," Frank finally says, and out it flows: after the typhoon, many people will be selling their pigs or cows to buy rice, and the livestock brokers, with the largest boats that ever come near here, are probably preparing a visit. Their boats are not only big; they have flat bottoms that allow them to get very close to the shore, making it easier to load and unload unwieldy cargo. "We need to come together, so everyone selling livestock can negotiate as one" and stipulate that the boats bring the rods on their way out, he says. "This way, we can also get a better overall price for our livestock and contribute the extra to whatever modest transportation costs there'll be for the rods."
Orlando, the voice of careful consideration, nods a few times. "It just might work," he says. Ruben quickly sketches out a swift plan for implementation and negotiating position.
Frank just smiles. He has taken his woe and found, at its dark core, a kernel of possibility. A plan. A way for everyone to move forward, to taste a bit of sweet progress in its purest form. And, for an instant, I was certain that on this windy night a guy named Frank saved the world.
Even if it was just one bridge.

Two Domes in Cornwall Defy Tourism Downturn

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
MENTION the idea of domes in Britain and most people think of the disastrous Millennium Dome on the banks of the Thames in Greenwich that turned into a sinkhole for bail-out money from the National Lottery.
 But a set of domes in Cornwall has begun to prove that dome-shaped attractions don't have to turn into financial fiascoes. Indeed, the attraction, known as the Eden Project, seems to have defied the downturn in tourism caused by the foot and mouth epidemic earlier this year and the broader economic slowdown since the Sept. 11 attacks in New York and Washington. 
 The combination of those two events -- both disasters albeit on different scales -- are giving British tourism its worst year in decades. In September alone, the number of American visitors to Britain fell 17 percent compared with September 2000, according to the National Statistics Office. 
But the Eden Project, with its two huge geodesic domes housing tropical and Mediterranean plant life -- one 180 feet high and covering four acres, the other 98 feet high and two acres -- has proved surprisingly alluring since its opening in March.
The expectation, said Paul Travers, the Project's media director, was that the domes and a third outdoor biome, or climatic region, would draw 750,000 visitors in their first 12 months.
Instead, in its first eight months the $120 million project -- half funded by the lottery and half privately -- has drawn 1.55 million visitors. By comparison, the $1.2 billion Millennium Dome drew less than half the 12 million people it was supposed to attract in the 12 months before it closed on schedule last Dec. 31 to become an unsold monument to the hubris of its politician-planners.
And while the Millennium Dome languishes unloved in Greenwich, the Eden Project is planning to start work on a third $28 million geodesic dome devoted to plants found in arid Arizona-like climates. The place got so busy last summer that it urged people to stay away at peak times -- particularly rainy mornings. "We were telling people: if you must come, please come in the afternoons," Mr. Travers said.
What attracts them is hard to say. "It's the old story of the right place at the right time," Mr. Travers said. It may also have something to do with the British obsession with gardens that has spawned several television shows devoted to the pastime. Even before the Eden Project opened, hundreds of thousands of people visited the construction site. And since it opened, the crowds, mainly British and European, have not been deterred by a $14 entrance fee for adults.
One of the attractions is the humid biome, which acts as a gigantic greenhouse, representing the rain-forest climate found in parts of Africa, Malaysia and South America, along with a waterfall. As an added draw apart from the thousands of plants, the Eden Project acquired a zoo license this year and introduced birds, geckos and tree frogs.
A second biome replicates the kind of climate found in southern Africa and California. Both occupy a vast 40-acre pit once used to excavate china clay. Over all, the domes contain some 12,000 kinds of plants, according to the Project's horticulturalists.
Such has been the attraction that local amenities such as hotels and guest houses in nearby towns such as St. Austell and Fowey have been overwhelmed by the unexpected flow of visitors, some arriving from cruise ships. There have even been reports of tourists sleeping in their cars overnight. 
Indeed, Cornwall benefitted from the new project both by attracting visitors while neighboring Devon was struck by the foot and mouth disease and by effectively extending the county's tourism season beyond the usual spring-through-fall period.
Already, Mr. Travers said, the Project is planning late-night openings as the holiday season approaches. That may be an added boon: while over four million visitors crowd Cornwall's ports and beaches every year, the area -- at England's southwesternmost tip -- is still listed by the European Union as one of Western Europe's poorest regions -- a status ascribed by local officials to the decline of mining and fishing.
The Eden Project was inspired by Tim Smit, the Anglo-Dutch chief executive and joint founder of the Project, who moved to Cornwall in the late 1980's as a songwriter interested in establishing a recording studio. Next door to the studio was a large unkempt garden known as Heligan. Mr. Smit restored it as The Lost Garden of Heligan, an attraction opening in 1992 that became the forerunner of the Eden Project. He has said his intention was to "make science sexy."
The Eden Project has established a particular reputation as a lottery-funded project that worked where others -- most notably the Millennium Dome, but also a rock museum in Sheffield -- have failed.
But one accolade eluded it. In October, the Project had been seen as the likely winner of a prestigious architectural award -- the Royal Institute of British Architects Stirling Prize for the best building of 2001. But when the winner was announced, it wasanother lottery-funded project -- the Magna Center, a science adventure park costing some $56 million and converted from a huge, disused steel mill in the rust-belt town of Rotherham in Yorkshire.

HEADLINE: Soaking and Steaming in Japan 

BYLINE:  By LISA TAKEUCHI CULLEN; LISA TAKEUCHI CULLEN is a Tokyo correspondent for Time magazine.

 BODY:
PUFFS of steam waft around the old woman as she squats naked on the tiles. She takes a cedar bucket and fills it with water, then carefully pours its contents down her knobby back. Slowly she scrubs her body with a long, soapy washcloth. When she's finished, she wrings the cloth, folds it into a square and places it on her head so it won't dirty the water. Only then does she ease herself into the deep, steaming bath.
 She nods in my direction, and I nod back. Neither of us speaks. We are strangers, and yet we are perfectly comfortable sitting naked together in a pool of scalding hot water. Soon we are joined by another naked stranger, then another. We all nod politely, though we don't make eye contact. One never stares at the onsen. 
 My mother and I are at a public bath in Arima, a hot springs resort area near Kobe, Japan. While growing up in this country I pulled every excuse I could to avoid onsen excursions like this one. The horror of everybody staring at my everything -- or, in my case, the lack thereof -- brought on fake fevers or unusually pressing homework. Yet somehow after moving to America, I developed fond memories of the onsen. Maybe as my body got older and softer, it didn't seem much worth hiding anymore. Maybe the stressful business of being an adult made me realize there is nothing more therapeutic than a good hot bath. Whatever the reason, between my visits and then my work-related move back to Japan, soaking in public has grown from hobby to habit. 
This particular onsen in Arima is spacious and modern, with three stone-edged baths, a sauna and wraparound windows with mountain views. A sign by one of the baths explains why its water is brick-red: minerals in the mountain springs color the water and, ostensibly, soften the skin. From the general direction of the skylights I hear the faint song of an uguisu, a Japanese bush warbler. I soak until my fingertips crinkle and gaze out at the crisp November sky. By the time I spy the speakers and realize the birdsong is piped in, I'm too dazed to care.
In an effort to survive a crippling recession, many hot springs resorts offer a bath packaged with a lavish lunch for a reasonable price. My mother and I like a bargain. Rubbery and relaxed from our dip, we join a group of middle-aged women and a few gray-haired couples in a large room. A painted paper screen sections off our corner, where soft silk zabuton cushions await us on the straw tatami mats. A chatty lady in a brown kimono brings out our meal, plate by delicate plate, arranging the food on low lacquer tray tables. A tiny cube of glistening tofu here, a sliver of sizzling Kobe beef there, and before we know it we are so full we're slipping out of our kneeling positions and furtively unbuttoning our skirts.
I've learned an onsen is improved immeasurably if you are cold when you get in and hungry when you get out. My husband and I were both freezing and famished by the time we arrived at our inn on Miyajima one January. The tiny island sits across the bay from Hiroshima, where we had spent an emotionally draining day at the Peace Memorial museum. Staggering off the ferry, we barely glance at the Shinto shrine jutting into the bay or its red Torii gates, reaching for the heavens out of the dusky water.
We push our way through the aggressive panhandling deer and up the cobblestone alleyways toward the inn, arriving at its gates just as it begins to snow. Two kimono-clad members of the staff rush to grab our bags and usher us to our room overlooking a snow-dusted garden. Though the room has its own tiny bath, we choose to use the inn's communal onsen. The women's bath is empty. I feel I can finally define bliss as I sink into that circular, tile-lined, steaming hot bath. That is, until we return to our room, toasty and pink under our cotton yukata robes (hilariously short on my 6-foot-2 husband). Awaiting us is a two-hour parade of sashimi and fried oyster courses. It reduces us to babble.
As with all things Japanese, there is ritual to be observed in public bathing. Luxury onsen like the ones in Arima and Miyajima hold their charm, but the best place to experience the tradition is at a sento, the humble neighborhood bath. Technically, sento aren't true onsen; they're more like the poor cousins of the natural hot springs. And they're disappearing from many towns as modern homes are built with their own ofuro baths and showers. But for some people, getting clean still means stacking a towel and a yukata into a shallow plastic bucket and strolling up the street to a building distinguished by a one-word sign: yu. Hot water. 
My local public bath in the Azabu Juban neighborhood of Tokyo happens to be an actual hot spring, spouting brownish water from 1,640 feet underground. Inside, an old woman (always an old woman) takes a few coins from me and hands me a tenugui, a washcloth. Folding my clothes and placing them in a cubbyhole, I clasp the tenugui to the front of my body. This is more a gesture of modesty than an actual attempt to cover up: the washcloth is about the size and thickness of a dishrag.
A novice often treats the onsen like a Jacuzzi, and plunges right in. The cardinal rule of public bathing in Japan: Scrub before you soak. You're about to share a small body of water with people you don't know. To do so without first reducing your germ count will clear the bath. If achieving pariah status isn't enough reason to stop and rinse, here's another: onsen waters are typically kept at temperatures appropriate for lobster-boiling. Hop in, and you'll be lucky to hop out with all your body parts intact.
Slow but steady is the more prudent way to go. Once submerged, you will be surprised at how quickly the body takes to the heat. Your toes will tingle and your cheeks will glow. But soon comes the test of gaman -- endurance. Onsen veterans have it; you don't. It is a mistake to compete with the wrinkly regulars who will remain, rock still, in scalding hot water long after you've bolted. 
Head for the cold-water bath to regain normal body temperature. Then sample the others. Many onsen, especially in hot springs resorts, boast more than one type of bath; some contain special herbs, or minerals specific to that region. My family once visited an onsen with a sulfur bath, which supposedly holds restorative qualities. But I couldn't hold my breath long enough to sink into what smelled like a vat of rotten eggs. Another onsen I tried with my husband in Matsuyama, on the southern island of Shikoku, compares its blend of eight Chinese herbs to the fountain of youth. Well, acid has age-defying properties, too. We decided youthful skin is overrated.
Born-again in my love of onsen, I try with feverish zeal to convert visiting friends and relatives. But Westerners often harbor strong aversions to the onsen. Some I understand; for example, I avoid coed bathing, which I find weird and uncomfortable. Many simply can't bend their minds around the fundamental concept of getting naked in front of strangers. To them I have only this to say: Get over yourself. And go take a bath.
Other reservations puzzle me, like that with bathing outdoors. Rotenburo, or outdoor baths -- literally, bath under the heavens -- embody the purest joy of onsen. Once you have tried floating naked under the stars in a steaming hot pool, you'll understand.

HEADLINE: IN PERSON; 
Farmer Brown

BYLINE:  By KIRSTY SUCATO 

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
ARTHUR R. BROWN JR. was known as "Cow Brown" in high school because of the whiff of manure that followed him to school from his family's 100-acre dairy farm in southern Massachusetts.
 At age 66 the congenial Mr. Brown -- who has been New Jersey's secretary of agriculture for the past 19 years -- still seems more comfortable on horseback than in his corner office here. 
 But if Mr. Brown's essence is as a farmer, he is no lightweight when it comes to policy issues. Mr. Brown's lengthy tenure came at a time when growers faced relentless pressures from cut-rate competitors at home and abroad and from voracious land development that claims 10,000 acres of New Jersey farmland a year. 
He responded with measures like the "Jersey Fresh" marketing campaign, which became a national model, and a revision of the state's Right to Farm Act, one of the toughest laws in the country intended to shield farmers from nuisance complaints.
But his main mission, apropos of the times, has been buying development rights from cash-strapped farmers to preserve the property as open space.
Mr. Brown had planned to retire last Friday -- the longest-serving member of the current cabinet -- but he agreed to stay on through Governor-elect James E. McGreevey's transition. Colleagues say his legacy will help to keep farming a way of life in New Jersey, an outcome that did not always seem likely. 
"I was much more worried about the future of agriculture in 1982 than I am now," said Gregory Romano, director of the state's Farmland Preservation program. "That's because of the strengthened programs we have adopted."
Mr. Brown has long enjoyed the trust of the farming community, perhaps because he paid his dues as an employee of Seabrook Farm in Upper Deerfield Township and then as the agricultural agent for Atlantic County for 11 years. In that job, he was charged with transferring research from Rutgers Cooperative Extension, an arm of the university's Cook College, onto the farm.
"In our farming culture, the county agent has a tremendous credibility factor and empathy factor," said Peter Furey, the executive director of the New Jersey Farm Bureau, a farmers' lobbying group. "They are viewed as getting into the trenches with farmers with all their multifold issues."
Unlike other departments, the agriculture secretary is selected by the state Board of Agriculture -- made up of eight farmers -- something it is doing now. The nominee is then confirmed by the governor. The rest of the cabinet is picked by the governor and confirmed by the Senate. Consequently, Mr. Brown has occupied an apolitical position through four administrations, enjoying friendships with his bosses and remaining remarkably free of detractors.
Mr. Brown made a splash early on with the creation of the "Jersey Fresh" marketing campaign, the first in the nation to brand an entire state rather than a specific commodity. He has been its pitchman, appearing in television commercials, tanned and smiling, urging consumers to "taste the homegrown goodness of 'Jersey Fresh.' "
"We had the products, we had a good name but we didn't really go out and sell it," Mr. Brown said.
His second priority was farmland preservation. The numbers tell the story: In 1953, farms covered 1.7 million acres of New Jersey; by 1997, that had fallen to 830,000, according to the latest Census data. 
Today the state is in a close race with developers, permanently preserving about as much farmland as it loses each year -- 10,000 acres -- under a program developed by Mr. Brown that is considered the most aggressive in the nation. 
"I was brought up on a farm and I live on a farm and I know the value of the land to the individual," Mr. Brown said. "It just seemed like in a state like New Jersey we were so densely populated and land was something that we were losing quite rapidly that we needed to do something."
In 1983 -- with little fanfare -- the state Department of Agriculture started the Farmland Preservation Program with a $5 million annual budget. Under the system, the state buys easements, or development rights, allowing farmers to remain on the land with an average of $4,300 an acre in their pockets. 
It took two years to sign up the first government-wary farmer. Today colleagues say the program succeeded largely because of Mr. Brown, who cut his teeth selling harvesting equipment for three years before becoming an agricultural agent. "It's just his personality," said William N. Brooks Jr., a potato farmer who is chairman of the Garden State Preservation Trust. "I've never seen a more positive attitude in a person."
By 1999, when Gov. Christie Whitman signed the open space bill -- the Garden State Preservation Trust Act -- the department was turning down 9 of 10 applicants for lack of financing. 
The bill set aside up to $2 billion to save a million acres of open space -- half of it farmland -- by 2010. Mr. Brown became one of its most visible cheerleaders, prompting a colleague to joke that he was running out of green clothes to wear to promotional events. 
To date, the state has preserved about 15 percent of its farmland, or 83,000 acres comprised of 606 farms, with another 33,000 acres awaiting closing.
"Art was a huge proponent of insisting that we have a target for farmland, which I was happy to do," said Mrs. Whitman who now heads the federal Environmental Protection Agency.
Farmers like to point out that although they are a small constituency -- there are about 3,000 fulltime farmers in New Jersey -- the industry injects $62.5 billion into the state's economy each year, making it one of New Jersey's top five industries. Total agriculture production is valued at about $800 million.
Mr. Brown has been good at getting money for producers. "He used that cabinet position as a platform to tell the story of a new and changing world," said Mr. Furey of the New Jersey Farm Bureau.
In the drought of 1999 he took legislators -- many of whom were friends -- on a tour of parched farms in Somerset County and persuaded them to back a $20 million drought relief package. 
"They were out there in 130-degree field temperatures walking on dirt that was crunching under their feet that was so dry," said Deborah Lawler, Mr. Brown's chief spokeswoman. "They saw the devastation on the field corn, they saw the impact on livestock producers, they saw how vegetable producers were working literally 24 hours a day."
He was the first to tap into the state's Casino Reinvestment Development Authority as a source for rural aid, securing a $3 million fund for low-interest loans for farmers in the late 80's, and helping to lift the industry out of the recession. 
A measure adopted this year effectively doubled the compensation that farms in the Pinelands received for their development rights, provided they agreed to such stricter environmental controls as protecting streams and limiting building. 
"That is a good example of Art's kind of savvy ways of doing things," said Michael Cattania, the executive director of the Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit group that lobbied hard for the open space bill.
Farmers love networking, and Mr. Brown worked cheerfully at it, attending as many as five night meetings a week. An avid horseman, for years he had a rivalry with Mrs. Whitman in harness racing and in calf cutting, the separating of a calf from the herd while on horseback. 
He received so many awards from industry groups since he announced his retirement in August that some still lay in the trunk of his car. But Mr. Brown admitted that he had grown tired of the long hours. 
"I love the job and I'm going to miss it," he said recently. "I'm sure of that. "But I love to hunt, fish, go antiquing and I have a bunch of grandkids I'd like to see once in a while."
His small nursery operation in Galloway Township, in Atlantic County, run by his wife of 20 years, Carolyn, is for sale. None of his six children and step-children have an interest in carrying on the business, he said. 
But Farmer Brown will not be riding off into the sunset. He plans to return to where he received his master's degree, Cook College, to teach and raise funds to endow an Art Brown professorship. 
"It's going to be big boots to fill," said Steve Jany, the president of the state Board of Agriculture. "I think we've got some good candidates, but they've got a big name to live up to."

HEADLINE: The View From/Easton; 
Lights, Tinsel, Action: It's Tree-Picking Time

BYLINE:  By GARY SANTANIELLO 

 BODY:
FOR all but a handful of weeks out of the year, Easton is a destination only for those 7,272 residents who call it home.
 Zoning laws enacted in 1941 have had the effect of limiting commercial development to the pre-existing general stores, gas stations, farm and produce stands and the Old Bluebird Inn restaurant, which is 82 years old. 
 But in the rush of days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, particularly on the weekends, this quiet town in eastern Fairfield County becomes one-stop shopping for the cut-your-own-Christmas-tree crowd.
Cars, trucks and S.U.V.s, many of them with New York license plates, descend upon the back roads and depart with Douglas firs, blue spruce and white pines protruding from trunks, roped onto roofs or wedged into flatbeds.
For the tree growers, this flurry of activity is the culmination of work that started not only at the outset of spring, but in some cases about 12 years earlier, when seedlings were planted. It is the continuation of work that often began generations earlier on land initially intended for dairy farming or fruit orchards. 
Easton, originally a part of Fairfield and incorporated in 1845, covers 27 square miles, although 35 percent of its property, including three reservoirs, is owned by Bridgeport Hydraulic Co., the area's largest water supplier. In all, 76 percent of the town is open land, and no other agricultural pursuit occupies as much acreage as the growing of Christmas trees.
The Connecticut Christmas Tree Growers Association, whose 318 members represent all seven of the state's counties, contends that only Guilford in New Haven County, which has three times the population of Easton, and East Hampton in Middlesex County, nearly twice Easton's population, have as many or more tree farms than the seven that are in Easton.
As is the case throughout the state, tree farms began proliferating in the 1950's, "when the dairy business was on its way out, mostly because of economic reasons," said William H. Everett Jr., who operates Everett's Corner Tree Farm on land that has been in the family for seven generations.
"A lot of farmers started planting Christmas trees instead," he said. "It was a way to keep the land as open space instead of selling to developers."
Maple Row Tree Farm, by far the largest tree seller in Easton and one of the biggest in the state, occupies 250 acres near Easton's border with Monroe, 130 of which are devoted to six species of trees.
The owner, Jim Edwards, employs up to 50 people, mostly family and friends, during selling season, and sells about 7,000 trees each year from three sales areas. All the field-cut trees, regardless of size or species, sell for $45 ($40 on weekdays).
The story of the farm is typical of most of the tree growers in Easton. The property, which has been in Edwards family since the 1700's, was a dairy farm when Mr. Edwards was growing up. His father, Sherwood, grew Christmas trees on the marginal acreage, selling only 20 to 30 a year.
When Jim Edwards got out of college in the late 60's with an economics degree, running a farm "was the last thing I wanted to do," he said. "So I went into sales for a year, and soon decided that wasn't what I wanted."
Mr. Edwards returned to the farm and decided to devote all its resources to trees, and Maple Row became his occupation. His 32-year-old son, Dave, who has a degree in marketing from West Virginia Wesleyan, is his partner, and his 21-year-old son, Scott, will join the family business when he completes his computer engineering degree at Sacred Heart University.
"This is a wonderful market area," Mr. Edwards said. "If you can't market trees here, you can't market them anywhere. But it's not like an annual pumpkin crop. On average, it's a 10-year rotation for trees, and when you're starting out and making a lot of mistakes, that's when the mortality rate for trees is high. It wasn't until the 80's that we felt comfortable in the business."
Yet experience hardly protects Mr. Edwards and his fellow tree farmers from the inherent vagaries of the business.
"Three of the last four years were poor growing years, and we've had dry years the past two," he said. "Last year we lost 70 percent of our transplants."
Because of the weather in recent years, "supply is light this year," said Joseph Slady, 75, who sells trees ($35 each) on 20 acres of what used to be his family's fruit orchard. "We usually sell about 1,000 trees, but we probably won't do half that this year."
Although Maple Row is the only tree farm in Easton that is run as a full-time business by the owner, the tending of Christmas trees requires year-round attention.
David Gordon, who retired from the local utility United Illuminating Company six years ago after 40 years as a vegetation manager, said his planting begins once the frost disappears, usually at the end of March or early April. How much planting is done depends on losses over the years.
"You don't want to go right back into an area where you've just harvested, because certain types of weevils loves stumps," said Mr. Gordon, who also sells his trees for $35 each. "The shearing and shaping of trees starts around the 15th of June. You've got to mow the brush along the ground, otherwise it excludes light and the bottoms of the trees end up looking poor."
Mr. Gordon said he typically mows his acreage three times in a season, and in between he sprays the trees as needed. "Basically," he said, "I'm running a delicatessen for insects." 
Mr. Gordon's grandparents started the farm in 1886, and his father started selling trees from the property in 1958. An agriculture student at Newtown High School, Mr. Gordon did not want a career in dairy farming, but he decided to continue the tree business when his father died.
"I originally started it as a college fund for my three kids," he said. "All I wanted to do was put away $100 a year for their college tuition. I think the last tuition check I wrote was for $8,000. It was always a hobby for me, but it became quite a lucrative business."
Although a daughter, a son and a son-in-law now help out during the selling season, Mr. Gordon, 69, said he still does most of the year-round work on his four acres himself.
"It's very therapeutic," said Mr. Gordon, who is an avid motorcyclist. "I enjoy the work more during the season than when I'm selling the trees. There's something sad about that."
But there is nothing sad about the scenes playing out in Easton at this time of year, as families from as far away as Long Island and Westchester County take hayrides on oxen-pulled wagons, sip cider from steaming cups and scour the fragrant fields in search of the perfect Christmas tree.
"We try to provide the atmosphere for a New England-type of experience," Mr. Edwards said. "People come up here and feel like they're in the middle of Maine."

HEADLINE: The Public's Stake in a Cultural Crossroads 

BYLINE:  By EVAN and FREDA EISENBERG; Evan Eisenberg is the author of the book "The Ecology of Eden." Freda Eisenberg is a principal of Sector Planning Ltd.

 BODY:
FOR a place whose stones are stained with the tomato traces of so many critics -- critics of architecture, urbanism, acoustics -- Lincoln Center has inspired a good deal of affection. Take this husband and wife (please): growing up in the suburbs, one of us made the pilgrimage with high school friends to receive the dual sacrament of high culture: Mozart on one side of Broadway, asparagus crepes on the other. One soft spring night years later, we had our first kiss by the Henry Moore reflecting pool. Our 5-year-old daughter has grown up at Lincoln Center, careering around the fountain by day (the white paving is dry land; the black, water -- don't fall in!), dancing to swing and merengue on the plaza by night and sleeping through third acts in many of its hallowed halls.
 Despite early opponents like Jane Jacobs, Lewis Mumford and Christopher Alexander, who inveighed against putting the city's cultural eggs in a single basket -- Alexander asking whether anyone would visit concert hall and opera house "gluttonously, in a single evening" -- Lincoln Center is indeed greater than the sum of its parts. Public space is the reason, more than six open urban acres: a largess emulated, in the last half-century, by arts centers all over the world. 
 Of the $1.2 billion budget of the redevelopment plan for Lincoln Center that will soon be made public, only 15 percent is devoted to public space. It is, however, a crucial 15 percent. For in one respect the critics are right: the center's public spaces are miserably flawed. To make them perform on the same level as the artists who tread its stages is one of the plan's stated goals.
A project of the utmost importance for the future of the Upper West Side, of New York City and, indeed, of the arts in America; a project with the potential to take a great place and make it a great good place, a welcoming place, a place without peer in all the cities of the world -- such a project should by now have generated tremendous public excitement.
It has not. Indeed, unless some production of "Aida" used a prop pinched from a pharaoh's tomb, one is hard put to explain the curse that seems to have fallen on Lincoln Center and its redevelopment project.
It all began well enough. Buoyed by the city's flush economy, Lincoln Center and its constituent organizations put together a list of their needs and wants, ranging from plumbing repairs to a new house for the New York City Opera.
Last summer, a constellation of designers and planners was assembled, among them the architect Frank Gehry and the landscape architect Laurie Olin. In charge was Rebecca Robertson, the celebrated stage mother of the New Times Square. The chairman of the project was Marshall Rose, a developer best known for his role in the transformation of Bryant Park in midtown. On Jan. 1, Lincoln Center itself acquired a new president in Gordon Davis, a real estate lawyer and former parks commissioner who had just found Jazz at Lincoln Center a ritzy new home with a Central Park view.
Three weeks later, things began to fall apart.
The Metropolitan Opera walked out. No sooner was it coaxed back on board than the project began leaking like a French man-of-war that had just run afoul of Jack Aubrey. News, or supposed news, was leaked of unseemly squabbles among the constituents, and of such unlikely notions as plowing up Damrosch Park for a new opera house and turning the main plaza into an enclosed suburban mall.
Though Lincoln Center could hardly be so self-absorbed as to count Sept. 11 as its own private misfortune, the blows that leveled the towers seemed to smash the center's hopes along with countless others. In rapid succession, both Mr. Davis and Mr. Rose resigned. The New York Times described a project board meeting that seemed to have ended an inch short of fisticuffs. Shortly afterward, the paper administered an editorial rap on the knuckles, advising the dysfunctional family to stop its bickering and content itself with such basic repairs as the present economy might permit. Not to be outdone, a writer in The Times Magazine suggested bulldozing the center and starting from scratch.
While the blame for some of these misfortunes might be laid at the door of a cave in Afghanistan, others had a local origin: the board's decision to shroud its work in secrecy. If we had been given even an inkling of the problems the planners hoped to solve -- not just of crumbling travertine, bad acoustics and backstage cramping but of intermittently splendid yet mostly sterile, wasted public space -- and of the marvelous transformations that a bit of inspired tweaking might achieve, there could have been a bubbling up of ideas, a ferment of debate.
Instead, there was a battle of leaks. Ignorant of what they might gain, New Yorkers could only fret about what they might lose.
The plan, or what is left of it, will soon be out in the open. Rushed into hard copy to meet the deadline for the first installment of a promised $240 million in city funds, the "Blueprint for the Future" has gaping holes. The big question of where to put a new home for the City Opera has been sidestepped, and the big idea of Mr. Gehry's undulating glass canopies -- not very mall-like after all -- has been scrapped. (Insiders charge both failures to the opposition of Joseph Volpe, the general manager of the Met.) Whether Avery Fisher Hall will be razed or merely gutted; where the new dormitory for the Juilliard School will go: these and other questions remain open. But the inspired tweakings are there, a myriad of details that add up to a livelier home for the lively arts.
Some of Lincoln Center's faults -- the acoustics of Avery Fisher Hall and of the New York State Theater in its makeshift role of opera house -- are well known. Others, less often discussed, may be more critical: not to critics, maybe, but to real people, even if their awareness of them has never risen above the level of the solar plexus.
Built as a fortress closed on three sides, Lincoln Center is hard to approach even on the fourth. Crossing 13 lanes of traffic on Broadway and Columbus Avenue can feel like fording a moat. Once inside, the newcomer is quickly lost among blank walls of travertine. Only 4 of the center's 13 constituents are in the great fountain's near orbit; the rest are in outer darkness, somewhere beyond the meteorite belt. Of the living, creative community that Lincoln Center actually is -- a place where 10,000 people study and create music, theater and dance -- one finds as much evidence as one would find on the moon.
No one disputes the magic of the center's main plaza just before 8 p.m. The place is luminous, filled with the wonderfully paradoxical movements of people hurrying toward their leisure. But most of the time it is deserted -- though not as thoroughly as Damrosch Park, which without an event is a two-and-a-half-acre manicured wasteland. Even the North Plaza, with its Henry Moore reflecting pool, often feels serene to the point of desolation. Attempts to enliven it with programming must contend with the awkward distribution of seats among the grid of trees in planter boxes -- just as, in the main plaza, the central fountain forces off-kilter, jerry-built stages for Midsummer Night Swing and Lincoln Center Out of Doors. In all the center's open spaces, a pounding sun can drive away all but those desperate for free culture at any price.
Mindful of these problems and a litany of others, the planning team has proposed a package of concepts intended to wake Lincoln Center's public spaces from a 40-year sleep. The big proposals have been shot down. Mr. Gehry's floating canopy over the plaza -- "the dome," to its detractors -- didn't last the summer. But a "galleria" flanking the west sides of the State Theater and Avery Fisher Hall held out until just before the final vote. (The project board has refused to release illustrations of the canopies, partly because they were rejected and partly because their Gehryesque form was only one of many possible incarnations: the project is still in the planning phase, with design work yet to be done. It should be noted, too, that the plan leaves the idea of a covering open for further exploration.)
Practically, the galleria would have provided climate-moderated space for a cafe, a restaurant and special events. Conceptually, it would have emphasized Lincoln Center's north-south axis: the broad crayon stroke from 65th Street to Damrosch Park that connects the constituents' scattered dots.
Happily, the planning team has proposed other, subtler means of making that connection. To begin with, 65th Street will be converted from autobahn underpass to living, breathing thoroughfare. (We use the future tense because it is convenient and evocative, but bear in mind that it describes one possible world: the improbable one in which the plan is adopted, financed and executed just as it stands.)
The overbuilt, underused Milstein Bridge will give way to a slender footbridge; its stone buttressing will fall, opening the North Plaza to the sidewalk in a broad series of steps, which the plan intends as a major entrance, rivaling the one on Columbus Avenue. But instead of the pomp of the plaza, this entrance will offer the intimacy of a campus quad or village green, a place where Ms. Robertson imagines "a girl reading a book while doing a plie." Students from Juilliard and the School of American Ballet, stagehands, bassoonists on breaks from rehearsals, lounging playwrights and lunching accountants will mingle; picture Washington Square, but greener and less louche. At the east end will be a bistro doing business from lunch time to late evening.
One of 65th Street's five lanes will be shaved away, leaving room for on-street, marquis-topped entrances to the theaters and for rehearsal spaces annexed to the theaters and to Avery Fisher Hall. In a delightful conceit that seems inspired partly by Javanese shadow puppets and partly by the MTV studio overlooking Times Square, the outer walls of these rehearsal spaces will be translucent, giving passersby dreamlike, abstract glimpses of work in progress. (Similar spaces may be tacked on to the east side of the State Theater.)
Following the axis southward, one will come upon a transformed Damrosch Park, its open spaces grassy, its plantings rich and strange. Two new entrances will open the park to Amsterdam Avenue. The old bandshell will have washed away, its place taken by a pacific grove of trees that will muffle outdoor music before it reaches touchy neighbors. As needed, a temporary bandshell will appear alongside the State Theater. (At least one of the plans for a new opera house in the park would have produced a similar outcome; by closing 62nd Street, it would actually have increased the usable area of the park by 2,300 square feet.)
The approach from Broadway will be transformed, too. Snagging visitors from the north, an aggrandized lobby for Alice Tully Hall will house a performing-arts bookstore to rival the nearby Tower Records and Barnes & Noble. Pedestrians approaching from the south will instead be drawn to a visitors' center sprouting from the east wall of the State Theater, its underground reaches housing two multifunction rooms and possibly a 300-seat theater.
In between, the grand approach to the main plaza will be made grander by dropping the service lane to street level, so that visitors may step dogelike into the majesty of the plaza without having to dodge taxis. Though the constituents felt that this majesty would be tainted by cafes or retail, caprice will have its place: a spiral staircase -- possibly a musical one, each step triggering a note or theme -- will lead down to the subway. Another at the far end of the plaza will descend to the parking-level concourse, which will somehow be made elegant and unbunkerlike.
To tame the tangle of traffic at the junction of Broadway and Columbus, two plans are being explored. One would pare away some asphalt and shorten the crossing by 40 feet. A second, more radical plan would extend the one-way segment of Broadway from 59th Street to 66th Street, creating an 80-foot-wide pedestrian promenade. Such a green strip would link Lincoln Center to Central Park -- the city's center of culture to its center of nature -- as the Lincoln Center Mall (an east-west greenway from the park to the center, proposed and disposed of in the 1950's) would have done, but in a way far more natural to New York. It would also link Lincoln Center to itself: that is, to the new home of Jazz at Lincoln Center in the AOL Time Warner complex now rising in Columbus Circle.
We have merely sketched some highlights of the "blueprint," a big, complex plan that deals with many things besides public space. As noted, the plan has some holes in it. Inevitably, it has some flaws as well.
Though its westward thrust is laudable, it doesn't thrust hard enough. The western wall of the acropolis remains blank and uninviting. Nothing has been proposed to enliven or increase foot traffic on 62nd Street, and even 65th Street's remaking relies on elements that are unlikely to be effective around the clock and throughout the year.
What is necessary, in our view, is to seed this institutional Sonora with retail and food services. To hazard an offhand example: a two-tiered cafe appended to the main Juilliard building could bring people into 65th Street at nearly all hours, offer a convenient mingling place for students and their future public, and make the pueblo cliff-face entrances to Juilliard and the Walter Reade Theater less forbidding. And this is a place where one of Mr. Gehry's dreaded curlicues (those not-yet-designs that sprout like fiddleheads all over the planning models) would be a form well suited to the function at hand.
IF Damrosch Park is now perceived as unsafe, putting deep dark woods at the Amsterdam Avenue end may only make matters worse. By contrast, a cafe opening onto Damrosch Park and Amsterdam would enliven both -- and would make more sense than the planned cafe at the east end of the park, which would get in the way of outdoor performances.
In case one feels that cafes are for young lovers, the westward edge of the park might also harbor a playground, something the neighborhood badly needs. Picture a place where children from Amsterdam Houses could roughhouse with polichinelles from the School of American Ballet, preteenagers needing to let off steam after a Young People's Concert and toddlers waiting for their siblings to emerge in a cloud of rosin dust from lessons at the Lucy Moses School. And why not make it a musical playground -- an aural wonderland where swings, seesaws and all manner of other contraptions are rigged to produce astonishing sounds -- at moderate volume, of course?
On the Broadway side, the planners might give some thought to controlling high-rise development. Like traffic flow, this is a municipal matter, but one on which Lincoln Center's prestige, financial clout and creativity could have a big impact. When Glenwood Properties' 29-story tower goes up at 1926 Broadway -- the site of the Saloon -- the last patch of sky visible as one looks east from the plaza will have vanished. Arguably, the present building should have been given landmark status; failing that, a determined effort by Lincoln Center and the city might have found a role for the center in the new building -- and curtailed its height. But the center's leaders seem hobbled by ambivalence. On one hand, they feel that the sky opposite the plaza has already been torn to shreds by existing towers. On the other hand, they are proud of the 50 high-rises that have gone up in the area since Lincoln Center's inception: as Mr. Davis, the former president, put it, "These buildings are our success."
The plan before us, though incomplete, is a fine one, worthy of lively debate and further inspired tweaking, which ought to ensue as city agencies and community groups get their licks in.
Far from being rendered trivial by the events of Sept. 11, the project is now more urgent than ever. It should be cheered and urged onward by everyone who cares about the future of the West Side, of New York City and of the arts in America, and who shares the ideals of freedom and diversity that everyone has been yammering about for the last three months.
In the architects' models in Ms. Robertson's office, the main plaza's current fountain is replaced by a golden egg. "Is this a joke?" she asked Mr. Gehry. His answer is unrecorded; but Lincoln Center is indeed a goose that lays golden eggs, valued at more than $1 billion a year, for New York's economy. In recent years, many of the world's major performing-arts centers have been renovated and updated. If Lincoln Center falls behind in its technical, artistic and social capacities -- if the goose is allowed to languish -- the present economic slump could become a helpless downward spiral. Conversely, a Lincoln Center that becomes, in Peter Martins's words, "one of the wonders of the world" -- a place whose energy attracts Danish tourists, strolling teenagers, black-clad downtowners and children from Amsterdam Houses -- will help ensure the vitality of New York for decades to come.
The prospects are not as bleak as one might think. Michael R. Bloomberg, the mayor-elect, is a member of Lincoln Center's board (recruited by his friend Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of the board, whose strength of will, worthy of a Donizetti queen, will no doubt color the coming drama). Mr. Davis is a member of the mayoral transition team, and his predecessor as the center's president, Nathan Leventhal, is its chairman.
In any case, so important are the open-space elements of the plan for developing new audiences, and for winning the hearts and minds of the community, that they should, in our view, be given precedence over everything but the most critical repairs.
In an age when city life is under attack from every quarter -- and now murderously, without quarter -- both the lively arts and lively public spaces are more precious and more necessary than ever. Let Lincoln Center be a place where people come to enjoy the pageant of their differences, as if this itself were art -- which, of course, it is.

City Opera Could Look Beyond Lincoln Center
SPAULDING: Tell me, Mr. Chandler, where are you planning on putting your new opera house?
CHANDLER: Oh, I thought I should like to put it somewhere near Central Park.
SPAULDING: I see. Why don't you put it right in Central Park?
CHANDLER: Could we do that?
SPAULDING: Sure, do it at night when no one is looking. Why don't you put it in the reservoir and get the whole thing over with? Of course, that might interfere with the water supply. But after all we must remember that art is art. Still, on the other hand, water is water, isn't it, and east is east and west is west, and if you take cranberries and stew them like applesauce, they taste much more like prunes than rhubarb does. Now, uh -- now you tell me what you know.
From the Marx Brothers
film "Animal Crackers"
In the chess game of urban revitalization, cultural institutions are high-value pieces. Sometimes there is strength in massing: on the Upper West Side, the phalanx of Lincoln Center has done good service. But the time may be ripe for a broader deployment.
Already, Jazz at Lincoln Center turns out to be a bishop, zipping down Broadway to Columbus Circle. The New York City Opera could be next to make a bold move.
Imagine: In the corner of Central Park abutting Columbus Circle, a glimmer of glass amid the foliage. An opera house married to nature, rife with greenery inside and out.
Impinge on Central Park? Well, the Metropolitan Museum did it, and no one is complaining. A new house for the City Opera is as worthy a cause and would need far less acreage. Indeed, offices for the City Opera, as well as storage and rehearsal space, could be found in 2 Columbus Circle, a building now vacant that the city has no idea what to do with.
Maybe this notion belongs only in a Marx Brothers farce. But Central Park is not the only park in town. Would a new opera house in Damrosch Park be less threatening to the Met if it were almost invisible? Half submerged in earth, with verdant ramparts leading to a verdant roof, such a house would, in any case, be less threatening to the public's sense of public space (even underused public space) than a more conventional building would be.
If a linear park is created in what is now the northbound side of Broadway between Columbus Circle and Lincoln Center, some sites that are now too small for an opera house -- like the Saloon site, now marked for an overbearing tower -- might accommodate a structure that extends into the promenade.
Perhaps, though, one's main objective in the urban chess game should be to open Lincoln Center to the west. In that case, rather than follow the jazz bishop down Broadway, the City Opera could take the role of knight. With a jogging leap to the west it could gallantly open the region bordering Hell's Kitchen to the influences of culture and commerce.
Alas, the one nearby and available site on Amsterdam Avenue, the one now occupied by the American Red Cross, is too small to cram a modern opera house into. But three or four jumps would take our knight to the Hudson River. Here, perhaps on a pier over the water, an opera house might rise to rival Sydney's. To make this workable, shuttle buses would have to link the new house to Lincoln Center and its subway stop. For those preferring to hoof it, a safe and appealing route would have to be found or created.

Surveying New York's Art World

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM ZIMMER 

 BODY:
THE Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art performs an important service with "Best of the Season: Selected Highlights from the 2000-01 Manhattan Exhibition Season," its annual display of work from the New York art world. The offerings of that world can be daunting; this exhibition helps make them more approachable.
 This year the curators have chosen work that seems more traditional than that picked in recent years. There is only one video piece, for example. 
 In that work, Christian Marclay focuses his camera relentlessly on an amplified electric guitar being dragged along a Texas highway. In this context, the guitar recalls a sleek race car, but it also summons up an era in which destroying instruments was part of some bands' acts. Mr. Marclay works with great economy; the experience is the same whether a viewer sees 10 seconds of the video or 10 minutes.
The show has some surprises. Conventional wisdom has it that abstract painting is dead, unless the abstraction incorporates some kind of narrative, but the work of a couple of pure abstractionists has been chosen.
Terry Haggerty makes paintings consisting only of stripes that recall minimal painting of the 1960's and 1970's. The effect, though, is very fresh. Paul Brown builds up layers of pigment, and small breaks in the surface reveal the layers underneath. This falls in the category of Process Art, in which the process of making the painting is revealed and is the work's only subject.
The most compelling piece in the exhibition is "Targets," by Joyce Kozloff. 
The work is in the form of a huge globe that viewers can enter. Ms. Kozloff was associated with Pattern Painting, an art movement of the late 1970's and early 1980's that was built on the premise that decorative motifs could be high art. There is patterning on the inside of the globe, but it is purposeful: maps of sites all over the world that the United States has bombed since World War II. It is chilling to see, because some of these places are in the headlines these days. Moreover, being inside the globe, a world turned inside out, creates a feeling of vulnerability.
Andres Serrano's large photographs are meant to carry an emotional charge. He can push his point to an extreme, as in pictures featuring African-American men. One is dressed in a Santa Claus suit; the other wears Ku Klux Klan robes.
The exhibition has its share of figurative art. Verne Dawson's people are usually somewhat Neanderthal but there are moments of elegance, like his depiction of men doing acrobatics on the backs of bulls.
In two panoramic paintings, Mr. Dawson imagines a prehistoric, pastoral and idyllic world. In each painting, a large form, a combination of nature and architecture dominates. The tower of Babel might come to mind.
The exhibition works mostly because the curators found a lot of modest, intimately scaled pieces. These include Jane Harris's drawings of pleasing yet mysterious shapes formed by a heavy application of graphite.
Yun-Fei Ji displays a lighter touch with evocations of traditional Chinese landscapes with their grey-green background. Yet the content of these pictures is strong; they include modern, industrial objects as well as familiar landscape elements and mythological creatures. The result is a bold combination of myth and modern life.
Tim Gardner's watercolors are so crisp and luminous that a viewer inevitably thinks they are color photographs. His "Home at Christmas" is as cozy as it sounds. The snow outside the suburban house festooned with lights has a palpable crust. 
Some works that embody a simple domesticity also underscore the inherent modesty of the show. Swatch by swatch, Polly Apfelbaum has built a floor piece that evokes a circular hooked rug, but a luxurious one. The pieces are made of dyed velvet. Roy McMakin's two untitled chests of drawers each have something wrong with them. One has no knobs and the other oversized drawers. A similar frustrating sense of daily life discord was mined decades ago by Richard Artschwager.
In an installation separate from "Best of the Season," Jordan Tinker, a Ridgefield native, has doctored the photographs in his 1986 high school yearbook, making them vague and ghostly. Despite an elaborate presentation, nostalgia for high school is too flat-footed a notion to resonate as art.
"Best of the Season: Selected Highlights from the 2000-01 Manhattan Exhibition Season," remains at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, 258 Main Street, Ridgefield, (203) 438-4519, through Dec. 30.

9/11 as Tax Hike Rationale

BYLINE:  By DEBRA WEST 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
FACING a dire state economic forecast and increased security costs related to the threat of terrorism, Westchester County Executive Andrew J. Spano has proposed a budget for 2002 that would increase the property tax levy by 9.5 percent, the largest county tax increase in 12 years.
 If approved by the County Legislature in December, it would be the first property tax levy increase of Mr. Spano's tenure. During the previous three years, Mr. Spano, a Democrat, has reduced the property tax levy by 7.8 percent. 
 "This is directly related to Sept. 11," Mr. Spano said. "It affected our economy, which affected our sales tax and our hotel taxes. We're getting less money from the state, not that I'm blaming them, they have got their own problems, but it's money we are not getting."
Mr. Spano's proposed $1.3 billion budget for 2002 includes an $89.4 million increase in spending. Under the proposal, the amount of money raised by county property taxes would be $370.5 million, compared with $338 million for 2001 and $357 for 2000. 
Katherine S. Carsky, a Republican legislator, said the expansion of county government personnel and programs in the last three years had contributed to the need to raise taxes. 
"It is obviously a budget that a lot of people want to shave," Ms. Carsky said. "The increase is above what has been cut over the last three years. It would have been nice if government had the foresight to reserve revenues and not grow government during the good times, but the time-honored tradition is to expand in good years and then you have to restrict." 
Westchester set aside a surplus in the boom years, Mr. Spano said, and $70.8 million of that will be used in the 2002 budget to keep the tax increase from being more than double what is proposed.
The largest part of the budget increase, $55.4 million, Mr. Spano said, can be attributed to an increase in the cost of state and federally mandated programs like special services for preschool children with disabilities, Medicaid and retirement expenses. While the costs are increasing, the state subsidy to Westchester was scheduled to be cut by $5.2 million even before Sept. 11. 
The proposed budget also includes an increase of $13.4 million in spending for public health and safety related to the Sept. 11 attacks. The costs include salaries and expenses for 55 new police officers to be stationed at the Westchester County Airport, in 10 round-the-clock positions, so that the airport can meet the Federal Aviation Administration's standard of high alert, and 23 other new police officers to be stationed in sensitive locations throughout the county like government buildings in White Plains. The county is also creating 28 new positions in public health, criminal justice and scientific laboratories that test for anthrax and other health threats. 
The county's debt service costs increased by $4.9 million, largely because of maintenance projects, acquisition of parkland and a $500,000 increase in insurance costs directly related to the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Spano said.
A series of public hearings was held last month to give residents a chance to comment on the budget. Legislators are scheduled to vote on the budget Dec. 10, but Richard G. Wishnie, the chairman of the Budget and Appropriations Committee, said there was so much work to be done on the budget that the vote might be postponed.
"I think we will meet every day to try and soften the impact of 9.5 percent," Mr. Wishnie, a Democrat, said. "This is not about politics. This is about democracy. The people we work for, our constituents, recognize that these are highly unusual times."
As part of the budget, Mr. Spano announced he would save money in the following ways: by closing the Playland Ice Casino at the end of the spring hockey season, instead of keeping it open year round to save $793,000; freezing the salaries of all nonunion employees; continuing a hiring freeze that was begun in October; cutting employees' travel, meals and educational expense budgets by 10 percent; using staff employees who earn an average of $67,000 instead of outside contractors, who earn between $105,000 and $144,000, for the Department of Information and Technology.
While they may not welcome a tax increase, Mr. Spano predicted that Westchester residents would understand the need for one.
"Most people I talk to realize that we are in better shape than most places," he said. "We're not Suffolk or Nassau. We still have our triple-A bond rating which I'm very proud of."

HEADLINE: Island's Airports Win a Partial Reprieve 

BYLINE:  By DIANA SHAMAN 

DATELINE: EAST FARMINGDALE 

 BODY:
FRANK HANAN, who was polishing his blue-and-white single-engine Hawk parked near the Republic Airport terminal here, had not heard the news.
 A day earlier, on Thanksgiving Day, the Federal Aviation Administration issued an air traffic waiver for Republic and three other New York-area airports, Caldwell, Morristown and Lincoln Park in New Jersey, all of which lie within a 20-mile ring of Kennedy International Airport. The waiver lifted a restriction that had kept pilots who were not instrument-rated from flying in and out of the four airports. 
 "This news is 9 on the scale of 10," said Mr. Hanan, a manufacturer of frozen deserts who flies for both business and pleasure. "Free gas would make it a 10." 
Lifting the restriction meant that all of the small airplanes based at Republic could fly again. Normally, they number 520, but about 100 were relocated during two brief escape periods granted by the F.A.A. in September and early October. The rest, unless flown by instrument-rated pilots, had to stay put. 
With over 200,000 annual takeoffs and landings, Republic is one of the busiest airports in New York State, but activity had decreased 60 percent under the F.A.A. restriction, Hugh D. Jones, the airport director, said. Most of the pilots who used Republic are weekend recreational flyers who are not instrument-rated, he explained.
The precipitous drop in air traffic hit hard at Republic's businesses like fuel suppliers and maintenance shops. Mr. Jones said that many elected officials and regional F.A.A officials, recognizing the economic impact of the reduced activity, had worked hard on Republic's behalf to win the waiver. 
The F.A.A. has gradually been easing restrictions it imposed on the national airspace following the terrorist attacks. Normal operations, including flight instruction, had resumed at all other Long Island airports on Sept. 21. At Republic, the Island's only airport within the 20-mile ring around Kennedy, limited operations under instrument flight rules as well as flight instruction were able to resume Oct. 6. 
Instrument flight rules require that a flight plan has to be filed at least an hour before takeoff and that the plane operates under the scrutiny of air traffic controllers at all times. Visual flight rules do not require a flight plan and give pilots more freedom to steer their own courses. 
Although he is instrument-rated, Mr. Hanan reveled in his new freedom. "Now I don't have to fly a very specific route," he said. "I can just go flying." 
The good news for many was not good news for all. All private planes continue to be barred from the 20-mile zone around Kennedy except on a case-by-case basis. The same restriction on private planes is in place around Boston and Washington.
Because of the 20-mile restriction at Kennedy, all of New York City is off limits to private aircraft. Bob Filonuk is worried about his job as the pilot for a Wall Street investor who used to commute from Republic to the East River by seaplane.
"I've been flying into the East River for 20 years," Mr. Filonuk said. "The tower knows me, everyone knows me, and all at once we are a threat?"
Before Sept. 11, private planes could enter the controlled space around Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark Airports with the permission of air-traffic control, keeping to certain altitudes that did not conflict with commercial airliners. 
Now that private planes are locked out, flying westward from Long Island presents problems. Pilots must head 20 miles south over water -- particularly risky for single-engine planes -- or north over Danbury, Conn.
But the restoration of normalcy at Republic is a big step forward, and it came in the nick of time for many -- but not all -- of the businesses, Mr. Jones, the airport director, said. 
"I've been asked how many have gone out of business, and I haven't heard of any giving up, but I've heard them say another week or another month," Mr. Jones said.
The 50 businesses on airport property have a total work force of about 1,000 people. The companies include flight schools and rental operations, fuel suppliers and maintenance shops, and even a museum with fly-by demonstrations by World War II aircraft. Some have been helped by the recent F.A.A action, but others are still in trouble.
One of them is Skytypers, which has been in business for 32 years, delivering commercial messages written in smoke, mostly in the skies over and near Manhattan.
"We primarily do our work in New York during the playoffs, the World Series, the marathon and football games at Giants Stadium," said Mort Arken, who owns the business with his son, Larry, an American Airlines captain. Skytypers employs 15 pilots part time, most of them retired veterans. "Now none of them are working for me," Mort Arken said. "We lost the entire fall season, and I pray to God that by spring the airspace over New York is open. We are hurting bad."
Also still affected is Island Aerial Ads based at Brookhaven Calabro Airport in Shirley. Island Aerial tows advertising banners along the Island's beaches during the summer season and operates two traffic planes year round. Now because of Kennedy's no-fly zone, the two traffic planes can report only on eastern Long Island, said Paul F. Calabro, the owner of the 18-year-old company. And his principal business, towing banners, is in jeopardy. His season starts on Memorial Day. If the restriction around Kennedy continue next spring, Mr. Calabro said, "it will put us out of business."
For other businesses, the lifting of the Republic restriction signaled another step toward normalcy. 
"This is beautiful weather, and if it stays like this we can probably rejuvenate and recover some of our losses," said Norbert Koenig, a co-owner of Nassau Flyers in East Farmingdale, a flight school and rental operation with 27 airplanes.
At the neighboring American Airpower Museum, attendance had dropped by as much as 30 percent because its planes couldn't go up on demonstration flights. "This is the best news we've had since Sept. 11," a museum spokesman said.
The day before Thanksgiving, Edward Libassi, the owner of A&P Aircraft Maintenance at MacArthur, a business he started 30 years ago, had only one week's worth of work waiting, compared with the normal six weeks' worth. He had moved from Brookhaven Calabro to MacArthur in May 2000, and "it was phenomenal for me until Sept. 11," he said.
Then after the terrorist attacks, customers trapped at Republic had not been able to get their aircraft to his shop for maintenance or annual inspections, he explained. 
Now with the restriction at Republic lifted, "it should bring some normality back for people who fly for enjoyment and just want to punch holes in the sky on a Saturday morning," he said. "It's going to help everything all the way around."
Bob E. Gordon, the president of the 1,000-member Republic Airport Pilots Association, said he hoped that general aviation on Long Island would be back to normal soon.
"I understand their concerns, but general aviation was not involved in the Sept. 11 attacks, and a typical private plane weighs less than a car, so does it really pose much of a threat?" he said.
But few people expect that all the freedom given to private aircraft before Sept. 11 will be entirely restored. "From a personal standpoint, it's sad," said Gene Portela, the general manager of Eastway Aircraft Services, a maintenance and parts company at MacArthur. "You used to be able to get into a plane and fly up the Hudson River past the Statue of Liberty. It was terrific. But those days are gone forever."
A lot of the fun has gone out of flying, said Jim Zambik, the owner of Zambik Aviation, a flight school at Spadaro Airport in East Moriches. "But national security comes before personal freedoms, so I don't see any easy answers," he said.
Bob Schaefer, a recreational pilot who is not instrument-rated, echoed that sentiment. He flies his single-engine Cessna up from Tryon, N.C, to Republic at least twice a year to visit his mother in Brooklyn and his sister in Dix Hills, he said. This Thanksgiving, he arrived before the restriction was lifted at Republic, so he flew into Trenton and rented a car.
"It's pretty selfish to complain," he said. "We may have lost a little bit of our 100 percent freedom, but driving an extra 20 miles for the sake of national security is a small thing when you remember Sept. 11 and how many people lost their lives."

HEADLINE: SENIORITY; 
Still ShowingOlder Workers the Door

BYLINE:  By FRED BROCK; Fred Brock is an editor at The Times. His column on the approach and arrival of retirement appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: fbrock@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
LESS than two years ago -- in the midst of one of the tightest labor markets ever -- companies were warned that they faced dire consequences if they discriminated against older workers. The reason? As vast numbers of baby boomers begin to retire in a decade or so, there will not be enough younger workers to replace them.
 In her book "Age Works: What Corporate America Must Do to Survive the Graying of the Workforce" (Free Press, 2000, $25), Beverly Goldberg contended that even if the economy turned sour, the labor shortage would ease only temporarily. 
 Well, here we are in a sour economy. Has corporate America heeded the warnings of Ms. Goldberg and others about ageism? Apparently not. 
Two years hence, when displaced-worker reports on the current downturn are in, they are likely to show that older workers bore the brunt of layoffs. At least that's the expectation of Marjorie Honig, who along with Michele Siegel and Charlotte Muller prepared a recent report -- "The Incidence of Job Loss: The Shift From Younger to Older Workers, 1981-1996" -- for the International Longevity Center-USA, a research organization affiliated with the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan.
The report concludes that older workers have cause to worry, based on what happened in the last two recessions, in 1981-82 and in the early 1990's. In the earlier recession, the job-loss rates for men 45 to 59 years old were 40 percent lower than those for men 25 to 39. In the recession of the early 1990's, however, the job-loss rates of older workers were just as high as those of younger workers. (Interestingly, and for unclear reasons, such a change was not found among women in the work force: in both recessions, layoff rates were higher among younger women.)
"The data aren't available on what's happening now, but it's my gut feeling that what we see from the previous two recessions is a trend," said Dr. Honig, chairwoman of the economics department at Hunter College and co-director of research for the longevity center.
"Many employers are using the current downturn as an excuse to get rid of older workers," she added. Under the guise of restructuring, she said, they are usually able to get around age-discrimination laws. 
Dr. Honig echoed Ms. Goldberg's point that the downturn was temporary but that the looming labor shortage was not. "Companies are going to need those older workers," Dr. Honig said. "They're going to need that experience."
Why are companies so shortsighted when it comes to older workers?
"In part, it's probably because many companies take a short-term view generally, looking from quarter to quarter in terms of shareholders and profits," she said. "If you cut a bunch of workers, especially higher-paid older workers, your profits look better. But there will be trouble in the long term."
Another factor, Dr. Honig said, is that companies have broken an implied long-term contract they used to have with workers. A worker would stay with one company for an entire career because of the understanding that workers would accept lower wages when they were young in exchange for higher wages when they were older, even though they might be performing at a less robust rate.
"This was good for the company," she said, "because that lure of higher wages later kept workers' job performance high."
"Now that's all gone out the window," Dr. Honig added. "But as a result, younger workers are ruthless in demanding higher wages. And they're right, because they don't expect to be with one company more than 5 or 10 years. So now a company has to pay through the nose to attract younger workers, because there's no expectation the company will keep them, as was the case under the old implicit contract."
Theodore Roszak, the author of "Longevity Revolution: As Boomers Become Elders" (Berkeley Hills Books, 2001, $15), also sees the current situation as temporary.
He says that as the population grows older, age discrimination will be addressed more seriously and the nation will develop firm rules that will allow older workers to keep their jobs.
"Often, age discrimination is the result of fashion, style, appearance and false assumptions about who should be working and holding jobs," Mr. Roszak said. "But these make no demographic sense and must be overcome as we become an older society."
Dr. Robert N. Butler, president of the International Longevity Center, noted that under current law, the age at which workers can retire and collect full Social Security benefits was being raised to 67 from 65. In addition, there are proposals to raise it further, even to 70.
"So here we are, facing a delay in Social Security benefits because of age, and at the same time facing age discrimination at work," he said. "That's a problem."
Dr. Butler said that in this age of longevity, one of the most important tasks was to keep extra "human capital" working.
"In the 20th century, we gained an additional 30 years of life," he added. "It took the preceding 50 centuries to do that. That's extraordinary."

HEADLINE: EDUCATION; 
High School on a College Campus

BYLINE:  By MERRI ROSENBERG 

DATELINE: HARTSDALE 

 BODY:
HAZEL PARNELL is hoping that her 14-year-old daughter will be one of the lucky ones. A select group of ninth graders from Irvington, Harrison and Woodlands High Schools will be taking their classes on the campus of the State University of New York at Purchase starting Jan. 28. 
 As members of the first class of the Westchester Magnet Academy, these 60 students -- 30 from Greenburgh Central 7's district, home to Woodlands, and the rest from Irvington and Harrison -- will participate in a program that combines academic curriculum with hands-on activities, a component that is modeled on aspects of the Outward Bound program, community service and arts classes taught by SUNY Purchase faculty. 
 Under the terms of a $2 million, three-year federal grant, these ninth-grade students will be the first graduating class in what will become a four-year high school. By last week, about 30 students -- all from the Greenburgh district -- had applied, and parents and students were invited to presentations about the magnet program. 
"This reflects a hands-on integrated approach to learning that would appeal to some students," said Joseph DeGennaro, assistant principal at Irvington High School. "It's really offered for students who want to branch out and try a different style of learning." 
The grant is part of the Magnet Schools Assistance Program, which is financed by the United States Department of Education. It is meant to promote equity and achievement for all students. Part of the grant's purpose here is to bring together students from diverse backgrounds to learn in a challenging setting. While the grant expires after three years, program administrators said they expected to be able to renew it as long as the school is successful. The academy may also have access to financing from New York State's magnet program and from the students' home districts.
The Westchester Magnet Academy is an unusual innovation for a county where loyalty to home school districts tends toward the extreme. In the recent past, efforts to consolidate smaller high schools into a larger entity, or even to develop a selective county-wide high school that would bring together the top students from districts like Chappaqua, Scarsdale, Byram Hills and Bronxville, along with White Plains, Yonkers and Katonah-Lewisboro, have not made much progress. Some local districts have feared that such programs, which would siphon off the top academic performers, would harm their competitive status for the most selective college admissions.
"It's neither an alternative for higher end kids or kids who can't cope with normal high school," said Dr. Donald A. Howard, superintendent of the Harrison public schools. "This is for any kid who is ready and willing to experience something radically different, that involves kids very personally in their own destiny. I had been looking for an alternative path for kids to get their high school diploma. There are a lot of kids who march to a different drummer, and this could be a better experience for them." 
For Mrs. Parnell, whose daughter is interested, the appeal is obvious. "I think it's an excellent program that's good for the community," she said. "The magnet school has a lot to offer. My daughter loves art and music and drama. I'm hoping she gets in." 
One unusual feature of this magnet program is that it links an ethnically and economically diverse district like Greenburgh Central 7 with more affluent districts like Irvington and Harrison.
As Jennifer Dolan-Waldman, assistant superintendent of Irvington said: "We want to provide a strong, viable academically strong high school alternative. When you have a small district, it's hard for students to find a wide range of options. This had very different goals than having a Westchester Stuyvesant. People move to Westchester for the good schools. This is not just a school for an elite bunch of children. It's more for the students not to be in such isolation." 
Not every parent is enthusiastic about the idea. "If it were for the academically elite, I'd consider it," said one Irvington parent, who spoke only if she were not identified. "When I looked at this, and saw that it wasn't screening on academics, I was baffled."
The current ninth grade classes number about 250 students in Harrison, 125 in Irvington and 140 at Woodlands. Even though the program will be run at SUNY Purchase, where the students will be able to benefit directly from its strong arts program, those who run the magnet program point out that the high school students will still be taking required Regents exams and meeting all New York State standards. The magnet academy's four teachers will be responsible for instruction in social studies, science, mathematics and English; SUNY professors will provide classes in the arts.
Josephine Moffett, superintendent of the Greenburgh Central 7 district who, as superintendent in Freeport on Long Island supervised the development of four magnet schools, said: "We want to be giving parents choices. And when I spoke with the students from the student government team, they talked about wanting instruction to be innovative and challenging." 
That would mean, for example, that students studying earth science or biology could map a stream, analyze the mineral content of its silt and sand, as well as the types of rocks and rock formations found along the stream bed, and report the findings using mathematics and scientific techniques. Students working on a social studies and language arts project might adopt an older person, conduct an oral history and produce a biographical report incorporating historical and cultural perspectives, as well as the individual's personal experiences.
For now, and under terms of the grant, the slots in the academy are restricted to students from the three participating districts. Students will receive transportation from their homes to the SUNY Purchase campus and be able to participate in extracurricular activities at their home district high schools.
Students will be selected for the magnet program solely on interest and motivation, based on applications that will be screened starting Dec. 10. Each student will be assigned a laptop computer as part of the focus on using technology in daily learning. The college's science and computer laboratories, as well as performance studios, will be available for the students. They will receive high school diplomas from their schools, in addition to a certificate of completion from the magnet academy.
"I do think it's interesting to have three districts collaborate among themselves, and to collaborate with a college," said Janet Walker, executive director of the Westchester-Putnam School Boards Association. "This opportunity may spark an excitement in learning. It'll be interesting to see what develops."

HEADLINE: And the Winner Is: Patchogue! 

BYLINE:  By ELISSA GOOTMAN

DATELINE: PATCHOGUE 

 BODY:
SWANLIKE young women in glittering gowns floated onto the stage. A man in a tuxedo belted out "Fly Me to the Moon." An audience of hundreds gazed at the spectacle, beaming. 
 Hollywood? Vegas? Atlantic City? 
 Try Patchogue. This Suffolk County village, which has for years been grappling with the question of how to revitalize its sadly quiet downtown, last week hosted its most glittering event: the Miss New York USA and Miss New York Teen USA pageants. 
"I think we all deep down inside want to be Miss America, or better yet, Miss Universe," said Karen V. Gole, a real estate broker from Patchogue, grinning broadly last Sunday as she waited for the coronation ceremony to begin. "Finally we get to see the girls in person." 
Ms. Gole's 35 years have included countless hours in front of the television watching beauty pageants. On Sunday, she slipped on a sparkly red shirt and rhinestone-encrusted boots and arrived at the Patchogue Theater for the Performing Arts on East Main Street with her 12-year-old niece, Marlana King, in tow.
They settled into their plush seats for what the two agreed was the greatest thing to happen to Patchogue since the Christmas parade, which had been the highlight of the local calendar.
"Nothing happens here," Marlana sniffed. 
That is precisely the point, say those who hope that events like the Miss New York USA pageant, which in recent years had been held in Albany, will breathe life into Patchogue, a once-bustling downtown that now has too many empty storefronts and too few customers. 
"An event like this just gets more people thinking about coming to Patchogue, to go shopping or to get a sandwich," said Michael Hollander, president of the Long Island Convention and Visitors Bureau and Sports Commission. "The name Patchogue gets on the map. People start to know that Patchogue exists."
The Miss New York USA pageant and its undercard, the Miss New York Teen USA contest, are contracted to take place here for the next two years, and Mr. Hollander and others are trying to bring the Miss USA pageant, the next level of the competition, to Long Island as well. (It's scheduled for next March in lovely Gary, Ind.) The pinnacle is the Miss Universe contest. On Long Island someday? Who knows?
"You want to get branded as being a positive place," Mr. Hollander said. "And something like this brands you." 
No doubt. But the important news, of course, is that the new Miss New York USA, beating out 30 other contestants, is Karla Cavalli, and she's from Mineola. 
Contestants in beauty pageants fall into two groups: those who are pageant people, and those who are not. The pageant people have previously found themselves wearing a bikini and heels in front of a crowd of strangers, and are likely to be in such a position in the future.
Miss Cavalli, a sweet-faced 25-year-old blonde with the major advantage of having a boyfriend who is a hairstylist at an upscale Manhattan salon, is a pageant person.
"She's just a natural," said her mother, Vicki Cavalli, who stood by as her daughter competed in pageant after pageant, winning Miss Long Island in the Miss America pageant circuit a couple of years ago. Her latest title is part of the rival Miss USA constellation.
"She doesn't need much coaching," said Mrs. Cavalli, who is from England. "If you notice, she has an elegance about her, a grace. It's the English part of her." 
Miss Cavalli's father, Ernesto, an Italian by birth and the manager of Due, a restaurant on the Upper East Side, had a different perspective. "Great gal, great heart," he said, whispering, "It's the Italian in her."
When not attending beauty contests, Miss Cavalli is a professional dancer for the New Jersey Nets basketball team.
"This is huge for me and huge for my career," she said, packing up her Russian Red lipstick and tanning spray in the theater dressing room. "I'm really, really excited." 
And what about Patchogue? 
"A big event in a small town like this is good, because it's giving back to the community," she said. "It's more all-American, supporting the small-business man type of thing." 
The other winner last weekend -- Marley DelDuchetto, 16, of Syracuse, the new Miss New York Teen -- is definitely not a pageant person, according to her father, Ernest, who was beaming Sunday evening in spite of himself.
"She's not going to be in any more pageants," declared Mr. DelDuchetto, who allowed his daughter to compete for Miss New York Teen USA only after she convinced him it would help her get into Yale. "I don't believe in pageants."
Miss DelDuchetto's mother, Debra, said the new family pageant moratorium did not apply to the Miss Teen USA pageant in August, and insisted that her husband was warming up to the notion of the pageant.
"Once he saw it in action, he really felt positive and knows that she's going to have a great year," Mrs. DelDuchetto said. 
It might have helped that Miss DelDuchetto told her father, a lawyer, about Carolyn M. Wright, a Yale junior who competed for Miss New York. 
Miss Wright, a theater studies major from upstate Guilderland, acknowledged that some of her classmates were a bit taken aback when she first mentioned the pageant. But they came around.
"They're very performance-oriented, so they considered this another form of performance," Miss Wright said. Plus, she figured the experience could be considered research for her playwrighting seminar. 
"Maybe somebody will end up in a story sometime," she shrugged. 
There is no talent component to the Miss New York contest. Which served some of the contestants well, by their own admission. Instead, there were swimsuit competitions, evening gown competitions and brief personal interviews by a panel of judges.
The judges, among them the Brookhaven town supervisor, John Jay LaValle; K. T. Mills, a radio program host on WALK-FM; and a Westchester County chiropractor, fired a motley collection of questions intended to ensure that the winner will be able to carry on a conversation with politicians and fourth-graders alike.
"What is your greatest fear?"
"If you were on the television show 'Survivor,' what luxury item would you bring?"
When Nicole Vought of Rockaway was asked, "What would you do if we held a celebrity charity auction, and a total loser shelled out $5,000 for the honor of dining with you?" she responded: "I might like him, I might not think he's a loser."
It seemed like a good answer, but Miss Vought did not place.
As the contestants waited to be interviewed at the Wyndham Wind Watch Hotel in Hauppauge, where they stayed for the weekend, some of them sought advice from a true pageant mom. 
"It's good to have a coach, and I'll tell you why: they have experience," said Gladys Colon, 41, whose daughter, Gloria Sophia Almonte, 18, of the Bronx, relinquished her Miss New York Teen crown Sunday evening. "It's a tough job. Everybody sees the glamour."
Ms. Colon had a litany of complaints: the pageant was disorganized, the judges' panel lacked racial diversity and Miss DelDuchetto was allowed to sing the national anthem at the start of Sunday's ceremony. 
"All the girls on the stage had their mouths open when that young lady got up to sing," Ms. Colon said. "Judges are human." 
The pageant director, Lauren M. Malis, said the judges might have all been white, but they are "well-rounded individuals who deal with all walks of life and all kinds of people every day." And it was the pageant's producer and choreographer, Miss Malis said, who asked if any of the contestants could sing upon learning moments before the ceremony that the professional singer hired for the job had been in a car accident. 
"I was just as surprised as everyone else," Miss Malis said, adding that she did not believe the judges took Miss DelDuchetto's vocal skills into account.
"That doesn't bear any judgment, whether a girl can sing or not," she said. "We don't have talent in this pageant." 
The event was Miss Malis's debut as director of the New York pageants. Miss Malis, 33, a former Miss Connecticut who has directed the Miss Connecticut USA pageant for two and a half years, said she strove to transform the New York pageant from an Albany-based event where the contestants ("delegates," they are called) performed in a hotel ballroom.
"I was looking to change the venue, change the type of production that had been in the past and give it a face lift," said Miss Malis, who runs a public relations agency in Manhattan. "I love Long Island." 
Through her former job with the Empire State Development Corporation, Miss Malis got to know the Long Island Grucci family, of fireworks fame. She asked Donna Grucci Butler, president of Fireworks by Grucci, to help judge the Miss Connecticut USA pageant, and talked to her about moving the New York pageant to Long Island.
"Donna said, 'You have to see this theater,' " said Miss Malis, who toured several Long Island venues but quickly settled on the Patchogue theater. "I was like, 'This is magnificent.' And this town, it's postcard perfect. If you had to pick this little American town, Patchogue would be it."
The Patchogue Theater for the Performing Arts is easily the jewel of village, and many local leaders and residents have seen it as the village's saving grace, the Main Street magnet with the potential to bring the crowds back downtown. With this in mind, the village has recently spent some $6 million renovating the theater, which opened in 1923 as a vaudeville house and changed with the times, becoming a single-screen movie theater and, later, a multiplex that eventually failed. 
In the past couple of years, there have been plays, concerts and dance recitals. After a dispute with the Gateway Playhouse, a Bellport production company that wanted to manage the theater, the village has now taken the job into its own hands.
Anthony D. Sala, 24, owns Salabella's Pizzeria and Cafe across the street from the theater. He renovated the restaurant, adding marble-dusted tables, optimistic that the theater will work its magic. Anything that brings the outsiders in and the residents down will be good for business, he said. 
"People come, they see the town, it's a nice little village," Mr. Sala said, preparing a meatball sub for a police officer. "Patchogue's starting to die out. We need to bring it back to life."
Vincent J. Grucci, president of the Patchogue Chamber of Commerce and a nephew of Donna Grucci Butler, was ecstatic. "The history books this past weekend were written," he crowed. "And the line is that when the pageant decided to change its location, forever in the books will be that the Incorporated Village of Patchogue was chosen as its new home."
But a lack of local hotel rooms sent most of the economic ripples elsewhere, mainly to the Wyndham. Though 800 spectators showed up for the final judging on Sunday, there was a measure of disappointment in the pizzeria that more people did not stop in for a slice or an espresso, and that the glitz was largely confined to the theater itself. 
"I was expecting limos and busloads of girls hopping out in bikinis," said Krystal L. Schweimler, 17, who works at Salabella's. "We just see big officials and people walking around in suits." 
Nonetheless, Miss Schweimler, a senior at nearby Patchogue-Medford High School, had jumped at the chance to serve as an usher.
"I think it's exciting," she said. "We don't have stuff like this." 
Mr. Sala had urged her to enter, but Miss Schweimler had demurred. Maybe next year, she said.

HEADLINE: Where More Is Less in Political Representation 

BYLINE:  By DONNA KUTT NAHAS 

DATELINE: BALDWIN 

 BODY:
AS Albany legislators armed with the latest census figures take up the once-a-decade task of reconfiguring legislative districts, some civic groups are pursuing campaigns to unify communities split among multiple representatives and divided by district lines.
 Nowhere is the problem felt more acutely than in Baldwin, a South Shore hamlet that is a jigsaw puzzle of legislative districts. 
 Baldwin's representation in the House of Representatives is split between Peter T. King and Carolyn McCarthy; in the state Senate between Dean G. Skelos and Charles J. Fuschillo Jr.; in the state Assembly among Earlene Hill, Kathleen Murray and Robert Barra; and in the Nassau County Legislature among Patrick Williams, Joseph Scannell and Michael Zapson. Aside from the United States Senate, the only legislative body in which Baldwin is not split between districts is the Hempstead Town Board, where Anthony Santino is the hamlet's only councilman.
With multiple lawmakers at almost all levels of government, residents say they are insufficiently represented by people whose focus is Baldwin and its interests. Adapting arguments made in the lawsuit that turned Hempstead's at-large town council arrangement into a district system last year, they say the system amounts to a dilution of the voting power of Baldwin's 32,000 residents. 
"If the community is dissatisfied with its representation, voters are free to exercise the power of the ballot box to either reward or punish that representative," said Doris R. Duffy, a member of the Baldwin Community Association and chairwoman of a committee on legislative redistricting. "But Baldwin cannot reward or punish because we are so carved up. Our votes do not mean as much as an entire village or area that is completely represented by one legislator."
Baldwin's problem was exemplified prior to a renovation of the hamlet's Long Island Rail Road station in 1999. Late in the planning, community groups learned that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority proposed to overhaul the station in a style clashing with plans for Baldwin's downtown revitalization project, featuring antique-styled lighting and benches. The M.T.A.'s plans were brought in line with the community's only after residents contacted the town's two state senators and three assembly members.
Like 31 other places in the Town of Hempstead alone, Baldwin is an unincorporated hamlet without a local government. And that creates a hardship for residents, they say, since no one has governmental authority except Councilman Santino, whose district also includes a portion of Hewlett, East Rockaway, Oceanside, Lynbrook, Rockville Centre and Island Park.
"The advantage of having one representative at the town level," Mr. Santino said, "is that you have one representative for the community and everyone knows who to go to." 
Mr. Scannell, who lives in Baldwin but represents only part of the hamlet in the county Legislature, suggested that all of Baldwin be included in his district. "It's easier to advocate for a town, easier to go to bat when one person knows all the issues," Mr. Scannell said.
Incorporation is an option, but the Nassau County charter bars newly incorporated villages from controlling their own zoning, a major function of most village governments. Ms. Duffy said redistricting is a more expedient and immediate way to effect change at all levels of government.
The Baldwin Community Association has petitioned the state Legislative Task Force on Demographic Research and Reapportionment, a six-member bipartisan panel charged with redrawing congressional, senate and assembly districts, to to reduce the number of lawmakers representing Baldwin at each legislative level. The panel is scheduled to issue its plan this month, but the decision ultimately rests with state lawmakers. Once a plan receives clearance from the federal Justice Department, it must then be approved by the governor.
Nassau and Suffolk will also redraw their legislative districts next year.
Baldwin is not the only community on the Island balking about being divided by district lines. A coalition of groups representing African-Americans in New Cassel, East Garden City, Hempstead, Uniondale, Roosevelt, Freeport, Lakeview and Elmont, along with Wyandanch and North Amityville in Suffolk, say split senatorial districts have weakened blacks' voting power.
Dorothy L. Goosby, a plaintiff in the suit that abolished at-large districts in the Town of Hempstead and now a member of the town board, contends that for three decades, state lawmakers have repeatedly gerrymandered minority communities to thin the percentages of blacks in many state Senate districts.
After the 1990 census, she said, legislators split minority communities such as Freeport, Roosevelt, Hempstead, Uniondale, West Hempstead, South Hempstead and North Baldwin between the Sixth and Eighth state Senate districts and Westbury, New Cassel, Elmont, South Floral Park and North Valley Stream between the Seventh and the Ninth Senate districts. She suggested that minority communities in the Sixth through Ninth Senate districts, which are geographically compact and contiguous, could constitute a majority in a redrawn district.
"Our people have been disenfranchised too long," Ms. Goosby said. "We have enough people in those areas to have that type of influence and to insure that the lines are not drawn in a manner that allows our votes to be lost."
Eugene Burnett, chairman of the Suffolk County Black Caucus, a civil rights group, said that in the redistricting in 1984 and 1992, North Amityville, which is 80 percent black, was placed in a senate district separate from neighboring Wyandanch, which also has a high proportion of African-Americans.
"When you dissipate the strength of our vote, our leaders become impotent and we are ignored by elected officials," Mr. Burnett said. "The closer you bring government to people, the better it functions in their interest because they have input. When you remove input, our issues are taken off the table."
Among those issues is education. The New York Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit against the state asserting that students in Hempstead, Uniondale, Roosevelt, Wyandanch, Amityville and 16 other districts upstate receive far fewer educational services than those in predominantly white schools. A second suit alleges that the state failed to provide students in Hempstead, Roosevelt, Wyandanch and Westbury, among others, with a "sound and basic education" by depriving them of adequate educational resources and services.
"If there are no representatives directly representing Wyandanch, Brentwood and other communities that are overwhelmingly minority in composition, then the argument goes that those communities cannot have the political influence that white communities have," said Don Shaffer, cooperating attorney at the New York Civil Liberties Union and the legal director of its Nassau chapter. "The school issue is particularly evident because school aid is one of the prominent characteristics that elected representatives always point to as, 'I brought home the bacon.' "
Long Island Hispanics say they too are being shortchanged in the political arena. Patrick Young, program director of the Central American Refugee Center in Hempstead, asserted that the political system fails the Hispanic population because "no state senator views Latinos as a primary constituency," and said it was no coincidence that none of the Senate districts in Nassau is more than 13 percent Hispanic.
Similar complaints are heard in Suffolk. Diana Dominguez Weir, an East Hampton town councilwoman who is also the former chairwoman of the Suffolk County Hispanic Advisory Board, said that Brentwood, where more than 50 percent of the population is Latino, is in three assembly and two senate districts.
Since May, the legislative task force, led by Senator Skelos, a Rockville Centre Republican, has sponsored hearings throughout the state to define what constitutes a "community of interest" for the purposes of drawing legislative districts. 
"Do the folks in Brentwood and Wyandanch feel more in common as an ethnic community or less in common because of other factors like school districts, employment patterns, etc.?" asked Assemblyman Chris Ortloff of Plattsburgh, who is a member of the task force. "Ethnicity is not the be-all and end-all, but if that is what defines a community then that's the way the legislative districts should be drawn."

HEADLINE: Suffolk Cuts $400,000 From Marine Project 

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
AMID the tax increases and spending cuts of a hard budget year for Suffolk County, a reduction of nearly $400,000 for a highly regarded marine program operated by the Cornell Cooperative Extension hardly stood out.
 But as the dust began to settle last week after the deliberations that produced what some Suffolk officials are calling a wartime budget for next year, the Cornell program was being recognized as a major casualty. 
 Its fate signals the difficult road ahead for groups and agencies that depend on county money at a time when slumping sales-tax revenues, a slowing economy and uncertainties after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks are taking their toll. 
The Cornell program, an educational and research effort that began 13 years ago, operates a marine center at Cedar Beach in Southold, an education center in Riverhead and a recently opened branch at the Vanderbilt Museum in Centerport. Thousands of volunteers and schoolchildren, as well as local governments, marine businesses and baymen, take part in its projects to preserve and restore shorelines and coastal waters. 
Those projects range from seeding bays with scallops to growing eelgrass in a nursery for eventual planting and creating local fishing jobs. 
Under the new budget, the county cut its contribution to the marine program to zero. The county's contribution had accounted for about a third of the program's annual funding. 
The program's staff members, some of whom have worked in local waters for more than 20 years, secure government grants and private financing for projects that currently employ about 40 people. Program administrators estimate that the projects bring in $3 million a year in revenues.
Now, the marine program must find new financing or close its doors. "We took a huge hit," said Christopher Smith, a marine scientist who is the program's director. "We are scrambling for survival, for sure."
The Suffolk cooperative extension, a nonprofit educational and research agency in Riverhead with close ties to Cornell University, depended on the county for about 43 percent of its annual budget last year, or about $3 million of $7.2 million.
The county also cut $278,000 for another extension program, one for diabetes education that the extension runs under contract with the Suffolk Health Department. The program offers diabetes management and weight-control counseling at county health centers. Judi Veeck, an extension spokeswoman, said that the program was within a year of gaining formal recognition from the American Diabetes Association, which would make it eligible for federal reimbursements.
The cooperative extension cuts, which total nearly $678,000, were the largest for any agency holding county contracts, officials said. 
The extension's board of directors said in a statement that it "realizes the difficult situation faced by our county and appreciates the effort that went into preparing this budget." "What is being proprosed as a savings to taxpayers will ultimately cost us all far more," they added.
The directors and other extension officials said they did not know why the county cuts fell so heavily on their programs. "I still haven't figured that one out yet," Mr. Smith said.
Some county legislators said that the cuts might have reflected disagreements between Michael J. Caracciolo, a Republican from Wading River in whose district the extension headquarters is situated, and other legislators on the special committee that negotiated the final 2002 county budget. The committee, created by Paul Tonna, the County Legislature's presiding officer, a Republican from Huntington, agreed with Robert J. Gaffney, the county executive, on a 13 percent rise in property taxes and $10 million in new fees. 
The adopted budget had to make up for a potential $37.7 million shortfall after legislators rejected Mr. Gaffney's tobacco settlement securitization proposal and declined to eliminate the sales tax exemption on clothing and shoes costing less than $110.
It also increased from 1 percent to 2.5 percent a tax on home heating oil, natural gas and residential electric bills. The increase on electric bills will bring in an estimated $8.4 million, but the Long Island Power Authority is protesting the tax increase and has asked for a rollback.
The marine and diabetes program cuts were among about $21 million in program and service reductions the legislators ordered. 
Under an informal arrangement, legislators who agreed to vote for the final budget were each allowed $200,000 to restore programs or services in their districts. Mr. Caracciolo and three other legislators who voted against the budget were excluded and got nothing.
Mr. Caracciolo said last week that the cuts in the extension programs were in line with other budget reductions and were not a punishment for his opposition. But, he added, "I would be dishonest to say the thought didn't cross my mind."
Maxine Postal, a Democrat from Amityville who sat on the special budget committee, defended the $200,000 awards. "We had to make some very tough decisions, and we decided that each of the legislators willing to vote for the budget would be able to restore some programs to the tune of $200,000," Ms. Postal said. "If you are not willing to vote for the budget, should you have the ability to spend money?"
It was not clear whether Mr. Caracciolo would have been able to restore financing for the extension programs even if he had supported the budget.
Mr. Caracciolo said he opposed the budget because it relied too heavily on raising fees, taxes and revenues rather than on what he called reasonable spending cuts. He called the electric tax "a sneak attack" that should have been discussed publicly before being included in the budget. 
Other officials said the budget deliberations were remarkable for the high level of cooperation among officials confronting suddenly changing economic conditions.
"In my 25 years in government, this was by far and away the most difficult budget to deal with," said Paul Sabatino, the counsel to the County Legislature. "I called it a war budget. There were no easy choices."
Mr. Sabatino said cuts in the Cornell marine and diabetes programs were "a question of prioritization" and no reflection on programs' quality. "We were cutting or partially cutting and raising fees, and every decision was really a horrible choice," he added.
Mr. Smith, the marine program's director, said that operations would probably cease within three to four months unless financing was found elsewhere or restored by the county.
"I have got to believe that once people understand how deeply we are woven into the fabric of Suffolk County, they will at least stop and reconsider the magnitude of these cuts," he said.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Perth Amboy; 
A Waterfront City Planning a Comeback

BYLINE:  By JERRY CHESLOW

 BODY:
THE new waterfront walkway along Sadowski Parkway in Perth Amboy reflects both the city's ambitious revitalization efforts and the challenges left by its industrial past. The esplanade, which has an immaculate red brick sidewalk, acorn-shaped Victorian lights and decorative iron and wood benches, overlooks a breathtaking view of Raritan Bay and Staten Island. In sharp contrast, however, it also overlooks Perth Amboy's battered and badly eroded shoreline to the east and its a sprawl of weathered brick and cinder-block industrial buildings -- some vacant with trash-strewn lots and broken windows -- to the north. 
 Financed with federal, state and Middlesex County grants, the esplanade cost nearly $15 million and is part of a metamorphosis that Mayor Joseph Vas predicts will revitalize the city through the injection of $1 billion in private investment into the 4.4-square-mile city over the next eight years. 
 His monumental redevelopment plan, called Focus 2000, involves 700 old industrial sites and nearly one-third of the city's land, mostly along the waterfront. It calls for the restoration of the shoreline, the development of beaches, the cleanup of brownfields left by industry and the construction of housing, a community center, an open-air market, new retail stores, a hotel, restaurants, a sports arena and a new industrial park. The largest portion of the plan is the $600 million Landings at Harborside, which is just getting under way with the demolition of old industrial buildings north of Sadowski Parkway to make way for 2,000 housing units, the hotel and stores.
"We are reclaiming more than 1,000 acres left behind from the postindustrial period," Mr. Vas said in an interview. 
The impending redevelopment follows a decade in which the once-proud manufacturing city has been clawing its way back from urban decay that set in with the flight of industry and the middle class from East Coast cities in the 1960's and 1970's.
Among the conditions that set the stage for redevelopment is a 40 percent reduction in crime in the last six years, after 14 years of rising rates. Largely because of the demolition of blighted apartment houses and community policing, the number of reported crimes in the city last year stood at 1,688, compared with 2,826 in 1995.
Other factors stimulating development are the city's spectacular location on the Raritan Bay at the confluence of the Arthur Kill and the Raritan River and its abundant transportation options. The Garden State Parkway, the New Jersey Turnpike, Interstate 287 and Routes 1 and 9 are all within 10 miles; the city is on the New Jersey Transit rail line to Manhattan; and next summer, ferry service to Manhattan is to begin.
The city's renaissance is manifesting itself in the housing market, according to James J. Elek, owner of the J. J. Elek Realty Company in neighboring Woodbridge. "Houses that sold a year ago at $115,000 on Hall Avenue," which is around the corner from one of the demolished high-rises, he said, "are now going for $185,000." 
"The largest jump is in the two- and four-family market, which is steaming hot." A two-family that sold five years ago for $120,000 can go for $220,000 today. Two-bedroom units in those houses command rents of $950 to $1,200.
Fernando Gonzalez, manager of Weichert Realtors in nearby Edison, attributes the increases to anticipation created by the city's redevelopment plans. "People who would otherwise sell their houses are waiting for price rises," he said. "Also anticipating increased prices, more people are trying to buy. It's a matter of low supply and high demand."
In mid-November, 56 houses were on the market, ranging in price from $56,000 for an 80-year-old two-bedroom colonial being sold as-is on Oak Street in the southern section of town up to $600,000 for a five-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath colonial on Water Street, overlooking the waterfront. Housing styles vary widely, from old colonials with no hot water to large Victorians and brand new town houses.
The largest rental development is Green Village, a 318-unit garden apartment complex off Harned Street in the northern section. The complex has mostly one-bedroom apartments and a few two-bedroom units. There is now a waiting list for one-bedroom apartments that will become available at $680 monthly in March, and no two-bedroom units are forecast to become available in the near future. 
The largest new housing development in progress is Harbortown Crossing along the Arthur Kill, off Buckingham Avenue, where about 1,500 condominium town houses and rental housing units are being built. Although designed to be sold, most of the 479 units in the completed first phase are now rented, many to low-income families receiving federal and county housing assistance. However, those who purchased in Harbortown have been rewarded with significant appreciation in the past three years, according to Robert Alex, one of the first buyers.
Mr. Alex says a four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath town house that is almost identical to the one for which he and his wife, Edna, paid $147,900 in 1998 sold recently for $242,000. This year, according to Perth Amboy tax records, 15 condominiums in Harbortown had sold by Aug. 31, ranging in price from $158,900 to $218,900.
MR. ALEX is a self-employed business consultant, and Mrs. Alex recently retired from her job as a social work supervisor for Middlesex County. She is about to start a new job as director of a day-care center for old people in Perth Amboy. They moved from a large single-family home on one acre in East Brunswick, 12 miles away.
"We knew we would be pioneers and welcomed the challenge and the excitement of being part of the rebirth of a city," Mr. Alex explained. Since moving to Perth Amboy, Mr. Alex has been drafted by the mayor to serve as a commissioner on the Perth Amboy Redevelopment Agency, a volunteer group overseeing the renewal of the city. 
The "City by the Bay," as Perth Amboy calls itself, has a proud history. Founded in 1683, it was the first city in New Jersey to be chartered by the Crown, in 1718. Its seal, presented by King George I, contains the Latin phrase "Portus Optimus," meaning "the best port." Indeed, Perth Amboy's port has served whale boats, oyster sloops and naval vessels, and it still receives large oil tankers and freighters.
The name Perth Amboy comes from the Earl of Perth, one of the proprietors of New Jersey under the royal grant, and the Leni Lenape Indian word "ompage," meaning "level ground." The town served as the first British capital of East Jersey and was home to William Franklin, the last royal governor of New Jersey and illegitimate son of Benjamin Franklin. His palace -- Proprietary House on Kearny Avenue -- is the last remaining British royal palace in the United States. The building, now used for a local museum and private offices, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places, along with the city's restored Historic Ferry Slip, which operated from the end of Smith Street from the late 17th century until it closed in 1963 for lack of passengers. The slip will remain a tourist attraction and will not be used for the new ferry service.
Mayor Vas says he hopes the new town houses along the shore and the easy commute to Manhattan will lure young middle-class families and singles back to Perth Amboy. Currently, the town is 70 percent Hispanic and has one of the lowest median household incomes in Middlesex County: $39,323, according to a 1997 estimate.
A key component in Mr. Vas's plan is the 9,200-student public school system, which faces enormous challenges because of overcrowding and its high proportion of low-income immigrant families. The number of students in the district has grown by more than 50 percent since 1992. Despite the construction of three new schools and the renovation of three others over the past decade, class sizes -- 19 on average at Perth Amboy High School and 24 at the elementary school level -- remain about 15 percent larger than state averages.
According to the superintendent of schools, Dr. Pablo Clausell, the district has purchased property and received a state commitment to provide $112 million for the construction of a second high school, two new elementary schools and an early childhood center. The start of construction is not yet scheduled. 
SINCE the first language of more than 70 percent of the students is Spanish, 1,500 students are currently enrolled in the English-as-a-second-language program. Because of the low income of the residents, 85 percent of the students receive federally funded breakfasts and lunches.
Dr. Clausell says the district offers a six-hour prekindergarten education daily to all 4-year-olds, with an optional three-hour after-school program. Computers are introduced in kindergarten and keyboarding in first grade. Every classroom above prekindergarten has Internet access, with one computer for every three students, compared with one for every six pupils statewide. Besides its programs for children, the district also runs a 3,000-student adult-education program.
Perth Amboy High offers 13 advanced placement courses in English, the sciences, history, government, mathematics, computers, Spanish and art. On last year's College Board tests, Perth Amboy High students' combined verbal and math scores averaged 863, compared with a state average of 1012. Of last year's 315 graduating seniors, 27 percent went on to two- and four-year colleges.
Like most other sections of Perth Amboy, the central business district on Smith Street throbs with activity from 9 a.m. until 9 p.m. There are few vacancies among the 400 stores, mainly because of Perth Amboy's designation in 1994 as a state Urban Enterprise Zone. Rather than collecting the full 6 percent state sales tax, enterprise zones collect 3 percent and invest the proceeds in redeveloping their business districts.
Among items financed with the $8 million in zone funds received since 1994 are new Victorian-style street lights and sidewalks along Smith Street and State Street, another commercial street. The money has also helped to pay for widespread road resurfacing throughout the city.

HEADLINE: Scarce Jobs and Dashed Hopes For the Class of 2001 

BYLINE:  By KATE STONE LOMBARDI 

 BODY:
BILLY TILSON remembers the good times. The days when looking for a job meant sorting through competing offers. When companies sought to sell themselves to him during interviews, rather than the other way around.
 "All the companies were fighting over me," Mr. Tilson said. "Everyone was hiring and the companies were bending over backwards for you. It was a lot of fun." 
 It's not so much fun anymore. Mr. Tilson is only 23, and it hasn't been that long since his career seemed flush with possibility. But prospects have changed dramatically for Mr. Tilson, an Edgemont native who graduated from the University of Virginia with the class of 2000. His story is representative of many in his generation: those who began college during a robust economy and four years later have entered a job market that is contracting by the month. 
Last week, a group of economists that tracks business cycles made it official: the country is in a recession for the first time in 10 years. The National Bureau of Economic Research said that the largest economic expansion on record gave way to a recession in March, months before the terrorist attacks or the sharp rise in unemployment that began last summer.
Like many of his classmates, Mr. Tilson started out strong. He began a new job right after graduation. He went to work for PricewaterhouseCoopers in Manhattan, first spending three months in an intensive training program and then being assigned to work as a consultant in the area of Internet development. Eight months after he was hired, he was laid off.
While he had seen it coming -- his was the company's second round of layoffs, and projects in his division had become scarce -- Mr. Tilson was shocked when he re-entered the job market. He found it transformed.
"I was completely unprepared for dealing with tough times," Mr. Tilson said. "All the career help I'd had before was basically how to choose between all the job offers you get and how to handle interviews. Now it was pretty dramatic if I could just talk to someone and get an interview. I had a great start-up job and good experience and it didn't seem to matter."
For five months he sent out his resume, wrote cover letters, made phone calls and grew increasingly discouraged. He said that he worked harder finding a job than he ever had actually having one. Some mornings, he said, it was hard to get out of bed.
Currently Mr. Tilson is working as a contract consultant at TrafficMac, a company that specializes in managing the performance of on-line advertising campaigns. He works full time but gets paid by the hour and receives no benefits. That worries him, especially since he plays rugby. He shares an apartment in the East Village in Manhattan with three roommates. Still, he hopes to stay where he is, at least until the job market improves.
"I'm very happy working here and I'd like to keep it," Mr. Tilson said. "I'm sick of searching. It's just full of frustration because no matter what I do, nothing seems to be working."
His frustration -- and that of other job seekers in the metropolitan area -- is not likely to let up. The latest figures from the New York State Department of Labor show that from October 2000 to October 2001, New York City lost 59,400 private sector jobs. And 44,200 of those jobs were lost between September and October of this year.
The huge drop over the month represents the relocations and layoffs associated with the World Trade Center attacks, said James P. Brown, a labor market analyst with the state Department of Labor. But the economy was already in a decline before then. 
Two broad forces are at work in the metropolitan area, Mr. Brown said. First, the economy in and around New York City is heavily dependent on selling services to other companies. As national corporate profits began falling in the middle of last year, so did the demand for services in businesses like advertising, consulting and finance. And as Wall Street took a sharp downturn, the financial community was further damaged.
"This was all pre-Sept. 11," Mr. Brown said. "You already had an economy that was significantly weakening, particularly in high-wage areas that attract college graduates. The events of Sept. 11 tended to hit many of the organizations that were having problems already -- the advertising market, the travel market and Wall Street -- and it also slowed the national economy, which meant corporate customers were cutting back yet more."
Regional figures -- which include New York City, Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Nassau and Suffolk -- are a little less discouraging. From October 2000 to October 2001, there was a drop of 52,000 jobs. From September to October 2001, 26,300 private sector jobs were lost.
As each recent college class has progressed, it has faced an increasingly tight job market.
"Anyone being hired from the class of '99 graduated into a very strong market," Mr. Brown said. "By spring of 2000 some weaknesses began to show up with the dot-com collapse. By the class of 2001, it was obvious that we had a national recession developing and substantial regional weakness."
Mr. Brown said that many companies did their hiring well in advance and recruited people from college campuses last fall to begin work this September. As it turned out, "they don't need all the people they thought they did," he said.
That's not something you need to tell Richard Tyre. Mr. Tyre, 23, grew up in Chappaqua and graduated from Lafayette College in May 2001 with a degree in international economics and commerce. He had several interviews with investment consulting and technology firms. In January, he was packing his suitcase for an interview in Rhode Island with American Power Conversion. he night before the trip, he received a phone call telling him not to bother flying to headquarters. The company was no longer able to make him a job offer.
Meanwhile, he had been pursuing other leads. Mr. Tyre had interviewed with Accenture, formerly Andersen Consulting. In April it offered him a position, but the job was not available until March 2002. He accepted, though the offer was later pushed off another month. Mr. Tyre was offered a sum of money to wait for the job, and he accepted. He hopes to start at Accenture in April 2002. In the interim, he did some temp work, which he disliked, and is now substitute teaching in his old school district. Last month he moved from his parents' home in Chappaqua into Manhattan, where he is sharing an apartment with two friends.
"I do have it rough, but it's not as bad as the upcoming graduating class," Mr. Tyre said. "At least I have an offer and I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. From what I've heard, Accenture is not going to recruit this year. They'll use my class to replace the class of 2002."
That class -- the current crop of college seniors -- is already getting bad news. They, too, began college is a strong market. Many of them took steps they thought would guarantee them a place in the corporate world. Now they find the rules have changed.
Take Kiamesha Colom, 20, a senior at Manhattanville College in Purchase. She worked for two summers at MasterCard International Inc. and is currently interning there. She has worked in corporate services, business performance solutions and competitive intelligence at the company. In years past, MasterCard has viewed senior class interns as employee prospects. But because Ms. Colom currently works there, she has seen the in-house e-mails announcing a hiring freeze.
"Most likely there won't be an offer, even though you were basically promised one at the beginning," Ms. Colom said. "You think you're doing the right thing for three years and suddenly you get stopped short."
Ms. Colom, who is president of the student government at Manhattanville, had been planning to work for a year and then begin graduate studies. Now she is thinking of going directly to graduate school, with the hope that the job market will improve.
"Financially, I didn't want to be any more in debt," said Ms. Colom, who lives on campus. "I wanted that year of work. Just graduating from college in general is scary, and then having to hear every single day when you wake up that they are dropping the interest rates one more point, it's very scary."
Munish Thairani, a classmate of Ms. Colom's at Manhattanville, also went the internship route. He has worked with Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm, as well as at a consulting firm in Connecticut. Mr. Thairani, 21, who also held part-time jobs on campus, maintained a grade point average of over 3.8 and has recommendation letters from every firm for which he has worked. He has sent out dozens of resumes but gets the same response: hiring is frozen.
"When I came to college in '98, the financial industry was booming," he said. "The opportunities were endless. My idea was that if I kept on doing my best in school and making sure I had the training at the same time, I would be selected as a candidate. But because the market is so bad now, it does not matter how impressive you are."
Mr. Thairani has enough credits to graduate next month. But he has decided to stay in school for another five months, with the hope that things will improve in the spring.
For college career counselors, it is a difficult time. Karen Ganz, associate dean of career service at Manhattanville, has watched the experiences of Ms. Colom and Mr. Thairani with frustration.
"To have been promised jobs because you've interned for two years, and you love them and they loved you, and to have that vanish, that's a great disappointment," Ms. Ganz said. "Especially for people who have done all the right things."
At Pace University, with campuses in Pleasantville and White Plains, this fall's career fair also reflected the downturn. Last September, 120 employers went to the school's job fair. This year 70 signed up, and many who came were not hiring anyway.
"The word out there seems to be freeze," said Jody Queen-Hubert, director of co-op education and career services for the Westchester campuses of Pace University. "I'm hearing from students that they are grateful for any offers. They recognize the market is bad. Instead of waiting for any other offers, they are saying, hey, let me go with this one, and not wait out an anxious situation."
Even internships are not what they once were. Local colleges report that some internship programs are being suspended. And for remaining internships that were once paid positions, the companies are now asking students to work for free.
To be sure, not every field is in trouble, Ms. Queen-Hubert said. Pace held a very successful career fair for nurses last spring, and the market is still strong for education, nursing and human services.
At Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, graduates historically have not been drawn to corporate jobs, said Mary Raymond, director of career counseling. Instead, students tend to look for work in education and with nonprofits, with a significant number applying to AmeriCares and the Peace Corps. This year, she said, seniors are showing more interest in graduate school. And she acknowledged that even noncorporate jobs are affected by a poor economy.
"At this point, if the money continues to dry up, with all those corporate people funding these great not-for-profits, we're in trouble," Ms. Raymond said.
COLLEGE career counselors are trying to reach out to alumni to help new graduates find jobs, but are finding that more and more alumni are themselves seeking career services.
"In the past we've seen alums who wanted to change careers, but now we're seeing alums who are unemployed, and these people have worked here in this area for major corporations -- 13 years at Readers Digest, 14 years at Texaco," Ms. Queen-Hubert said.
Schools also anticipate a change in the popularity of majors. In the last five to seven years, there has been a large increase in enrollment in computer and finance majors. But with the shake-out in those industries, colleges expect students to start to return to fields like accounting.
"Whether you're making money or losing money, you still need accountants to generate that data," said Joseph M. Pastore Jr., a professor at the Lubin School of Business at Pace University. 
Career counselors say that part of their role now is to educate students on how to have realistic expectations of the job market. Gone are the days of signing bonuses, let alone having a company foot the bill for a fledgling employee's M.B.A. degree. But they don't really need to tell students that.
"It's very discouraging," said Noah Schwarz, 21, who grew up in Chappaqua and will graduate from Colgate University in May 2002. "You're having these interviews, you're preparing for them, you do all your reading on the company, you get in your suit, you go through all the stress and at the end they say thank you, but we're not hiring. It's really tough."

A Degree, a Good Resume, Iffy Prospects
IT'S not exactly life imitating art. But since this is a story that features MTV, a line from an Alanis Morissette hit song, "Isn't it ironic?," does come to mind. Here is Josh Kleiman, recent graduate of Sarah Lawrence College, clearly a go-getter, with significant experience to his credit. Not only hasn't Mr. Kleiman found a full-time job, but in his position as an unpaid intern at MTV, he just finished working on a segment for the station's news program on a topic all too familiar to him: how tough it is for young adults to find work.
The segment, which was shown last month, included an interview with the director of career counseling at New York University and also covered a career fair at Yale. Mr. Kleiman, 22, worked on it as a research assistant, helping out in whatever way he was asked.
"The story that I'm trying to get across to students is that they should keep working toward a job for when the economy starts up again, and not use this time to sort of do nothing and go live at home and wait," Mr. Kleiman said.
He is taking his own advice, as best as he can. Throughout college, Mr. Kleiman worked and interned in entertainment and production jobs. One summer he worked for a subsidiary of Universal Pictures. The fall semester of his senior year, he secured "the best internship I've ever done" with "The Howard Stern Show." (He got that by waking up to the radio program and hearing that it was looking for interns. He said he was dialing the number to apply before his eyes were fully open.)
Throughout college he worked for Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, a position for which "they pay you to go to the movies," he said. Specifically, Mr. Kleiman would count how many people were in the theater and what trailers were being shown. He also interned in Washington with Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland.
When he graduated from Sarah Lawrence last May, Mr. Kleiman could not find a job he wanted. He said he could have gotten a job as a store manager or a waiter, but that it wouldn't have led to the career he desires. So now he is back in another internship, in the field he wants, but without the salary he needs.
To make ends meet and pay the rent on the apartment in Manhattan he shares with a roommate, Mr. Kleiman until recently had a job designing Web sites, which he did on the weekends and in his spare time. But he is currently looking for a permanent night job. On top of that he is working on a novel. And here's one more thing keeping Mr. Kleiman busy these days. He is studying for the LSAT. 
"An executive-level producing job is much easier to attain with a law degree in your pocket," he said. 
Mr. Kleiman said that most of his friends are in the same situation as he is.
"My best friend has been trying to find a job for months and has gone on more than 20 interviews," he said. "Obviously if you have a college degree and it's a necessity to have a job, you're going to get a job -- in the service industry or hostessing or in a clothing store. Getting a job is not on hold for most young people, but pursuing a career is." Kate Stone Lombardi

HEADLINE: A Booming Business in Selling Money 

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
FIVE years ago when Carl and Debbie Kaufman began looking for a house in Connecticut for themselves and their three children, who back then ranged in age from 13 to 6, they found a four-bedroom 1920 colonial in Milford, Conn. But because of what Mr. Kaufman described as "some credit problems in the past," the banks to which they applied for a mortgage turned them down.
 Eventually, however, the Kaufmans obtained a $74,900, 30-year loan through a mortgage broker, $65,000 of it for the mortgage, several thousand dollars for closing costs and the remainder for some of the many repairs needed to upgrade the half-century-old house. Because of the Kaufmans' earlier credit problems, they had to pay far more than the going interest rate. At a time in 1996 when the average mortgage rate was 8.03 percent for a single family residence, their rate was a whopping 11.5 percent. 
 But Mr. Kaufman, a photographer for Yale University's department of media services, had no complaints then about his dealings with Shoreline Mortgage in Milford and has none now. "What else could we do?" he asked. "I needed a house for my family, and with my credit history no bank would touch me, but Shoreline did." What is more, he and his wife recently refinanced their mortgage with Shoreline, this time obtaining a 30-year $200,000 loan at 8.1 percent, still higher than typical rates these days because of his past credit history, but a rate that will drop a percentage point if they make all of their payments on time for 24 months.
It should not be very surprising that a broker found both the original loan for the Kaufmans and their refinancing loan, for mortgage brokers have originated a majority of residential mortgages in six of the last seven years, according to Wholesale Access Mortgage Research and Consulting Inc. in Columbia, Md.
The only year the mortgage brokering industry slid in that period was 1999, when its market share dropped to 47 percent when rising interest rates caused refinancing, in which brokers tend to specialize, to all but dry up. This year, according to David Olson, the managing director of Wholesale Access, brokers are likely to account for 65 percent of residential mortgages. If so, that will be their second highest market share since Wholesale Access began keeping track in 1987, behind only a 69 percent share in 1998, when refinancing was also strong.
Back in 1987, brokers had a market share of just 20 percent and there were only 7,000 mortgage brokerage firms nationwide. This year, Mr. Olson said, there are probably 33,000 to 35,000 such companies.
Despite the specialty's robust growth in recent years, many potential and actual borrowers have only a sketchy idea of what mortgage brokers do, often confusing them with bankers and other lenders. In fact, brokers are the mortgage industry's equivalent of matchmakers, bringing together borrowers and lenders instead of brides and grooms. 
As the role and numbers of mortgage brokers have grown in recent years, the practices of some of those matchmakers have brought scrutiny that is now resulting in proposed regulatory changes that would affect the entire industry. Complaints of predatory lending practices, in which borrowers are charged high fees or talked into loans they cannot afford by brokers who work on commission, have brought federal action to force greater disclosure by all mortgage brokers.
Many brokers, Mr. Olson said, were formerly salaried employees at banks or savings and loan associations and a significant number struck out on their own when the S.&L.'s ran into regulatory and liquidity problems. Before long, Mr. Olson said, banks and other lending institutions not only overcame their suspicions of their mortgage broker competitors but also realized that outsourcing much of the loan process to brokers obviated having to employ more loan officers and clerical help. 
Thus, in return for brokers arranging loans for borrowers, completing the necessary paperwork and making sure that the loans meet the guidelines that will enable them to be sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (which will bundle them and sell to investors), lenders were more than willing to pay the brokers a commission. That commission usually averages between 1 to 3 percent of the loan, depending on its size, complexity and the relationship between lender and broker.
Interviews by Wholesale Access of more than 3,000 mortgage brokers, picked at random from a database of 28,000 firms, found that last year the typical brokerage had one office, originated 125 loans, employed five people and was generally profitable. Many such brokerages consist of one or more family members, although Mr. Olson said that a few brokerages have about 100 brokers.
"It's a service business -- we're selling money, said Richard A. Sales, who has been in the business almost 40 years and who owns RTN Mortgage brokerage in Fairfield, N.J., where his son Todd and daughter, Michele Ligorelli, also work. "It's an easy business when interest rates are going down," Mr. Sales added, "but when rates are going up, you don't have many friends." 
What most brokers also do not have many of are wealthy customers, Mr. Sales said. People with upward of $1 million usually have relationships with banks, he explained, and they tend to care more about that relationship, which often includes financial advisers, than they do about having a broker shop around for the lowest cost loan.
"Our market is basically people who want the lowest rate and who are uncomfortable in banks," he added, "and they would rather drop by or phone us to get that rate without having to put up with the hassle you often get in a bank."
To which Mr. Kaufman, who bought and refinanced his house through brokers, would probably add "Amen." He said he preferred dealing with brokers because they usually seem able to deliver a lower rate and because "they go out of their way to find you a loan, even if your credit history hasn't always been perfect."
BANKERS, of course, paint the picture differently. "Bankers offer a relationship that extends beyond the mortgage loan sought and beyond such other bank products as home equity loans and lines of credit, car loans, education loans and more," said Julie Malveaux, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association. Because brokers rely on others to finance the loan, she added, "borrowers should choose a mortgage from a lender they trust and are comfortable doing business with."
When they shop for loans for their clients, mortgage brokers spread a wide net and may well land a lender that the borrower is unfamiliar with.
The Kaufmans' loan when they refinanced, for example, originated through a broker, Shoreline Mortgage, but the lender was First Union, a conventional banking company headquartered in Charlotte, N.C. Susan Harris, the owner of Shoreline, said she had correspondent relationships with about 40 banks, including some in California, Florida and Iowa. She chose a Connecticut branch of First Union because it offers a Fannie Mae loan that automatically reduces the interest rate by up to 1 percentage point if the borrower makes 24 consecutive monthly payments on time.
"People think that rates are the same at every bank," said Joseph L. Falk, president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers, "but there is a wide diversity of loans and prices, because lenders all look at things differently." 
"What's good for one lender might not be right for the next one," he added. "We have 41 state associations, and each one has an annual trade show where hundreds of lenders from all over show up" to display their wares.
These wares consist not only of various blends of loan rates and durations, but also loans for such niche markets as senior citizens, military veterans, minority communities, immigrants, self-employed borrowers who lack income verification and people with spotty credit.
Not only that but "rates often change every hour, depending on what's been happening with the Taliban, consumer confidence, unemployment, the stock market or the Federal Reserve," said Peter L. Spalthoff, executive director of the Connecticut Association of Mortgage Brokers. Using an example from Shoreline Mortgage, the brokerage owned by Ms. Harris, who is his wife, Mr. Spalthoff said that about a month ago she could have gotten customers a 15-year fixed-rate loan at 5.75 percent if they were willing to pay a fee of two points. (Each point represents 1 percent of the loan.) "But that rate," he added, "was available only the last four hours of the day." 
This example, brokers say, is indicative of the hundreds of short-term offers available almost daily, for those who know where to look within the vast mortgage marketplace. And knowing where to look for the best rates and niche markets is why brokers forge correspondent relationships with banks and other lenders across the nation.
The average mortgage broker deals with up to about 15 lenders, but Dan Levitan, managing director of the Manhattan-based Home Mortgage Acceptance Corporation, which originates loans for customers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, said his firm has about 80 lenders.
Why? "Because there is no one mortgage market -- there are many -- and each bank is going for one segment of the market," he said. "And we know the players in those markets."
These days, most players are forced to wait several weeks to have loans processed and the mortgage check in their hands, instead of the wait of a week to 10 days that was usual until recently. The reason is that refinancing this year -- which the Mortgage Bankers Association of America has projected will total $970 billion, which is $220 billion more than the record $750 billion in 1998 -- is now clogging the mortgage pipeline. Loans and loan applications are backed up, while lenders are swamped, along with appraisers, real estate lawyers, title companies and just about everyone else involved in the mortgage loan process.
With 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rates rising to 7.21 percent through last Wednesday from 6.59 as of Nov. 9, things have cooled slightly, but the pipeline remains clogged. That is one reason some mortgage brokers, and a number of banks, either do not solicit refinances or limit their number. 
"We and most companies our size never want to do more than a third of our business in refinancing," said Tom Weisman, account executive for the Newburgh, N.Y., branch of CTX Mortgage, a big Dallas-based company. "We get most of our business from referrals from lawyers, realtors and accountants, so if you stay in the office all day and concentrate on refinancing, the next time they want to refer somebody they'll phone Tom, Dick or Harry." Besides, he added, "When refinancing dries up, so does a good part of your business."
Penn Johnson, the owner of Stamford Mortgage Company in Stamford, Conn., said his brokerage accepts refinance customers but does not solicit them. "We prefer purchases, because refinances come and go and we have to stay in business," he added. "I can't service purchase customers if we're swamped with refinances." 
But most brokers do not limit the number of refinancings, because the demand for first mortgages is also dependent on the economy, if not to the extent that refinancing is. So, brokers tend to accept the longer hours and frenzied pace that come with the periodic refinancing cycles, knowing that they will also have to endure down times, much as owners of summer businesses at the seashore and owners of ski lodges and ski slopes resign themselves to the doldrums that accompany their off-seasons. 
Furthermore, many people finance two or more times with the same broker, as Carl and Debbie Kaufman did with their Connecticut company, and brokers say that customers who refinance also occasionally buy a bigger or more expensive house later, and many times they recommend the broker to family members, friends or acquaintances who are looking to buy a house.
A handful of online lenders, including E-Loan and Countrywide, have elaborate and comprehensive Web sites, but Mr. Olson of Wholesale Access said that online mortgages account for a very small proportion of the total.
Still, even some traditional lenders and brokers are finding that going online is a good way to increase business.
A. J. Romano Mortgage in Stratford, Conn., was unsure whether to use the Internet, because it did not know what to expect. "But we went online in September 1996, and our first loan closed in January 1997," said Joseph L. Romano Jr., the company's president. "Now about 30 percent of our business comes via the Internet, including from people in other states." Moreover, whereas the company's typical loan had averaged about $185,000, he said, the loans generated on the Internet average about $205,000. 
Romano Mortgage does not actually make loans or commitments over the Internet, because for the company to do credit checks the borrowers would have to provide their Social Security numbers online. Mr. Romano said he would not provide his own Social Security number online, in case it should fall into the wrong hands, and so his company obtains that information by telephone.
Companies that make extensive use of online applications, however, stress that they employ encryption and other techniques to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing any personal information transmitted to or from the company. 
Almost every state has laws regulating mortgage brokers, said Robert S. Lotstein, the general counsel for the National Association of Mortgage Brokers and the managing partner of the law firm of Lotstein Buckman in Washington, usually requiring that they be licensed or registered. 
New York, for example, requires that mortgage brokers register with the New York State Department of Banking, and they must have two years of experience in credit analysis or underwriting, although business experience or education may be used to satisfy that requirement. And registrants who originate loans through HUD's Federal Housing Administration must post $25,000 bonds.
Connecticut requires mortgage brokers to post $40,000 bonds. 
To obtain a license in New Jersey, mortgage brokers must post a $50,000 bond and maintain a net worth of $50,000. And unlike New York and Connecticut, neither of which requires mortgage brokers to maintain offices in the states, New Jersey licenses mortgage brokers only if they have offices in the state. 
While the overwhelming number of mortgage brokers are reputable, according to Mel Martinez, the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, for several years there has been pressure in state legislatures and in Congress to rein in what Mr. Martinez also criticized last April as the "dishonorable practices" of "a small number in the lending industry who choose to prey on the most vulnerable in our society." The vulnerable include the elderly, minorities, the least educated and people with little money. Among the practices that Mr. Martinez condemned are those that burden the unwary with bigger loans and higher interest rates than they can afford and that he said "may often lead to foreclosure."
He also criticized those who inflate the price of appraisals, legal fees, title registration and other closing costs -- fees that consumer organizations and other critics say are little more than disguised kickbacks, financial rewards for foisting the bigger loans on the unwary.
Mr. Martinez has also been critical of the illegitimate use of "yield-spread premiums," the higher commissions that banks pay brokers for bringing them loans with higher interest rates, but which the unscrupulous among them use to fleece the unwary by talking them into loans with unnecessarily high interest rates. TYPICALLY, such higher-than-market-rate loans are part of a package in which all or part of the closing costs and other fees -- sometimes including the fee that some mortgage brokers charge for preparing the loan applications -- are included in the loan itself, which then carries higher payments, making it more attractive to the lender and far costlier for the unwary borrower.
And in a policy statement released on Oct. 15, Mr. Martinez reiterated that "it has always been HUD's position that yield-spread premiums serve an important purpose in the housing market," in that when used properly they give lower-income home buyers the option of paying all or part of their closing costs over the term of the loan in return for paying a higher interest rate.
But the policy statement went on to say that HUD is drafting regulations that, if enacted after a six-month public comment period, would require brokers to provide borrowers with a more precise estimate of the yield-spread premium and the fees that will be required at closing, rather than giving borrowers rough estimates and possibly springing inflated costs on them at the closing. He also suggested that lenders and brokers adopt those policies now instead of waiting for them to become law.
Mr. Lotstein said that no one would be more pleased to get rid of unscrupulous brokers than the large majority of honest brokers who are sometimes tarred with the same brush. "There are predatory loans," he added, "and the system is clearly not working when the borrower is paying more than is appropriate." The association's hope, he said, is to join with HUD to get rid of unscrupulous mortgage brokers without doing damage to a system that has been a win-win situation for most brokers and borrowers.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED; 
Giving Is Taking Its Toll

BYLINE:  By DEBRA NUSSBAUM 

 BODY:
THE middle of September is usually a hectic time at the regional offices of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, with thousands of volunteers trying to raise $1.5 million for research.
 This year was different. 
 "The phones weren't ringing," said Elizabeth Preston, executive director of the organization's mid-Jersey office in Hudson County. "There was no mail. A pin could have dropped in here and you could have heard it. We wanted to just go home and close the door."
Instead, they came to the office every day after Sept. 11, even though Ms. Preston lost seven family friends and acquaintances in the attack on World Trade Center, and tried to figure out how best to seek donations in the aftermath of such an enormous tragedy. 
Four walks were scheduled for the last two weekends in September. Three days after Sept. 11, the office cancelled the walk in which about 5,000 people would have started at Liberty State Park -- projected to raise $710,000. So far -- even without that one walk -- $290,000 has been donated. Three other walks raised $650,000, about $150,000 short of projections.
Nationally, the goal was to raise $78 million, but a little more than $61.5 million was taken in. Overall, money raised from walks in the Northeast was down 35 percent, as against 17 percent in other regions, said Julie Kimbrough, a spokeswoman for the organization.
"It was important that we had those walks because people needed to be together," Ms. Preston said. "We're going to reduce our expenses by 20 percent, and we're redoubling our efforts in our fund-raising programs.' 
The diabetes foundation is among the many charitable organizations in New Jersey that have found contributions down since Sept. 11.
Americans are a generous lot -- having donated $203 billion to nonprofit organizations last year -- said Adam Meyerson, president of the Philanthropy Round Table, a group up of 650 donors. More than $1.2 billion has been raised for victims of the World Trade Center attacks, which is what is given every two days on the average to charitable groups, Mr. Meyerson said. But he and others who monitor fund-raising expect the economic downturn and the events of Sept. 11 to make it more difficult to raise funds this year. 
"Giving will be strong and the economy will come back, but there are certain charities that are going to have tough times in our state," said George C. Ruotolo Jr., president and chief executive of Ruotolo Associates Inc., a fund-raising consulting firm in Cresskill. "Organizations that have cultivated relationships over time will do better. Churches aren't going to suffer and schools will be okay. Animal rights groups and arts organizations may have some tough times, but they will come back. I'm more concerned about start-up organizations.' 
For instance, the annual fall Making Strides Against Breast Cancer Walk, which last year raised $9 million, brought in $8.5 million this year.
Volunteers and staff at the Monmouth County Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Eatontown are currently making their annual holiday appeal, and the hope is that contributions will make up for what has been lost the past 10 weeks. Donations are down about one-third, said Ursula Goetz, the society's executive director, and the shelter -- already filled with almost 300 animals -- is beginning to get more from people being called up by the military. 
"With all the human needs, people are forgetting animals now," Ms. Goetz said. "We are very concerned as we enter 2002 on how we are going to make it. We are not seeing the 25, 50 and 100 dollar checks."
Area food banks are also finding a drop in donations -- in both money and goods. And in some cases, agencies are seeing the demand increasing at the same time that donations are slipping.
"We have had such a tremendous increase since Sept. 11 in the number of people requesting assistance, and the donations can't keep up," said Thelma Fedele, director of community and government relations for the Center for Food Action in New Jersey.
The organization, which has five locations, is serving 200 more families than it was before Sept. 11. Ms. Fedele said that among those seeking aid were hotel and restaurant workers, limousine drivers and office staff members who were laid off after the collapse of the twin towers.
The Mercy Center in Asbury Park, which supplies about 7,000 families a year with food, clothing and shelter is also finding the demand heavier than usual but donations lagging, said Sister Carol Ann Henry. Although they do not have figures, Sister Carol Ann said parishes in North Jersey were attending to the needs of people in their congregations.
At the Food Bank of South Jersey in Pennsauken, donations increased in recent weeks after organizers put out a plea. Last year, the group took in about $40,000 in unsolicited contributions, said Bedzaida Mendez, executive director of the food bank. This year, it has raised about $32,000 so far.
"Most people scrounged what they had for 9/11 which is a great humanitarian thing to do," Ms. Mendez said. "We've been through hard times before and we know how to survive. We still have to make sure that no one goes to bed hungry."
Both Mr. Meyerson and Mr. Ruotolo agreed that charitable organizations needed to remind loyal donors that their causes still existed and needed money and when possible, groups should address the issue of 9/11.
"How do you use your resources to stop terrorism in the first place?" said Mr. Meyerson.
The Newark Museum, which saw the city decrease its financing this year because of lower revenues at the airport, is trying to make up for it through donations from visitors. In addition, it recently received a $75,000 grant from the Dodge Foundation, said Lorraine McConnell, a spokeswoman at the museum.
The plan, Ms. MccOnell said, was for the grant to go toward the recreation of a garden of solace and contemplation, similar to those in Spain in the 9th through 12th centuries that were shared by Jews, Muslims and Christians. 
Then there is PuttinOn the Ritz Theater, a 470-seat theater in Oaklyn, where attendance has dropped somewhat since Sept. 11. At this time last year, performances had attracted 11,998 patrons. For the same period this year, attendance was at 10,692 people, said Bruce A. Curless, the theater's producing artistic director.
Mr. Curless said he struggled with whether to have shows the weekend after Sept. 11. In the end, he said, the show went on -- and before each performance he read a quote by George Cook, who during World War I said: "The social justification which we feel to be valid now for makers and players of plays is that they shall help keep alive in the world the light of imagination. Without it, the wreck of the world that was, cannot be cleared away and the new world shaped."
While fund-raising experts say it will be difficult to find new patrons, Mr. Curless insists that arts organizations must always look for new viewers to keep going.
"Because we are grassroots we aren't looking at a lot of large individual donors," he said. "Because we're the arts, we're looking for people to pull into the arts. We're always reaching out to different people."
For now, fund-raisers can take heart in statistics included in a report prepared by the Trust for Philanthropy Giving USA report, which show that with the exception of 1987, a year of financial panic, charitable giving has gone up every year in the United States for the past 40 years.
In two acts of terrorism that the group examined -- the bombing of the World Trade Center and the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City -- the rate of growth in giving increased in the year of the event over the previous year. 
Workers at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation hope to make up some of the fund-raising shortages with golf tournaments and galas next spring. This year's walks in South Jersey and Philadelphia missed their goal by $40,000, but Valerie Minuti, executive director of the Greater Delaware Valley chapter, expects the organization to do well in the end.
"We have had tried-and-true donors," she said. "We will be standing strong."

A Pantry Offers Soup and Solace, But There's Never Enough of Either

BYLINE:  By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
THE big trucks packed with cans of food and bags of grain arrive on Tuesdays at the West Side Campaign Against Hunger food pantry, a warren of basement rooms beneath the soaring white stones of the Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew, at West End Avenue and 86th Street. Inside, last Tuesday, a dozen volunteers and employees scurried about counting and stocking, knowing that when the shelves were full the next day the lines would wind around the block in the affluent Upper West Side neighborhood. 
 Sometimes, on busy days, just two hours after opening at 8 a.m., people are told to come back in the afternoon. On an average day a year ago, people from 100 households would come by to load up their shopping carts. That figure today is 168 households. As in so many other New York neighborhoods, there are more hungry people than there is food. 
 Johana Solana and Eduardo Rodriguez, counselors at the pantry, were stocking food on Tuesday and bracing themselves. On Wednesday, with a waiting room full of people, mostly women and children, they would interview clients and collect the documents verifying their need. Recently, a fight broke out in front of the church because the food had run out. Every day, they said, they grapple with sadness and helplessness. Ms. Solana has nightmares. Mr. Rodriguez has started smoking again.
"When I started this job, I expected to see homeless people or people with drug or alcohol problems," Ms. Solana said. "But I'm talking about your average American not able to make that dream. People who have lost jobs in factories, or sales, baggage check, construction, you name it. They are ashamed to come here."
Mr. Rodriguez said: "For me, the undocumented immigrants are the saddest. Because they have no documents, I can't really help them, and they show up with all their kids and you know they are hungry and need help. They say: 'My husband left, and I have three kids. I want to work.' "
Emergency food programs are the other ground zero in New York these days. But with a record loss of 80,000 jobs in October alone, the 32,800 families facing the five-year welfare limit today and a softening economy, New York faces a hunger crisis.
Just as many New Yorkers began to look at police officers and firefighters with renewed respect after Sept. 11, attention must be paid to people like Ms. Solana and Mr. Rodriguez, on the front lines of a different catastrophe. Their stories need to be heard. This city's heightened sense of community and sympathy offers a chance to rethink everything from the minimum wage to subsidized day care. 
Food for Survival, one of the city's most important food-pantry groups, recently issued a report estimating that more than one million people, one out of eight New Yorkers, rely on the city's 1,200 soup kitchens and food pantries to avoid going hungry. The preliminary results of a continuing study by Food for Survival found that since Sept. 11, two-thirds of the people receiving emergency food for the first time were single mothers. About 40 percent of them had lost jobs. They wanted information about job placement and day care.
"I have sat down with people and done the math," Mr. Rodriguez said. "It's paying the rent or buying the groceries. It's using that $6-an-hour job for child care or staying home with the kids yourself and getting welfare."
Ms. Solana, 27, a single mother of a 1-year-old daughter who lives with her mother, her cousin and her cousin's two children in Washington Heights, was once an unhappy statistic.
After years of working, she found that her bachelor's degree in social work was useless when it came to finding a job after moving here from Florida. She ended up at the food pantry in June. Doreen Wohl, the Campaign Against Hunger's executive director, overheard Ms. Solana tell a counselor her educational background and, admiring her warm, forthright manner, hired her. 
"The danger is that in donating to food programs people think they're doing their bit," Ms. Wohl said, showing a visitor an empty storage room on the day before the food deliveries. "This is not the solution. The solution is that people have adequate incomes to walk in and make purchases like dignified human beings."

HEADLINE: ON THE CONTRARY; 
Brother, Can You Spare a Billion?

BYLINE:  By DANIEL AKST; Daniel Akst's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IN attacking our country, terrorists inadvertently demolished more than the World Trade Center, part of the Pentagon and our collective sense of well-being. They also took out some major barriers to corporate welfare.
 How else to explain the sudden proliferation of government handouts to big companies? Some years ago, welfare for people was recognized as something to be restricted as much as possible for everyone's good, yet the venerable practice of handing out money to corporations has survived the rhetoric of the Clinton years and has flourished anew in the aftermath of Sept. 11. 
Like anyone who gets something for nothing, businesses love this stuff, even though it's bad for them -- and even more so for the companies that pay taxes and get no direct handouts. The total bill, after all, is enormous; Stephen Slivinski, a fiscal policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a research center in Washington, estimates that corporate welfare -- direct subsidies to business -- from the federal government amounted to $87 billion in fiscal 2001. 
That's a lot of money, but the cost to the overall economy is many times greater. For some reason, public officials who grasp instantly the case against welfare for people do not understand that the same arguments apply to companies. Welfare saps corporate initiative, for instance. It's an insult to low-wage workers struggling to get by, especially when the chief executive makes millions. And just as conventional welfare hurts the economy by removing some people's talents and energy from the marketplace, corporate welfare makes the economy less efficient by misallocating capital, propping up businesses that should be left to die and imposing a drag on successful ones.
How has corporate welfare blossomed of late? Let us count the ways. First, under cover of terrorism, the government has approved a $15 billion airline bailout. Although $10 billion of that would come as loan guarantees for which the government could at least demand warrants or some other reward for its risk, $5 billion is an outright gift to companies thoughtful enough to fly people around for profit. The airlines, of course, have been hurt by fear of terror and a general economic malaise, but so have cab drivers, hotel operators and tourist traps everywhere, none of whom can see any government help on the horizon. (That is not necessarily for want of trying; so far, travel agents and bus companies have both found advocates in Congress.)
Then there is the section of the House-approved economic stimulus plan that would abolish the corporate alternative minimum tax and refund 15 years' worth of payments to corporations. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service figures that this gift would amount to a jaw-dropping $25 billion giveback to corporations including Ford Motor, General Motors and I.B.M.
Many other companies and industries are lining up for giveaways, too. In October, the House found time amid the din of terror and war to approve the Farm Security Act of 2001. The price of this appalling and irrational collection of agricultural subsidies is $170 billion over 10 years, and if you think this money will bail out the Joads on some dusty family farm, guess again. The main beneficiary of federal farm programs is agribusiness.
Industrialists are getting help, too. In early November, the United States International Trade Commission ruled that foreign steelmakers were hurting American producers by selling us hot-rolled steel too cheaply. That opens the way for the government to impose tariffs, in effect forcing the foreigners to charge us more -- and handing American steelmakers unearned profit. A group of American steelmakers has filed yet another anti-dumping petition with the Commerce Department, including among its targets some of our NATO allies and other countries whose help we might like in the war on terrorism.
The rush to provide welfare for business -- usually big business, at that -- may help a few companies and industries, but it will leave everyone worse off by reducing overall economic growth. Instead of fighting to get their share, enlightened companies should be fighting to get rid of such handouts. But corporate greed and compliant politicians are a tough combination. For too many companies, it is easier to make some campaign donations and then go on the dole.

HEADLINE: Investing; 
A Diversification Path Leads Abroad

BYLINE:  By CONRAD DE AENLLE 

 BODY:
INVESTORS who who have limited themselves to American stocks may want to consider shares of foreign companies that, by some measures, are among the strongest in the world.
 Many global blue chips that have outperformed the American market recently remain moderately priced, analysts say. Some of the stocks have the added virtue of convenience, with United States listings that make them as easy to trade as American shares. 
 "Valuations are reasonable, and the remarkable strength of the dollar makes this a good time to allocate overseas," said Shawn Johnson, research director at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. "To me, the strength of the dollar is more of a reason to put assets overseas now than the terrorism threat or the U.S. recession." 
Companies like Honda Motor, the ANZ Banking Group and Telefonos de Mexico rank among the strongest in the world on a composite measure of value and growth known as the prospective earnings growth, or P.E.G., ratio, according to FactSet Research Systems of Greenwich, Conn. 
The ratio, the price-to-earnings multiple of a company divided by a consensus estimate of expected earnings growth, is an important number for many investors. A low ratio suggests that each dollar of earnings is priced relatively cheaply -- and should become even cheaper because earnings are growing rapidly.
"Investing in stocks with a low P.E.G. ratio and strong price momentum can produce a positive return," Mr. Johnson said. But such measures are "not the be-all and end-all" in selecting stocks, he said, even if they are useful as starting points. 
A low ratio in itself is not always a sign of a strong company. Some stocks have low ratios because their share prices have plunged, a sign of trouble. That is why close attention to a company's recent performance and its competitive and financial position are essential companions of such an analysis, many financial professionals say.
Honda is a popular choice among analysts and fund managers who admire its management for its ability to thrive in in a sluggish economy. "We like Honda because it's the best in its sector," said Steve Tyson, head of global equities at the London office of AXA Investment Managers. Despite problems facing the global auto industry, like overcapacity, he said, "the company can grow market share, particularly in the States."
The United States accounts for the majority of Honda's sales and profits, but with only 7 percent of the American car market, Honda has room to grow. Its strategy has been to create a scarcity premium, Mr. Tyson said. "The philosophy of the company is that size doesn't matter," he said. "It has controlled capacity and brand image. The emphasis is on high-quality production. There are few fears of Honda having overcapacity."
Shahreza Yusof, a fund manager in Singapore for Aberdeen Asset Management, also likes Honda's strategy in the United States. "Waiting lists for the Acura MDX run to a few months, which is impressive in today's market environment," Mr. Yusof said, "and that leads to the industry's lowest costs regarding dealer incentives." He added that Honda had made "successful sharp cuts to production costs with each new model year." The strategy has been so successful that Honda, recession or not, is expected to pay off its debt this year. 
Almost all the large, attractively priced foreign companies traded in the United States are in developed markets, FactSet said. An exception is Telefonos de Mexico, or Telmex, the primary Mexican telephone company. The stock is a favorite of Scott Lewis, co-manager of the Credit Suisse Warburg Pincus Global Telecommunications fund. Emerging-markets phone companies like Telmex, Mr. Lewis said, "generally face less competition than their developed-market peers and are cheaper." 
Telmex benefits from a regulated operating environment but still has great earnings potential, he said. 
Telecommunications analysts at Merrill Lynch, who recommend buying the stock, point to the company's debt load, the lowest among similar companies in emerging markets, and its profit margins, the highest in the sector.
Safety is one of the stock's attractions for analysts at UBS Warburg. They like Telmex's strong cash-flow generation and its decision to reduce capital expenditures, which they estimate will save the company $300 million next year. 
Warburg also recommends buying ANZ, one of several Australian banks it favors, because the bank appears "conspicuously inexpensive against bond yields, fair value against the Australian market and fair value relative to global banks."
The bank focuses mainly on profitable activities like financial and investment services for retail clients, while limiting involvement in riskier ventures like securities underwriting, the analysts say. ANZ is doing a good job of cutting costs, improving efficiency and expanding its business overseas, according to Warburg.
Several pharmaceutical companies with strong growth prospects offer attractive values. Mark Pignatelli, a manager of Continental European equity portfolios at Schroder Investment Management in London, said he particularly liked Novo Nordisk of Denmark.
"Pharmaceuticals is the defensive area that we would sell last," Mr. Pignatelli said. 
Novo Nordisk's strength, he said, lies in its large share of the insulin market and in its NovoSeven anticlotting agent. Noting the drug's $70,000 yearly retail cost for a patient, he said, "to put it mildly, it's a high-margin product."
Simon Melluish, who is based in Conshohocken, Pa., and is responsible for North American equities at Gartmore Investment Management of London, said his funds owned shares of the Royal Bank of Canada. That bank "has been more adept at controlling costs and not paying top dollar" for brokerage assets compared with banks elsewhere, he said.
CANADIAN companies occupy a conspicuous share of the list of low-P.E.G., high-return stocks. Others include Manulife Financial, a life insurance company, and BCE, the holding company for the Bell Canada telephone business. 
"Valuations in Canada tend to be more muted than on Wall Street," Mr. Melluish said. "Manulife is one of three or four life companies that went public in the last two years. They came at good valuations, and operating results have been very good." 
Mr. Melluish described BCE as a north-of-the-border Baby Bell that benefits from its dominance of the tightly regulated market in local phone service while still being able to enter other, more open segments of the industry. BCE also disposed of its large stake in the equipment maker Nortel Networks before Nortel's stock plummeted with the piercing of the technology bubble.

Refurbishing a Courthouse, If Not Its Reputation

BYLINE:  By KELLY CROW

 BODY:
For nearly three years, the New York County Courthouse, better known as the Tweed Courthouse, had been shrouded in scaffolding as the city worked on an $85 million restoration.
 Three weeks ago, the metal wrapping came down, revealing a creamy, marble facade and a new granite staircase rippling down to Chambers Street. 
 Arl Danirov, the bagel cart vendor across the street, called the new view startling. 
"I have only been in New York a year, so I have never seen this before," Mr. Danirov said. "But you see now? It is so beautiful."
Wayne Taylor, a messenger who walks past the courthouse several times a day making deliveries in the City Hall area, stopped for a moment on Friday to admire the new beds of seaweed grass. He remembers what the building looked like before renovations began in May 1999 -- "old and dirty." Now he wonders what kind of work is being done inside.
"Hope it looks as good," he said.
Once again, the Tweed Courthouse is inspiring the curiosity of passers-by, though perhaps not as much as that surrounding its notorious construction from 1862 to 1878. William M. Tweed, or Boss Tweed, ringleader of the Democratic political machine known as Tammany Hall, is perhaps best remembered for having sunk more than $13 million of city money into the project and then funneling most of the money to himself and his cronies.
The courthouse's association with Tweed has stamped it with an air of corruption. Coincidentally, the city has acknowledged that current renovation costs more than doubled, growing from $37 million to $85 million, as the scope of the work expanded. But the work is expected to be completed by February, when the building is to be turned over to its incoming tenant, the Museum of the City of New York, and city officials say all that is needed are the finishing touches.
Last week, about 75 workers were installing bronze doorknobs and ornate, globe-shaped glass lamps in the courthouse's 28-foot-high rooms.
Architects had to refer to old photographs in replicating the fixtures; the originals were destroyed or carted away when the building was converted to a city courthouse in 1929 and to city offices later, said Michael Carey, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, which is overseeing the work.
The 52-foot-wide octagonal skylight above the rotunda has been redecorated with colored glass images of frogs and birds and flowers. All the indoor scaffolding is gone, as the recarving of the columns with pilaster capitals was finished last month. The cast-iron staircases still need to be grinded and repainted, and the floors have yet to be polished.
Outside, the staircase leading to the portico has regained 17 steps lost when the city expanded Chambers Street in 1942.
For Mr. Carey, it is this staircase that best symbolizes the courthouse's return to what he called "its historical integrity."
And what of its Tweed-tainted past?
"Now that we've so rehabilitated this building, maybe it's a good time to give it a good name," he said. "I don't have any ideas, but now the place is spectacular." KELLY CROW

HEADLINE: Personal Business; 
Shaken Consumers Are Looking to Life Insurance

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
FOR years, life insurance was a hard sell. Even some companies that sold it began dropping "life insurance" from their names and calling themselves financial services companies. They recognized that Americans had become less interested in buying protection for their families than in making investments intended to make themselves comfortable in retirement.
 But the terrorist attacks turned life insurance into a hot commodity. 
 "Sept. 11 brought people's mortality back into focus," said Mickey Mann, a life insurance agent in Norman, Okla. "You can kiss your family goodbye and leave home and that's the last time you see them." 
Unlike some other kinds of insurance, life insurance has not increased in cost since the attacks. The companies are not charging more for customers who work in office towers, now regarded as potential terrorist targets. People in the riskiest jobs, like coal miners, have always paid more for life insurance, and they still do. And there have been no changes so far in the costs of coverage for mail handlers or airline crews, even with the threat of terrorism and anthrax infection. 
Life insurance rates are based on life expectancy of the entire American population; over all, rates are not affected by the relatively few people in dangerous jobs or locations. Still, the cost can vary by hundreds of dollars -- the only difference being the choice of companies. 
Across the country, sales of life insurance, which had been declining for years, jumped about 9 percent in October from the same month a year earlier, according to the MIB Group in Westwood, Mass., which compiles data for the industry. 
The average size of a life insurance policy has jumped, too. Byron Udell, the chief executive of the online insurer AccuQuote.com, said the average policy his firm had sold since the attacks was for $443,000, up from $383,000 in the months before Sept. 11. Other agents report that customers have been coming back to increase their coverage. Mr. Mann said one client, a hospital administrator in eastern Oklahoma, had quadrupled his coverage, to $2 million, while a businessman in central Texas had doubled his, to $500,000.
The whole pace of the business has quickened. "We used to get two or three calls a week on life insurance," said Mr. Mann, whose sales have jumped 30 percent since the attacks. "Now we're getting two or three a day. We used to get a lot of Looky-Lous, people just looking, trying to get prices. Now they're serious."
Shannon Curley, an insurance analyst at Banc of America Capital Management, said that estate planning had picked up again and that the sale of larger policies, intended to offset estate taxes, had accelerated. "The attacks reminded people they needed an estate plan," he said. "And the downturn in the economy and the cost of all the antiterrorism things makes it less likely that the estate tax will actually go away." 
Term insurance is the most popular type of policy. It is the least expensive and works well for people who want coverage only until their children are grown. It is sold for a specific term, in contrast to whole life insurance, which is intended to remain in force over a lifetime. Term life often costs less than 10 percent of what whole life costs, but it lacks whole life's savings feature, which accumulates money that can be borrowed against or spent.
A few weeks ago, Todd Munday, 30, who owns a mortgage brokerage firm in Norman, Okla., bought $250,000 of term life coverage for 20 years, at $41 a month. "Things seem to be happening all around us now," said Mr. Munday, who is married and has a 2-year-old son. "If something happened to me and my wife wasn't covered, well, I don't know. I've got a house payment, two car payments and I'm self-employed."
Manila Whitehorse, 38, the owner of a hair salon in Norman, decided that she needed more coverage. She already had $125,000 in whole life insurance and bought a $150,000 term life policy that runs for 30 years and costs her $29 a month. Her husband, John Clour, 51, plans to buy at least a $250,000 term policy after he graduates from law school in December. They have a 19-year-old son, Ryan, in college. "You realize how short life really is," Ms. Whitehorse said.
Both Mr. Munday and Ms. Whitehorse bought policies from the Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company that cost 20 to 30 percent more than the least expensive term policies, though the difference can be three times greater. But under the provisions of their policies, they will get all their money back if they pay premiums until the end of their coverage terms. (There is a danger: many people drop these "return of premium" policies after a few years and end up paying more than they would for standard ones.)
How much life insurance should anyone buy? Originally, life insurance was intended to cover burial expenses. As the idea expanded, many people began to regard the insurance as a financial bridge for survivors until they could find other income. For a long time now, it has been billed as a replacement for lost income so that survivors can go on without a change in lifestyle. Of course, independently wealthy people with few or no dependents may not need life insurance.
But for those who do, most experts say the right amount is now 10 times a policyholder's annual income. For someone earning $100,000 a year, that would be $1 million. Jackson National Life Insurance offers that coverage in a term policy for a 40-year-old man in excellent health for $740 a year; it is available for $745 from the Empire General Life Assurance Corporation and for $765 from General American Life Insurance, Mr. Udell said. Some companies, however, provide the same coverage for about $1,500, and one company, Employers Modern Life, charges $2,310.
Over all, prices for term life insurance have been dropping because of competition and because people have been living longer. That means companies can collect premiums longer and pay fewer death benefits. 
Five years ago, for example, a $500,000 policy for a 40-year-old man in excellent health cost as little as $830. Now, Mr. Udell said, three companies -- Banner Life Insurance, General American Life Insurance and West Coast Life Insurance -- offer the same coverage for $420. That is $60 less than in early 2000, when prices jumped briefly after state regulators required insurers to add to their expenses by increasing their reserves. But some companies are selling the same coverage for about $800 and one company, Employers Modern Life, offers the coverage at $1,170, Mr. Udell said.
COMPARISON shopping is important. Not long ago, there were two ways to do so: by contacting several companies or by calling a broker who represents a handful of them. But the Internet has simplified the process in many ways. You can click to AccuQuote.com or Quotesmith.com, for example, answer a few questions and, in a few minutes, have some price quotations.
But price is not the only consideration. Experts suggest sticking with companies with financial strength ratings of A or better from rating agencies. For term policies, they also recommend a feature called convertibility. It permits a policyholder to shift automatically into a whole life policy when a term policy expires, without submitting to a medical examination. Without that feature, a person whose health is deteriorating as the term insurance runs out could face a staggering price for another policy or be denied coverage.
In buying coverage over the Internet, however, some prospective buyers provide overly rosy assessments of their health. That can result in a low price, but one that an insurer will not honor if a medical examination turns up conflicting information. In that case, experts say, it is often better to start the search again rather than to accept an adjusted price. An insurer who offers great prices for people who are in excellent health may not be competitive on coverage for people who are not. 
Other complications can arise. Companies can be idiosyncratic in assessing risk -- some may be happy to insure scuba divers and pilots of small planes at their best rates while others charge extra. Smokers may find different rates at different companies. Insurers also have varying definitions of dangerously high cholesterol levels or different standards for height and weight ratios, used to measure obesity.
All this makes it difficult to buy insurance on the Internet without the help of an agent. One tactic is to use the Internet to get an idea of prices, then to go to an agent. AccuQuote combines both approaches. It provides some comparative price quotations but also has an agent contact a prospective customer.
Most companies using the Internet have yet to offer discounts for bypassing a commissioned agent.
Cathy Riddle, 34, who is pregnant with her first child, and her husband, Paul, 31, computer programmers who live in Elkridge, Md., did not turn to the Internet for life insurance. They checked with their employer and with an agent referred by a friend. The agent's price was better: two policies of $1.25 million each for 20 years from Transamerica Life Insurance, at $900 a year in premiums for her, $1,300 for him.
They wrapped up the deal in two phone calls. "We were pretty sold that we needed life insurance," Mrs. Riddle said. "Now, anytime you travel, you never know what's going to happen."

HEADLINE: By Any Name, It's the Mercedes of Cargo Vans 

BYLINE:  By NORMAN S. MAYERSOHN 

 BODY:
ARE American tradesmen and delivery people ready for the Sprinter commercial van by Mercedes-Benz? My plumber would appear to be; he motored up in a vintage 560 SL roadster to give an estimate for a new bathroom. Given the size of that estimate, he may be able to afford several Sprinters.
 Alas, if he should decide to haul his drain snakes and pipe wrenches in one, he will have to make do without a three-pointed star on the grille. The new work van will carry the name of Freightliner, the American truck subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler, along with badges that say, "Powered by Mercedes-Benz." 
 DaimlerChrysler officials say they chose to market the Sprinter this way because Freightliner is their recognized channel for commercial vehicles. But they were also mindful of the impression that might arise if a carpenter arrived in a vehicle that Americans associate with luxury.
But even without the gleaming wood trim and leather-wrapped thrones of Mercedes luxury sedans, the Sprinter may attract a devoted following. Since its introduction in Western Europe in 1995, it has become the best-selling commercial delivery van. In this country, FedEx has agreed to buy 1,900 of the distinctive slope-nosed Sprinters.
The Sprinter's agility, compared with heavy-duty versions of the Ford Econoline or Chevy Express vans, may be a big attraction in crowded cities. "The vehicle was originally designed for small and tight European streets, so the turning circle is amazingly short," said Tim Reuss, president and chief executive of DaimlerChrysler Vans in Huntersville, N.C.
The Sprinter gets its power from an advanced five-cylinder diesel engine, the same one installed in the Mercedes E270 sedan in Europe -- but not emissions-certified for use in passenger cars in the United States. The 2.7-liter power plant is rated at 156 horsepower and is paired with the five-speed automatic transmission from the S-Class luxury sedan.
Because the engine uses energy-efficient technologies like direct fuel injection -- a design in which the fuel is delivered straight to the engine's cylinders for combustion -- the Sprinter can achieve 22 m.p.g., according to Mercedes-Benz, about 20 percent better than competitors.
Safety features include four-wheel antilock disc brakes, a stability control and dual air bags on trucks with passenger seats.
Both cargo and passenger models come in three wheelbase configurations, two weight-capacity ratings and two roof heights. Cargo models are assembled in Gaffney, S.C., from component kits prepared in Germany, at a plant where Freightliner builds medium-duty trucks.
Don't worry about a flood of Sprinters filling the spaces outside your next P.T.A. meeting. Although individuals can buy and register the vans, these plus-size carriers -- with up to three times the cargo space of a Honda Odyssey -- are unlikely to lure many soccer moms from their Caravans and Expeditions.
The first of the cargo models went on sale this fall starting at $27,075; passenger vans, destined for duty as airport shuttles, range from $28,525 to $35,325. DaimlerChrysler hopes sales will reach 7,000 a year, through a network of 50 Freightliner dealers.
The decision to bring the Sprinter to North America was driven by a perception that e-commerce would fuel huge demand for home deliveries. While the dot-com decline altered that view, Mr. Reuss still sees great potential for his maxi-van.
"The market opportunity now is very interesting," he said. "And Sprinter is the only cargo van specifically designed for the purpose. It's not a derivation."

HEADLINE: School Budget Cuts 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "Economy Puts Schools in Tough Position" (news article, Nov. 26) did not put into context the spending reductions proposed by Gov. Gray Davis of California. 
Even with the proposed $843 million cut, Mr. Davis will still have provided education with a year-over-year increase of well over $1 billion, in a year when state revenues will be down as much as $14 billion. The amount of increased state spending on education over the last three years is 10 times greater than the amount of the proposed cuts. 
 The vast majority of the proposed spending reductions are targeted at new programs that have not been put into effect, programs that have left unspent money provided to them by the state or programs that will simply be delayed. The proposed cuts spare essential classroom programs as well as after-school programs serving 1.2 million students.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: WASHINGTON HEIGHTS; 
Flying to Santo Domingo, Rum in Hand, for Holidays

BYLINE:  By SETH KUGEL 

 BODY:
New York's Dominicans may soon have another carrier to ferry them on the immensely popular air route to their homeland. The move will challenge American Airlines, which is now the only commercial airline that flies from Kennedy International Airport to Santo Domingo. 
 "Perfect, magnificent," said Olga Corniel, a home attendant from Washington Heights. "If it's new, that's what we need." 
 The rival airline is Peru's Aero Continente. It plans to begin daily flights from Kennedy to Santo Domingo on Dec. 10. The announcement comes with airlines still suffering the economic and psychological aftereffects of Sept. 11. It also comes just weeks after American Airlines Flight 587 to Santo Domingo crashed over Belle Harbor, Queens, although the move was planned long before the accident. 
Pending expected approval from the United States Department of Transportation, Aero Continente will begin daily departures at 12:30 p.m. from Kennedy to Santo Domingo and on to Lima in time for the heavy travel of the Christmas season. 
American operates four flights a day to Santo Domingo during the holiday season. With most of those flights fully booked between now and Christmas, many Dominicans welcome more planes on the route. Aero Continente will have 290 seats on its new daily flight.
Many Dominicans also welcome the competition. Although Continental Airlines operates some flights from Newark, many Dominicans say American has a virtual monopoly, with tickets often topping $600. Ms. Corniel said she avoided flying home at Christmas because of the "super high" prices.
Aero Continente says it will offer a peak-season rate of $399 for a round trip.
"It's a shame that the Dominican Republic does not have a national airline that can cover the New York route," said Anthony Duran, the new general manager for Aero Continente's New York operations, adding, "American is taking advantage."
Marty Heires, a spokesman for American Airlines, said, "We welcome the competition." He added, "We feel we have a loyal customer base in Santo Domingo and we're going to continue to do the best job we can." He would not comment on pricing strategy.
Aero Continente is planning to make its service culturally appropriate.
"We will be the Latino option for our customers," said Jose Ares, the airline's general manager in Santo Domingo. Thirty Latin American flight attendants are now training in the Dominican Republic for the flights from Kennedy. Free Dominican rum will be served on board, and a typical meal might consist of rice, beans and beef, said Mr. Duran, a meal often referred to as "the Dominican flag." American has stopped serving meals on some of its flights.
But not everything will be Latin. Because Aero Continente does not currently have enough employees to work the flights, it has hired an outside company to provide the plane and cockpit crew, a common practice. The aircraft and pilot flying Dominican immigrants home this holiday season will be Icelandic. SETH KUGEL

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/John J. McCabeAnd Mark F. Trautman; 
M.S.B. Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
FORECASTING what consumers, businesses and investors will do during normal times is as difficult as trying to put a pair of pants on an elephant, says John J. McCabe co-manager of the $58 million M.S.B. Fund. 
 Trying to do so after the events of Sept. 11 is utterly futile, he said, yet he and his co-manager, Mark F. Trautman, still make such forecasts, believing that it is sensible to buy stocks as long as they keep a truly long-term view in mind. "We will make some mistakes, but we do our homework, and time, patience and history are on our side," Mr. McCabe said from his office in Midtown Manhattan. "We plan to keep our companies for a long, long time." 
 In 2000, the fund's turnover rate was a tiny 15 percent, versus more than 100 percent for the average domestic diversified stock fund, according to Morningstar Inc. 
The fund returned 2.9 percent a year, on average, in the three years ended Thursday, versus a 0.1 percent loss for all large blend funds and a 0.2 percent decline for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, Morningstar said. It lost 4.2 percent in the last 12 months, versus a 14.9 percent loss for its group and a 13.9 percent loss for the S.& P.
Mr. McCabe, 58, is senior vice president of Shay Assets Management, the fund's investment adviser, which is based in Chicago and manages about $3 billion for seven mutual funds and for institutions. Mr. Trautman, 36, is vice president of Shay. Though the fund is open to all investors, it was originally intended as an investment portfolio for employees of New York State mutual savings banks, hence the name M.S.B.
The managers describe themselves as Graham-and-Dodd investors. In 1934, Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd wrote "Security Analysis," the classic text for value investors. Perhaps their most famous disciple is Warren Buffett, chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, M.S.B.'s biggest holding, at about 6 percent of assets.
Berkshire Hathaway owns General Re, one of the largest global reinsurers. "Their rates have gone up quite a bit," Mr. McCabe said, "which should more than offset the payments that they will be required to make on account of Sept. 11, which won't occur for a number of years because it will take time to evaluate and pay off the claims."
The managers pick the 25 to 30 stocks in the fund from among United States companies with market capitalization of at least $5 billion. They look for companies that are dominant in their businesses, with consistent growth in long-term cash flow in established industries. They also want solid management and significant free cash flow -- what is left after capital expenses.
Because they look for sustainable competitive advantages, the managers typically avoid technology companies. Two exceptions are Intel and Microsoft, which dominate their markets, Mr. Trautman said.
The managers prefer companies with ratios of debt to market capitalization below 50 percent, depending on the industry, as a cushion during periods of economic weakness. They also want returns on capital of at least 15 percent over five years or more.
To value a company, they calculate an internal rate of return by forecasting the share price 10 years ahead, based on probable cash flow. Generally, they want that rate to average at least 12 to 15 percent a year. 
On Sept. 21, the fund bought shares of the State Street Corporation of Boston, a provider of investment services and management, at an average of $39.57. The price exceeded $50 in the summer but fell during the general market decline after Sept. 11 and is now at $52.34. State Street's business has grown consistently, Mr. Trautman said, and he expects the company to generate an internal rate of return of 11 or 12 percent a year in the next 10 years.
The managers bought shares of Procter & Gamble in July at an average of $69.62; they now trade at $77.46. The company's growth slowed early last year, Mr. McCabe said, as name-brand products in the paper products area, including Bounty paper towels and Charmin toilet tissue, were hurt by higher raw-material costs and increased competition. The stock had traded at more than $100 in early 2000.
"We don't mind buying a low-growth company if it is reflected in the stock price," he said. He expects a long-term internal rate of return averaging 11 percent.
The slowdown in consumer spending also pushed down the stock of Sherwin-Williams, the paint company in Cleveland. The fund bought shares in January at an average of $24.66; they had traded as high as $26 in the spring of 2000.
"People are pricing the company as if it will have low same-store sales growth or none at all," Mr. Trautman said. "When the economy rebounds, people will buy more paint." 
He expects an 11 percent internal rate of return in the next 5 to 10 years.
The stock closed on Friday at $27.99.

 BODY:
VINCENT AU'S mother says that God messes with her son. Twice he has faced death. Twice he has lived. He has given both those lives to his work.
 Mr. Au, a 31-year-old stockbroker, founded a small brokerage firm called Avalon Partners in 1998. The next year, he and two employees moved into a modest office on the 18th floor of 2 World Trade Center. On Aug. 13, 2001, the company relocated to a spacious new office on the 84th floor of the north tower. 
 All that is gone now.
Large corporate tenants of the twin towers -- Cantor Fitzgerald, Marsh & McLennan -- have naturally loomed large in reports of the tragedy. But thousands of small businesses, like Avalon, were also directly affected by the Sept. 11 attack. 
According to the CoStar Group, a real estate information service, nearly two-thirds of the tenants of the trade center occupied less than 10,000 square feet, modest digs in the corporate world.
Some of these small ventures have vanished. Others, like Avalon Partners, are beginning their struggles through the afterlife. For many, like Mr. Au, the scramble to rebuild is a sad if strenuous re-enactment of their efforts to create the ventures in the first place.
Economically, the revival of these small businesses is crucial. According to J. P. Morgan Chase, before the attacks there were nearly 7,800 businesses with annual revenues of less than $10 million at ground zero, and about 34,800 of them south of 14th Street.
Modest enterprises like Avalon Partners have been a major engine of growth for the city. But unlike larger firms, many of these companies have no backup systems, little infrastructure, small staffs and limited access to credit. And anyway, achieving the outward signs of recovery -- finding a new office, buying new computers -- does not alone reinflate the client list, restore morale or revive other intangibles. Replacing the tools does not mean the old world will return.
"Every time you think you have a leg up on it," Mr. Au said of his climb toward recovery, "another thing happens."
On Sept. 11, Vincent Au escaped with his life. Now comes the hard part.
Mr. Au, whose parents emigrated from Hong Kong when he was 2 months old, drives a silver Porsche Boxster and has his suits tailored at Peppino's on the Upper East Side. But he was lured into the financial services industry by the promise of free food.
Growing up in Chinatown and New Springville, Staten Island, Mr. Au (pronounced ow) attended Pace University, where he majored in finance and later got an M.B.A. As a freshman, he found a job making "cold calls" for a brokerage firm. The position offered $5 an hour and pizza or McDonald's three nights a week, a big jump over his summer job as a cook at the Roy Rogers across from the World Trade Center.
"I was giddy," said Mr. Au, a single man with an open face and an easy demeanor. "I really liked the job, and quite frankly, I'm not too good at too many other things."
While still a teenager, Mr. Au became a licensed broker. "I could sell stock, but I couldn't legally drink alcohol," he said. He spent the next decade tearing through a series of small brokerage firms. Soon, the money came pouring in. In 1994, he moved into a one-bedroom apartment in Battery Park City, paying just under $2,000 a month. The next year, he bought a black BMW for $55,000.
Through it all, Mr. Au had some collisions with the securities establishment. According to his record at the National Association of Securities Dealers, he was "discharged" from two jobs and "permitted to resign" from another. In one instance, the association suspended his license for 10 days, fined him $5,000 and required him to retake an industry exam.
"Like everybody else, I made a mistake," Mr. Au said about his record. "It's done."
But Mr. Au also has his own gripes with the industry. He particularly chafes at what he sees as the pressures that Wall Street firms place on their brokers.
"Everybody has a list of stocks they want their brokers to promote," he said. "Half of them are based on the fact that they have a banking relationship with them."
One reason he founded Avalon, Mr. Au said, was to challenge that system. The firm, which he started with Peter Bull, an English client, would dispense investment advice without engaging in underwriting, which might endanger its objectivity.
"If we have a firm motto, it's that we want to give everybody a fair shake," said Mr. Au, who is not unfamiliar with the persuasive arts. "That's all the investment public can really ask for."
Mr. Bull provided the bulk of the $350,000 start-up money. "I had no reason to trust him, but I did," Mr. Bull said. "It turned out to be a good move."
Mr. Au had a list of 500 clients from his years in the business, but that was about his only asset. Even Office Depot wouldn't give him a line of credit. "How do you want me to get credit if you don't extend credit?" Mr. Au asked.
He did not have a name for his fledgling company, either. "I spent two weekends in a row at the Barnes & Noble looking for a Latin phrase or a Greek name that would really serve me well," he said. "All the good names were taken." Eventually, he found his inspiration at Park Avalon, a restaurant on Park Avenue South South he visited regularly to see a bartender friend.
In bringing Avalon to life, Mr. Au ran up $30,000 in debt on his credit cards, beyond the money from Mr. Bull. "Sometimes I was afraid to go home," he said. "I thought Visa might have a hit man waiting for me." 
His parents were anxious, too. "We were very upset by his experiments in finance," said his father, George Au, an assistant manager in accounting at Citigroup, at which he has worked for more than 30 years. "We didn't know if he could afford to run the business."
"My parents are very button-down conservative," said Mr. Au, calling his father "a loyal company man."
"They would have loved to see me become a doctor, an accountant, something that's more stable than riding the peaks and troughs of Wall Street."
But Mr. Au sought something different. "I wanted to work for myself," he said. He dreamed of building a boutique brokerage firm with offices in Europe, Asia and the United States.
It is the vision of a driven man. "In high school he was all about tennis," said his younger brother, Terry. But in college, Mr. Au's competitiveness found a new outlet in finance. 
One clue to his singlemindedness is that Vincent Au can recite more than 300 phone numbers from memory. But nearly all the numbers are clients'; Terry's number he has to look up.

A First Brush With Death
On July 5, 1998, just before Avalon Partners was to open, Mr. Au was on his way to dinner in Chinatown when a truck ran a red light, causing him to crash his BMW into a hair salon. "I almost died," he said. He was hospitalized for more than a month. 
So instead of taking shape in a proper office, Avalon Partners was born in Mr. Au's Battery Park City apartment. (He moved out in spring 2000.) His mother took a two-month leave of absence from her job as a service agent at Verizon and helped him with everything from having phone lines installed to cooking dinner.
"I got on my walker, then my crutches, then my cane," Mr. Au said. "I rolled out of bed, turned on CNBC, and worked at my kitchen table for seven or eight months." 
Then, in April 1999, he hired a broker and a secretary and moved into an office for $4,000 a month on the 18th floor of the south tower.
"It was such a great leap forward," he said. "It was a validation of the work I had put in. It wasn't much -- 1,100 square feet, two offices, and a little open area -- but it was mine and it was great."
It was also good for business.
"Being a small firm, when you're talking to a client overseas and you tell them your office is in the World Trade Center, your respectability goes up a huge amount," he said. "They knew, O.K., I'm not calling you from a Chinese restaurant. I'm a legitimate company."
He "fired" his mother.
"I never paid my mom," he said. "She doesn't want money. She wants me to get married and give her half a dozen grandchildren." 
Avalon's clients, Mr. Au said, include homemakers, chief executives, football players and physicians, with from $10,000 to $10 million in assets.
The firm has no money for a research staff, so Mr. Au researches investment opportunities himself. Sometimes friends at large brokerage houses give him research reports. Avalon brokers also come up with their own ideas.
Mr. Au himself prefers stocks that have plummeted in value, an investment strategy that requires fearless optimism. "We don't dance on anybody's grave," he said. "But we do like companies that are distressed and out of favor."
One favorite is Ericsson, the Swedish telecom giant. Its stock traded above $26 in March 2000 and closed Friday at $5.46 on Nasdaq. Mr. Au said it could "easily double" in the next 6 to 12 months. 
One of Mr. Au's first clients, Harper LeBel, who was a tight end for the Baltimore Ravens and other pro football teams, said: "He told me, 'I buy stocks like your wife shops for clothes. I look for a discount.' "
Mr. LeBel also said Mr. Au doesn't sit on stocks for long. "Vincent is not a buy-and-hold guy," the investor said. "Sometimes I tease him. I said if you've got this stock after lunch I'd be surprised."
As the years passed, the firm grew. In late 1999, Avalon Partners opened an office in Frankfurt, to be run by some former colleagues of Mr. Au. Last year, Mr. Au said, the firm's revenues were $1.5 million, up from $150,000 in 1998.
"In the three or four months before Sept. 11, things were really picking up," Mr. Bull said. The firm had 2,500 clients and was managing more than $50 million in assets. The New York office had 11 employees and the Frankfurt office 15.
Mr. Au and Mr. Bull were also gambling on a big expansion of their headquarters. On Aug. 13, Avalon moved up to an office on the 84th floor of the north tower that was five times the size and cost of the old one, 5,300 square feet at just under $20,000 a month. Within a year, they hoped to have 35 employees and revenues of $4 million. On the drawing board were plans for offices on the West Coast and in London and Hong Kong.
"Even though he wasn't born here, it's the American dream," Mr. Au's father said.
The new furniture came. So did an airplane.

Pursued by a Dust Cloud
On Sept. 11, Mr. Au arrived at work at 7:30 a.m., as usual. Victor Wald and Gary Lam, both brokers, were the only other employees there. Mr. Au was drinking tea and reading the newspaper when a plane crashed into Tower 1, about 12 floors above his office. He thought it was a bomb.
He gathered his employees and followed some Japanese bankers to an intact exit. The men were soon separated in the crowded stairway. 
"Victor was right with me," Mr. Au said. "Then he became right behind me, and then. . . ."
It took him nearly an hour to get out of the building. Outside, debris was falling. He headed for his father's office on Wall Street.
"When I got to the Federal Reserve building, I heard people screaming," Mr. Au said. "I looked back and all I saw was this thousand-foot-high dust cloud coming at me."
He ran. "People were falling, I just hopped over them, one bad leg and all," he said. Then, exhausted, he sat down and said to the onrushing cloud, "Hey, you got me. If I die, you got me here." 
The dust came, but Mr. Au made it to his father's office, where they waited for the second tower, Mr. Au's tower, to fall.
It did. Down came the new cherry-wood chairs, the tax files, the client records, the 20 new Dell computers, the 20 new Hewlett-Packard printers and the $21,000 phone system. Down came the Derek Jeter baseball and the "Jerry Maguire" poster autographed by Tom Cruise. Down came the list of leads and the five-year plan.
Mr. Lam had survived, but Mr. Wald was missing. He was last seen sitting on a staircase in the tower, unable to move.

New Office, Few Supplies
"This whole thing hurt me more because my work is my shelter," Mr. Au said of the Sept. 11 attack.
Some of the pain could be measured. The company lost $85,000 worth of new furniture and equipment. By Oct. 5, Mr. Au had poured a third of the company's cash reserves into rebuilding. For weeks, revenues hovered around 15 percent of normal. Only part of the losses were insured. "We just got a thank-you note from Workbench because we bought all that furniture," Mr. Au said. "It's kind of funny. Not funny."
The Workbench delivery, which arrived at the end of August, was supposed to take six to eight weeks. "I befriended the manager at the store," Mr. Au said. "We got it in three weeks."
Some things could not be measured. "I cannot sleep at night," he said. "Things spook you a lot more. When a truck hits a pothole, that bang. . . ." 
On Oct. 8, Avalon Partners opened for business at its new office on the 34th floor of 60 Broad Street. Mr. Au signed a 10-year lease for the space, which is one block from the New York Stock Exchange. "I don't want anybody chasing me out," he said, explaining the location and the long lease. "It's our home. If we leave, they win."
The office overlooks ground zero. From their desks, the employees can see too much of the river. The spot where the twin towers used to be is filled with the glorious blue of the Hudson.
Four brokers and one trader showed up for work Oct. 8. They didn't have business cards, stationery, a copier, a fax machine or printers. They could not make international phone calls. The secretary did not show up. Some cabinet keys were missing. They had no permanent phone number to give clients.
Tom Maiden, one broker, stared at his dark computer screen. How do you work without a computer? "You don't," he said.
Branden Gillespie, 24, had got his first job as a broker at Avalon Partners last July. He made cold calls and $250 a week. "This guy Osama bin Laden robbed me," Mr. Gillespie said that day. "I was just taking off financially." With his list of prospective clients lying amid the rubble, he said, "That phone weighs about 400 pounds right now. I don't want to pick it up."
In the next several weeks, there was progress, but it was fitful. Dell Computer gave Mr. Au 30 percent off on 10 new computers. But then the phones stopped working, and everyone stayed home for three days. Mr. Au's loan from the Small Business Administration has yet to be approved, and he has made little progress on reconstructing lost client records.
Still, by last week, most of the logistics were in place. Mr. Au was able to think about growth, not just recovery. He hired a new broker and expects four more to arrive soon. Today, he estimated, revenues are about 50 percent of normal. "We're a lot more focused on the work," he said. 
But time and energy have not healed all. Last week, the office was still heavy with quiet. No jokes flew across the room.
"Monetarily it was bad, but it wasn't a death sentence," Mr. Au said. "What hurt us more than anything else was the morale."
The firm had been at a high point before Sept. 11. Employees were excited about the new space, the new recruits, the expansion. After Sept. 11, the team began to fall apart. 
Some brokers were upset by the way the rebuilding was handled by Mr. Au, who defends his acts as the best possible in trying times. Mr. Lam, seeing "no future at Avalon," resigned in late October. Since early November Mr. Gillespie has been on a leave of absence, trying to get a handle on his post-Sept. 11 world.
"It's a rough patch right now," said Mr. Au, who hopes that as business improves morale will, too. "It's like something that's in the air. You can't put your finger on it. Even though everything else in your body tells you to move on, to get over it, it's like a lingering cold that won't go away."
But while Avalon sits under the spell of a strange sickness, the clock is ticking. The markets move. Money is made.
"We have a phrase in Chinese from when I was a kid," Mr. Au said. "In English translation it goes, 'Which is more valuable: An ounce of gold or an ounce of time?' Of course being a capitalist, an ounce of gold. I didn't figure it out. You can't buy time back."

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES; 
The Stock Market Must Rise in 2002? Think Again

BYLINE:  By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter based in Annandale, Va. His column on investment strategies appears every other week. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
STATISTICIANS refer to it as the gamblers' fallacy: betting that the odds of an event's occurrence depend on previous events that in fact have no relationship to it.
 If the ball in a roulette wheel lands on red four times in a row, for example, many gamblers believe that on the fifth spin there is a much higher-than-average chance that the ball will land on black. Of course, the odds of landing on black are static: they do not change, regardless of the sequence of reds and blacks that have come before. 
 The gamblers' fallacy is much in evidence among investment advisers these days. Many of the advisory newsletters that I monitor have contended in recent weeks that equities must rise in 2002, a view based on the claim that the United States stock market has never declined for three years in a row. (They are making the seemingly safe assumption that 2001 will go down in the record books as a second consecutive year of losses, since the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is down almost 14 percent with just a month remaining.) 
The argument is based on both bad history and sloppy statistical reasoning. 
Consider the most striking counterexample, from the Depression years of the early 1930's. After declining in both 1930 and 1931, stocks should have risen in 1932, according to their theory. Instead, the market was further rocked, declining by 42.9 percent, as measured by the Standard & Poor's Composite Index, the precursor to the S.& P. 500.
What about 1933, the year after that? Stocks lost an additional 8.6 percent, for a fourth consecutive year of decline.
Some newsletter editors concede that there is no certainty that stocks will rise after two down years, but they still believe that the odds of their doing so are much higher than average. To find the right way to respond to their argument, I analyzed the stock market's yearly gyrations back to 1872. Over those 129 years, there were eight occasions in which the stock market, as measured by the S.& P. Composite Index or the S.& P. 500, declined for two years in a row. In the calendar years immediately after those eight occasions, the stock market rose in six of them -- or 75 percent of the time.
Such odds may strike you as good enough to justify placing an outsized bet that stocks will climb in 2002. But you would be wrong, since the stock market rises in most years anyway. The 75 percent average is, in fact, statistically indistinguishable from the percentage of years in which the stock market rises in general. Over the last 129 years, stocks have climbed in 95 of them, or 74 percent of the time. 
The inescapable conclusion is that the stock market's yearly gyrations are independent of one another. If the future is like the past, there is about a three-in-four chance that the stock market will rise next year. Those are not bad odds, but they have nothing to do with the fact that 2000 was a down year and that 2001 is likely to be, too.
IT does not follow from this conclusion, however, that all movements of the stock market are random. Instead, investors should conclude that the patterns that exist in the stock market do not manifest themselves in neat and tidy calendar-year intervals.
Researchers in recent years have discovered a number of exploitable patterns. Stocks that trade at very low price-to-book ratios, for example, tend to have above-average performance. So do stocks of companies where insiders are buying, rather than selling, shares, and where stock repurchasing programs are in place.
Investors, then, should focus on these
patterns, not on the sequencing of the
stock market's calendar-year gains and losses.

HEADLINE: Investing; 
Metal Stocks Gain Ground Amid Cuts In Production

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO 

 BODY:
WITH profits tumbling and mines closing, producers of base metals would appear to be enduring the worst of times.
 Yet companies like Alcoa and Alcan in aluminum, Inco and Falconbridge in nickel and Phelps Dodge in copper have been popular with investors in recent weeks, outpacing the broader market. 
 Alcoa, based in Pittsburgh, announced on Nov. 19 that it was eliminating 6,500 jobs and would take an after-tax charge of $200 million to $250 million in the fourth quarter. But its stock has climbed 36 percent, to $38.60, since it fell to $28.30 on Sept. 21. 
Other metals stocks have fared well since their lows in the aftermath of Sept. 11. Phelps Dodge, based in Phoenix, is up 39percent since Sept. 26, closing on Friday at $35.83. Inco, based here, has climbed almost 46 percent, to $16.10, since Sept. 26. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, by comparison, is up 21 percent since its low on Sept. 21.
The jump in these stocks reflects a rise in commodity prices. The price of copper, the most widely used industrial metal, is often regarded as an early indicator of manufacturing activity. It jumped to over 75 cents a pound last week, from 63 cents in mid-October, its lowest level in almost a decade. Aluminum was up to 65 cents a pound last week, from 59 cents in early November. 
The spurts have occurred despite economic data that continues to paint a bleak picture of the world economy. The Commerce Department reported last week that industrial output in the United States fell for the 13th month in a row in October. 
Nevertheless, investors have taken heart from two developments. One is a rise in long-term interest rates, inspiring predictions that the worst of the downturn may be over. The other is the move by producers of copper, nickel, aluminum and zinc to cut output, to bring supply in line with demand.
Indeed, the impetus for the market rally was the announcement by Phelps Dodge on Oct. 23 that it was curtailing copper production by 220,000 metric tons a year. Since then, BHP Billiton of Australia has cut 170,000 tons annually from operations in Chile and Peru. Several other companies have followed suit.
"We've had a pretty good portfolio of cutbacks," said Terence S. Ortslan, whose research company in Montreal tracks base metals. "We needn't worry about demand or inventories now. That will come later".
Investors also appear to be banking on merger and takeover moves to help base metal stocks. WMC, an Australian producer of alumina, nickel and copper, said on Nov. 21 that it was rejecting a takeover bid by Alcoa and splitting into two businesses, partly to encourage competitive bids for its constituent parts. Its stock fell after the announcement but then rallied somewhat.
Some companies are more sensitive than others to price changes in the underlying commodities. Phelps Dodge is among the most responsive in that way. The company says its pretax earnings rise or fall about $20 million, or 25 a cents a share, for each one-cent move in the price of a pound of copper. Inco says its earnings move about 15 cents a year for every 10-cent-a-pound change in nickel prices. 
Aluminum producers, on the other hand, rely more on manufactured products, especially for the automotive and packaging industries. In the process, analysts say, their earnings are becoming less volatile. Anthony B. Rizzuto Jr., an analyst at Bear Stearns in New York, has set a price target of $45 for Alcoa within the next 12 months.
Michael F. Gambardella, mining analyst at J. P. Morgan in New York, says the "enormous" balance sheet and borrowing capacity of Alcoa put it at the top his list of favorites.
But not everyone is convinced that the fire under metal and mining stocks will burn as strongly as it has in recent weeks. Lawrence Smith, an analyst at TD Newcrest in Toronto, said he was "leery" of the sector. "You need to have an improving trend in industrial production globally, and I think that's still some way off," Mr. Smith said.
The recent surge in Inco's share price led John Redstone, an analyst at Scotia Capital in Montreal, to downgrade the stock to "buy" from "strong buy" last week. In a report, Mr. Redstone predicted that nickel consumption in Western countries would fall 2.9 percent this year but would grow 4 percent in 2002 as stainless-steel production picked up.
Moody's Investors Service said it was reviewing the credit rating of Noranda, a copper and aluminum producer based in Toronto, for a possible downgrade. According to Moody's, "conditions in the metal industry are expected to remain challenging well into 2002." 
The challenge for investors may be to decide whether the recent action in commodity markets heralds an upturn in the overall economy. If so, base metal stocks could be strong performers in the coming months. If not, the stocks could founder.
Mr. Gambardella of J. P. Morgan, for one, has concluded that "the easy money has been made already" in the sector.

PatriotBond Sales To Begin This Month

BYLINE:  Compiled by Jeff Sommer 

 BODY:
The Treasury will begin selling Patriot Bonds this month, but unlike the war bonds of the 1940's, these savings bonds will not generate revenue designated for a particular national purpose.
 The money will go into the Treasury's general coffers and, like all other revenue, "will contribute to the federal government's overall effort to fight the war on global terrorism," the department said. 
The House and the Senate had separately approved bills calling for "war bonds" but have not enacted legislation. The Treasury, which originally was not enthusiastic about the proposal, has moved ahead on its own, inscribing a variation on the standard Series EE savings bonds as Patriot Bonds. 
The bonds will be available at the middle of the month in denominations of $50 to $10,000, the Treasury said, and will be sold at banks and through a Treasury Web site, www.savingsbonds.com. Like other EE bonds, they will be sold at half their face value. Until April 2002, they offer a yield of 4.07 percent.
By comparison, the Treasury's inflation-adjusted bonds, or I bonds, also offered in denominations beginning at $50, now offer a yield of 4.40 percent, which includes a guaranteed inflation adjustment. The I bonds do not carry the Patriot inscription.

Gains for Social Screening

BYLINE:  Compiled by Jeff Sommer 

 BODY:
 Assets in so-called socially responsible investment portfolios grew 36 percent, to $2.03 trillion, from 1999 to 2001, according to the Social Investment Forum, a nonprofit organization that includes mutual funds, community development organizations and portfolio managers. 
 The group defined socially responsible investing as involving at least one of these three strategies: shareholder advocacy, community investing and avoiding stocks that shareholders find objectionable. It said 230 mutual funds now incorporated social screening, compared with 168 in 1999. Screens to eliminate tobacco stocks are the most widely used, the group said. Other screens eliminate companies involved in weapons, alcohol and gambling or look for companies that promote human rights, equality in employment or a healthy environment.

HEADLINE: Nationalists Are Routed in Taiwan Legislative Election 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Dec. 1 

 BODY:
Taiwan's Nationalist Party was routed today in legislative elections on the island, completing a political fall from grace that began when it lost the presidency last year.
 The Nationalists, who governed Taiwan for a half-century after fleeing there from China after a civil war in 1949, lost 42 seats, and their majority, in the 225-seat Legislature. The Democratic Progressive Party of President Chen Shui-bian gained 21 seats and supplanted the Nationalists as the biggest party. 
 It was a resounding victory for Mr. Chen, who made history last year by leading the opposition party into the presidency. But it was an even more resounding defeat for the Nationalists. Although the party had been expected to lose its majority, the results were worse than expected. 
The vote underscored the antipathy that many people in Taiwan still feel toward the Nationalists, who built an enormously wealthy, and increasingly corrupt, political machine during their 55 years in power.
"It shows that it takes time to heal the wounds," said Shaw Yu-ming, the chairman of the party's newspaper, The Central Daily News.
Mr. Shaw said the Nationalists could still cobble together a formidable bloc in the Legislature by allying with a third party that split off from the Nationalists in 1999. He noted that while Mr. Chen's party had strengthened its hand, it, too, had fallen short of a majority.
Political analysts expect several weeks of intense horse-trading as Mr. Chen and the Nationalists maneuver to put together coalitions with smaller parties to give them control over the Legislature.
"The end of the elections is the beginning of cooperation," Mr. Chen said in a statement after the results were announced. 
Most analysts foresee more contention than cooperation. But the victory has put Mr. Chen, an earnest lawyer and native Taiwanese, in a markedly stronger position. After he humiliated the Nationalists in the presidential election in March 2000, they exacted vengeance by tying up his government in the Legislature.
Politics in Taiwan has been paralyzed for the last 19 months, with Mr. Chen and the Nationalists blaming each other for the impasse. The sense of drift has been amplified by Taiwan's economy, which is heavily dependent on exports to the United States and has fallen into a deep recession. Now, though, Mr. Chen's party said it hoped to form a government that would be able to gets things done. 
"We did extremely well," said Wilson Tien, the party's director of international affairs. "We will have more momentum to work on developing alliances, and it will be very hard for the K.M.T. to oppose us," he added, using the initials for the Nationalist Party's Chinese name, the Kuomintang.
Analysts warned against writing off the Nationalists. The party performed better in county and municipal elections that were also held today. In one closely watched race, Jason Hu, a former party spokesman and foreign minister, was elected mayor of Taichung, the island's third-largest city.
The Nationalists, these experts predicted, will choose a new generation of leaders from its grass roots. "The local chiefs are going to be much more outspoken in the future," Mr. Tien said.
The election was marred by harsh campaigning and a fixation on small-bore issues. Partly this is a function of the complex way Taiwan elects its Legislature. Each voter casts a single ballot, but each district sends as many as 16 lawmakers to Taipei, so a candidate need only place among the top vote-getters in his district to win.
Since the parties want to win as many seats as possible in each district, they strategize endlessly about how to allocate their supporters' votes to the various candidates. Often, a voter will pick his third choice rather than his first, if his first choice seems likely to win. 
The election rules, which have come under criticism in Taiwan, work against the development of broad campaign themes. Instead, the battles between candidates are tactical, personal, and brutally partisan. 
Beyond the rules, some commentators said the depth of the problems facing Taiwan deprived the candidates of easy solutions. The island's economy has been depleted by the migration of its computer industry to mainland China, where labor is cheaper. With China and Taiwan both joining the World Trade Organization, economists say that exodus is likely to accelerate. 
With no experience in governing, Mr. Chen's administration was ill-equipped to deal with the economic collapse. And its feuding with the Nationalists doomed any chance of a coordinated economic policy. 
Mr. Chen did relax restrictions on investments by Taiwanese companies in mainland China last month. Analysts said the government would probably also open direct trade and transportation links with the mainland if the political atmosphere between the two sides improved. 
Relations between Taiwan and China have been in suspended animation since Mr. Chen came into office, however. China refuses to deal with him because his party formally advocates an independent Taiwan. While Mr. Chen has pledged not to push for independence, he has steadfastly rebuffed the Chinese government's demand that he recognize a single China, governed by Beijing. 
China did not try to intimidate Taiwanese voters, as it has in previous years, by threatening military action if the island edged toward independence. Previous efforts to do that have backfired, emboldening Taiwan to elect Mr. Chen and his independence-minded predecessor, Lee Teng-hui. 
China also mentioned President Chen by name for the first time late last month, in an article in the official People's Daily. Before that, his name never appeared in China's official news media. 
Some analysts said this was a sign that Beijing is learning to live with the Taiwan leader. Others noted, however, that the reference to Mr. Chen was in an opinion piece that lambasted him for not recognizing the one-China policy. 
"If Chen Shui-bian can prove himself to be a person with staying power in Taiwanese politics, Beijing will have to deal with him," said Chu Yuan-han, a professor of politics at National Taiwan University.

HEADLINE: Boom Over, Las Vegas Goes Back to the Basics 

BYLINE:  By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
As the self-described "happiest mayor in America," Oscar B. Goodman of Las Vegas leaves no superlative unspoken in his quest to revitalize downtown, the seedy underbelly that lies a few miles from the fantasy world of the Strip. 
 A vacant 61-acre parcel at an old rail yard is "the best piece of urban real estate in the country," says Mayor Goodman. Another stretch of downtown is the perfect spot for a giant "incubator" for high technology companies. Roaming past blighted pockets that include an impressive collection of pawnshops and bail-bond operations (many with "God Bless America" decals in the windows), the mayor describes another dream project of his. 
 "We're going to make this whole block here into an agora, like a marketplace where Aristotle and Plato would gather," he says, beaming. "It's going to be very, very special." 
When Mr. Goodman talked like this a year ago, anything was possible in still-booming Las Vegas. But as the economy soured, some of these big plans have been scaled back or delayed and others, like the high-tech complex, seem to have fizzled altogether. And the mayor has seemed to go back to basics in his pursuit of almost any investment on behalf of rebuilding downtown.
First, Mr. Goodman, a nationally famous organized crime lawyer before he became mayor, announced that he was negotiating with Beefeater gin to become a pitchman. The mayor said he would donate all proceeds to Las Vegas, including money to help what the city calls the "chronically inebriated." 
Then Mr. Goodman was spotted meeting in his office this month with Marion Knight, who is known as Suge, the recently paroled music mogul and co-founder of Death Row Records, a label that made millions off gangsta rap hits but was nearly done in by Mr. Knight's many clashes with the law and his reputation for gangster-style intimidation of rival artists and producers. 
The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that Mr. Knight, paroled after four years in prison for violating probation in an assault case, had come to City Hall "at the mayor's request to discuss downtown redevelopment" and quoted Mr. Goodman as saying he hoped Mr. Knight would choose Las Vegas as the site for a music and production studio for his new record company, Tha Row.
Mr. Goodman said the report was a wildly overblown account of the meeting, which he described as only a "very, very casual" discussion that was actually initiated by his friend and longtime law partner, David Chesnoff, who represents Mr. Knight. The city is not actively recruiting Mr. Knight to set up his studio here, Mr. Goodman says. 
However the meeting got started and whatever was said, some here feared that a city once fueled by gangster money might now seek an economic charge from gangsta rap -- and perhaps another from alcohol, if their mayor's face ever appeared on the label of a gin bottle. 
"We're kind of falling back on our heritage," said Professor Robert E. Parker, who teaches a course on the sociology of Las Vegas at the University of Nevada here. 
The mayor concedes that he took a lot of criticism for his meeting with Mr. Knight, who a former chief of the Las Vegas homicide squad described as one of the most uncooperative witnesses he had ever dealt with. In 1996, the rap star Tupac Shakur was shot to death in Las Vegas in a car driven by Mr. Knight. A few hours before Mr. Shakur's shooting, Mr. Knight assaulted someone suspected of being a rival gang member at a casino here, a violation of his earlier probation for his 1992 assault of two rap artists at a Hollywood recording studio. That led to a new prison sentence, which ended with his release this past summer.
While nearly all the calls to the mayor's office were from people who said Las Vegas needed Mr. Knight's studio like it needed a hole in the head, Mr. Goodman seemed angry at the criticism, saying Mr. Knight deserved a fresh chance. The rap mogul was a "genius in his field," he said, suggesting that some complaints stemmed from racial bias.
"It amazes me, it appeared to me there were an awful lot of people who had a lot of bias and prejudice," the mayor said in an interview. "I don't know whether it was against people who got out of prison or against a rapper or a black rapper or a black guy who got out of prison, but my phone was deluged with phone calls saying, don't let this guy come here." 
It is unclear what Mr. Knight's plans are. Mr. Chesnoff said neither he nor Mr. Knight would comment. 
The mayor says he simply listens to anyone with any plans to bring in business downtown. 
What Mayor Goodman was far more interested in talking about was all the things that are already happening downtown, including the recent opening of the first big office building in 25 years and the opening next spring of Neonopolis, a retail, theater and dining complex. 
Tourists, who are returning to Las Vegas after the fall's sharp decline, are attending the Fremont Street Experience, an hourly light and sound show that plays across a giant canopy each evening. Planning is under way for the 61-acre lot, which the mayor hopes will include housing, an arts complex and a medical center affiliated with a university. 
There has been an influx of artists to the area, with a large lithography studio opening. "These buildings, which are inherently ugly, when you put them into an art context, they become funky," Mayor Goodman said. "They become cool places rather than old rundown places when you call it the arts district."
The very same was true, he said, of the giant cockroach model that adorns a pest control business in the area. "I hated the cockroach until this became the arts district," he said. "So the cockroach I couldn't stand becomes the cockroach I love. Everything is relative."

HEADLINE: A New Count of the Dead, But Little Sense of Relief 

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
The number tumbles. First 6,700, then 5,000. Down, down, down, 4,500, 4,000, now 3,300.
 The death toll in the World Trade Center attack keeps falling as officials refine their count. When they are finished, the toll will be much smaller than anyone anticipated, probably about 3,000, less than half the number that made headlines in the weeks following the attack. 
 That is a fact. In historical terms it means that Sept. 11 can no longer be called the bloodiest day in American history. (That was Sept. 17, 1862, when at least 3,650 Confederate and Union soldiers died at the Battle of Antietam, and thousands of others were wounded.) In contemporary ones it means that the evacuation and rescue efforts were even more spectacularly successful than anyone imagined. The 400 rescuers who died helped save more people than anyone might have dreamed possible. 
Mere numbers, of course, do little to diminish the nation's sense of horror.
And yet as the number has fallen, and been publicly recorded, people have reacted in a variety of ways, not all of them simple relief: one sister of a victim watched the number shrink and felt all the lonelier, briefly fearful that people might think the wholesale devastation that took her brother was somehow less epic; the mayor of New York excoriated reporters for chronicling the declining totals, describing it as a "macabre" exercise; military and political leaders have said the total does not for a second change their sense of outrage. 
Historians and psychologists say that such a mix of relief and confusion, anger and insistence is not unusual, and maybe even to be expected. Over history, the early, dreaded estimates of death totals in cataclysmic events have had a way of taking stubborn hold. People invest in them, however broken their hearts. People come to defend them in certain ways, in part because they think worrying about definitively counting the deaths amounts to a conscious effort to diminish the event's awfulness.
No one is wrong in all this, and no one, however conflicted their emotions, feels that Sept. 11 was anything less than a cursed day. Much of it just has to do with how people process loss, how humans protect that which they cherish, how slowly some truths nudge powerful myths from the historical stage.
Lori Barzvi, whose brother, Guy, 29, worked at Cantor Fitzgerald and died in the attack, said she watched the numbers of dead and missing decline and felt something might be at risk. "I was afraid that it might be looked at as being less of a tragedy or it would be easier to forget because less people died," Ms. Barzvi said. "It is not that I wish that there were more people. It just made me feel a little bit more alone."
Joel Best, chairman of the department of sociology and criminal justice at the University of Delaware and author of the book "Damned Lies and Statistics" says that sometimes people's feelings can go beyond the strangely disconcerting sensation experienced by Ms. Barzvi. People can almost actively cling to high numbers of dead or hurt despite the fact that those numbers have been proven erroneous.
"People develop an emotional stake in defending a number," Mr. Best said. "They feel they have to defend it."
The phenomenon, while understandable, can also blunt what is objectively a good development. "If there are 3,000 dead instead of 6,000 dead that does not make the tragedy half as bad," Mr. Best said. "What people ought to see is the astonishing good fortune that we had in evacuating these buildings."
And yet the ability to feel anything like comfort can prove difficult. Some people ask, not without sound reasoning, how anyone can feel any better knowing that "only" about 3,000 people died. Even engaging in a discussion about the declining count has brought some people criticism.
"It appears to many people to be callous," said John Allen Paulos, a professor of mathematics at Temple University and author of the book "Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences." 
"I have had conversations with people and I sense it a bit -- that concerns with the numbers is somehow unseemly."
Certainly, the United States diplomats, military leaders and members of Congress who have repeatedly cited the thousands killed in explaining why the country has gone to war do not think the lower total affects their rationale or the country's cause. For weeks, they cited 5,000 and 6,000 dead when it was public knowledge that the figure was substantially lower, although they probably were erring unintentionally. 
Spokesmen for the Pentagon and the State Department, where Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell have each referred to much higher death tolls in explaining the United States engagement, said the lower numbers changed nothing.
"Our country was attacked, thousands of innocent Americans and citizens from other countries were killed and the terrorists have threatened to kill more," said Philip Reeker, a deputy spokesman at the State Department. "We are waging a campaign in self-defense."
Along those lines, psychologists and other experts suspect that the change in the death toll will mean little in how this disaster affects the American psyche. That enduring, collective sense of horror, these experts say, results in part from the fact that so many people around the country experienced the intense trauma of watching the towers collapse on television, and perhaps felt almost as if they were there. And the towers, the signature of the downtown skyline, were such recognizable icons that many people had almost a personal relationship with the buildings themselves.
Perhaps most importantly, psychologists say, is that the scale of the disaster on Sept. 11 was so incomprehensibly great, that even when the number of people who died was cut in half, the loss remained just as incomprehensibly great.
"If you hear about a car accident in which one person died versus one in which four people died, that is experienced much differently psychologically," said Jennifer S. Lerner, an assistant professor of decision science and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, who is studying how Sept. 11 influenced risk perception and economic behavior. "But if there is a train wreck and 100 people died versus 104 people died, you are not going to pay that much attention to whether it is 100 or 104, because it is already beyond the threshold where you count individuals."
In any disaster of such proportions, these experts say, we tend to form memories and an outlook on life that will be unaltered by a lowering of official death counts.
"Our grief is not proportionate to the number of people who died," said Shelley E. Taylor, a professor of psychology at the University of California at Los Angeles, whose research focuses on how humans deal with stress and trauma. "Our grief depends first on the personal impact, if we knew someone, and second to the sense of loss that pervades everyone psychologically because of the loss of innocence and the realization of our vulnerability, and none of those things are affected by the reduction in the number of casualties." 
Historians, too, are wrestling with what to make of the smaller death toll. Even in the course of a single conversation, several seemed to revise their thoughts about what, if anything, the smaller death toll will mean in the way history records Sept. 11, 2001.
Robert Jay Lifton, a psychiatrist and historian who published a book in 1999 about the Japanese cult that released poison gas in the Tokyo subways, said the lower number may mean that as time passes, "there can be a gradual sense in people's minds that the disaster was not as vast as they had thought." But, he added, given that this attack was on civilians and not on soldiers on a battlefield, the lower numbers may not have an effect on how people perceive the vastness of the calamity.
"This was a unique attack and its standing as an historical experience has to do with it being a terrorist attack, as opposed to an event in war time, for which we have different standards," he said.
Ultimately, historians said, the historical importance of Sept. 11 is still being defined on a day-by-day basis, from the fate of the war in Afghanistan to the effort to rebuild Lower Manhattan to any realignment of relations among world powers, like the United States and Russia.
David M. Kennedy, a Stanford University professor of history, said that to him it was clear that the drop in the Sept. 11th death toll would have no effect on its standing in history. "The whole experience is what has made an impact on us and will remain in our memory, and the absolute number is irrelevant," he said.
He noted, for example, that few Americans know how many people died during Pearl Harbor (2,400), and yet it does not change the significance of the event.
"None but a few specialists and historians will know the exact number," Mr. Kennedy said of the Sept. 11 attacks, which as of the latest official count, left 3,533 dead, including 189 at the Pentagon and 44 at the crash site in Pennsylvania. "But the magnitude of the event is well established and will be remembered." And that truth is felt most powerfully by the families whose loved ones died. "It just doesn't mean anything," said Warren B. Nelson of St. Louis, whose son, David W. Nelson, 50, a senior vice president at Carr Futures, died in the attack. "A whole lot of people got killed, whether it is 3,000 or 6,000."
Elizabeth Crawford, David Nelson's wife, said that when she finds herself in a room of say 50 or 60 other widows or family members of victims, she is already overwhelmed by grief. But she said that perhaps in some way, solace can be taken from the decline. "Any family that does not have to go through what my family is going through, is a wonderful thing," said Mrs. Crawford, who lives in Brooklyn with two children, ages 8 and 4. "I do say, 'Thank God it is less than we had thought.' I wish David would have been one of those who got out. But it was out of my control."

Sheffield With Mets Is Unlikely Scenario

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The Mets have been through this dance before, and the repetition has become tiresome. If they do not trade for Gary Sheffield this time, they should be banned from ever uttering his name again, let alone trying to get him.
 Actually, their latest attempt to put Sheffield in their outfield has most likely ended before it really got started. The Los Angeles Dodgers apparently want more for Sheffield than the Mets want to -- or can -- give, and Sheffield would want more money in a monstrous new contract than the Mets, who are on his no-trade list, would want to give. 
 The Mets tried to get Sheffield last spring, when he asked the Dodgers to trade him because they would not give him the lifetime contract he wanted. The Mets did not get Sheffield because they did not want to give the Dodgers Mike Piazza or Edgardo Alfonzo, or a package of players including Armando Benitez and Jay Payton. 
The Mets tried to get Sheffield the first time when he played for the Florida Marlins. It was less than a month after the Marlins won the 1997 World Series, and their owner, H. Wayne Huizenga, directed the front office to shed the high-priced players. 
At that time the Mets seemed to wrestle with Sheffield's history and reputation as a problem player, and when General Manager Steve Phillips finished his internal monologue, he ceased pursuit of a trade.
Sheffield remained with the Marlins until the following May, then went to the Dodgers for Piazza and Todd Zeile, who subsequently wound up as teammates on the Mets.
If he is still talking to the Dodgers about Sheffield, Phillips is not talking to the news media about Sheffield.
"I can't talk about a player on another club," he said. But speaking generally about evaluating the possibility of a trade for any player, he said: "Generally we take all issues into account on any player we pursue. Look at what they can do on the field, the talent evaluation, the clubhouse evaluation, impact on the chemistry of the team. Obviously the cost, meaning the dollars and impact on a payroll and talent it would take to acquire the player. Those are the factors we consider in acquiring a player."
The factors have never added up to a trade for Sheffield and presumably never will, leaving the Mets to look elsewhere for a big hitter to go with Piazza. Maybe they will sign Barry Bonds. He is a free agent with a fresh home run record. His agent, Scott Boras, said he had spoken with the Mets, and their talks reflected interest.
But is not Bonds the player whose teammates have said goes his own way, creating a 24-and-1 environment? Wasn't that the problem Phillips cited a year ago when he abandoned the quest for Alex Rodriguez, another Boras client?
The Mets believed Rodriguez wanted to play for them. They believed he was so eager to play for them that they would not have any real competition for him. Then they discovered that he was considering four or five other teams. Their interested disappeared -- quickly. 
A couple of days later, Phillips announced the end of the Mets' pursuit before it really started. Phillips ticked off a whole litany of perks that he said Boras said were necessary to make Rodriguez a happy player. Boras denied making such demands. Rodriguez was insulted, not to mention embarrassed that anyone should think he was a selfish player.
A friend of Rodriguez recently expressed the view that the real reason the Mets bowed out was that Fred Wilpon, the team's co-owner, did not want to become involved in a bidding contest for Rodriguez and instructed Phillips to find a way out of the race without making the Mets look bad. 
Last week Wilpon and Phillips denied that explanation.
"That's fiction, not fact," Wilpon said. "The fact was there were very few people in that quest for the guy. I'm not sure there was more than one other team. It never got that far. It happened exactly as Steve reported. Steve decided he wasn't going in that direction and I agreed with him. Those are the facts."
Phillips said he did not want to "relive the whole A-Rod situation; that's come and gone." "But," he added, "that's not accurate, no. The explanation was the explanation."
Boras said he did not want to bring up the matter either a year later.
But just think what might have been had the Mets had Rodriguez. He batted .318, hit 52 home runs, drove in 135 runs, scored 133, amassed 201 hits and had a .622 slugging percentage. He could have given the Mets a respectable offense instead of the worst one in the league.
And they would not have to look for a big hitter now, certainly not Bonds, who is 11 years older than Rodriguez.

Preparing for Giambi
It seems to be a foregone conclusion that the Yankees will sign Jason Giambi, and they are expected to do it by the end of this week. 
Other teams will grumble that there they go again, spending tons of money, and George Steinbrenner will respond that the Yankees are not the ones who set new salary milestones. Giambi, he will point out, will not make as much as his new teammate Derek Jeter, which means his salary is even further behind the $25.2 million that Alex Rodriguez averages annually.
Giambi led the American League in slugging percentage and on-base percentage, combining them for a total of 1.137. How remarkable a year did Barry Bonds have? He led the National League in slugging and on-base percentages, and he totaled 1.378.

Andruw Jones Pact Defended
Final word on the Andruw Jones contract with the Atlanta Braves:
Stan Kasten, the Braves' president, took strong exception to the impression that the Braves took advantage of Jones because his father and not his agent, Scott Boras, negotiated his six-year, $75 million contract.
Kasten was particularly irate over an issue being made out of the absence of a no-trade provision in the contract. The thought was that Jones took less money to stay with the Braves than he could have gained as a free agent next year, and the club, with a no-trade clause, could have protected Jones, a center fielder, from being sent elsewhere.
"They asked for a no-trade, and we told them no," Kasten said. "For the record, the Braves have never given a player a no-trade clause, even those with agents."
The Braves apparently need to get a break on some contracts because as remarkable a streak as they have had with 10 consecutive division championships, figures in last year's report of baseball's blue-ribbon panel say the Braves lost $6.88 million in 1995-99. 
On the other hand, people familiar with the Braves' operation scoff at the idea that they lose money, given, among other revenue sources, the national scope of their cablecasts on TBS and their own boast of having the most comprehensive sports broadcasting in baseball.

Contraction Hearing Ahead
It could become a collectors' item, the Minnesota Twins' 2001 postseason guide, a compact 200-page publication reviewing the team's outstanding season and the contributions its individual players made to the surprising second-place finish.
But with each passing day, the chances of the Twins having at least one more postseason guide grow. The court case in Minnesota alone guarantees that Commissioner Bud Selig cannot execute his contraction plan until January, if then. In addition, baseball's arbitrator, Shyam Das, could rule that the clubs have to bargain contraction with the union.
Lost in the morass of contraction is the bargaining the clubs and the players are supposed to have for a new labor agreement to ensure a peaceful 2002 season. That agreement will be far more difficult to achieve than consent on contraction and its effects. 
If Selig eliminates two teams and the Pittsburgh Pirates select Vladimir Guerrero in the dispersal draft, it will not matter if they do not have a season to play next year.
But if contraction represents the first round of the labor fight, Selig's appearance before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday and his disclosure of clubs' financial data (profits and losses, mostly losses) will be the second round. 
The union is certain to dispute many of the figures, and it will have the support of skeptical economists, who will question how 25 of 30 teams can lose money in an industry whose revenue has risen in the last five years from $1.5 billion to $3.6 billion.

Economic Woes Grow

BYLINE:  By Richard W. Stevenson

 BODY:
 It was a bad week on the economic front. The official arbiters of such things proclaimed that the longest business expansion on record ended in March, ushering in the first recession in a decade, and that the federal budget surplus has likely given way to persistent deficits. 
 With that gloomy backdrop, Democratic and Republican leaders sat down with White House officials to begin negotiating a plan to revive the economy. But they couldn't even agree on how to run the talks, much less on the proper mix of new tax cuts and additional government spending. Richard W. Stevenson

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE FAMILIES; 
GIFTS TO RESCUERS DIVIDE SURVIVORS

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARSTOW and DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
One firehouse has collected $2 million in donations. Another received $225,000 out of the blue from a small company in Texas. In a single day, members of a family in Park Slope, Brooklyn, collected so much for their local rescue squad that they stowed garbage bags of cash in their shower stall for temporary safekeeping.
 Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, breathtaking sums of money have poured in for the families of about 400 police officers, firefighters and other uniformed personnel who died trying to lead thousands to safety. Charities set up exclusively for the rescuers' families -- there are more than 50 such groups -- have raised at least $353 million so far, according to a survey by The New York Times. That works out to more than $880,000 for each rescuer's family, and with donations still flowing in, many families could collect $1 million or more from these charities alone. 
 For the widows of firefighters and police officers, the money has provided financial security, a sense of being embraced by a nation. But for the families of civilian victims -- and even some of those raising money for the rescuers' survivors -- the flood of charity to the families of the uniformed dead has obliterated the hope that America's donations will be distributed in an even-handed way to all the survivors. 
Soon after Sept. 11, when the magnitude of the nation's charitable response had become clear, several government and charity officials stressed the importance of distributing aid in an equitable manner. Those experienced in disasters, like the Oklahoma City bombing, warned that disparities could produce division among the survivors.
And those divisions are starting to emerge as more than $1.3 billion in charity is spreading across the landscape of need. Legally, the rescuers' funds cannot simply redirect their money, and much of the remaining $1 billion in charity has been pledged to small businesses, the unemployed and the traumatized, not specifically to the families of the civilian dead. Now, even officials for the uniformed-service funds are worrying about the growing perception that there is an aristocracy of grief.
At a recent support meeting in New Jersey, for example, a screaming match broke out when a widow of a Port Authority police officer argued that her family deserved more charity than other families because her husband had died saving others.
"How can you say that?" a widow of a financial executive retorted, insisting that every person killed on Sept. 11 was a casualty of the same war and deserved equal treatment.
The estrangement between the families of uniformed victims and civilian victims is not simply about money. Some families of civilian victims complain that they have been made to feel like second-class victims who have less access to the site of the collapse and less influence at City Hall. They are also convinced that families of firefighters, the police and emergency service personnel are getting most of the free concert tickets, vacations and even seats for the lighting of the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center.
"We're not just angry, we're heartbroken about the inequities -- that people could value the lives of those men more than they would value the lives of our men," said Mary Ellen Salamone, of North Caldwell, N.J., whose husband, John Salamone, worked for Cantor Fitzgerald.
"Nobody got up to the floors where my husband was," she said, her voice trembling. "They died alone. And you have no idea who was helping whom. Don't tell me there weren't people up there trying to do heroic things. They had to be their own heroes and help each other."
In dozens of interviews, those raising money for the families of rescue workers said they were stunned by the millions that have flowed in, often with little effort on their part. But while they are grateful, some of these officials are troubled by the stark, evolving disparities.
"You don't want to see anybody walk away here a millionaire; that is not the intent," said Frank Ferreyra, president of the New York State Fraternal Order of Police Foundation, which has raised $3 million in its WTC Police Disaster Fund.
Some are calling on the large, general-purpose charities like the United Way's September 11th Fund to help narrow the gap by making special payments to civilian families.
"We have been taken care of," said Tom LaMacchia, treasurer of the Uniformed Firefighters Association in New York City, which has received $29 million for its Widows' and Children's Benefit Fund since Sept. 11. "As a citizen," Mr. LaMacchia said, "I hope that these other funds that have not distributed their money yet are distributing their money to the civilians."
To be sure, it is far from clear how everyone will ultimately be compensated in the months and years to come. The families of all who were injured or killed, including the rescuers, are eligible to collect substantial awards from a new multibillion-dollar federal victims' compensation fund, and the awards may eliminate some of the inequities.
But for now, families have only charity to count on, and with more than 200 charities raising money for trade center victims, the danger that some families would receive far more money than others has been evident from the start. In Oklahoma City, the problem was resolved with the creation of a central database of the 168 victims that kept track of how much aid each family received. Officials met every week to monitor the distribution.
Eliot L. Spitzer, the New York attorney general, has been working for months to replicate that system, but progress has been slowed by disagreements among the charities.
"By the end of this process, there will be equity that people are very comfortable with," he vowed.
Clearly, though, he and other players in the charitable relief effort face a problem born chiefly of the country's desire to reward the indisputable heroism of rescuers who marched into two burning towers.
"What I was moved by -- as most Americans were -- were the unselfish acts of the firefighters," said Michael H. Feuer, chief executive of OfficeMax, which has pledged $1 million for scholarships for the rescuers' families. "In retrospect, given the obvious abundance of charity going to the rescuers, it was a decision made with the heart and the gut, and not the mind."
And he does not regret it one bit. 
States have long recognized a special obligation to the families of police officers and firefighters killed in the line of duty. New York provides spouses with pensions equal to the lost salaries and children with full scholarships to state universities. Additionally, the federal government provides $250,000 to families of police officers and firefighters killed on duty.
Those raising money for families of firefighters and police officers benefited from the fact that their unions, some with national reach, had existing charity funds and an established structure.
They also found a powerful fund-raiser in Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose Twin Towers Fund alone has raised at least $113 million for uniformed victims.
The families of civilian victims -- sprawled over several states, employed by dozens of companies -- have been slower to organize. Some employers and unions have established funds, but they pale in comparison to the major funds for uniformed victims.
"We just want to be recognized as needing, as well," said Liz McLaughlin, of Pelham, N.Y., the widow of a Cantor Fitzgerald executive, Robert C. McLaughlin Jr., and one of the founders of a nonprofit group called Families of September 11th Inc., whose 11-member board has people from six states, none of them representatives of uniformed victims.
Even among the rescuers, there are significant differences in what their families are receiving in charity. As things stand now, for example, the families of the 37 Port Authority police officers will collect roughly one-third less money in charitable assistance than the families of 343 New York firefighters. The reason is simple: charities dedicated solely to firefighters are taking in far more money than those dedicated solely to the Port Authority police officers. 
"The firefighters are getting so much publicity," said John McAusland, counsel for the Port Authority police union, which has raised $1.4 million in its Survivors' Fund. Mr. McAusland said that early on he struggled to get major Web sites and television networks to give equal attention to the Port Authority fund. "We couldn't get ours on the screen," he said.
And disparities are even emerging among firefighters' families, largely because of luck and geography.
"It is safe to assume that every single fire company that lost somebody has a fund of some sort," said Ann Berger Lesk, a lawyer with Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson in Manhattan. "The size will depend on how many people were lost, how large the company is, how connected they were to their community -- and how affluent that community is."
The amounts are not trivial. The Ladder 12 Firefighters Fund in the Chelsea section of Manhattan has raised $250,000 for five families, with donations from as far away as Ireland. Another downtown firehouse, with more than a dozen casualties, has received gifts estimated at $400,000.
So sensitive is the subject of money that many of the firehouse funds are refusing to disclose what they have collected, although they ultimately will have to do so under federal charity laws.
Sean Delaney, the executive director of an organization that provides legal advice to nonprofit groups, is helping four firehouses obtain tax-exempt status and said that his clients refused to let him provide any information about the funds because they have become so wary of criticism. "They see where this is going," Mr. Delaney said, "and they don't think it's helpful to them."

HEADLINE: How Islam and Politics Mixed 

BYLINE:  By Saad Mehio; Saad Mehio is a regular contributor to The Daily Star in Lebanon and Al Khaleej in the United Arab Emirates.

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon 

 BODY:
So what comes after the Taliban and Osama bin Laden are finished? Probably more Talibans and new Osama bin Ladens. This is the sad and shocking reality that we must confront. It will happen apart from all the fanfare surrounding America's military triumph in Afghanistan and all the other achievements of this so-called war on terror. Why? Because the Taliban and Mr. bin Laden are not isolated cases but manifestations of a complex, and potentially durable, sociopolitical phenomenon.
Basically, this phenomenon involves the immoral, unscrupulous and irreligious exploitation of Islam as a political weapon -- by everyone. The West, the United States, Arab and other Muslim tyrannies have all used the weapon of Islam. And all are paying their different prices for it.
 During the cold war it was easy, and easily justified on pragmatic grounds, to enlist the help of political Islam in the fight against Communism. Yet this enlistment of Islam, which helped hammer the final nails in the coffin of Communism by defeating the Red Army in Afghanistan, led to catastrophe -- first for the Middle East and later for America, as was so shockingly brought home by the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington. 
 The policy of using political Islam as an anti-Communist tool was a crucial reason why so much of the Muslim world came to be dominated by stagnant, undemocratic but stable (so it seemed) and adequately pro-Western governments, on one hand, and the traditional forces of political Islam, reconfigured for the latter half of the 20th century, on the other. The crowning achievement of such a policy was the defeat of the modernizing alternative: those movements that hoped to avoid aligning with either the Soviet Union or the United States; to develop their societies along secular lines by, ideally, ever more democratic means; and to substitute nationalism for colonial humility and Islamic traditionalism. Such movements were sometimes called Nasserite, after President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt. He struggled against the Muslim Brotherhood for most of his political life.
The Nasserite space has been shrinking over the three decades since his death. The alliance between Western democracies and local despots, whether Saudi royals or Saddam Hussein in his early years, had two results: the destruction of democratic openness in the Arab world and the obliteration of any chance for a liberal Arab nationalist movement that could act as a bridge to the modern world. State power may have been, in most cases, secular, but political hope and political mobility were left in the hands of God's representatives.
After the cold war ended in 1989, and while the rest of the world was gearing up to join the march of globalization and making great strides toward democracy, liberty and human rights, the Middle East looked like a bombed-out city. More political oppression, more intellectual and cultural stagnation, more economic and social despair -- and an ideological void that only the fundamentalists were able or were permitted to fill, under the demagogic banner of protecting identity and character.
Political exploitation of Islam continued, but the enemy became simply Muslim peoples themselves. This was exemplified in the financing (with petrodollars) of some 7,500 religious schools in Pakistan, India and the Arab world, schools that taught only isolationism, backwardness and hostility. Arab and other Muslim tyrannies sought, by leaving the educational and cultural fields to Islamism, to acquire legitimacy at the cheapest and most opportunistic price: by keeping the masses ignorant and preventing them from improving their lot, politically and economically. Better to direct their hopes toward the hereafter.
Where was America then? Where was the West? Cavorting with tyrants on the sunny beaches of the Mediterranean. So long as the oil flowed at a good price, petrodollars were recycled in the West's arms factories and Israel was in no real danger, there was no reason to interfere in what America's moderate or even immoderate allies were doing to their own peoples.
Sept. 11 changed all that. The United States lost its sovereignty. Suddenly security in the streets of Washington, New York, Boston and Los Angeles was inextricably linked to the curriculums of schools in Peshawar, Mazar-i-Sharif, Cairo, Algiers and Deoband.
And just as suddenly, the regional system that Washington had nurtured during the cold war, then left to its own devices after 1989, was seen to have turned into a hatchery for human missiles and suicidal rage directed against the United States itself.
Now we have a world war on terror. This war is already yielding results: the prehistoric Taliban regime is all but finished, the financial lifelines to fundamentalist extremist networks have been severed, Mr. bin Laden is on the run.
Winning a war, however, does not mean winning the peace. This war can, in truth, be won only by winning hearts and minds. This can be achieved only by correcting the historical mistakes made by the West, including the United States, in undercutting the modernizing forces of pan-Arabism -- and by correcting the spectacularly misguided choices made by Arab elites in their use of power and of politicized Islam as a way to keep it.
Benjamin Barber, author of "Jihad vs. McWorld," wrote recently, "In the long run, war cannot defeat terror alone because violence cannot defeat fear: only democracy can do that." Secretary of State Colin Powell seems to view matters in a similar light. In his speech of Nov. 19, which received careful attention in Muslim countries, Secretary Powell articulated his vision of a Middle East in which "all people have jobs that let them put bread on their tables and a roof over their head and offer a decent education to their children."
"We have a vision of a region where all people worship god in a spirit of tolerance and understanding," Secretary Powell continued. "And we have a vision where respect for the sanctity of the individual, the rule of law and the politics of participation grow stronger and stronger."
For now these are just promises. It is extremely hard not to question the likelihood of their fulfillment. For much of the 20th century, excessive American pragmatism tended to stress short-term interests, which often were served by tyrants like Saddam Hussein at the expense of the future of Arabs.
Nevertheless, Secretary Powell's promises alone may widen the chasm between the United States and its regional allies, and that is to the good. Americans seem to be realizing that having undemocratic allies -- ones who manipulate political Islam for their narrow purposes -- has been a pennywise policy, at best. The stress Colin Powell put on respect, dignity and the rejection of humiliation widens this chasm still further, for personal dignity is about the last thing Arab rulers have allowed to Arab citizens. Secretary Powell's emphasis makes the issues clear; it shows that the solutions adopted in ignorance by all sides, including America, have not worked. The Arab and Muslim worlds may yet sign on to modernity and globalization -- because they and the West may come to realize there is no other choice.
Through this window of hope, it may be possible to see that the self-inflicted injuries in the Arab and Muslim soul can indeed heal. But until these promises and visions reach fulfillment, the passions, fears and hatreds of the Taliban and Osama bin Laden will remain alive among us.

HEADLINE: With Enron's Fall, Many Dominoes Tremble 

BYLINE:  By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
THE Enron Corporation, despite its origins as a gas pipeline business, was no mere energy company. Its ambition, its passion for innovation and its boundless appetite for risk gave it a far greater reach than that of competitors, even those that control many more power plants or far larger reserves of natural gas.
 In the last decade, it became not only the world's largest trader of electricity and natural gas, but also a telecommunications company, an investment firm, a paper and lumber producer and an insurer. It was, with more than $100 billion in revenue last year, the nation's seventh-largest company. 
 Its collapse last week reverberated through not just the nation's energy industry, but also through retailing, real estate, insurance, banking, Internet services, newspaper publishing, even the manufacturing of plastics and glass. 
Most other energy companies were content to provide electricity or natural gas. Enron signed contracts with 28,500 customers worldwide, including J. C. Penney and Owens-Illinois, to manage all their energy needs, usually promising that it would absorb the risks of volatile prices and fluctuating supplies itself. Now those customers fear that the risks are once again all their own. 
Houston, where Enron keeps as high a profile as its 50-story downtown headquarters, is bearing the greatest burden. There, the Trammell Crow Company immediately cited Enron's collapse in halting the planned groundbreaking last month on a 34-story office, apartment and shopping complex next to Enron Field, the new home of the Houston Astros. 
At the end of last week, those who did business with Enron, or depended on it in other ways, were still trying to puzzle through all the consequences of its ruin. No easy task, this, considering that Enron's own finances, more convoluted than anything even a Max Bialystock could imagine, proved beyond the grasp of its chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay. 
Here, though, is an initial look at how Enron's fate has affected industries across the nation (not to even mention the 40 or so though, is an initial look at how Enron's fate has affected industries across the nation (not to even mention the 40 or so other countries where Enron operates).

A Crown JewelBecomes a Liability

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN BALLEZA 

 BODY:
In a Houston economy where corporate stars like Continental Airlines and Compaq Computer were suffering, Enron had become the premier business. Its executives reveled in the role, naming the Houston Astros stadium for their company, building a new office tower and writing checks for every civic cause. Through Enron, above all, Houston, long the capital of the world's oil industry, was extending its claim to natural gas and electricity. 
 Suddenly, any tie to Enron has become a liability. In April 1999, Enron signed a 30-year, $100 million contract for the naming rights to the new baseball stadium. Today the Astros, are wondering what the future holds. "It's really a sad day for Enron and for Houston," said Pam Gardner, the Astros' president for business operations. Though Enron is current on its payments, she said, "It is all up in the air." 
 Though construction on Enron's new building continues, developers of other projects are thinking twice. Work on Trammell Crow's Ballpark Place, a shopping, office and apartment project downtown, had been set to start at the end of last month. 
While the terrorist attacks and the recession had already raised doubts, Matt Khourie, Trammell Crow senior managing director, said that he will now delay, until at least the first half of next year. "Recent events with Enron, where no one is quite certain what the final resolution would be," he said, "really is the factor we had to consider when deciding whether to start this month or not." 
Jim Kollaer, president of the Greater Houston Partnership, a leading civic group, said that Enron's donations to the United Way and a host of other causes were at risk, as were its dealings with a broad range of businesses. "Their vendors range from the people who are designing the interior spaces of their new office tower to the people who run the Starbucks coffee bar in the lobby, to the attorneys, to the bankers, to the traders, to the clients," Mr. Kollaer said. 
Many among Enron's 7,000 Houston employees are bitterly protesting the loss of retirement savings invested in its stock they recently were forbidden from selling. For them, the immediate future will be tough, whatever the outcome. "Six months ago, nine months ago, people were calling me to hire me away," said one employee who asked to be identified only as Jorge. "No one's called this week. So I think my market value has gone down, along with Enron's."

Report of Raid Gone Awry, Music in Kabul and the Looming Economy

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
Although things could still go wrong for American forces and their allies in Afghanistan, the end of the Taliban was in sight. American B-52's relentlessly bombed Taliban troops holding out in Kandahar, their last bastion, with the unmistakable message being that surrender was their only way out.
 CLOSING IN ON TALIBAN -- At the Pentagon, a senior official said that anti-Taliban Afghan groups controlled the roads north and south of Kandahar, and United States marines reinforced a defensive perimeter around the city. Taliban forces seemed to be pinned down, with "no sign of movement whatsoever," the official said. 
 But no one underestimated the bitter-end determination of some in the Taliban, notably the Pakistanis, Arabs and other foreigners among them who have fought hard. An example of their ferocity was the surrender of a surprisingly large number of these fighters at the Qala Jangi fortress, where hundreds of people had died, including an American intelligence official, during a revolt by Taliban prisoners.
It had been thought that only a few holdouts remained. Instead, more than 80 finally emerged from their bunker and surrendered to forces of the Northern Alliance. They were a wretched sight -- starving, barefoot, soaking wet and filthy. They gave up only because "there was nothing left," one man said. "We had no ammunition, no weapons, no food."
VILLAGES ARE HIT -- On things perhaps going wrong, there was an American air raid over Tora Bora, the cave complex in eastern Afghanistan where Osama bin Laden may be hiding. Although military officials vigorously denied missing their target, residents of nearby villages said that bombs fell on them, killing scores of civilians -- at least 70 some said, and maybe many more.
As the fighting continued, so did talks in Germany on the shape of a post-Taliban government. Negotiators worked into the night trying not to let a possible deal slip through their fingers.
CHANGES IN KABUL -- There can be little doubt that Kabul, the Afghan capital, is changed now that the Taliban are gone, and with them their iron-fisted brand of Islam. For the first time in five years, young women enrolled at an Afghan university. That is a far cry from the Taliban days, when girls over 8 could not go to school.
In recent days, a surgeon who is a woman operated on a patient for the first time in years. A businessman took forbidden paintings out of storage. A singer and his friends made music. Yes, there is change. But perhaps only up to a point. Most women, for example, still shroud themselves in head-to-toe burkas, even though the virtue-and-vice police have disappeared. They are afraid, one woman said, and "it is going to take time."
IT'S THE ECONOMY -- Americans of the Vietnam War generation will remember Senator George Aiken, the Vermont Republican who urged the United States to declare victory in Southeast Asia and get out. A rough equivalent has been suggested to President Bush by advisers who want him to claim victory as soon as possible in the war on terror, and then focus on the economy.
The debate is over how to calibrate the president's priorities. He has told Americans to brace themselves for sustained battle against terrorists and can hardly seem to be sounding a premature retreat. But he also knows well the fate of his father, who was enormously popular after the Persian Gulf War in 1991, only to lose the 1992 election. The lesson, some advisers are telling Mr. Bush, is that the economy trumps war, and the country may not cut him much slack.
PRICE OF SORROW -- The pain caused by the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center keeps taking new forms, one being the price of sorrow. Extraordinary sums, at least $353 million, have been raised by charities distributing money solely to 400 or so families of firefighters, police officers and other uniformed rescuers. That comes to about $880,000 per family -- apart from insurance payments, pensions, scholarships and other money that can be expected.
But what about the families of the civilians who died at the trade center? Many feel neglected by a nation far more eager to embrace firefighters' widows. Their loved ones were victims, too, they say, yet that fact is not reflected in the aid distribution. Emerging divisions among survivors worry people in the charity field. Even some who have raised money for the uniformed workers are uncomfortable with a perception that grief has a caste system. CLYDE HABERMAN

HEADLINE: Rural Irish Post Offices to Double as Banks 

BYLINE:  By BRIAN LAVERY 

DATELINE: DUBLIN, Dec. 1 

 BODY:
In a deal that may set a pattern for sustaining rural financial services elsewhere in Europe, the Irish postal system agreed this week to begin handling some banking transactions for customers of Allied Irish Banks at 1,000 of its 1,800 post offices. 
 As decades of emigration and urbanization have drained rural Ireland of much of its population, it has become harder to justify the cost of maintaining small-town bank branches and post offices. 
 But small communities depend on them as an economic and social nexus and a lifeline -- especially the post offices, which commonly follow a model rarely seen in the United States outside the most remote towns. They are generally attached to a family-run small business, like a convenience store or pub, and are run as a part-time sideline by the proprietor, who does it for the social standing as much as for the small paycheck, and often dispenses local gossip along with stamps. 
The national postal system, known by its Gaelic name, An Post, has been trying to keep these rural post offices viable by adding services, like accepting utility bill payments and dispensing welfare benefits -- though the welfare function has been challenged by the European Union as anticompetitive.
On a parallel track, the country's big banks have been looking for relief from the costs of serving rural areas. Allied Irish Banks's principal competitor, the Bank of Ireland, has provoked protests from customers and labor unions for closing branches.
Arranging with An Post to have rural postal workers double as bank tellers has obvious benefits for Allied Irish, but the bank insisted that the deal was not a precursor to widespread branch closings of its own. In fact, it promised to keep all its current branches open for at least two more years.
The service will begin in July and will be exclusive for two years; after that, An Post could make similar deals with other banks.

Martha Stewart Brings Us All Together

BYLINE:  By Judith Shulevitz 

 BODY:
MARTHA STEWART'S dazzling brand has been slightly dimmed over the years by critics aghast at her transmogrification of the most routine household chores into acts of domestic theater. Let it never be said, however, that in this she misconstrues the spirit of Christmas. Her Christmas publications, like the 1997 "Christmas With Martha Stewart Living" and the "Martha by Mail" 2001 holiday catalog, are as overstuffed as stockings with recipes and instructions for making geometric chocolates, professional-looking ornaments, fir-draped fireplaces and glistening banquets of prime rib and Yorkshire pudding served on the best silver. The very over-the-top-ness of Martha's productions testifies to her deep understanding of the holiday. Christmas has always been a time for extremes. That the extreme in her case should be a labor-intensive effort to summon up the ghost of Christmases past supposedly enjoyed by British gentlefolk in homes run by invisible servants amid cheery fires and well-heeled visitors proves mainly that she is a woman with an uncanny ability to capitalize on American dreams. 
 What does Martha know? That the essence of Christmas is its appeal to nostalgia, whatever languid fantasy the nostalgia may happen to express. Even the earliest Christmases celebrated a yesteryear that existed only in the imagination. The church invented the holiday four centuries after the birth and death of Jesus Christ largely to steal thunder from Roman winter festivities, which tended toward drunkenness, overconsumption and fertility rites. No one, not even the church fathers, knew when and where and under what circumstances Christ had been born. The Gospel accounts don't provide much in the way of historical detail, and Jesus' immediate followers would probably have considered it idolatrous to celebrate his birthday, since that was sort of thing done for earthly kings. Just because the feast of the Nativity came along relatively late, though, doesn't mean it lacks a lasting power: there are good literary reasons we can't conceive of the mystery of the Incarnation -- the divine embodiment of the son of God -- without summoning up the images of an infant, a mother, a stable, worshipful animals and solemn magi. 
 Slightly more than a millennium later, the Puritans turned against Christmas for its lack of a textual basis, to say nothing of its well-preserved pagan rituals. These had evolved into elaborate displays of wealth by the rich and public cross-dressing, aggressive begging and scenes of near anarchy by everyone else. During the first two centuries of American history, good Christians ignored Christmas, working through the day, at least in the Northern American states, though it often occasioned parties on Southern plantations. In the early 19th century a group of wealthy New Yorkers, including the writer Washington Irving and the author of " 'Twas the Night Before Christmas," rebelled against the Puritan ban on the holiday. What we now think of as the standard American Christmas was in part their creation.
The historian Eric Hobsbawm has called what these 19th-century citizens did "the invention of tradition"; a common academic term for made-up customs is "fakelore." A less sneering way to think of this is that we experienced an extraordinary outburst of national creativity. Cultural historians have recently begun to focus on these homegrown Christmas rituals; indeed, in the past decade there has arisen something of a cottage industry in American Christmas studies, and our "fakelore" has been extensively chronicled. Among the elements that scholars have identified as essential ingredients in the Americanized Christmas are Santa Claus, the Christmas tree and the giving of gifts. Santa Claus was a clever Yankee repackaging of St. Nicholas, the patron saint of children, whose feast day was Dec. 6. ("'Twas the Night Before Christmas" helped make him a national hero.) Christmas trees came from Germany by way of German immigrants: the idea of bringing nature indoors charmed our burgeoning Romantic sensibility, and the lustrous adornment of the home appealed to the nesting instincts of the emerging American bourgeoisie. 
The best thing to happen to the American Christmas, though, was gift exchange. In some places and families this is now so extensive it amounts to what anthropologists call "potlatch," huge feasts held by tribal heads who compete for prestige by doling out gifts of bankrupting proportions. Up through the mid-19th century, gift giving took place on New Year's Day, but the custom migrated to Christmas once that holiday captured the American imagination. Our end-of-the-year potlatch, accompanied by the high artistry of marketing strategists and cultural impresarios and department store window dressers, has become an indispensable part of our economy, spurring consumption and production and serving as a general boost to our well-being.
In less than a century and a half, we have turned the American Christmas into an adoration less of a divine Christ than of the quasi-divine in us -- our homes, children, families and communities. Religiously, Christmas is, as it has always been, a mad syncretic mishmash of pagan and Protestant and Catholic and New Age doctrine and ritual. Why do we feel compelled to wrinkle our noses at this populist amalgam, with its delirium of buying and wrapping and consuming and visiting? Aren't these sociable pleasures just what we want as afternoons disappear into night and the cold sets in? If there is such a thing as an authentic Christmas tradition, it would have to be overdoing it -- spending and drinking and eating too much and hanging out at length with friends, a habit that goes back to the Romans, if not before, and that Christianity has only intermittently managed to stamp out. 
But we also use the holiday as a chance to dwell in the shadow of a wondrous made-up past, which seems as fine a way as any to pass a dark season. Some nostalgia takes the form of fretting about whether there's any Christ left in Christmas, as if he and not the frenzy of carnival ever really dominated the day. Some people obey the orders given in the Martha Stewart books and give over their Decembers to the making of shopping lists and clever little items, as well as the pursuit of epicurean festivities, secure in the belief that this will bring them closer to the ideal of gentrified country living -- and who's to say that it doesn't? Others, like me, observe Hanukkah, a minor Jewish holiday blown wildly out of proportion to offer an alternative to our nation's irresistible winter solstice festival. But if dreaming of invented traditions is what we're doing, at least we're doing it together, and that strikes me as the point.

The Last Word

 BODY:
Carrie Donovan introduced The Times Magazine's readers to Donna Karan for the first time in May 1986, and this is how Donovan captured her: "The designer strides forth, a freshly filled coffee mug in her hand, a big bag over her shoulder, dark glasses hiding some of her usually unmade-up face, which is framed by brunet hair casually tossed here and there. At 37, Donna Karan is a noticeable person, not beautiful, but handsome, with an infectious smile and a commanding voice accented unmistakably with the vowels of New York." That description is affectionate and blunt, insightful and superficial, typical for Donovan, who loved to play up the dichotomies of her own character. A few months before that cover article ran, a home videotape captured Karan accepting congratulations backstage after her first show. At the celebration, Donovan sat knee to knee with the triumphant, glowing designer and gazed gleefully into the camera: "My daughter Donna," Donovan beamed. "I'm so proud of her." Karan turned her attention away from Donovan only for a moment to look with ardor at her husband, Stephan Weiss, who gave her a short kiss, then a longer one. 
 This year, Karan lost both her husband and her surrogate fashion mother. Donovan, who left behind only her industry children, the designers she discovered, died Nov. 12. As part of a series for the magazine she was working on, called "Conversations With Carrie," she revisited Donna Karan at a landmark moment in the designer's career. The interview was to come out when Karan's store opened in September. Then, when Donovan became increasingly ill, it was rescheduled to coincide with the acquisition of Donna Karan International by LVMH Group last month. Ever a pro, Donovan was determined to write the introduction and edit the transcript of the interview herself. It may have been the first deadline she ever missed. 
 Over Labor Day weekend, Karan dropped in at Donovan's house in the Hamptons to have their chat, the last interview Donovan would do in a long career. "I hadn't seen Carrie in a long time," Karan says. "But when someone is with you, they're with you forever, regardless of the time that passes. We had that kind of connection. She was like my mother, but she was my mentor, an inspiration, and my teacher. I wanted to perform for her, to please her. I can't tell you how emotional it was, the highs and the lows of it. Of course, I wanted to reminisce. She wanted to go forward." 
CARRIE DONOVAN: Now, listen, what I wanted to do is ask you --.
DONNA KARAN: Stephan gave this to me. I thought you'd get a kick out of a rock. 
C.D.: Whoa! Wow! Honey bunch.
D.K.: I never had a diamond in my life.
C.D.: I want to know all about the new store, I want to know about the new business arrangement . . . about the man with the little beady eyes. But that ring. Oh! You knocked me out! When do we think the store is really going to open? Do we have any idea?
D.K.: You know what? In life, I make no plans anymore.
C.D.: No, no plans. You're right.
D.K.: Why plan? One never knows.
C.D.: I remember when you were planning your very first boutique
D.K.: That's right.
C.D.: Oh! And you wanted to do black and gold, and, oh, that was quite daring.
D.K.: Right.
C.D.: And you've always wanted to change everything.
D.K.: Right.
C.D.: That's what I like. You're always reinventing everything.
D.K.: Did you ever get to see the London store that we opened?
C.D.: No.
D.K.: Never?
C.D.: The last time I was in London was when I went with you, when you went to Brown's a hip, high-end store .
D.K.: Oh, my God.
C.D.: And do you remember there was some kind of third-rate royal . . . 
D.K.: Right.
C.D.: . . . at that social thing. And they were la-dee-dah and carrying on about her. And because you weren't English, they didn't introduce you? I was livid. I thought, Listen, she came all the way over from the States, for God's sake -- they could at least introduce her.
D.K.: Have I ever been proper?
C.D.: No!
D.K.: Is there anything proper about me?
C.D.: Never.
D.K.: I'm not even proper in the industry. (laughter)
C.D.: You know, I want you out of the stock market. The other day I said: "It makes me crazy about Donna. She's so creative, and she's one of the few creative designers we have in America, truly. And her stock doesn't go up."
D.K.: They don't understand investment spending. It was never about a small vision, it was a big vision. And it's not easy to have visions, and of course everybody wants you to be the way you were, not the way you're going.
C.D.: Incidentally, I think this sweater might be an old Donna Karan sweater. It is so old I've got moth holes in it.
D.K.: Cashmere?
C.D.: Oh, yes. I sleep in it and everything.
D.K.: Carrie, since we've spoken, I've been a little bit on the path. I mean, you know, I made three promises to Stephan . To be there for the children, to continue and build the luxury company that he envisioned.
C.D.: Right.
D.K.: That's what he wanted, and he was very clear about it. And present his art work.
C.D.: Does the luxury business make money at all today?
D.K.: Oh, God, yes.
C.D.: Someone said to me the other day, "When did you first meet Donna?" And I said, "When I went to Versailles for a joint French and American fashion show in '73." And I went backstage after the show because the Americans did so extraordinarily well.
D.K.: That's right.
C.D.: And the French were such bombs.
D.K.: Right.
C.D.: Which was such a thing, and I was so excited, and I went over with Halston.
D.K.: Right.
C.D.: I was all in Halston sequins and stuff . . . 
D.K.: Right.
C.D.: . . . and borrowed . . . (laughs)
D.K.: Right.
C.D.: . . . had to go back that night.
D.K.: Right, right, right.
C.D.: (laughs) Yeah, and I remember I thought, I want to go back and congratulate them. I went backstage, this was like 10 minutes after it was over. There were only two people backstage. One was Josephine Baker . . . 
D.K.: Hmm.
C.D.: . . . who was sitting on a stool very quietly, very modest, waiting to be picked up by someone, and the other was this young girl, very pregnant, and that was Donna Karan. Then I thought about when I went to see your collection, the very first time with Patty Cohen, her right hand , and you were in the place looking out on Bryant Park. And the clothes were sensational. And I had from that first collection --.
D.K.: Did I ever get you the perfect black jacket? I want to know.
C.D.: You've tried ever since, but I still like the one I took from you.
D.K.: (laughs)
C.D.: So I came back to The Times . . . 
D.K.: Oh, right, in the navy . . . 
C.D.: . . . because I was so excited about the collection, and I wanted to do the story. And I went to this meeting with Abe Rosenthal, the big boss.
D.K.: Right.
C.D.: And so here I am in his office with all these big-time editors, and I said, "Now, you see, you've got to understand these clothes."
D.K.: (laughs)
C.D.: "They're simply wonderful. Let me show you how this skirt works." And I stood up and unwrapped the skirt and I remember . . . 
D.K.: (laughs)
C.D.: . . . and then you see, you look, and then you do this, and Abe said, "Carrie, watch yourself." (laughter) But I think that helped. He was fascinated, and I think that helped, because it was very difficult in those days to sell a story.
D.K.: On fashion.
C.D.: And a cover!
D.K.: Is that unbelievable?
C.D.: You know, but I looked over that piece. Parts of it are so boring, and you know why? Because that's, what, about 15, 16 years ago. You had to explain so much about the business.
D.K.: Yeah.
C.D.: And I think today people know everything about the business, don't you? I mean, generally.
D.K.: Unfortunately in the press there's a lot more about business than there is about fashion.
C.D.: But is there fashion out there?
D.K.: That's a good question. I think we've looked at the past so long now. If I look at the 70's and the 60's and the 80's --.
C.D.: Oy vey, yeah.
D.K.: You know, it's like the young kids come in and they go, "Oh, it's a Donna Karan moment," and I say: "Guys, if you want to do old Donna Karan, please be my guest. But I can't. I can't go backward, you know?"
C.D.: That's very interesting.
D.K.: You know, when these young designers come in and they put these shoulder pads in the clothes, I go (laughs) . . . I know. It might be a trend. Thank you, but no thank you.
C.D.: No pads now?
D.K.: No. (laughs)
C.D.: You know, everything is soft now.
D.K.: I think the beauty, if I continue to do fashion --.
C.D.: "If I continue to do fashion?" What are you saying? Oy vey!
D.K.: I always look at that. If I wasn't going to make a difference in this world, I'd rather not do it.
C.D.: But you've made such big differences.
D.K.: But if I don't continue to do it, if there's no reason, if I don't see a void. . . . Like right now I am passionate about my store because I think there's a void in retail. I've always felt there was a void in retail.
C.D.: Yeah.
D.K.: I mean, it has been my obsession. I started out in retail when I was 14 years old.
C.D.: Now, wait. What did you do?
D.K.: A clothing salesperson. At Shurrie's
C.D.: Scheri's?
D.K.: Shurrie's in Cedarhurst.
C.D.: Oh, in Cedarhurst!
D.K.: At 14 years old.
C.D.: S-c-h-e-r-i?
D.K.: Shurrie's. How do you spell Shurrie's?
C.D.: And you were 14?
D.K.: I was 14. I lied about my age. I was a salesgirl in a clothing store, and the mothers used to bring their kids in because they felt that if I told them, they would listen to me, they wouldn't listen to their mother.
C.D.: So you used to be a salesperson. See, I never knew that.
D.K.: Yeah, well, I try to sell you the perfect suit.
C.D.: I never got the black --.
D.K.: I can try.
C.D.: But do you remember the time you were on your way to London?
D.K.: O.K.
C.D.: And you pulled some clothes from the warehouse in New Jersey. 
D.K.: Right.
C.D.: And you and I were the same size.
D.K.: Of course.
C.D.: And you had a black jacket hanging up there.
D.K.: Mmm-hmm.
C.D.: And you said, "Here, try this out."
D.K.: And it worked?
C.D.: I cannot give up that jacket. I put that jacket on and I look just great. That jacket must be. . . . 
D.K.: A basic, pure black jacket?
C.D.: It was the perfect jacket. I find it interesting that you really know how good your business can be anywhere. I mean, you could live anywhere.
D.K.: I think I have to. I think being an American designer is a real hold back, particularly now.
C.D.: Yeah, it's interesting. Talk about that a little more.
D.K.: You know, I've said before, you can't do your craft without the tools.
C.D.: And the tools are in. . . . 
D.K.: . . . Europe. The fabric mills are there, which is my passion. You know, everyone says I run my business like a couture house. You know, my sample room is down here, and I'm making the dresses to the last minute and I'm draping and I'm --.
C.D.: Here in town?
D.K.: Here.
C.D.: Yeah.
D.K.: Which has been for me, creatively, a blessing. But at the same time, it makes delivery very difficult.
C.D.: Yeah.
D.K.: Which are, you know, some of the things that I have to rethink. (laughs)
C.D.: So in other words, you might have to do even your workroom over there?
D.K.: Yeah. I might have to do a little bit more work over in Europe.
C.D.: This is very interesting.
D.K.: Right now for me to create the product that's right, the hand has to be there. The artisan hand plus the technical. It's not one or the other. It's like today, you know, the technician helps us expedite us to the next level.
C.D.: Right.
D.K.: Not that I'm a computer genius. You know, I sat there the other day trying to work on an e-mail.
C.D.: Oh, forget it.
D.K.: If you're here in New York as an American designer, the fabrics have to come here to New York.
C.D.: Oh!
D.K.: The customs, the service, the dah, dah, dah. . . . Then the garments get made. Then the garment has to go back to Europe again. Then they want to know why the delivery is so bad.
C.D.: Yeah. No American has ever been very successful in Europe, have they?
D.K.: Calvin has tried it.
C.D.: Of all your companies today, what makes the most money?
D.K.: Oh, DKNY. It would have to. Just in pure volume.
C.D.: Now, am I right, but I seem to remember that you had that assistant, Jane Chung , from Taiwan. And she wanted to go back to Taiwan.
D.K.: She's from Korea.
C.D.: And so you thought up DKNY merely as a way to keep her. Give her a little something to do. And it became this extraordinary thing.
D.K.: She's still with DKNY. If anyone could be my successor, it would be Jane.
C.D.: Isn't that interesting?
D.K.: You know, I'd rather have my people come from within. I want to train. You know I love to teach. That's one of the things I love doing, is teaching people what I know about the body. Which I think is my uniqueness as a designer: truly understanding the body. And the psyche. My jackets got shorter-waisted because for you, they were always too long-waisted. And all of a sudden, when I had Barbra and Liza, everybody was short-waisted. I realized that I had to raise the waistline. This season's collection I put corsets into the evening clothes. Structure!
C.D.: Very interesting.
D.K.: Because the biggest problem I had is, you take these models, and they can wear anything. But then I realized with the Oscars, when the stars or whoever come up, they all want the support. So I realized if I was going to do my store, I wanted the clothes to be all the clothes I want to wear. Me and my friends.
C.D.: You think you'll make money on it?
D.K.: I can't imagine that LVMH invested that kind of money without thinking that this is going to make money. They know how to make luxury brands make money.
C.D.: They do. But is that going to be hamstringing to you? I don't know anything about the way they work internally.
D.K.: Neither do I.
C.D.: You don't?
D.K.: But I know Pino Brusone, from Armani the new president and C.E.O. of Donna Karan International . I figured, O.K., you have Italians, you have French, you have Americans, and I have my friends, B.F. and Christina Ong owners of Karan's Asian licensees , who are Asian. I have a real understanding of the world. And they're all part of the family to help create it because they believe in the company. We're all going to have to learn about each other. And for me, Carrie, the money was never an issue. You know that.
C.D.: Kind of nice there is some money, though. (laughs) Think about it.
D.K.: I mean, Carrie, have I ever worn a ring? This is hysterical. This I got, you know, when we got remarried this Christmas. I mean, look at my fingers, my nails, the way I dress. I'm not exactly what you'd call Ladies Who Lunch. (laughs)
C.D.: Now, wait a minute. What do you wear nowadays?
D.K.: A bodysuit, which I always wear. I've never changed. First thing in the morning, I put on my bodysuit. Then white in the country, black in the city.
C.D.: Right. O.K.
D.K.: This store is not only about clothes. My real passion is in the arts. Supporting art and supporting artisans' work. Have you ever been to 10 Corso Como, in Italy? It's Carla Sozzani's store. It's amazing. And when you think back at Bendel's, it wasn't about clothes.
C.D.: It was an experience. But you ended up with simply divine clothes. I still have a divine robe from there.
D.K.: But you walked in there, and the first thing you hit was the hosiery counter.
C.D.: That's right.
D.K.: The second thing you hit was those marvelous tabletops.
C.D.: I still have a red tablecloth that I bought.
D.K.: What great minds.
C.D.: I know.
D.K.: It was fun.
C.D.: Wasn't it wonderful? So you'll do that in a modern way?
D.K.: I did it with the DKNY store to a certain extent. When you walk into DKNY, you don't see clothes. It's the pottery or the dishes. It's not about me designing it. It's me understanding a desire that the customer might have. You're not always buying clothes. You're buying a thought. You're buying an experience. You want to come down and have a cup of tea. You want to talk to somebody. There will be a tea bar in there. We'll also have soup and tea and --.
C.D.: How are the salespeople?
D.K.: Oh, the best. But more important than anything, if I have to train them personally myself, I will. I'll probably be more in the store than I will be in the designing room now. Because I want to do couture. I want to do made-to-measure there. I want to make custom-made suits.
C.D.: Black suits.
D.K.: You know, my whole life history in fashion has been so dramatic. Everything has been dramatic. It's a drug. It's the thing that keeps us going. It never stays still. That's why I'm not into the return of the style of the 70's or the 80's. I've lived it. You know? I don't want to go back.
C.D.: We were there. We were there.
D.K.: I lived it too much. It's too close to me. You know? I'm more interested in the places I didn't live. I'm more interested in the turn of the century. I'm more interested in past cultures. And now I'm starting to get really fascinated in technology on a different level.
C.D.: The technical thing must be riveting.
D.K.: Although the mouse gives me hives. We're visceral people. Visceral means we're feely, touchy, you know, speaky. It's all about, you know, our energies. Now, there is this flat, impersonal energy.
C.D.: But we need that energy.
D.K.: So we're definitely going to be moving forward. I think the world in general is coming together as one. I don't think fashion is any different than the rest of the world. Fashion is a reflection of the world.
C.D.: As it always has been.
D.K.: A mess. (laughs)
C.D.: As it always has been.
D.K.: And yet, everyone is looking for something to give them pleasure. Something that's going to make a difference. Something that's going to say, "I'm new." I remember when I started my company, we were in a recession.
C.D.: Yes, we were. In 1987.
D.K.: But how wonderful to restart my company in a recession again. I'm very positive about that.
You know, Bernard Arnault chairman and C.E.O. of LVMH --.
C.D.: I was just going to ask you, have you met him? Have you dealt with him?
D.K.: Not very much. But I have met intensely with Yves Carcelle president of LVMH Fashion Group .
C.D.: My impression always of Arnault was that he loosened up considerably after his second marriage. But I used to see him always at the shows in Europe. And he was always so cold, you know? He seemed so still, and his hair was even stiffer.
D.K.: (laughs) Very like me.
C.D.: Then when he married a second time, his hair got looser and more attractive. But I think that he's probably a top-notch businessman.
D.K.: Yeah
C.D.: I like that you're just taking this attitude about the store -- when it opens, it opens.
D.K.: My house isn't finished, my store is not finished, my apartment. . . . I don't have a place that I'm living. Because everything in my life is like this.
C.D.: Ever since I've known you, you know, you've always been. . . . 
D.K.: Building. 
C.D.: . . . reinventing, building, doing something. But I like your description of everything as sort of . . . how would we say that in words? 
D.K.: Everything's under construction. (laughs)
C.D.: Everything in your life is. . . . 
D.K.: Being built. Nothing is the way it was.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 12-02-01: ON LANGUAGE; 
Clintonyms

BYLINE:  By William Safire 

 BODY:
'Bill Clinton is a relic of another age," the essayist Lance Morrow wrote in Time magazine, "like the 20's party boy F. Scott Fitzgerald stranded in the landscape of the Great Depression." 
 I rise today to our immediate past president's linguistic defense. Let me tell you about the very articulate. They are different from you and me. The Lexicographic Irregulars, asked in this space to choose the phrases that Bill Clinton would be remembered by, responded with words that evoke an era of intense controversy and vituperation. Respondents included his critics and his speechwriters, those nostalgic for the time of prosperity and peace as well as for the days of whine and nosiness. 
 The most memorable Clintonym (a coinage of F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre) chosen by a plurality of entries was a sentence that thrilled every semanticist, grammarian and syntactician in the nation: "It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is."
The words that raised parsing to a fine art were spoken under oath to a grand jury. They were about a statement made by the president's lawyer during a deposition about the relationship with a White House intern, in which the lawyer asserted, "There is absolutely no sex of any kind." Clinton pointed out that because his attorney had been speaking only in the present tense, the statement was true: "It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is," he explained, adding, "Actually, in the present tense, that is a true statement." That is indisputable: during the deposition, no sex of any kind was taking place between them. 
What made the sentence so memorable? Part was the exquisite nature of the literal reading, taken by Clinton critics to be an infuriating example of legalistic slipperiness. Another part was the unique juxtaposition of the quoted is with the unquoted is. The sentence would not have had the same puissance -- indeed, it might not be destined for the next edition of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations -- had it concluded with "the meaning of 'is' was."
I feel your pain, an expression of compassion often associated with psychiatric jargon, was the runner-up in this sample (which has an accuracy estimated at plus or minus 60 points). The remark was ad-libbed at a March 26, 1992, campaign rally as part of a riposte to an AIDS activist who angrily accused the candidate of avoiding the issue. The candidate, who later became a champion of gay rights, came back with: "I feel your pain, I feel your pain, but if you want to attack me personally . . . go support somebody else for president." He ameliorated that with, "I know you're hurting, but you won't stop hurting by trying to hurt other people." 
Tied for second place, thanks to its repetition thousands of times on television, is his statement of Jan. 26, 1998: "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky." What made it memorable was not only its unequivocal tone but also its accompaniment by a wagging finger. More than the words, the stern digit fixes it firmly in the national memory. 
A charge leveled by Hillary Rodham Clinton at her husband's nattering, battering cottage industry of vilifiers makes it into the political lexicon. On Jan. 27, 1998, during the month that the most memorable Clinton locutions were launched, the first lady told a television interviewer, Matt Lauer of the "Today Show," that she and her husband were targets of "a vast, right-wing conspiracy." (That is most frequently written without a comma between the adjective vast and the compound adjective right-wing; such an error is not attributable to Mrs. Clinton but to the vast right wing.) 
"I didn't inhale," which was widely quoted in derision early in the Clinton era, seems to be on the decline in quoted recollection. Regarding the use of drugs, Governor Clinton of Arkansas said in 1992 that "when I was in England I experimented with marijuana a time or two, and I didn't like it. I didn't inhale it and never tried it again." (The phrasal verb experimented with became the operative term in such admissions, giving the action an almost scientific connotation, rather than "smoked" or "used.") It was the careful plea of guilty with an explanation -- of smoking but not inhaling -- that struck many as ludicrously clever, but the phrase was overtaken by "is' is."
Clinton enthusiasts are proud of "The era of big government is over," spoken in his 1996 State of the Union address, a stunning statement from a Democrat, somewhat tempered by "but we cannot go back to the time when our citizens were left to fend for themselves." This was described by his public-opinion aide, Richard Morris, as triangulation, the positioning of a politician above two contending ideologies, a geometric updating of "stealing the opposition's clothes." 
Another Clintonism that those who remember his administration fondly like to recall is the campaign semislogan, "It's the economy, stupid." This was a sign posted by his campaign manager, James Carville, and not a statement by the candidate. Clinton did say in his stump speeches, "My responsibility is to grow this economy," which was effective though it drew the ire of grammatical purists who objected to the use of the intransitive verb to grow in a transitive form. 
Students of regional dialect recall with fondness Clinton's use of Ozark expressions. The most memorable of these was spoken at a Feb. 15, 1992, rally where the Arkansas governor said that he hoped people would see him "working hard, reaching out to them and fighting until the last dog dies." (As 'til the last dog is hung, this has been traced to a 1902 novel set in Michigan.) Clinton also contributed this proverb to the political lexicon: "Even a blind hog can find an acorn."
Perhaps the most poignant of the memorable Clintonyms was recalled by Uzi Amit-Kohn of Jerusalem. In a farewell to Yitzhak Rabin on Nov. 5, 1995, after the Israeli leader's assassination, Clinton said, "Shalom, chaver," which translates from the Hebrew as "Goodbye, friend" or "Peace, friend." 
These statements are hardly the relics of a forgotten age. But as F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote in his notebook, "There are no second acts in American lives." And "show me a hero, and I will write you a tragedy." And in "The Great Gatsby," his unforgettable, "So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."

HEADLINE: THE CITIES; 
In Paterson, an Unusual Alliance

BYLINE:  By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: PATERSON 

 BODY:
THE Great Falls of the Passaic have always signified Paterson's history, the place where Alexander Hamilton envisioned the country's first planned industrial city.
 Later the falls symbolized, at least to some, less glorious chapters of the city's past. Today, there are those who see them as the very key to Paterson's future. 
 Until recently, Thomas C. Rooney, a 74-year-old veteran councilman and former mayor, was known more for his stands against taxes than for vision.
Yet over the summer it was Mr. Rooney who led a campaign to halt construction of 57 two-family townhouses on a historic tract in the Great Falls Historic District -- oddly enough, a plan he once voted for. In its place he proposed an unusual theme park. 
Surprisingly, he sought and won help for his efforts from a political foe from the 1960's and 70's, former Mayor Lawrence F. Kramer.
With the death of the townhouse plan and after other failed proposals over 25 years, preservationists see this as the last chance to build something historically significant and economically beneficial on the deteriorating seven-acre site, where, among other things, the Colt revolver and the nation's first skein of sewing silk were born. 
"The thing we need to embrace is the concept that we're going to develop this place as a heritage tourism destination -- tourism based on the history of the area," said David Soo of Paterson Friends of the Great Falls, a nonprofit preservation group that took the townhouse plan to court.
Mr. Rooney is the first to have made a detailed proposal: a self-sustaining theme park, including preserved factory buildings, an Indian village, boat excursions, and construction of a foot bridge over the Passaic River and a catwalk below and across from the falls. 
"Tourists will bring us revenue and help provide jobs for our people who will work here," Mr. Rooney told the council last summer. "They will leave and spread the word of how grand a trip they had."
Mr. Rooney's enthusiasm was matched only by the disinterest of Mayor Marty Barnes, who favored townhouses at the site and said he did not need another park to maintain.
"Now were talking about creating Disneyland," Mr. Barnes complained.
But even those who have reservations see Mr. Rooney's plan as a catalyst for further discussion.
"Apparently what turned things around was when Tom Rooney came out with his idea," said Flavia Alaya, a former president of the Paterson Historic Preservation Commission. "Even if it never gets into place, where there was nothing before and where people didn't have imagination, there is something now to consider."
The site's future is likely to be a campaign issue when Mayor Barnes seeks re-election in May. The outcome is also of interest because Congress has approved a study of whether to designate the Great Falls Historic District as a national park.
Passaic County Vision 2020, a nonprofit planning group, endorsed the Rooney plan after Mr. Rooney and Mr. Kramer appeared before the group.
"We were really thrilled by it," said Pat Di Ianni, president of the organization. "We're not saying that particular plan as a whole is the way it's going to be, but it's such a wonderful concept, and he's really thought this thing out."
Mayor Barnes is not buying.
"We're trying to look for a development, whether it's a hotel or some housing," he said. "The bottom line is it needs to generate dollars."
For his part, Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., who was mayor here when the townhouses were proposed in the mid-1990's, said elements of Mr. Rooney's plan could be folded into any development, though he still favored residential housing on the site.
"The falls has its own special place in American history," Mr. Pascrell said. "The district does, too, in terms of manufacturing, but it also has a special place for all immigrants who came in one wave after another. I don't want to put up a purple rope around the district."
The site in question -- where the Allied Textile Printing Corp. operated until the early 1970's -- is a fenced-in wasteland of overgrown vegetation, stacks of old clothes, piles of empty beer cans and hulks of dozens of brick factories destroyed by fire. The Colt Gun Mill, built in 1836, is a brownstone shell. 
Mayor Barnes said Paterson had received a $250,000 federal grant to study developing the Passaic River waterfront, and the city would seek proposals to develop it.
The Rooney plan, "Walk Back In Time 10,000 Years!", would begin with a clean-up of the buildings. Those worth saving would be shaped up and given historical markers.
Paying visitors would enter a welcoming center with a small restaurant and follow paths among the buildings and archeological digs to a Leni-Lenape village with wigwams, long houses and sculptures of people going about daily life.
A dock would be built from which boats would travel to the falls or down the Passaic. A foot bridge built over the Passaic would lead to a path and then a tunnel -- drilled though a rock wall leading to a platform and catwalk -- from which people could look up at the 77-foot waterfall.
Mr. Rooney is an unlikely champion. As head of the Paterson Taxpayers Association in the late 1960's, mayor in the early 1970's and a councilman since 1980, he has been seen as a nuts-and-bolts type to whom you could give your wallet and not have to count the money later.
Even he would admit to a lack of imagination when it came to the value of saving old mills, unlike Mr. Kramer, 69, and his late wife, Mary Ellen, who fought to divert a Route 80 ramp from destroying the factory area and got it designated a national historic district. 
"I just didn't get it," Mr. Rooney said.
What changed him, he said, was a tour of the site several years ago with Friends of the Great Falls. 
"I literally felt I wasn't in the current Paterson at all," Mr. Rooney recalled. "You can't hear trucks or cars or any of the noise of the city. It's almost spooky."
He went on: "It had an impact on me like nothing else has in a long time. And that's when I realized it was outrageous to fill this in and lose all of this." 
Mr. Kramer, who is now executive vice president of V. Paulius & Associates, a design consulting company in Allendale, was surprised to get a call from Mr. Rooney, whom he had beaten in four mayoral elections, last July. 
The two mayors, now both white-haired grandfathers, met at The Bonfire, a restaurant where political maneuvering has been as much a part of the atmosphere as the food.
"He had had an epiphany," Mr. Kramer said, recalling that Mr. Rooney was almost teary-eyed. "He said, 'I feel terrible about things. I never understood Mary Ellen's and your commitment to the historic district. If it isnt too late, I want you to help me.' "
Mr. Kramer, who does not agree with every aspect of the Rooney plan -- the tunnel for one -- said he would. He talked to Mayor Barnes about getting out of the townhouse deal and appeared before the council to ask it to remove the developer and support the Rooney plan. In September, the council rescinded the contract with Regan Development Corporation of Yonkers, which it had approved in 1995. 
At the end of his report, which Mr. Rooney read to the council, he wrote: "Other men and women in past years worked hard to elevate our historic district and the falls into a major drawing card for our city. Most notable were former Mayor Lawrence Pat Kramer and his wife, Mary Ellen. This proposal should build on their work."
To which Mr. Kramer said: "You've got to take your hat off to Tom. This is not a politician speaking here. I was moved by the fact he was big enough to say, 'I didn't see this. You were right.' A lot of guys talk a big game, but he put it in writing."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
A Sashay To the Right, Some Smiles From the Left

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IT was a wish list for corporate lobbyists and conservative ideologues alike. As such, the tax bill pushed through the House this fall by Representative Bill Thomas of California, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, was clearly an opening gambit in what was sure to be an intense partisan battle over how to revive the economy. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill even dismissed it as "show business."
 It went well beyond what President Bush had been seeking, particularly in granting some of the nation's biggest companies the right to claim, immediately, billions of dollars in tax credits built up over 15 years under the corporate alternative minimum tax. But the administration, Mr. O'Neill's comments notwithstanding, did little to distance itself from the Thomas bill, which has come to embody the Republican position on economic stimulus. 
 In one sense, the bill has had its intended effect. It ensured that bipartisan negotiations over a stimulus package would start so far to the right that Democrats could hope for little more than to drag them back to the center. For that, Mr. Bush is no doubt grateful.
But in another way, Mr. Thomas's strategy has backfired. His bill's focus on business tax cuts -- 70 percent of its benefits in the first year would go to companies -- has proved a political windfall for Democrats. The legislation casts Republicans as champions of corporate interests and the rich at a time when the country is arguably looking for selflessness.
For that reason alone, some Democrats have not been unhappy that negotiations on the stimulus package have bogged down. Every day that people read about a bill that would grant I.B.M. a $1.4 billion tax rebate while turning aside Democratic calls for more assistance to laid-off workers is another chance to convince voters that Republicans in general and Mr. Bush in particular are no friends of the little guy.
Moreover, the stimulus bill fits a broader pattern of economic policy decisions in which the administration has been criticized for rushing to deal with distressed industries -- first airlines and now insurers -- while dawdling over help for individuals.
Democracy Corps, a liberal advocacy group headed by James Carville, Stanley B. Greenberg and Robert M. Shrum, three of the most experienced Democratic strategists, surveyed voters recently about post-Sept. 11 economic policy. In focus groups, they reported, people could almost not believe that some of the Republican proposals were for real, especially the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax and the provision allowing immediate refunds to big companies.
"After they accepted the proposition that this was actually happening, they were furious," said Jim Gerstein, the executive director of Democracy Corps. "Items in the package like the A.M.T. repeal are completely at odds with the mood of the country following the attacks. If this is the defining element of the stimulus debate and the overall economic debate, it is very advantageous for Democrats."
It is not that the public is against tax cuts. A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found 50 percent support for the basic Republican approach to reviving the economy -- tax cuts, with a special emphasis on tax breaks that encourage businesses to invest and create jobs.
Even the Democracy Corps poll found very high levels of support for many Republican ideas, including accelerating the planned reduction in income tax rates for middle- and upper-income people.
THE notion that Republicans want to cut business taxes because they are beholden to corporate lobbyists and campaign contributors may have some truth to it, but it obscures a more important point: Republicans don't cut taxes because they are told to. They cut taxes because it is in their political DNA to do so. Cutting taxes, more than any other issue, is what defines the party.
It helps that there are also legitimate economic arguments in favor of the Republican approach, which is based on the reasonable notion that helping companies -- or employers, as Republicans are now careful to call them -- will create jobs by supporting renewed investment in plant and equipment.
Moreover, with his job-approval ratings at record levels and the nation much more consumed for now with the war against terrorism than with the lurching of the economy, Mr. Bush has not yet felt much of the political pressure to back away from the Republican orthodoxy. Besides, he managed to push the biggest tax cut in 20 years through Congress this year even though public opinion was lukewarm at best.
In the end, Mr. Thomas's bill may help Mr. Bush get much of what he wants in the stimulus plan. Whether that proves to be a political victory will have to wait on whether the economy bounces back quickly and strongly.
Because once the shooting war in Afghanistan starts winding down, public attention will shift to the recession and what the president is doing to help. And as the current president's father learned a decade ago, the political glow from a well-prosecuted war fades faster than you can say "rising unemployment."

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
A House Divided. Senate, Too.

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE post-Sept. 11 Congress has now almost fully abandoned its briefly adopted pose of high-minded bipartisanship, when it put aside political advantage and even submerged principled differences to unite the nation. 
 Democrats probably started it. Senator Barbara Boxer of California said that a Republican tax cut plan "to reward their biggest contributors is nothing less than unpatriotic." Representative Sherrod Brown of Ohio said, "This kind of political profiteering by House Republicans is downright shameful." 
 But Republicans joined in gleefully. Representative Sue Myrick of North Carolina said that any effort to vote more funds for New York City or homeland defense "is a vote to delay support for our men and women in Afghanistan." Representative Tom DeLay, the Republican whip from Texas, accused Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, who proposed the homeland spending, of being "the last guy we want to trust on national security" because he voted against last year's defense bill.
At times it seems that the only change the Capitol since Sept.11 is that new subjects are exposing traditional differences. 
President Bush has stayed above this fray, thus far safe from personal attack and in no need of the self-pity of some beleaguered wartime presidents (remember Lyndon Johnson's "I'm the only President you've got"?).
Lawmakers may be using the war on terrorism as another reason to try to do what they would be trying to do anyway, but is there anything really wrong when politicians remember their differences and find new areas of disagreement? 
No, says the public. A mid-November CBS News Poll showed that majorities, even of Republicans, find nothing offensive in criticizing the president, be it over economic policy or the conduct of the war. Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, said even in wartime "honest disagreements over real issues are viewed as completely fair game."
No, say the historians. "We're used to argument," said Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the historian, who served in World War II. Joel Silbey, a Cornell historian, said, "It's happened in every war I know of." Michael Kazin, a Georgetown historian, said, "It's one of the great glories of democracy, it doesn't take a break for wartime." 
In some past wars, conflicts have come from the president's party and focused on the conduct of the war, or even the war itself. Lincoln was bedeviled by his own Republicans, who thought he wasn't opposing slavery adequately or that his generals were too cautious. Democrats were Lyndon Johnson's severest critics on Vietnam. 
Wartime fights have often been institutional, with Congress fearing that popular presidents were assuming too much power. It thought Woodrow Wilson's plan to arm merchant ships was provocative. Mr. Johnson and Richard Nixon were both challenged on their authority to make war in Vietnam. Democrats took the lead, but important Republicans joined them. 
To date, the only areas where the Bush administration faces Congressional scrutiny are civil liberties and military tribunals. Democratic leaders are keeping their distance from Senator Patrick J. Leahy and the Judiciary Committee, while Republican support is token. This dismays John Morton Blum, a retired Yale historian, who said, "There has been lots to oppose and just about dead silence from the Democrats."
Most partisan, as opposed to institutional, exploitation of war situations has come on domestic issues. In the Civil War, Mr. Blum said, "The Republicans used the war to get through legislation they had been supporting right along -- a protective tariff, a National Bank act, land legislation." It was easy, of course, because the bulk of the Congressional Democrats had departed as secessionist southerners. 
IN World War II, there was little Congressional criticism of military decisions. But tough going on the battlefields, unhappiness over rationing and wage and price controls, and the fact that hardly any soldiers voted produced major Republican gains in the 1942 elections. 
As David M. Kennedy, a Stanford historian, wrote in "Freedom From Fear," the new "Congress moved swiftly to lay the New Deal finally in its grave, and then to drive a stake through its heart." It eliminated or deeply cut agencies from the Civilian Conservation Corps to the Rural Electrification Administration.
Today, no solid majorities exist in either house, but long before Sept. 11, "compromise" had become an epithet in a polarized capital. The fact that this war occurs during a recession (and is worsening it) makes compromising even more difficult, because party principles differ most profoundly on economic policy. Republicans think tax cuts help the economy grow; Democrats want to help workers directly. 
INDEED, the economy is the only area where a leading Democrat has taken the plunge and criticized Mr. Bush, however blandly. Last week Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, said: "The president is managing the war well. He is mismanaging the economy with the help of his colleagues in the Senate and the House." 
Even Mr. Blum concedes, "The stimulus package is about the only thing that is getting the usual partisan flak." 
That should be no surprise. As Mr. Kazin observed, "You might say there is a heightened intensity to these economic arguments during wartime.
"If you look at some of the debates in World War II, they are quite vicious," he said. In the 1944 election, along with attacks over who was responsible for unsanctioned strikes, "Republicans basically accused the main labor supporter of Franklin Roosevelt, Sidney Hillman, of being a Communist."
Partisanship in wartime may be inevitable. While a parliamentary government like Great Britain's could postpone elections during World War II, in the United States they happen every two years. As David Herbert Donald, the retired Harvard expert on Lincoln, said, "I think Lincoln would have liked to have a kind of bipartisan government." He tried occasionally, but "the old bonds of party were too strong." 
Today, Democrats are using legislative battles to gear up to run the 2002 elections. Republicans will surely invoke the war and the popular Mr. Bush, but they are not counting on their coattails. 
They may have one relatively new political weapon. For all that the public is willing to see parties argue their principles, the very word "partisan" (like "compromise") has become a dirty word. While the Democrats position themselves as defenders of workers, count on the Republicans to accuse their foes of being partisan.

My Bottom Line, Right or Wrong . . .

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
THE attacks of Sept. 11 were aimed at the symbolic heart of capitalism, but that does not mean the titans of industry feel obligated to join the fight on terrorism. 
 On numerous occasions since the attack, businesses have found themselves facing a choice between patriotic action or their bottom line. Politicians have suggested that investment houses would be caving to terrorism if they did not rebuild in New York, for example, and asked domestic wheat growers for understanding as they purchased Asian wheat for rapid food shipments to Afghanistan. They have encouraged American apparel manufacturers to continue to buy goods from Pakistan even in the face of rising insurance costs and local unrest. 
 Corporations are designed to make money -- not to meet patriotic or moral obligations. In times of peace, their focus on profit maximization usually dovetails with the goal of national prosperity. But in times of crisis, corporate and national interests can suddenly, uncomfortably diverge. 
In 1940 and 1941, for example, when it was becoming clear that America would soon be drawn into the war raging in Europe, many American corporations tried to duck government military contracts. One main reason: they feared they would end up paying for wartime production facilities that were useless in peacetime -- just as they had in World War I. 
The auto industry was particularly reluctant, because the civilian market was so lucrative. Until 1941, it fought restrictions on total auto output that would have freed resources for the defense effort.
In the end, the government essentially bought corporate cooperation, said Hugh Rockoff, an economic historian at Rutgers University specializing in World War II. 
"Government assumed most of the financial risk," he said, by allowing "firms to keep final title to the facilities they were building after writing the cost of construction off, against taxes, over five years." Later in the war, he said, the government simply built plants for companies and gave them to them. 
Such a risk-free guarantee for doing warwork is not necessarily ill-advised, according to economists. "The basis of business is the belief in the invisible hand" -- Adam Smith's shorthand for the way competitive forces themselves tend to regulate markets -- according to David Colander, the Kelley professor of distinguished teaching at Princeton. "Besides if firms were doing something strictly for a patriotic interest, they could be sued by shareholders." 
Even privately held companies have to be wary of doing things that are not strictly in their business interests. Malden Mills, the makers of Polartec fleece, kept its employees on the payroll while it rebuilt after a devastating fire six years ago -- and ended up filing for bankruptcy protection last week. 
There are historical instances of corporate sacrifice for civic good, but they are rare. 
The industrialist Andrew Carnegie was as cynical an operator as anyone. "One of the purest fallacies is that trade follows the flag," he once lectured. "Trade follows the lowest price current. If a dealer in any colony wished to buy the British Jack, he would order them from Britain's worst enemy if he could save a sixpence." 
But it was Mr. Carnegie who rounded up fellow industrialists to spend their own money to buttress a stock market in free-fall in 1929.Other financiers and financial institutions have also found themselves in the role of rescuers of capitalism. A recent example was in 1998, with the decision of a consortium of private lenders to keep the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management from dissolving all at once. (In both cases, of course, the financiers also managed to protect their own interests by keeping markets from collapsing.) 
There have been corporate sacrifices to help win wars, too. The Axis powers controlled the majority of natural rubber plantations during World War II. Standard Oil farmed out its patented method for making synthetic rubber to its American competitors -- albeit with encouragement (okay, arm twisting) from Congress. 
AFTER Sept. 11, airline, insurance and other industries looked to government for help. Government has started looking back.
When the government first suggested that to speed wheat to starving Afghans, it would buy it from Asia, some domestic wheat growers protested. Congress quickly convinced them to take the patriotic long view.
Backing down made good business sense in the end. As of mid-November, America had bought 15,000 metric tons of Kazakh wheat and 300,000 metric tons of American grain. 
Partly because Afghanistan has long been kept out of international markets by war and its aftermath, there are few immediate arenas where American national and business interests could collide. 
Next door, however, is another story. Pakistan's textile and apparel firms employ an astonishing 60 percent of the industrial work force, and American firms are the country's largest buyers. Or they used to be. Since Sept. 11, American orders have plummeted by two-thirds, according to Pakistani trade groups, and unemployment is soaring. 
That's bad news for the government of Gen. Pervez Musharraf, which is already under fire for helping the United States from Pakistan's powerful radical Muslim minority. 
Among the United States firms that reduced their orders from Pakistan are American Eagle Outfitters and Tommy Hilfiger, two firms that have made a steady stream of profits on patriotic imagery here at home. 
"I agree it is likely detrimental to Pakistan to cancel orders," said Laura Wile, chief financial officer of American Eagle Outfitters. "But I think every company has to assess the risk/reward relationship for themselves."
But Ms. Lee would not listen to her mother because she loved her job as an administrative assistant at Aon Consulting, even though she traveled each day from Eltingville, Staten Island. And it was also true that Ms. Lee had quit smoking for eight months before the terrorist attack, and did not need to make all those trips to the plaza anymore. "She loved the people there," Mrs. Greene said. "She loved her boss. And she loved the view."

BRENDA E. CONWAY
Half of a Lifelong Team
Brenda E. Conway was hard to miss. First, because of her unique style -- an avid shopper, she preferred bright colors and patterns, and made funny socks her signature -- and second, because you usually saw two of her. Mrs. Conway was rarely without her twin, Linda McGee. Though they were fraternal, the sisters still looked and sounded enough alike to draw attention.
"They were always together," said their mother, Edith Watford, pastor of the Second Chance Christian Center in the Bronx.
Mrs. Conway was a native of the Bronx, and lived there with her husband, Russell, and children Danielle Alexander, 19, and Mandell Conway, 13. A systems analyst at Marsh & McLennan, on the 97th floor of the World Trade Center, she would have been 40, and she often said that she did not need to have a lot of friends, because she had a twin.
Her sister said, "People ask me, am I dealing with it, and sometimes I say, no, I'm not dealing with it. Everything reminds me of her, because we did everything together."
The weekend before Sept. 11, the twins took a "ladies' day out" shopping trip with their daughters. Mrs. Conway bought almost a whole new wardrobe, now untouched. "She left behind so many new things," her mother said.

YAPHET J. ARYEE
Taxes and Taxis
Yaphet J. Aryee was the person everyone went to for advice. "He was born in Ghana so he was the expert on that," said Ely Yulman, who worked with Mr. Aryee as an auditor with the State Division of Taxation and Finance, on the 86th floor of 2 World Trade Center. "He made his furniture when he got married, so people asked him how to fix the stairs in their house, or how to fix the engine in their car. But first of all, he was the smartest corporate tax auditor in the department. Millions and millions he brought in."
Like many other new immigrants, Mr. Aryee, 49, drove a cab when he first arrived in New York as a young man; hacking paid for bachelor's and master's degrees in business administration from Adelphi University. He and his wife, Maria, moved to Rockland County to raise their four children.
But Mr. Aryee never forgot his taxi, and in August he bought his own cab so he could begin driving again. "Only on weekends," Mr. Yulman said. "It was his hobby."

MICHAEL A. ULIANO
Pleasures of Shore and Stage
Michael A. Uliano, a broker for Cantor Fitzgerald, never changed much from the grinning 10-year-old boy who was profiled in 1969 by his Canton, Mass., paper for snagging a 20-pound bass off Cape Cod. That he had just recovered from a broken wrist only added to his reputation for athleticism.
For the next 32 years, relatives recall, Mr. Uliano returned often to the Cape to dig clams and test out fishing lures he fashioned from chenille and Krazy Glue. He rode the dunes in a 1973 Jeep whose grille he painted to look like a shark's mouth.
Work eventually brought Mr. Uliano to New York, and though he enjoyed being a broker for Cantor Fitzgerald, he really wanted to act. So much, said his sister, Martha King, that he even endured teasing as a student at Ithaca College when he took ballet lessons as a way to improve his football game and prepare for a possible theatrical career.
When he met Linda Buffa in Bay Ridge in 1993, she took note of his Boston accent. He ribbed her about her Noo Yawk habit of talking while chewing gum. They were married in 1996 in Las Vegas, with an Elvis impersonator giving away the bride.
Life had darker moments, too. In March, Ms. Buffa learned she had breast cancer. "Thank God, he was here for that," she said. Daily radiation treatments kept her from attending a ceremony in his honor in which the Canton high school retired the Number 10, which he wore as its quarterback.

ERIC THORPE
Ball Carrier on Wall Street
The booming voice, competitiveness and self-assurance that helped Eric Thorpe become the star quarterback of his undefeated high school football team in Wilbraham, Mass., served him well on Wall Street. Mr. Thorpe, 35, known as Rick, was one of the top salesmen at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
But Mr. Thorpe kept business success in perspective. He helped run a soup kitchen during college, served as a Big Brother and participated in Hands Together, an anti-poverty program in Haiti. Having grown up in a close family -- he referred to his father, Raymond, as his best friend and called him nearly every day -- Mr. Thorpe was thrilled when his wife, Linda, gave birth to their daughter, Alexis, last year.
Through it all coursed a nonstop sense of humor. Not even Mr. Thorpe's parents escaped his fondness for nicknames, and he enjoyed initiating phone calls with a disguised voice. "He teased everyone, including me," said Thomas Michaud, Mr. Thorpe's boss.

WEIBIN WANG
Living the American Dream
Weibin Wang and Wen Shi met as students in Beijing, and married three years later. A few months after the wedding in 1986, Mr. Wang left for the United States to study geophysics, at Yale and then at Columbia. Ms. Shi followed a year later.
"We were very happy," she recalled. "We were finally able to be together. We were working hard, trying to realize our American dream."
And they did. He did research at Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y., and then shifted into computer systems to provide better for his wife and three children, working the last two years for Cantor Fitzgerald at 1 World Trade Center. The family moved to a house in Orangeburg in Rockland Country, where every weekend he cooked dumplings, noodles, even lasagna. On Saturdays he took his children to piano lessons, art school and karate; on Sundays he took them to a school in Fort Lee, N.J., where they studied Chinese reading, writing and culture. The family visited China when they were able.
"We want to instill a lot of learning and a lot of Chinese traditions," Ms. Shi said.
But Mr. Wang, 41, was also committed to his new country. In March, he became an American citizen.

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the relationship between corporate interests and national priorities at times of crisis referred incorrectly to the industrialist Andrew Carnegie. He did not use his own resources to mute the stock market crash in 1929; he died 10 years earlier.
A picture caption in some copies last Sunday about a vigil in Union Square that included Amber Amundson, whose husband died in the Sept. 11 attack on the Pentagon, and David Potorti, whose brother died at the World Trade Center, described the event incompletely. It marked the end of an eight-day peace march from Washington to New York.

HEADLINE: Oedipal Loop de Loop 

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
So will the president focus more on Wall Street's lipstick index or Teddy Roosevelt's big-stick index?
 The lipstick index is a way to judge a recession. When the economy goes down, lipstick sales go up. Women indulge in smaller luxuries and skip bigger ones. 
 The big-stick index is a way conservatives judge the president. Will W. whack Saddam with the stick, or will he fold, the way his dad did?
Mr. Bush spent his first year using his father's failures as a reverse playbook. Trying to dodge 41's mistakes, 43 catered to Congressional right-wingers and muscled through a mammoth tax cut.
When the economy slumped, he took great pains to tell Americans he understood their pain -- so he would not seem oblivious and wrapped up in foreign affairs like his father.
Then Sept. 11 hit and he had to get wrapped up in foreign affairs.
If the president uses the reverse playbook now, and continues to coddle the conservatives his father neglected, he has to go topple the wacky Iraqi, completing Poppy's unfinished business.
But if he does that, he turns his attention away from the recession, repeating Poppy's mistake after his war, when he never used his celestial approval ratings to fix the economy.
It's a surreal Oedipal loop de loop, made all the loopier by the spectacle of history repeating itself and putting the son at the same juncture where his father made two of the most critical and criticized decisions of his presidency.
Because 41 detached from Baghdad and detached from economic angst at home, 43 is under extra pressure to attack Iraq while attacking the recession.
The man who started out as the most disengaged president in modern history is now being pestered by his aides and his conservative base to engage, engage, engage.
His political and military advisers are competing for his attention, as he decides how hotly to pursue the war at a time when the economy is foundering and deficits are back.
It is a measure of how nervous the White House is, given Republican losses in the recent gubernatorial elections, that it dumped Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia as party chief last week.
Should the president rout Osama and the Taliban and then "focus like a laser beam on this economy," as Bill Clinton said when he beat Bush senior? Or should he go on to Phase Two, as the Get Saddam crowd calls it, now that the U.S. is "on a roll," as State Department official Richard Armitage puts it?
At the moment, Mr. Bush is juggling furiously.
In his Saturday radio address, the president concentrated on the recession and expressed concern about soaring unemployment. "It's a time to reach out to Americans who are hurting," he said, "to help them put food on the table and to keep a roof over their heads."
And, if Mr. Bush has not yet decided whether to crack Saddam with the big stick, he has been talking more loudly anyway. He said if Iraq did not allow U.N. inspectors into the country to check for weapons of mass destruction, it would "find out" the consequences.
It's hard to say if the swagger was meant to co-opt the string of Perles -- Richard Perle and others who are in full cry to crush Saddam -- or to lay a real groundwork for at least bombing Iraq.
It is curious that the president tolerates such open provocation from people in his administration and connected to it, given that the clamor sets him up to look soft on Saddam if he doesn't go after Iraq.
Paul Wolfowitz, the No. 2 Pentagon official, has been the spark plug of the Get Saddam club. Other drum-beaters are Mr. Perle, on a Pentagon advisory board, and fellow board member James Woolsey, who went on a government plane with a team from Justice and Defense to investigate whether Iraq was involved in the 9-11 attacks.
"If we cannot drive this tyrant from office," Mr. Perle said on CNN, "then we can't do anything."
In an interview with Bob Novak and Al Hunt on CNN Saturday, Donald Rumsfeld was asked about Mr. Perle's agitations.
"Look, Richard Perle is Richard Perle," he replied, praising Mr. Perle but adding: "He does not speak for the president. He does not speak for me."
So many voices, so little time. It's enough to send a president burrowing back into his feather pillow.

HEADLINE: Race Is in South Dakota But Interest Is National 

BYLINE:  By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: SIOUX FALLS, S.D., Nov. 30 

 BODY:
On the surface, next year's race in South Dakota for the United States Senate appears clear-cut enough -- the incumbent, Tim Johnson, a mainline Democrat, faces a strong challenge from the state's sole House member, John Thune, a solidly conservative Republican.
 But the contest is much more than that. 
 Underneath it is a battle royal -- a proxy fight, really -- between President Bush, who has pledged strong backing for Mr. Thune, and South Dakota's senior senator, Tom Daschle, who has pledged strong backing for Mr. Johnson and can deliver it, because he also happens to be the Senate majority leader. 
Such a standoff ensures that plenty of national political attention will be focused on South Dakota next year. But there are other reasons to watch the state, too, because besides the Senate race, there will be a House race and a governor's race.
In short, next year is shaping up as one of the most important election years ever in South Dakota, with a good possibility that the votes cast here in the Senate and House contests will be especially important in the overall national struggle for control of Congress.
Mr. Bush recruited Mr. Thune to take on Mr. Johnson and be one of several point men in next year's all-out Republican push to regain control of the Senate by picking off two Democratic seats. The president promised Mr. Thune White House and national party help, including money and staff, and over the next few weeks several top national Republican figures are scheduled to campaign here with Mr. Thune.
Mr. Daschle has made Mr. Johnson's re-election (and by extension perhaps his own survival as majority leader) what he calls "the most important political effort for me" in 2002. Mr. Johnson has also been promised help from Washington.
Independent pollsters have not taken a look at the contest. But polls taken by both candidates show a race too close to call.
Independent analysts agree. 
Charles E. Cook Jr., editor of The Cook Political Report, calls the race a "nail biter" that could end up being "one of the nation's most competitive contests."
Stuart Rothenberg of The Rothenberg Political Report says the closeness of the Thune-Johnson contest, along with the House and governor's races, both also expected to be close, could make South Dakota "the single most interesting state in the 2002 elections." 
Mr. Johnson narrowly won election to the Senate six years ago, beating the veteran Republican incumbent, Larry Pressler, by two percentage points. Given that slim edge, Republicans say it is not politically unrealistic to believe Mr. Thune can take Mr. Johnson. They note that South Dakota, Mr. Johnson's 1996 victory notwithstanding, has a history, year in and year out, of voting Republican more often than Democratic -- witness Mr. Bush's 22-point victory margin here last year.
Mr. Thune also has something else going for him. Though he is a member of the House, he is as well known in the state as Senator Johnson.
With about 750,000 people, South Dakota is so lightly populated that it has only one Congressional district. That means Congressional candidates always run statewide, the same as candidates for senator and governor, and Mr. Thune has run three times.
Almost certainly, the Johnson-Thune race, like most other Congressional races in 2002, will turn in good part on how much progress is made in the war on terror and how much the national economy recovers. In particular, the success of the proxy efforts by President Bush and Senator Daschle will be heavily governed by economic and national security issues. Beyond that, health care will surely be a major issue in the race, as it will be in other states. Because South Dakota is a big farm and ranching state, agriculture will be a major issue, too.
For the moment, however, Mr. Thune's main campaign pitch emphasizes something else. Those who ask why they should vote for him and thereby vote to break up the Daschle-Johnson team are told what Mr. Thune said when he announced his candidacy: "Consider this: Tom Daschle leading the Democrats in the Senate and John Thune working with him and the Republican leadership in Congress and with President Bush. South Dakota would be better positioned than ever before at the federal level."
Steve Hildebrand, Mr. Johnson's campaign manager and a veteran of many Democratic election battles, contends that his man will make political mincemeat of that argument and win re-election going away. But first things first, Mr. Hildebrand says, insisting that Mr. Johnson "really hasn't been able to focus seriously on running yet because he's spending just about all of his time in Washington working on legislation for national security and the war on terror."
"It's kind of got things on a hold," Mr. Hildebrand said. "But that's where the focus should be anyway."
The South Dakota House and governor's contests are not as fully developed as the Senate contest.
In the House race -- the seat opened up when Representative Thune decided to run for Senate -- Mr. Pressler has declared himself a candidate for the Republican nomination, a move that former senators usually view as a political step down. Several other Republicans have also jumped in, but Mr. Pressler is given the edge over all of them.
Gov. William J. Janklow, who under state law is not permitted to run for another term, is said to be thinking about joining the field too, a political move that would also be relatively rare for a former governor. If he does, with his popularity he would immediately become the leading Republican candidate. In the judgment of most political experts in the state, he would also be the favorite to win the general election in the fall, no matter which of half a dozen or so Democratic hopefuls is nominated.
The race to succeed Governor Janklow is even more wide open.
Of several Republicans thinking about running, Attorney General Mark Barnett is most often given the best chance of winning the nomination. But he has yet to formally announce that he is running.
Among Democrats, Jim Abbott, the president of the University of South Dakota, has expressed an interest in running and is given a good shot at winning the nomination. But he, too, has not yet made his move.
Mr. Abbott was unsuccessful in three earlier tries for elective office.

HEADLINE: A Husband Lost, and a Daughter Out of Reach 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Every time she telephones her 8-year-old daughter in the Ivory Coast, Hadidjatou Karamoko Traore says, the girl cries that she wants to come to New York to see her mother.
 "I wish she could come because her father is no longer alive," said Mrs. Traore, whose husband, a banquet cook at Windows on the World, died on Sept. 11. "She cries so much that she wants to see me." 
 But her daughter's hopes to see her mother, an illegal immigrant, have been blocked by the State Department's refusal to grant a visa.
State Department officials call it an open-and-shut case, saying that if the girl, Djenebou, were granted a temporary visa, she would undoubtedly do as her mother had done: remain in the country illegally after her visa expired.
Mrs. Traore, 31, has enlisted her husband's labor union and Senator Charles E. Schumer to fight for a visa, but they have butted up against the State Department's stance that it would be improper to grant a visa to someone, even a child, who is certain to remain in the country illegally.
Senator Schumer has implored the government to show some flexibility. "There ought to be some way that in very rare and unique cases an exception can be made," he said. "It's unfortunate that they could not find one here."
Mrs. Traore does not want to move back to Africa to rejoin the girl because life is much harder there, and because she is raising a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old, who, until their father's death, were thriving in New York.
"I don't think it's very nice not to give her a visa," she said in French. "How can they refuse?"
Her husband, Abdoul Karim Traore, moved to New York in 1993, after the grains-and-beans shop he ran in the Ivory Coast went under. Convinced that it was the only way to lift their family out of poverty, Mrs. Traore supported his moving without her, even though she was pregnant at the time with Djenebou.
In 1997, Mrs. Traore followed him to New York on a three-month tourist visa, without taking Djenebou. She knew she would not have gotten the visa if she had tried to bring her daughter. She recognized, she said, that State Department officials granted her the visa only because they were confident that, with a daughter still in the Ivory Coast, she would go back.
Mrs. Traore said she had intended to return to Africa, but her husband persuaded her to stay with him in the Bronx, hoping they could bring Djenebou over soon. Mrs. Traore gave birth to two more children in New York, while Mr. Traore's parents raised Djenebou in Abidjan.
Mr. Traore, an illegal immigrant, followed the path of many African immigrants seeking to climb into the middle class. He took a job as a supermarket deliveryman and then became a dishwasher.
Five years ago he became a cook at Windows on the World, a job he hoped to keep forever, his wife said. "He loved the job, he loved the people," she said. 
He worked on the 106th floor of 1 World Trade Center from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. each day, but that was not his only job. From 4 to 6 each morning, he also delivered newspapers.
"He was a fine, upstanding, affable, very intelligent guy," said Michael Lomonaco, executive chef at Windows on the World. "He was one of my best banquet cooks. I thought highly of him as a cook and as a man."
Since the terror attack, Mrs. Traore has spent much of the last two months trudging around Manhattan, seeking financial assistance to keep her family afloat. For now, she is getting by with help from relatives, her mosque and her husband's union, as well as the Red Cross, Catholic Charities and other relief agencies.
One big worry is whether she will lose the three-family house her husband bought in the Bronx last summer after making an $11,000 down payment. It carries a monthly mortgage payment of $1,715. She earns a little money braiding hair, but not enough to cover the mortgage.
Amanda Ream, an official with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union who is assisting Mrs. Traore, noted that in a similar case in September the American Embassy in Ecuador granted visas to three children of a deceased Windows of the World worker from Ecuador. That worker and his wife were also illegal immigrants.
"His widow went from being completely consumed by her grief before her children came to having a full life with her children," Ms. Ream said. "I'd love to see that happen with Hadidjatou."
But Christopher Lamora, a spokesman for the State Department's bureau of consular affairs, offered little hope. "The embassy in Abidjan," he said, "determined that Djenebou Traore was not eligible for a visa based on a belief that she had no intention of returning to Cote d'Ivoire after a temporary stay in the United States." 
Djenebou's only chance, Mr. Lamora said, is for her family to persuade the Immigration and Naturalization Service to grant a rare humanitarian exception, permitting her into the United States.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE STRATEGY; 
As Guns Still Blaze, Bush Aides Debate Shifting Focus to Butter

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE and THOM SHANKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 

 BODY:
Even as President Bush asks Americans to prepare for a sustained war on global terrorism, tensions are escalating between his domestic political team and his military policy advisers over whether the administration should turn more of its attention to pressing economic concerns.
 At the Pentagon, policy advisers make the case that the Defense Department should not back down from the commitment to eradicating terror, particularly since public support of the president remains strong. 
 But inside and outside the White House, many advisers to Mr. Bush have urged him to use that political capital to declare victory sooner rather than later and to emphasize efforts to fix the economy. The party could suffer in the midterm elections next year, they argue, if there is too much emphasis on the war at the expense of the economy. 
These advisers are mindful that Mr. Bush's father enjoyed astronomical approval ratings after the Persian Gulf war in 1991, only to lose his job 18 months later because the public believed he had not responded effectively to an economic slowdown.
But other advisers and some Pentagon officials expressed the fear that Mr. Bush would abandon the war effort prematurely to demonstrate that he cared equally about jobs and incomes.
President Bush, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and other members of the war council speak in one voice about their long-term commitment to the war, even if the next phase remains unclear. Mr. Bush in recent days spoke in his strongest terms yet on the threat posed by Iraq and seemed to expand his definition of the war on terrorism. And Mr. Rumsfeld expresses confidence that the Bush administration has earned the continued support of the American people for prosecuting the war.
Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political adviser, insisted that administration officials were in lock step, and that the president could pursue the war and tend to the economy.
"The president's concern is first that the media, and then the American people, need to be reminded that this is a long, grueling campaign ahead," Mr. Rove said. Insisting that Mr. Bush could balance the war and the economy, he said "they will both be important issues" in the elections next year.
Still, as the war in Afghanistan, the first front in the fight against terror, approaches its third month, many other officials said there was a vigorous debate over how Mr. Bush should calibrate his priorities.
"Bush and Rumsfeld are in sync," said one senior Defense Department official. But the official acknowledged worries among some of Mr. Rumsfeld's advisers that powerful voices in the administration were urging what the Pentagon views as a premature desire to declare victory and retreat to domestic issues.
"There is concern expressed that they won't have the stomach to carry it through to other countries," the Defense Department official said.
One of Mr. Bush's political advisers conceded that the patience for a prolonged military operation might be limited, saying: "In the White House, there is a bias toward developing a broad-based strategy to deal with the lack of economic growth. You maintain strong public support when the economy is robust, and they know that. Political concerns in a Congressional election year would normally be part of anything a White House would legitimately be concerned about."
In his weekly radio address today, Mr. Bush linked the ailing economy directly to the strikes at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, saying that "the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 hit our economy hard."
"They hurt our airlines and hotels and restaurants, and undermined consumer and business confidence," Mr. Bush said. "Now we need to act boldly to protect America's economic security."
Former Representative Vin Weber of Minnesota, an influential Republican who is close to the White House, said of the need to focus on the economy: "I don't know that it needs to become outright partisan warfare, but it's going to have to be a little bit higher profile than it has been in the last 90 days. People's votes for Congressional and gubernatorial candidates are still going to focus largely on domestic concerns."
Mr. Weber added, "My reading of history shows that at the end of the day, the domestic economy dominates -- even in wartime."
White House officials said they had been devoting more time to the economy than many people realized. The president does not have to be convinced of the importance of focusing on the economy; aides said he remembered that his father's popularity plummeted after the gulf war.
Recalling the experience of Mr. Bush's father, Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, said: "The country doesn't give you much slack. President Bush won one of the most decisive victories in human history to discover the country impatient with the economy."
Yet the conundrum faced by the current President Bush is underscored by the fact that his father was also accused of declaring victory too soon in the war against Saddam Hussein, who remains a threat and may yet become a target in the new war on terror.
Those advocating a sustained war effort argue that if the fight is halted too soon, or played down publicly -- especially in the instance of another terror attack at home -- Mr. Bush's political fortunes would tumble and he could suffer the same fate as his father: losing a bid for re-election.
Already, Mr. Bush's aides are laying out plans for him to have a higher profile on his stimulus proposal and other economic matters -- just as they were before Sept. 11. The debate is over how to strike the proper balance without appearing to play down the war, the continued terrorist threat or the nation's economy, which this week was officially declared to be in a recession.
The latest survey by Public Opinion Strategies, a prominent Republican polling company, found that for the first time concern about "the slowdown of the economy" eclipsed that about "the threat of terrorism on U.S. soil." And the survey found the public to be far less concerned about the drive to eradicate terrorism overseas.
To some degree, the economy and the war are inextricably linked. It was perhaps inevitable that officials at the Pentagon would be more eager to press the military effort while domestic and political advisers would be more worried about the economy, and that after Sept. 11 the national security team would eclipse the domestic policy group that reigned during the administration's first six months.
Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, said that if there was not greater focus on the economy, the public could become restless. "It all depends where we are in terms of the war effort and homeland security,' Mr. Rowland said. "Economic issues are always a front-burner issue to people unless you're at war."
Ed Gillespie, a Republican strategist who was an official on the Bush campaign, said the White House had to focus on the economy while not appearing to be giving short shrift to the war. "To say 'Forget all the stuff we said about the war on terrorism' would be a mistake," he said. "At the same time, people are concerned about the economy, and hopefully the war on terrorism will become less than a daily concern."
Advocates of opening new fronts in the war on terrorism fear exactly that -- that the concerns about a next attack are already fading in the public's mind in advance of opening whatever second front may come.
"I think we are closer to Phase 2, in part because the end is in sight for Phase 1, unless there is a serious reversal" in Afghanistan, said Richard Perle, chairman of the Defense Policy Board, an unofficial Pentagon policy review panel.
Speaking at a recent meeting of the Defense Writers' Group, Mr. Perle underscored "the risk that there will be a break in momentum" between Phases 1 and 2. "And so," he said, "it would have been better, I think, to look at this as a single campaign, which is what I think the president had in mind at the outset when he declared a war against terrorism -- not against Al Qaeda simply; not against the Taliban simply."
Prominent Republicans who are close to the White House argue that Mr. Bush has no choice but to begin concentrating on the economy.
"As we bring more certainty to the war, I think there will be a real shift and we'll see increased expression or concern for the workers, concern for the joblessness and concern for the economy," said Senator Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee. "I know from conversations with the administration that the concern is there. Workers have lost their jobs or will lose their jobs and they expect government to address it."
Former Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana, a friend of Mr. Bush's who is being considered as the next Republican Party chairman, said: "I have no question that the economy remains at the top of the list in terms of importance and attention being given by the administration. That's why you see them so engaged with the stimulus package."

 BODY:
 Battles, Past and Present

CLOSING IN -- With relentless bombing and the checkmate positioning of their military forces around Kandahar, the United States military and sympathetic Afghan forces continued to send the Taliban's besieged defenders the message that surrender is the only way out of an otherwise hopeless plight. Meanwhile, in Bonn, negotiations on a new post-Taliban government for Afghanistan proceeded fitfully, with the Northern Alliance making a proposal that has broken Friday's impasse. A1

ERRANT BOMBING REPORTED -- American bombers over Tora Bora, the cave complex where Osama bin Laden may be hiding, struck three Afghan villages, killing or injuring scores of civilians, witnesses and local officials said. But an American spokesman, Marine Maj. Brad Lowell, denied that American bombs had mistakenly hit a village, saying that the target struck was military. B2

Surrendering, Again

THE HOLDOUTS -- More than 80 foreign fighters, the last survivors of a revolt by Taliban prisoners that left scores dead, finally surrendered, wounded, starving and near collapse, at the fort near Mazar-i-Sharif where they had been held. Their surrender, six days after the bloody uprising, ended the last desperate fight of the Taliban in northern Afghanistan. B1

THE UNWANTED -- The foreign soldiers who fought with the Taliban before surrendering seem less diabolical than deluded, ignorant men on a fool's journey that has landed many of them in cells. No one -- neither their captors nor their native lands -- seems to want them. B3

PRESSING THE ENEMY -- Hundreds of marines have flowed into what was once Taliban-controlled territory in southern Afghanistan, clearing the way for more American and allied forces to arrive. Senior Pentagon officials say the force is meant to increase pressure on the remaining Taliban strongholds. B1

A Changed City

IN KABUL -- Three weeks after the Taliban's exodus, residents are resuming those parts of their lives that had been outlawed by an uncompromising vision of Islamic purity. While joy may be too strong a word, there is no denying that a shared sense of relief has embraced the city. A1

DIPLOMATS RETURN -- Some diplomats have returned to their shuttered embassies, or in some cases ruined ones, in Kabul, united by their desire to ensure that nothing like the Taliban ever again takes power and turns Afghanistan into a haven for terrorists. B5

BACK TO SCHOOL -- When Farida Afzali, 21, walked into Kabul University -- the first woman in five years to register for classes -- she had no idea she was walking into history. B5

Questions of Strategy

AN EXPANDED SEARCH -- The Federal Bureau of Investigation has expanded its investigation of the anthrax attacks to include government and contractor laboratories as a possible source of the deadly powder that has killed five people, scientists and law enforcement officials say. While theories about the culprit have focused mainly on domestic loners and foreign states or terrorists, law enforcement officials are now also examining the possibility that the criminal may be a knowledgeable insider. B1

THE ECONOMY -- Tensions are escalating between President Bush's domestic political team and his military policy advisers over whether the administration should turn more of its attention to pressing economic concerns. Pentagon advisers say the president should not back down from the promised long-term commitment to eradicating terror, but others are urging him to declare victory sooner rather than later and to emphasize efforts to fix the economy. A1

SAUDI ARABIA -- William J. Burns, the assistant secretary for Near East affairs, met in Riyadh with top Saudi officials, including Crown Prince Abdullah, for talks intended in part to seek further Saudi help in cutting off money to suspected terror organizations. The Saudis have complained that the United States has not shared the evidence necessary for them to freeze bank accounts, and American diplomats acknowledge that information provided until now to the Saudis has been insufficient for further action. B5

Differences of Opinion

LEAHY-ASHCROFT DISPUTE -- The issue of civil liberties has created a classic balance-of-power struggle between Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Attorney General John Ashcroft, a onetime colleague now leading the administration's domestic war on terrorism. B6

U.S.-BRITISH TENSIONS -- After percolating below the surface for weeks, a debate between the United States and Britain over when to use peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan became public Friday when the Pentagon made clear that Washington's military campaign came first. B4

THE TRIBUNALS -- Former military lawyers say they are angered by a public perception, fed most recently by the top White House lawyer, that the military tribunals authorized by President Bush are merely wartime versions of American courts-martial. The lawyers say the proposed tribunals are significantly different from courts-martial, adding that confusion between the two has distorted the debate over the tribunals and unfairly denigrated military justice. B6

THE INVESTIGATION -- Officials in Italy and the United States have been describing the Islamic Cultural Center and mosque in Milan which has played a recurring role in various terror investigations, as Europe's logistical support center for Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network. Two terror suspects who worked there have been taken into custody, one during a raid on Thursday. Both men, the police said, were Al Qaeda recruiters. But on Friday, hundreds of Muslim men who came to the center to pray, protested that the investigations are trumped up and racist. B4

Raising Money

THE CHARITIES -- Soon after Sept. 11, when the magnitude of the nation's charitable response to the terror attacks had become clear, several government and charity officials warned that disparities in how aid was distributed could produce division among the survivors. Those divisions are starting to emerge as breathtaking sums of money have poured in for the families of about 400 police officers, firefighters and other uniformed personnel who died trying to lead thousands of civilians to safety. A1

REST IN PEACE -- The body of a firefighter who was mistaken for a fellow firefighter and buried last month was buried for a second time after it was disinterred last week. B7

NEW BOOK -- A book of photographs, "Brotherhood," documenting the Fire Department's losses in the trade center attacks, goes on sale this week at $29.95 a copy. Money from sales will go to families of the fallen rescue workers. B7

HEADLINE: The Industry Behind the State's Robust Industry 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN WARNER 

DATELINE: PRINCETON 

 BODY:
AT the sleek corporate campuses of the world's largest drug-makers tucked away throughout New Jersey, thousands of scientists and executives are working on new cures that will enhance and extend human life and their companies' financial health.
 But for every one of these giant drug-makers, there are hundreds of other companies around the state that serve pharmaceutical manufacturers with everything from raw cells and animal testing to television ads and salesmen. 
 "There is a whole industry behind the industry," said Joseph Palo, a partner in the pharmaceutical strategy practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Florham Park.
In all, there are 217 companies in New Jersey that manufacture pharmaceuticals, according to the state Department of Labor. Moreover, those companies provide a client base for thousands of other businesses in the state, particularly the 200 companies that manufacture laboratory equipment, along with 8,571 computer service firms, 8,886 business and management services and 1,074 research and testing companies. 
Seventeen of the state's largest drug companies, including Merck, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer employ 60,000 workers. Another 46,000 employees work for smaller drug companies and medical manufacturers, according to a study prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers for the HealthCare Institute of New Jersey, a statewide industry trade group.
Beyond that, an additional 42,500 jobs are generated in the wider state economy by the entire drug industry, according to an economic analysis by the state Commerce Department.
Because the industry pays so well -- the average annual salary last year was $123,710 -- each pharmaceutical jobs supports nearly two others in the state, the Commerce Department said.
"They have a very important ripple effect through the economy," said George Nagle, an economist for the Commerce Department.
But that cuts both ways.
As investigators struggle to find the source of the anthrax spores mailed to news organizations and government offices in Washington, many are not surprised that they appear to have come from New Jersey.
Richard H. Ebright, a professor of chemistry at Rutgers University who is a lab director at the Waksman Institute of Microbiology in Piscataway, said the state was full of experts and equipment that could reduce material into fine particles for use in medications. This is also how the anthrax spores have become weaponized for easy inhalation.
"I think it's very likely it was done in New Jersey," said Dr. Ebright. "I think it was done, and it is being done in New Jersey."
To emphasize his point, Dr. Ebright pointed to at least three companies in the Trenton area that specialize in the production of fine powders for industry on a contract basis. In addition, he said that used pharmaceutical equipment was sold in the state -- including industrial dryers small enough to make fine powder chemicals in a home.
Yet while New Jersey has the expertise to make this deadly form of anthrax, it also possesses the knowledge to help halt it, he said. 
Vincent Gullo, a research executive at Schering-Plough Corp., the huge drug manufacturer in Kenilworth, said the company hired hundreds of outsiders to supply everything from testing equipment to radioactive chemicals and even chemical compounds that could themselves become the essence of a hit drug.
"I sign purchase orders all day," said Mr. Gullo.
Some of the vendors are large, high-tech operations with hundreds of employees themselves. Many more are run by a lone entrepreneur, often a refugee from one of the big pharmaceutical companies, working out of a spare bedroom on a laptop.
While most pharmaceutical manufacturing is done outside New Jersey -- particularly in Puerto Rico and overseas -- the state remains the corporate center of the industry where top managers guide business strategy, marketing and sales and research.
They are in New Jersey because this is where the business is.
"For us, it's convenient,' said Chris Kuebler, chief executive of Covance Inc. of Princeton, which performs testing and clinical trials for drug companies. "We don't have to get on an airplane in order to be underfoot regularly."
Even in an age of e-mail messages and teleconferencing, proximity matters.
This fall, Andrew Carr, chief executive of Amersham Biosciences in Piscataway, was invited to a weekend barbeque by the parents of his child's friend. Lingering by the smoker, Mr. Carr began talking to a venture capitalist with ties to a company in the Midwest that had developed a compelling new gene technology.
Mr. Carr called him back Monday morning.
"That's a lead I'm very interested in following up on," he said. "That's exactly how it works."
Indeed, Mr. Kuebler emphasized what a a "small world" the drug industry was in New Jersey.
"We're always bumping into each other at the grocery store, or our kids' soccer games," he said. "There's never an airplane out of Newark or Philadelphia that is not filled with people from the industry."
That access can mean everything.
Bovis Lend Lease, a global construction company, opened an office in New Jersey more than a decade ago to be even closer to the drug industry than was its New York City office. 
Bovis, which is based in Britain, builds highly specialized drug manufacturing plants around the world. Though most of the plants are not in New Jersey, the people who decide who will be paid to build them are.
"Seventy-five to 80 percent of the construction-related decisions for the industry are made within a 50-mile radius of this office, even if the facility is in Singapore or Europe," said Steve Steelman, senior vice president of the pharmaceutical business unit in the Americas for Bovis Lend Lease in Princeton. Mr. Steelman's office employs about 260 people, of which about 65 percent work on pharmaceutical construction projects full time.
Beyond winning a bid, proximity can help in a long-term relationship.
Mr. Carr's company, Amersham, produces sophisticated equipment used to help drug-company chemists screen millions of compounds for a potential reaction that could halt disease. For instance, Amersham worked directly with Schering-Plough for several years to develop a testing machine, called a LEADseeker, that simultaneously tests thousands of chemical compounds for a reaction to a cell associated with disease. If a compound creates a reaction, it may become the basis for a new blockbuster drug.
"There is e-mail and teleconferencing and all the rest, but to get all the scientists together, and to do that frequently, is helpful," said Mr. Gullo. "It is very helpful that Amersham is in New Jersey and so are many, many other little companies."
The structure of big pharmaceutical companies, which do everything from basic research to manufacturing to parceling out samples to doctors, makes it naturally prone to use outsourcing.
Not only do drug companies do it all, they do it for many diseases. A cardiovascular drug is different from a cancer drug, not only in the laboratory but all the way through the process of testing, getting approval from government regulators and to distributing it to completely different sets of doctors.
Even with the armies of their own employees, drug companies need help. What's more the industry's constant race against the clock must be factored in. From the time a drug is discovered, it has up to 20 years of patent protection to reap profits. Most of that time is eaten up in development and testing, leaving only about seven years of market life.
"The value of working with outside companies is you buy into their expertise on something they have done many times before and get a very quick start-up time," said Mr. Palo of PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Drug companies run in cycles. Sometimes, when they are lucky, they are busy in the lab developing early-stage drug candidates. Other times, after a dry spell in the lab, the focus may be on beefed-up marketing for mature products. With help from outsiders, the company can grow in the specialties it needs most and shrink back in others.
PDI -- with 5,000 employees nationwide, of which 300 are situated in New Jersey -- was a pioneer in offering a contract sales force to the drug industry in 1990. Companies hire PDI when they need an army of salesmen to launch a new product, or reposition an old one. Smaller companies use PDI instead of building their own sales force.
"The pharmaceutical industry is amazing in its ability to plan ahead," said Steve Cotugno, executive vice president of PDI in Upper Saddle River. "It takes many years to develop a drug and get approvals. They have to make huge investments up front. And they're not afraid to spend money."
According to Mr. Kuebler of Covance Inc., 12 major drug companies stretching from Connecticut to Wilmington, Del., spent more than $30 billion on research alone last year, more than half the industry total of $55 billion.
Quite simply, the drug industry is able to spend huge amounts of money because it makes huge amounts. In the United States, it is among the most profitable businesses. So, too, are its suppliers.
Cambrex Corp., of East Rutherford, dates its history back 100 years to Baker Castrol Oil in Bayonne. By the 1980's it had evolved into a chemical company. When it acquired an agricultural chemical company that also sold medicine for animals, managers were pleasantly surprised by the profit-margins on the drugs. The company then began its transformation into a health-care company, which accounted for more than 70 percent of its $492.5 million in sales last year.
Cambrex makes specialty ingredients for the drug industry including experimental drugs for use in clinical trials. It is also the largest supplier of human cells and adult stem cells to drug researchers in the United States, said James A. Mack, the company's chief executive.
"We see the growth rates in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology as being much higher than in the traditional businesses," said Mr. Mack.
He said that outside consultants and vendors had to tap into the culture of large drug companies -- and that culture is based in science. It is cautious and slow moving because the industry is fearful of making a mistake that might result in repercussions from its regulators or the loss of public trust in its products.
"It's important to have the same level of quality in your systems as Big Pharma," said Mr. Mack. "Big Pharma only talks to each other and they don't trust anybody else unless you have quality standards that look just like them."
Even within the overlay of that culture, drug companies have certain personalities of their own, suppliers said. Some are fiercely independent. Others are more willing to collaborate. Some put more emphasis on science, while others are better marketers.
Mr. Kuebler said it got even more complicated than that. For example, he said Merck's corporate headquarters in Whitehouse Station had its own culture, while its research operation in Rahway had another. So, too, does Merck's operations center in West Point, Pa., near Philadelphia.
"And within West Point there are differences in how you approach the cardiovascular team or the gastrointestinal team," he said. "We always have to be aware of the different idiosyncracies."
The main reason for the concentration of drug companies in New Jersey is the availability of highly trained workers, fed by a network of eastern universities. Companies can easily raid another and employees often do not have to uproot their families to change companies.
"There's a huge talent pool of people we can draw on," said Joe Torre, chief executive of Torre Lazur-McCann healthcare Worldwide, an advertising company in Parsippany that specializes in the drug industry.
But that works both ways, said Mr. Torre whose own company was the second ad agency focusing on the drug industry to move to Parsippany.
"Neither one of us ever had a problem with employee turnover," he said, "but then came the third and the fourth and the fifth and the sixth and they started stealing people from each other."
There is also something of a revolving door between Big Pharma and suppliers.
"When people leave a company and go into the service business, sometimes a company will say, 'It's great to have Joe back.' Other times there are companies that say, 'No, we don't want to have people leaving and then trying to come back and sell us something,' " said Mr. Palo. "I've seen it work both ways."
Dana Guazzo of Bridgewater thought she was walking out the door for good in July 2000 when she quit her job at Johnson & Johnson. After 22 years in the industry, Mrs. Guazzo wanted to spend more time with her two daughters and to volunteer at her church. As she was cleaning out her desk, executives asked if she would continue to work with the company as an outside consultant.
"I really was ready to pull out completely," said Mrs. Guazzo, who is a specialist in drug packaging. A pharmacist by training, she figured she could always go back and work in a drugstore if she needed a job.
"But when they came to me, that motivated me to set up my own business," she said. Now she has her own company, RxPax LLC, and 12 clients. She works 20 to 30 hours a week and is earning more than she did at Johnson & Johnson, though that is without any health and retirement benefits, paid vacation or a guarantee there will be work tomorrow.
Still, Mrs. Guazzo said she did not worry that she would go cold outside the thick of the action at a big drug company. "Being out there as a consultant, I'm more aware of what's going on than when I just worked for one company," she said. "That's what my clients want. They want somebody who knows what's going on at a variety of companies."
But the intensely secretive industry, rooted in proprietary formulations, operates on a code of silence.
"We can never talk about confidential business on an airplane," said Mr. Kuebler.
Every project that is awarded comes with a confidentiality agreement and the implicit understanding that if it is violated the perpetrator will need to consider a new line of work.
Mr. Gullo said that in 25 years in the industry, he had never had a problem with espionage. 
Mr. Mack of Cambrex said his clients trusted him, but still cut the cards. For example, if Cambrex is hired to make a trial batch of a new drug that requires a dozen steps, the drug company might give Cambrex four of the steps and do the rest itself, or parcel it out to one or two other businesses.
The industry's close breeding also requires arrangements to avoid business conflicts.
Mr. Kuebler said companies often want to hire his firm because it has done work on a similar product in the past. Of course, the initial client may have a problem with that since the new drug is likely to be competition.
"We have to work through these conflicts all the time," he said.
Mr. Torre, the advertising executive, solved the problem by forming three separate companies that do programs to inform doctors about clients' new drugs or new uses for old drugs. Each company has a slightly different emphasis and can handle competing products, he said.
"The beauty of three," Mr. Torre said, "is that in our industry conflicts are a big thing. If one is handling Paxil then they cannot handle Prozac."
Mr. Kuebler said the New Jersey state government has taken a pro-growth stance with the industry as a whole with tax abatements and training credits and is competitive with other states in attracting and retaining companies in the industry. He said the state helped Covance erect a new office building in the Carnegie Center in Princeton, where 650 of the company's 7,000 employees are based.
When he loses an employee to a competitor in North Carolina, he said, it is usually for the weather and the golf courses, not the lower cost of living. More often, Mr. Kuebler he said, his competitors came away empty-handed because New Jersey employees did not feel they could adjust to the culture of the South.
His company serves 500 clients, yet half of its business is concentrated with the 12 major drug-makers in New Jersey. Its laboratories do more than a third of the tests for drugs in the clinical trial process. In addition, the company is conducting 143 clinical trials, involving 1,500 Covance employees and 10,000 to 15,000 doctors.
Last year, Mr. Kuebler said, there was a downturn in business of a lack of late-stage products in the industry pipeline. But he said Covance's toxicology labs, which are the initial stage of the drug development, are busy again, indicating more large-scale trials in four to five years.
While they all have their niche, New Jersey's pharmaceutical vendors know their futures are linked, for better or worse, to those of the industry's big players.
Working in its favor, said Mr. Kuebler, "is the aging of the population and new advancements in science coming all the time."
But he also shared the worry of those in the executive suites at the large drug manufacturers. "A negative could be society's willingness to pay for it all."

HEADLINE: French Leader Visits Algiers To Shore Up Terrorism War 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE DALEY

DATELINE: ALGIERS, Dec. 1 

 BODY:
President Jacques Chirac of France swept into this port city for an eight-hour visit today, the first time a French president had been to Algeria in more than 12 years.
 With President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Mr. Chirac briefly toured of an area of the city where hundreds of people died last month when a violent storm caused huge mudslides. 
 Under a blazing sun, the French president broke away from his security guards to kiss babies and hug strangers, many of whom chanted, "Give us visas. Give us visas." 
The hastily arranged trip is one more sign that the Sept. 11 terror attacks in New York have changed the political landscape around the world. The Algerian government, much like the Russian government, has found that by offering to cooperate with America's war on terrorism it is getting a far more sympathetic hearing than it had in the past. 
Western governments, including the French, are showing less inclination to listen to the complaints of international human rights groups and Algerian democracy activists who condemn Algeria for its handling of Islamic militants. Indeed, Mr. Chirac made no mention of such issues in a brief news conference before meeting Mr. Bouteflika for dinner at the presidential palace.
And asked if he had wrongly dismissed Algeria's claims in the past that Europe was being used as a base for Algerian terrorists, Mr. Chirac said, "Yes, yes. We were wrong."
Nevertheless, the visit was not quite a full embrace. Mr. Chirac sandwiched his brief stop here in the middle of visits to two other former North African colonies with close economic ties to France: Tunisia and Morocco.
The trip was not an official state visit, only a "tour." 
Mr. Chirac's entourage placed little emphasis on the visit to Algiers, saying that the trip was a matter of telling the leaders of all three countries that the American-led campaign against terrorism was not a campaign against Islam. 
"We have contact with many officials all the time by telephone," Mr. Chirac said just before taking off for Algeria. "But that is nothing like sitting down over a good cup of coffee, which is what we are doing here." 
There can be little doubt, however, that Mr. Chirac's visit was also a calculated political move designed to make him look good at home in the runup to a re-election campaign next spring. 
There are about five million Muslims leaving in France now, almost 10 percent of the population, and the majority are Algerian. But beyond impressing potential Muslim voters, the trip is keeping Mr. Chirac in the news and looking presidential while his likely rival, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, is at home struggling with such implacable problems as the growing unemployment rate. Mr. Chirac has been taking a lot trips lately, including visiting the United States twice since the terror attacks. 
But visiting Algeria is a tricky proposition. France's violent eight-year effort to suppress an independence movement here is often likened to the United States efforts in Vietnam, having caused violent protests at home and led to the fall of a government before the French withdrew in 1962. The Algerians would like an apology for French conduct during those years, but this is a delicate issue in France and an apology has not been forthcoming.
Moreover, recent history is problematic as well. Mr. Chirac's predecessor, Francois Mitterrand, visited Algeria three times. But visits stopped after what is known as "the coup" of 1992 -- when the military canceled elections the main Islamist party was poised to win. 
That led to a violent struggle between the government security forces and armed Islamic groups that has killed 100,000 people, many of them women and children slaughtered in their villages. 
With the backing of the generals, Mr. Bouteflika became president in 1999, promising to end the violence. He offered an amnesty to some of the militants and more than 5,000 laid down their arms. 
Abroad as well, Mr. Bouteflika has begun a charm offensive. He has visited the United States twice this year, meeting with Mr. Bush both times and pledging his support for the campaign against terrorism. 
But the French are not yet ready to be wholly favorable to Mr. Bouteflika's advances. When he visited France last year -- the first visit by an Algerian leader in 17 years -- the red carpet was rolled out. But the visit nevertheless drew criticism from editorial writers, who criticized the nation for what one called "serious and systematic human rights violations."

HEADLINE: Now, Is Even the Boss Taking a Hit? 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
CARLY'S doing it. John's doing it. So are Gordon, Don and Leo.
 Even James E. Cayne, the chief executive of Bear Stearns, whose executives have been widely criticized as paying themselves well -- no, very well -- is doing it. 
 After years in which executive pay marched steadily, if controversially, upward, the trend seems to have begun to reverse course -- in many cases at the behest of the executives themselves. 
From Hewlett-Packard to Cisco Systems to Continental, American and Delta airlines, executives are forgoing bits and pieces of their compensation with hardly a squeak. Others are accepting severance packages, either willingly or under duress, that weigh in at far less than what departing executives, even poorly performing ones, received last year.
What gives? "The optimist in me would like to believe that pay for performance is actually working," said Cynthia L. Richson, director of corporate governance at the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. "The realistic side of me says that for now, it's probably more of a P.R. move than anything."
Shame, perhaps, is back in vogue. It is moot now, but the biggest example may be the Enron Corporation. A takeover offer by Dynegy in early November automatically entitled Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chief executive, to a $60 million severance package.
But when employees, many of whom had lost most of their retirement savings in 401(k) plans after the company's stock nose-dived, became incensed, Mr. Lay walked away from the money. "How could Ken Lay possibly have withstood the public scrutiny if he had walked away with that $60 million severance package?" Ms. Richson said. "It would have been almost criminal to take a big fat payoff."
(The Dynegy deal collapsed last week, canceling the payoff anyway.)
It is hardly surprising that chief executives and members of compensation committees are not rushing to the phones to explain their behavior.
But some companies and pay experts would have you believe that executives and board members are insisting that pay match the altered performance of their companies, that as they lay off workers and cut costs to cope with the now-official recession, they are taking a hit themselves.
Last April, for example, John Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco Systems, gave up his right to $268,131 in salary. Cisco's stock dropped 70 percent in the last fiscal year and earnings plummeted as demand dried up for the company's switches and other products. "His request to the compensation committee was that his pay reflect the current state of the business," said Terry Anderson, a spokeswoman for Cisco.
But cynics -- and after years of skyrocketing numbers it is easy to be cynical about executive pay in America -- say that much of the sacrificing is more style than substance. In reality, they say, executives and boards are just finding creative ways to cut cash compensation while making up the loss in ways that take advantage of weak disclosure requirements.
Supplemental pension plans are rising in popularity, experts say. They ensure rich retirement pay for executives, and with limited disclosure, because companies can bundle all their pension liabilities, obscuring the increases aimed at senior managers. Companies like Motorola, McKesson and Hershey have all adopted such plans.
Gaining favor, too, are special trusts, like the one designed for John F. Welch Jr. when he left General Electric in September. It allows him to pass his wealth on to future generations with few or no tax penalties.
Ms. Richson of the Wisconsin agency, whose responsibilities include investing state pension money, said that at a recent conference on executive pay, some panelists -- including corporate executives, compensation consultants and members of board compensation committees -- were very concerned about making executives whole in a time when stock options and other noncash goodies had become worthless.
The real-life models are starting to stack up. "Look at Cisco," complained Graef S. Crystal, a compensation expert who is one of the biggest critics of compensation practices. "There was a case where, yes, Chambers did cut his pay and his bonus -- but then he gave himself monstrously more options than the previous year, so his total pay actually went up."
Mr. Chambers received six million options in the last fiscal year. First, in November 2000, he got four million with a strike price of $50 under the company's regular stock option program. Then, in May, when Cisco's board decided to hand out additional options to keep employees motivated, he received an additional two million with a strike price of $18.50.
"The size of the second option grant was not recalibrated to make up for the reduction in his salary or the fact that he did not receive a bonus," said Ms. Anderson, Cisco's spokeswoman.
She said the options were disbursed at the board's discretion -- not at Mr. Chambers's demand -- and that there was no way to know what the options would be worth until they were cashed out. "All grants approved by the compensation committee are based on competitive norms and are applied to all Cisco employees, not just John," she said.
The motives of the airline chief executives -- Gordon M. Bethune at Continental, Donald J. Carty at American and Leo F. Mullins at Delta, among others -- also raise questions. After the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, each gave up his salary for the remainder of the year. But their magnanimity coincided with the $15 billion government bailout for the industry and thus appeared to be a sort of quid pro quo.
Or consider Jacques A. Nasser, who was ousted as chief executive at Ford Motor in October. Although the details of his severance package will not be known until next spring, it is clear from initial regulatory filings that he will receive awards of stock for the next two or three years.
Moreover, he will receive "restricted stock units" this year as if he had met all his performance goals, which he did not: Ford's profits have dropped, the company became involved in a bitter and expensive fight over faulty tires with Bridgestone, and the acquisitions that were the hallmark of Mr. Nasser's reign depleted its cash surplus and have yet to pay off.
But 18 months after his retirement, Mr. Nasser will have the right to exchange those stock units for cash equal to the value of an equivalent number of Ford common shares. In other words, if his successor, William Clay Ford Jr., manages to fix the mistakes that Mr. Nasser made, Mr. Nasser will benefit.
If these were real pay cuts, they would prove that the compensation revolution of the 1990's actually worked. 
A decade or so ago, shareholders started demanding that executive pay reflect corporate performance. Compensation committees responded by designing pay packages that relied increasingly on stock, options and other stock instruments in the name of more closely aligning a manager's interests with those of investors.
That worked fine while the economy was in overdrive. Big investors and critics grumbled about how huge pay packages had become, but their complaints carried little weight as stocks kept reaching new highs.
But when the Internet bubble popped last year and the economy then started running out of steam, companies did not seem willing to let the principle of pay for performance work in reverse. Boards scrambled to reprice options to mitigate the impact of sharply lower stock prices, and even executives who were blamed for major mistakes walked away with severance packages fit for royalty. Among them was Jill E. Barad at Mattel, who received roughly $50 million and other perks.
To be fair, some executives did take hits. A study released last spring by the William M. Mercer consulting firm showed that 13 percent of executives at 350 of the country's biggest companies received no bonus in 2000 and that 22 percent had their salaries cut, although by how much was unclear.
"There are now many more swings up and down in compensation," said Peter T. Chingos, head of Mercer's executive compensation consulting practice. "Those companies that continue to do well will pay well, and those that haven't will continue to see declines in pay."
But whether the cuts are real or just so much smoke and mirrors is a matter of debate. Compensation consultants say the question will not be answered until next spring, when most companies file their proxy statements.
"It is happening, but whether it's wholesale, I'm not sure," said Judith Fischer, head of Executive Compensation Advisory Services, a consulting firm. "Until companies start reporting their payouts in March, we won't know for sure if it was a movement that was universal or whether it is just industry-related."
Nonetheless, institutional investors and compensation consultants, as well as corporate boards, are watching the developments leading up to the proxy season with eagle eyes, because the outcome will perhaps settle, for now at least, the persistent question of whether the principle of pay for performance really works.
"I think you're going to find that this is a vindication of pay for performance," said Ira T. Kay, practice director for compensation consulting at Watson Wyatt Worldwide. "It isn't so much that the executives are being magnanimous or eleemosynary, it's that they're just getting ahead of what boards of directors would do anyway."
Or one-upping them. In Mr. Chambers's case, the board slashed his salary to $268,131 from $323,319, but he asked to take home only $1 until the company's performance turns around.
Then there is James L. Payne, the new chief executive at Nuevo Energy, an oil and gas company based in Houston. Mr. Payne stunned the compensation committee as a new recruit this fall when he asked to be paid entirely in company stock.
"Our jaws dropped when he came in and asked for that," said Prof. Charles Elson, head of the University of Delaware's Center for Corporate Governance and of Nuevo's compensation committee. 
Mr. Payne's situation was somewhat unusual -- he had headed the Santa Fe Snyder Corporation and received a nice severance package when it was sold to Devon Energy.
Nonetheless, his compensation package aligns his fate far more closely with that of Nuevo's shareholders than most executive compensation packages do.
At least a few boards seem determined to make pay for performance work in bad years as much as it did in good ones -- mostly, perhaps, when the pain is spread, not concentrated in the boardroom. Ford rescinded bonuses this year for some 6,000 senior managers who collectively received $442 million in bonuses last year. In explaining the move, the company cited the deteriorating economy, market conditions and the costs of replacing Firestone tires on its cars.
The board of Campbell Soup came up with a novel way of dealing with options that were under water, or worthless, that involved neither repricing them nor issuing a slug of new options at a lower strike price -- practices that incited cries of fury last year from shareholders at other companies.
In the fiscal year ended July 31, Campbell exchanged about 4.7 million options issued in 1997, 1998 and 1999 that were out of the money for a million restricted shares that vest over a period two to four years longer than the original options. In other words, executives who participated in the program will receive fewer shares and have to wait longer to get them.
Mr. Kay says he has attended board sessions at other companies where directors are playing hardball. "I've been in 10 board meetings over the last six months where clearly 70, 80, 90 percent of outstanding stock options were under water, and there was no intention to do anything about it," he said.
Cisco's board also eliminated cash bonuses for senior executives, as did the directors of Siebel Systems. Siebel also cut executive salaries by 20 percent and froze other salaries.
The Tribune Company plans to cut salaries for its top 140 executives 5 percent starting on Jan. 1, and they will get no bonuses this year. The company will also award merit-based raises for its other 18,000 nonunion employees in stock options, not cash.
Investors are continuing to be pushy, perhaps even pushier, although their activities are sometimes less than obvious. Earlier this month, Jeffrey Steiner, chief executive of the Fairchild Corporation, which makes nuts, bolts and other products used in airplane construction, was forced to defer part of his compensation after Mario J. Gabelli, head of Gabelli Asset Management, which controls about 11 percent of the stock, complained that Fairchild's pay packages did not match the company's performance. Mr. Steiner and four other Fairchild executives agreed to defer one-quarter of their cash compensation for the fiscal year ended in June. Mr. Gabelli did not return calls.
But some executives, perhaps aware of how they will look, are moving on their own, at least with cash. 
Last year, Carleton S. Fiorina, chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, gave up her contractual rights to a minimum guaranteed bonus of $1.25 million. Because the company failed to meet its profit targets for the year, Ms. Fiorina asked the board not to pay her the $625,000 bonus she was promised for the second half of the year.
She did, however, still take home $2.1 million in cash.
The other seven members of the executive committee did the same, giving up a total of roughly $1 million. "If you miss your numbers, there are going to be consequences -- and that means everyone," Ms. Fiorina told Business Week last December.
More recently, she said she would not take the $8 million bonus that would be hers if Hewlett-Packard's acquisition of Compaq Computer was completed. That pushed Michael D. Capellas, Compaq's chief executive, to say he would forgo the $14 million he would have received. 
The members of the executive committee at Bear Stearns voluntarily gave up 50 percent of their bonuses this year, about a 70 percent reduction from last year. That made Bear Stearns the first big Wall Street firm to share the pain among executives as well as the rank and file.
Mr. Cayne, the firm's chairman and chief executive, will thus take home cash compensation of about $15 million, down from $33 million last year.
Thomas M. Siebel, chairman and chief executive of Siebel Systems, voluntarily gave up his $1 million salary in July.
At Cisco Systems, Mr. Chambers did the same. According to a person familiar with his decision, he asked the board to use his salary to retain two employees whose jobs were at risk, instead.

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about trends in executive pay during a slowing economy misstated one change in the compensation packages of chief executives at 350 big companies last year. According to the William M. Mercer consulting firm, 22 percent received lower bonuses, not lower salaries.

HEADLINE: In a Recession 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "Economists Make It Official: U.S. Is in Recession" reads a Nov. 27 headline. This is no surprise to the women our foundation supports. 
The Sept. 11 attacks have taken a toll on the travel and hotel industries. Low-income women -- who often provide the only support for their families -- fill the majority of these jobs. 
 Congress is debating a stimulus plan that would accelerate tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. A more effective package would expand unemployment benefits for part-time workers, help states cover health care costs and provide tax rebates to low-wage workers who didn't receive them earlier this year. When legislators do what's fair for women and families, they do what's best for our economy.

HEADLINE: MEDIA; 
Asian English-Language Journals Are Reeling as Advertising Slumps

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
English-language journalism in Asia has taken a body blow in the last month, with the closing of one Hong Kong-based regional news magazine and a drastic retrenchment at another.
 AOL Time Warner said on Thursday that it would stop publishing Asiaweek, which it has owned since 1985, because of the collapse of the advertising market here. Most of its 85 employees will lose their jobs. 
 Dow Jones & Company, which publishes Far Eastern Economic Review, recently combined the editorial staffs of that magazine and The Asian Wall Street Journal -- a move that cut 36 jobs, most at the review. 
The cutbacks mean more than despondent people at the bar of Hong Kong's Foreign Correspondents' Club. They signal the waning of a tradition of lively, independent magazines that cover Asia with the familiarity of a native but the critical distance of an outsider.
"There's been a deterioration in the diversity of opinions, and analysis of political and business events, in the region," said Philip Bowring, a former editor of the review and a columnist for The International Herald Tribune, which is published by The New York Times and The Washington Post.
"People in Southeast Asian countries, which have large English-speaking populations, want alternative voices to their local media," Mr. Bowring said. "Often the local media is controlled by the government."
Mr. Bowring said both magazines had strayed from their original focus on regional politics to a heavy emphasis on business and technology. The new formats, he said, were ill-timed: most Asian economies are lagging and the dot-com crash was every bit as crushing here as in the United States.
Executives at AOL Time Warner and Dow Jones insist their decisions were based on economic, not editorial, considerations.
"We had a plan, and the plan was working up until the middle of this year," said Peter Brack, president of Asiaweek. "Then we got struck by lightning. Nobody could have predicted the severity of this downturn."
Dorinda Elliott, Asiaweek's editor, said subscribers and advertisers liked its focus on business. Time Inc., however, was not willing to endure years of losses while the magazine found its financial footing.
"Unfortunately, every time I found ways to cut some costs, the market dropped even further," Ms. Elliott said. "When the market collapses, it makes the road to profitability all that much longer."
Like Asiaweek, Far Eastern Economic Review is losing money. It, too, insists that its shift in editorial focus has been successful -- at least with readers. Circulation rose 2.8 percent in the first half of 2001, to 99,120 copies.
"There are no dot-coms to write about any more, but there are a lot of other areas of innovation," said Philip Revzin, the publisher of the review and The Asian Wall Street Journal. "There's nothing to be ashamed of in writing about gadgets. I like gadgets. We'll do more on them."
There has been no gloating at the review over Asiaweek's demise. The magazines are linked by history: Asiaweek was founded in 1975 by Michael O'Neill, a New Zealander, and T. J. S. George, an Indian, who had worked together at the review but had grown disenchanted with what they considered its ponderous style.
The review, founded in 1946, made its name with feisty, if occasionally long-winded, reporting. Soon after Dow Jones acquired majority control of the magazine in 1987, it was banned in Singapore for a few years when its coverage ran afoul of the city-state's leader, Lee Kuan Yew.
These days, the review's journalists are worried by the prospect of writing for both a weekly magazine and a daily paper. Reporters at The Asian Wall Street Journal said there had already been turf battles over where articles were published.
Mr. Revzin would not say how much combining the editorial staffs would save. But he said he hoped the layoffs would be the last. To critics who say Dow Jones is reducing its support of the review, Mr. Revzin said the revamping was a commitment to the magazine's future. "If we had wanted to shut it down, we would have shut it down," he said. "We're not shutting it down."
Some media critics noted that with the emergence of competent English-language newspapers in Bangkok; Jakarta, Indonesia; and other Asian cities, regional magazines were less important than during the heyday of the review.
Mr. Revzin, not surprisingly, disagrees. "Asia needs a newsmagazine," he said. "Regrettably, we're now alone in this niche. We obviously would welcome advertisers who don't have a place to go."

HEADLINE: BRIDGE; 
Turnout for the Fall Nationals Proves the Game's Popularity

BYLINE:  By Alan Truscott 

 BODY:
In spite of economic downturn and international crisis, the American Contract Bridge League's Fall Nationals, which ended Tuesday in Las Vegas, were the biggest in the event's 75-year year history. There were 16,818 tables in play in 10 days, indicating that bridge is flourishing in North America, as it is on other continents.
 The most interesting ending in the tournament occurred on the diagramed deal in the Reisinger Teams, reported by Barry Rigal. Bob Lipsitz, a former world champion, found himself in three no-trump after the auction shown. He had opened one diamond because he was playing a strong-club system. 
 He would have had an easy road to nine tricks if the diamond finesse had succeeded. He won the opening spade lead and tried the diamond finesse, leading the 10. East allowed this to win and took his king when South repeated the finesse.
The contract would have failed quickly if East had shifted to a low club, but he did not want to put all his eggs in that basket. He led the club ace, obviously from an ace-king combination, and West had a problem. Should he encourage a continuation? Playing more clubs rated to be fatal if South held four clubs since it would establish a winner.
So West discouraged in clubs, believing that South would be unable to make a ninth trick if East reverted to spades. This was wrong, but only just. East did shift back to spades, which was the only way to give South a chance. After winning with the spade king, the declarer took three of dummy's diamond winners, reaching this fascinating ending:
When the last diamond was led, East threw a club and South a spade. West reluctantly parted with a club, his only safe move. But South then led a club from the dummy and there was no defense. If East played the king, South's jack would be established. East therefore played low, and after taking two black-suit winners West had to lead from the heart king to give Lipsitz his game.
This play is known as a winkle. That is popular with bridge theorists and with vacationers on the beaches of England.

HEADLINE: Index Casts Doubt on Quick Recovery 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 1 

 BODY:
The Chicago purchasing managers index fell in November to its lowest level since July, pointing to more weakness in the manufacturing sector and casting doubt on an economic recovery any time soon. The index dropped to 41.1 from 46.2 in October, showing a contracting regional economy for the 14th consecutive month. 
 Economists had predicted that the index, which is compiled by the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago, would drop to 44.9. 
 An index below 50 signals that the manufacturing economy is contracting, while a reading above 50 suggests expansion. The association said all the component indicators of the index were below that level in November.
"It tells me things aren't getting better around here and that they're getting worse," said Paul Kasriel, director of economic research at the Northern Trust Company. "It's kind of discouraging news for those of us who are looking for recovery sooner rather than later."
Jennifer Rossum, an economic analyst at Thomson/IFR, said, "Nothing has really changed. Conditions are still weak in manufacturing. They're not really showing any signs of a bottom."
The employment component of the report fell to 37.2 from 42, while prices paid rose to 40.1 from 39.2, staying below the threshold of 50 for the fifth consecutive month, the association said.

HEADLINE: Turkey Reports Agreement on European Force 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
After months of negotiations led by American and British diplomats, Turkish government officials announced tonight that they had broken the deadlock in talks over the creation of a European security force. The issue has increasingly roiled this country's relationship with the European Union, an organization that Turkey wants to join. 
 Turkey has insisted on having a decision-making role in the proposed 60,000-member European Union security force, especially as it applies to the use of the resources of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; Turkey is a member of NATO and a candidate for membership in the European Union. Turkey's demands have been the chief stumbling block to the creation of the security force. 
 A statement from the office of Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said an agreement had been reached to allow cooperation between NATO and the European Union. Turkish government officials offered no other comment. But whatever the details of the agreement, it has yet to win the approval of the 15-member European Union. The organization is scheduled to meet later this month to begin setting up the security force, scheduled to be in place by 2003. 
"The three-party talks form a concrete basis that will provide an opportunity to take relations between the E.U. and NATO forward in every field," read the statement, issued today after the prime minister, his cabinet and senior military officials ended their meeting.
Turkey worries that the European Union, which includes its rival, Greece, would use the proposed force against its interests, namely, on the divided island of Cyprus in the Aegean Sea. Turkey has sought to participate in the decisions. For their part, the Europeans have rejected giving Turkey an automatic seat at the table. Rather, the European Union has said Turkey and other nonmember states would be consulted on a case-by-case basis.
Turkey's intransigence on the issue emerged in recent weeks as the chief symbol of tensions with the European Union. "It's a matter of extreme, extreme distrust," said Soli Ozel, a professor of international relations at Bilgi University here. "The British and the Americans have tried very hard to reach a compromise." 
British and American diplomats have held three meetings in Ankara in recent months to work out a solution, and the matter is expected to be on the agenda during Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's visit this week. The United States has a stake in this fight: it prefers that the would-be European force use NATO resources rather than create a separate military unit.
Turkey has already been assured that the European Union force will not intervene in the political disputes of NATO allies, like the Greek-Turkish standoff over Cyprus. 
The Dutch foreign minister, Jozias van Aartsen, and Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt of Belgium, who currently presides over the European Union, met senior Turkish officials last week to try to iron out a deal. 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 8, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article last Monday about Turkey's announcement of an agreement on the formation of a European Union security force misstated the location of Cyprus, whose partial occupation by Turkey since 1974 is a source of tension with Greece, a European Union member. It is in the Mediterranean, not the Aegean.

 BODY:
DEAR DIARY:
I live in Greenville, S.C., and a recent visit from a brother-in-law, who lives in New York, reminded me of a trip I made there several years ago. I had boarded a subway train bound for Times Square with my 9- and 10-year-old sons, who wanted to go to a 42nd Street arcade they had visited with their uncle the previous day. A man who overheard the conversation turned to me and said, "Honey, if you're trying to get to Times Square, you're going the wrong way." He told me to get off with him at the next stop.
 I thought I had followed his directions but found myself on a platform across the tracks from him. Seeing me, he yelled out, "No, honey, you need to be over here." He dashed back up and over to my side, grabbed my hand and got us on the correct uptown train. He then turned to me and in his best New Yorker tone, said: "Now, honey, I can't follow you around New York all day to make sure you don't get lost. I've got to get to work." I can't wait to come back and visit the best city in the world! Tracy Ann Gange 

Dear Diary:
I called the New York office of an insurance company to discuss a notice sent to me regarding a paid-up policy. I dialed the 800 number, received the menu, punched in the number and, lo and behold, the human voice of a young man came on the line. I gave him the information requested and then asked him to look at the screen and tell me if he was alive when I bought the policy. After a pause, he replied: "No sir, I was not, and my mother wasn't, either. I thought you would want to know that." I laughed so hard I forgot why I had called. Paul Sukernek
 Bryan Miller was in California recently and had the following exchange when he was walking in Pasadena. With no traffic in sight, he crossed the road in the middle of a block. A police car pulled up and an officer got out.
Officer: "Sir, do you know what you just did?"
Mr. Miller: "I crossed the road."
Officer: "That's jaywalking."
Mr. Miller: "Yes, but I'm from New York, where jaywalking is mandatory."
Officer: "Really."
Mr. Miller: "If you don't do it, you can get a summons."
Officer: "Do you have proof that you're from New York?"
New York State driver's license is handed over.
Officer: "O.K. then, but next time use the crosswalk."
 Their Bloomingdale's charge cards were old and worn and it was difficult to read the imprinted names, so Terry Bovin asked the customer service department to issue new ones for her and her husband. A week later an envelope arrived, correctly addressed to her husband. Inside was only one card. The account number was correct, but her imprinted name was now "Mrs. Spouse." There was no card for Mr. Spouse.

Dear Diary:
I recently took my son to the Central Park Zoo, where there was an outdoor puppet show about the delicacy of our global environment and the importance of each animal species. The narrator, seeking, via the imagination, to transport the young audience to a faraway forest, asked if anyone knew any magic words. One child promptly volunteered, "Abracadabra." A second child called out, "Hocus-pocus." But a small voice from a young girl clearly carried the day. "The magic word is 'please,' " she said. Lon Singer

MY COMPUTER
 As I sit here weak and weary
at the end of a long, long day
I gaze upon my home computer
wondering has it sex or neuter 
to indicate what I should say.
For as I watch it lock me out
I just don't know what it's about.
What must I do without delay?
I could hit it, there's no doubt
or I could scream and rant and shout.
Or should I kneel to it and pray?
This beast has taken o'er my life
I spend more time than with my wife
but still I know not of its way.
But after all is said and done
it's clear that I am still the one
that has the final word and say.
For when the thing gets really bad
and I am getting more than mad
I throw the switch and it goes away. Richard L. Coren
 Phyllis Melhado and a friend were making their way through a crush of weekend moviegoers at a West Side theater when they were approached by a woman with her hands in the air, shiny red nails and generous size diamond ring flashing brightly. "Would you mind getting my ticket?" she asked, gesturing to a pocket of her coat where her money was. "I've just had a manicure and I don't want to ruin my nails."
 Sue Tarlton is unemployed and, as she says, "trying to network anywhere to get a job -- even on the subway." On Thanksgiving morning, she struck up a conversation with a man carrying a box and a bag marked "White Castle." He was, he said, on his way home to use 30 White Castle hamburgers as stuffing for his turkey -- to be enhanced with chicken broth, chopped celery, sage and rosemary. Ms. Tarlton had a thought: "Maybe next year I can premake the stuffing and sell it on the subway," she said.
 Monica Sands was on a bus when two strangers, a young man and a woman, started chatting with each other. In the course of the conversation, the young man mentioned he was a film student. "So you're going to be a world famous director?" she said. The young man had no illusions. "I'll probably be a waiter," he said.

HEADLINE: Rejecting 10% Raise, Pratt Workers Vote to Strike 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
Rejecting a contract offer that would have provided 10 percent pay raises over three years, unionized machinists at Pratt & Whitney voted today to go on strike.
 More than 4,000 of the 5,100 eligible union members showed up for the vote. Nearly 70 percent voted to strike, clearing the two-thirds majority needed to do so, said James M. Parent, a spokesman for the union, District 91 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. 
 "We're prepared to continue this process, whatever it takes to come up with a satisfactory contract," Mr. Parent said. He said the major issue was job security. 
Mark Sullivan, a spokesman for Pratt, said company officials made the best offer they could on Saturday, the last day of the talks.
"Obviously we're extremely disappointed," Mr. Sullivan said. "We made what we believe was an extremely generous offer, in light of the tough economic times today. Certainly a long strike would be damaging to our company and our employees."
The walkout, scheduled to begin after midnight, would be the first at Pratt, a maker of jet engines, since 1985. No new contract talks were scheduled.
Mr. Sullivan said Pratt planned to open for business Monday morning with nearly 2,000 managers and salaried employees reassigned to union workers' jobs.
"We will meet the requirements of our customers," Mr. Sullivan said. 
The proposed contract included a 10-percent wage increase over three years and a $1,000 bonus per worker if the pact was ratified. The offer would have raised the average wage to $25.88 from $23.27 an hour by the end of the contract.
Union members said they were most concerned with job security and wanted assurances from the company that it would not move any more jobs out of Connecticut. They also were seeking language limiting the subcontracting of work. Workers said Pratt has not been filling many jobs when workers have retired, deciding instead to hire contractors.

HEADLINE: Shah's Son Enlists Exiles in U.S. in Push to Change Iran 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
This year, Reza Pahlavi, the son of the former shah of Iran, seized what seemed a propitious moment to start campaigning to replace the ayatollahs in Tehran with a democratic government.
 From his base near Washington, Mr. Pahlavi has been denouncing the Islamic fundamentalists, a message that has gained a new urgency since Sept. 11. 
 But on a recent morning in a television studio here, Mr. Pahlavi, the American-educated heir to the deposed monarchy, made clear why Southern California, even more than Washington, was playing a central role in this tricky mission. 
Seated at a gilded table, Mr. Pahlavi was fielding telephone calls from Iran and offering passionate appeals for change as the guest on a live Farsi television program beamed into Iran daily. It is one of several such programs sent to Iran from what has grown into a lively cluster of Farsi television and radio networks that operate from the influential Iranian population in metropolitan Los Angeles. 
"This community does play an absolutely critical role in disseminating information and financing the media needed to let people in Iran know what the alternatives are," Mr. Pahlavi said in an interview. "This is a very affluent community, with all sorts of mechanisms it can command."
The Iranian population's influence is a product of numbers and enormous wealth. In the American Community Survey conducted by the Census Bureau last year, it was estimated that as many as 180,680 people who are principally of Iranian descent live in California, and are concentrated in the southern part of the state. Of those, as many as 95,400 live in Los Angeles County.
Most of those people arrived around the time of the Islamic revolution in 1979, vowing to return someday. It is a tight-knit, insular community.
Iranians, who entered just about every profession, dominate large pockets of two areas, Beverly Hills and the Westwood district. Many streets in those sections are lined with houses with oversize white columns, a signature of the Iranian well-to-do.
Also here are two daily Farsi newspapers, several magazines, three television networks, two radio stations, pop singers, other artists and many Iranian clubs, including all-Iranian Rotary clubs.
Despite the population's size and wealth, few Iranians have run for local office or played an active role in civic affairs, in part, several people said, because this was supposed to be a way station.
But Mr. Pahlavi's campaign and the ferment in Iran -- where open, if tentative, protests against the militant government have grown more common -- underscore the ambiguous role that Iranians here may play in political changes in Iran.
One of the few factors that unite Iranians here is the desire to oust the clerics and open the door to democracy, as suggested by the eager participation of many people at the events that Mr. Pahlavi attends.
But even ardent supporters of change, and of Mr. Pahlavi, say they hope to encourage reforms in Iran while remaining here.
Haleh Eghrari is a psychologist here who said that as a woman and a member of the Bahai religious minority she enjoyed opportunities that she would never experience in Iran, even under a democratic government.
"What this immigration has done for women is incredible," Ms. Eghrari said. "Women who were doormats are now really, really advancing. They have the jobs. Many support their families. How many would give all that up?
"I'd be very curious if there was a revolution. I'd go for a visit. But I've become accustomed to life here."
Ayhe Kazerouni, a senior at the University of California at Irvine and a founder of the local chapter of Students for Democracy in Iran, has worked to energize opposition to the government, but the ardor of many students is limited.
"If things do change, I'm not staying here," Ms. Kazerouni said. "But I think most students would. They were born here, and this is where they feel they have business opportunities."
Behrooz Movahedi, 29, a graduate student at the University of Southern California, where he is president of the Persian Student Society, put it in terms of a generation gap.
"The older generation is always homesick," Mr. Movahedi said. "But for the younger people, their base is the United States now. The older Iranians here are a little bit frozen back in the 1970's."
Pari Abasalti, the editor of a popular biweekly magazine here, Rah-e-Zendegi, and a former member of the Iranian Parliament under the shah, had a similar view.
"If there was real democracy and real justice, the children would stay and we would probably go," Mr. Abasalti said. "The older generation has very different feelings. The younger generation are all established here."
Young people and elders agree that if Mr. Pahlavi's goal of holding a referendum in Iran is realized, Iranians here will pour millions of dollars into encouraging democracy.
Mr. Pahlavi's campaign has crossed at least some of the divisions among Iranians here, even for those who remember the corruption and abuses of power under the shah. The old royalists have offered their support.
But because Mr. Pahlavi was educated here, he has embraced Western political philosophy and expresses ideals of creating economic opportunity and personal freedom under a secular government, just the sort of goals that some Iranians would be reluctant to give up here.
Cyrus Sanati, founder of a chapter of Students for Democracy in Iran at the University of California at Los Angeles, said, "Realistically, if democracy came to Iran, yes, a lot of young people I know would go there -- but to buy businesses or buy property."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: BAGRAM; 
Securing Base, U.S. Makes Its Brawn Blend In

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: BAGRAM, Afghanistan, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
Dressed in Afghan clothing and sporting scruffy beards, American soldiers here do their best to blend in when they move in and out of the Afghan capital, Kabul.
 The soldiers come from the United States Army's 96th Civil Affairs Battalion, which is based in Fort Bragg, N.C. But their home these days is an abandoned aircraft hangar at a former Soviet base here, 20 miles north of Kabul. 
 The sprawling Bagram air base has been a crucial prize throughout Afghanistan's wars. Today, it is the only functioning airport in the country and a base for allied troops. The forces include not only the soldiers from the 96th battalion, whose mission is to help provide relief supplies, but also 100 Army soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division and an unspecified number of British and American Special Operations forces. 
Framed by jagged mountains, Bagram was built by the Soviet military during its 10-year occupation of Afghanistan. After the Soviets left, the Taliban and the Northern Alliance took up positions on opposite ends of the base and fought a deadly war of attrition. The alliance's fighters were eventually driven north but had their revenge last month when they swooped through Bagram on their way to Kabul. 
The trenches used by the Taliban and the Arabs who fought alongside them are still plainly visible among the wreckage of Soviet aircraft, unexploded bombs and mines that still mar the base.
The road between Bagram and Kabul, a winding, pockmarked route, also shows the scars of the war. Villages on each side have been razed, walls have been toppled and even trees uprooted as part of the Taliban's scorched-earth campaign against settlements that gave their allegiance to the Northern Alliance, dominated by ethnic Tajiks and Uzbeks.
Today, Bagram is under the command of Gen. Babajan, who was an Afghan official in the Soviet-backed government of Muhammad Najibullah and who later became a Northern Alliance commander. Security at the front gate is handled by the Northern Alliance, but soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division, weapons at the ready, control a checkpoint 100 yards up the road. 
With marauders preying on the roads and pockets of Taliban and Arab fighters in the country, Bagram is the only secure gateway to the capital. Kabul has a civilian airport -- Kabul International -- but it was attacked by American bombs, and combat engineers have yet to remove a large unexploded bomb and repair its runway.
The Russians use Bagram to bring in their relief supplies and diplomats. So does the United Nations. Western officials say the airfield will became a major conduit for assistance as well as a boon to the economy, as Afghan citizens are hired to refurbish the airfield, fix up its control tower and repair damaged buildings. 
But the military forces within the well-guarded installation are the main actors now. General Babajan said the American troops started arriving about three weeks ago. He said the Americans handle the air-traffic control at the base and have their own security. The soldiers from the Army's 10th Mountain Division were flown from Uzbekistan, where about 1,000 of the division's soldiers have been protecting a base for Special Operations forces.
Though soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division guard the base now, they are prepared for other missions. Schooled in winter warfare, the troops are trained for a variety of combat missions and are ready to deploy anywhere in the world on 96 hours notice. 
"We are not force protection," said a company commander from the 10th Mountain Division, an Army captain who gave his name only as Chris. "We are here on the mission the commander in chief gave us to eradicate terrorism and are here to facilitate that."
The soldiers only recently began to receive hot food, and they live in windowless concrete buildings. Because of the scare over anthrax, mail is also slow in coming, said a 21-year-old Army private from New York City who identified himself as Barkim. He said he had not received any mail in weeks. The soldiers avoid wearing their floppy hats because they are similar to some of the headgear used by the Soviets during the invasion of Afghanistan and that is an association the Army wants to avoid. 
In addition to the 10th Mountain, an unspecified number of American and British Special Operations forces are believed to be based here. About 160 of Britain's Special Boat Service and American Special Operations commandos swooped into the base in mid-November. 
Bagram could become a crucial hub for Special Operations missions, troop reinforcements or even an international peacekeeping mission. Much will depend on who wins the American-British debate over an international peacekeeping mission.
The United States Central Command has put the deployment of international peacekeepers on hold, seeking to keep the focus on the military operation in the south. But the British have contended that there is no contradiction between securing the peace in the north while fighting is going on in the south. The conference of Afghan factions may yet agree on a role for a multinational peacekeeping force in Kabul, a development that the Central Command would be hard put to resist.
Six soldiers from the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion are stationed here, too. They have set up shop in an old aircraft hangar, which was a wreck when they arrived. All the wood and wire had been stripped from the hangar and it contained four old Soviet MIG's, which they have dragged out.
Their task is to provide storage for relief aid from nongovernmental organizations and to make sure it is trucked to the city by Afghan contractors and properly distributed if needed. "We are using this facility as a collection point for humanitarian assistance from whomever is willing to give it," said a captain in the unit, who identified himself as Wes. 
When they travel to the capital, the soldiers wear Afghan clothing. They don a pakol, an Afghan hat, and a patu, an Afghan scarf. They also wear vests and wool sweaters that are commonly seen on the streets of Kabul.
"It helps to blend in so that you don't attract a lot of attention," said John, a 31 year-old captain from Auburn, N.Y. "The vest has lots of pockets and the nice wool sweaters are pretty warm. It did not cost a lot, maybe $30 or $40."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 10, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article last Monday about United States troops in Afghanistan misstated the age of the Bagram air base, near Kabul, which is being used by allied forces. It was built with Soviet aid in the 1950's, not during the 1979-89 Soviet occupation.

HEADLINE: Bare Bones in Albany 

 BODY:
Gov. George Pataki and members of the Legislature, who should be working on a plan to respond to the economic downturn, are instead squabbling over who is to blame for state spending that went up this year at twice the inflation rate. 
Regular citizens may be curious about who the culprit is, too. The $84.3 billion budget for the current year was labeled "bare bones" by legislative leaders, who passed it as a stopgap measure last summer. Both the governor and the lawmakers seemed to feel that it was austere to the point of irresponsibility.
 It turns out that the budget included modest spending increases for health, education and other services, causing expenditures to rise by more than 5.5 percent. The fact that the budget seemed "bare bones," particularly to school districts that had been hoping for more aid, is an indication of how difficult it will be to balance the budget next year. 
 Conservative critics of state spending are saying that the fact that there was actually flesh on those bare bones all along proves that the state government's budget-making process is out of control. There should be far more transparency in the system. But Governor Pataki and the Legislature have been trying to make tough, responsible decisions in the face of a looming tidal wave of red ink.
Despite proposed cutbacks and savings, Mr. Pataki faces what could be a $9 billion deficit next year. If Albany is lucky, Congress will allocate extra revenue-sharing funds next year to help New York and other states deal with their post-Sept. 11 deficits. Otherwise, New Yorkers are in for choices that will be tougher than ever.

HEADLINE: Lure Tourists Back To a Wounded City 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Bob Herbert ("The Tourism Crisis," column, Nov. 29) says, "When you think of tourism, think jobs, jobs, jobs." 
 One way to bring back jobs to the devastated economy of New York would be to introduce casino gambling to Lower Manhattan. It is a labor-intensive industry with many support services required -- hotels, restaurants and so on. It can be started up quickly in space previously occupied by the financial industry. And it will draw day-trippers as well as high rollers. 
 Dare I also suggest that it has something in common with the financial industry's culture?

Religion Museum in Taiwan Promotes Tolerance

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: YONGHE, Taiwan 

 BODY:
Hsin Tao does not want to read too much into it. But the opening date of his museum -- Nov. 9, or 11/9 -- was the reverse of 9/11, the date of the attacks on the United States.
 "We didn't choose that day deliberately; it was a coincidence," said Hsin Tao, a soft-spoken Buddhist monk with a diamond-hard will. "But I do believe it means that we have a mission." 
 Hsin Tao founded the Museum of World Religions, which seeks to promote understanding and tolerance among the world's major religions. These qualities, the Buddhist master says, have been in tragically short supply since the attacks on the United States in the name of a holy war.
"Every religion has its problems," he said. "The message we want to deliver is that religion is about love, devotion and service. As a religious person, I want to see people treat each other with love."
It is hard to imagine a better time for the opening of a museum dedicated to tearing down barriers between faiths. The question is how many visitors will find their way to this suburb of Taipei, where the museum is housed in a blocklong building above a Sogo department store.
The prosaic location makes the museum's interior all the more revelatory. Conceived by Ralph Appelbaum, the New York designer who planned the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, the museum is a cavernous, soothing space that mixes cutting-edge technology with ancient religious relics.
Mr. Appelbaum said he used the metaphor of life's journey to lay out the exhibits and attractions, many of which are interactive.
"We wanted to bring the great collections together in one place that would create an aesthetic sense of awe," Mr. Appelbaum said by telephone from his office in New York City. 
"The dharma master's notion was that the museum should correct misperceptions and elicit critical thinking," he said, referring to Hsin Tao.
Such ambitions do not come cheap. The project cost $66 million, the bulk of which Hsin Tao said he collected over a decade through monthly donations from his 100,000 followers. He also built the Ling-Jiou monastery, a spectacular retreat on the craggy coastline in northeast Taiwan.
The confluence of traditional Chinese beliefs and economic prosperity in Taiwan has given rise to several wealthy Buddhist organizations. Some build lavish temples or hospitals. Others provide disaster relief.
Mr. Appelbaum said it was highly unusual for a Buddhist monk to undertake a project like this.
"He literally showed up at our doorstep in SoHo with some of his followers," Mr. Appelbaum said. "It took a lot of visits to the monastery to see what their intentions were. We decided they were noble."
At Mr. Appelbaum's urging, Hsin Tao recruited scholars from the Center for the Study of World Religions at Harvard Divinity School to design the exhibits and ensure that the museum's academic foundations were sound.
Such sophistication might seem improbable in a Buddhist monk. But Hsin Tao, 53, travels widely, scouting museums, meeting fellow religious leaders and cultivating ties with influential people.
Hsin Tao's worldliness is not without its detractors. While his lifestyle and fund-raising techniques had not been questioned during the building of the museum, a local magazine recently reported that Hsin Tao had an intimate relationship with the wife of one of the museum's donors.
The donor, Shieh Chen-da, demanded that the museum return his $441,000 gift, which it did, according to Next magazine, which specializes in exposes and gossip. Hsin Tao denied the allegation in an interview with the magazine and said that Mr. Shieh wanted to control the finances of the museum.
Although the museum was built without state funds, President Chen Shui-bian turned up for its inauguration, which coincided with an international conference on the preservation of religious sites.
In most ways, Taiwan has been exceedingly good to Hsin Tao. Born in Burma, now Myanmar, to ethnic Chinese parents, he was orphaned at age 4. By age 10, he was recruited into a guerrilla force. He made his way to Taiwan in 1960, following the retreating Chinese Nationalist army, after its ill-fated invasion of Burma.
Hsin Tao traded his rifle for a monk's robes, and spent much of the next two decades in meditation. He emerged in 1983 to found a Zen Buddhist movement built on the principles of teaching and tolerance.
"As a soldier, I saw a lot of killing and violence," he said. "Ethnic and religious conflicts seem to go hand in hand. I wanted to convert these conflicts into something positive."
Hsin Tao does not want to be drawn into a discussion of the religious roots of the September attacks or the war in Afghanistan. There is little mention of war -- holy or otherwise -- in the exhibits.
"As for what Islam has been teaching its people, that's the kind of thing they have to reflect on themselves," Hsin Tao said. "It's not for us to tell them what their problems are."
The museum, he said, is designed to give people a place to explore the common traits in religions. Leaders of several faiths donated relics, creating a collection of about 5,000 artifacts.
Ecumenism extends only so far, however. A museum employee said one of the donors requested that the exhibit devoted to Islam not include Sufi relics. Sufi sects, which emphasize mysticism and personal spirituality over political or social activities, are opposed by more legalistic Wahhabi Muslims. 
Still, the overall effect of the museum is powerful. "Many nations would envy a museum like this, but they don't have the conditions that we do," he said.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE INTERESTS; 
Since Sept. 11, Lobbyists Put Old Pleas in New Packages

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
The war against terrorism has created some novel pitches from Washington lobbyists, now swarming over the capital as Congress tries to wrap up its business for the year. 
 The American Traffic Safety Services Association, whose members make traffic signs, is arguing that more federal money is needed for road signs to prevent traffic jams after terror attacks. California date growers have petitioned the White House and the Pentagon to buy dates for food packages being dropped in Afghanistan. They would be a treat for the Afghans during Ramadan, the growers maintain. 
 Since Sept. 11, many other business lobbyists have taken old pleas for federal help and turned them into new arguments for spending to combat terrorism. Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, is amused by the efforts to profit from patriotism. 
"No self-respecting lobbyist," he said, has not "repackaged his position as a patriotic response to the tragedy."
This, he said, is what he is hearing:
"The challenge is terrorism. The answer is re-establish telecommunications monopolies.
"The challenge is terrorism. The answer is to drill for oil in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge.
"The challenge is terrorism. The answer is a $15 billion retroactive tax break to scores of corporations."
The minute he arrived at work on the morning of Sept. 12, a top aide to a Democratic senator recalled, he received a call from a lobbyist for the airline industry pushing for a repeal of the federal tax on jet fuel to help the industry in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks.
Over the next few days, the aide said, reading from his desk calendar and telephone logs, he heard from representatives of the travel, insurance, telecommunications and software industries, from lobbyists for farmers, pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers, and from several military contractors.
None of them asked for anything different from what they had sought from Congress before, the aide said, but all had new pitches presenting their cases as responses to the attacks.
Until Sept. 11, money was scarce. President Bush and Congress had said they would save the surplus in the Social Security accounts. But now, fiscal discipline has been played down, budget deficits are the order of the day and companies, unions and the range of interest groups want a slice of a vast new stimulus-military-bioterrorism-homeland defense pie.
The idea of making money from the attacks sounds so crass that few lobbyists are willing to talk about it openly. But James Albertine, a lobbyist who represents companies, trade associations and nonprofit organizations, was remarkably frank. "What happened was a tragedy, certainly, but there are opportunities," Mr. Albertine said. "We're in business. This is not a charity."
Paul C. Light, director of government studies at the Brookings Institution, put it directly. "This is the best of times for lobbyists," Mr. Light said. "All of a sudden, they are in a position where they can sell their clients on the possibility of success."
Some of the lobbyists have such clear cases that their clients were damaged by the terrorism and need immediate relief that the government has already come through or seems very likely to. The $15 billion package of aid and loan guarantees for the airline industry, enacted in September, is an example, although some critics have assailed its size. 
Insurance companies, which were busily lobbying in the House last week, can expect some form of federal protection against large losses from future terrorist attacks, although it remains unclear what form the aid will take. New York City has a strong claim for federal assistance to rebuild the devastated area, though the amount of money that will be available is a matter of considerable dispute.
As for economic stimulus, the Republican package the House of Representatives approved in October was made up principally of corporate tax breaks: larger write-offs for investments in plants and equipment, retroactive repeal of the alternative minimum tax, tax savings for financial services companies with operations abroad and a lower capital gains tax.
Michael Baroody, chief lobbyist for the National Association of Manufacturers, made this argument for how cutting corporate taxes would help revive the economy: "Companies are either going to invest the extra money in equipment, or they're going to invest it in jobs."
But even Mr. Baroody, who put together a coalition of corporate lobbyists to press for prospective repeal of the minimum tax -- a measure enacted in 1986 to make sure profitable companies could not escape income taxes -- did not defend the House plan for repealing it retroactively. That plan, denounced by Democrats, would result in hundreds of millions of dollars in tax refunds to corporations, including International Business Machines, General Motors and General Electric.
Here are some other commercial interests that have adjusted their pitches in response to the attacks:
*The travel industry is seeking a temporary $1,000 tax credit per family to help offset vacation expenses.
*Boeing, with the Marine Corps, is pressing Congress and the Pentagon to revive the V-22 Osprey, an experimental aircraft that has been grounded because of fatal crashes.
*Verizon Communications wants to lift federal rules that give smaller competitors access to its network. The company argues that its success in restoring telephone service to Lower Manhattan demonstrates the importance to the nation of large telecommunications companies.
*Farm lobbyists are portraying a subsidy bill as a safety net for farmers in the recession and a bulwark against disruptions in food supplies in war time. Once called the Agriculture Act of 2001, it has been renamed the Farm Security Act of 2001.
Many, maybe most, of these proposals will never become law or public policy. But that is not so important to lobbyists, said Charles Peters, the founding editor of The Washington Monthly magazine and a cryptographer of the codes of Washington. "I can hear them saying, 'Oh, God, we fought hard on this amendment,' " Mr. Peters said. " 'We got it through the House. That's worth another $2 million in billing.' "
When the Senate took up a bill to extend the moratorium on sales taxes on purchases over the Internet, both sides tried to take advantage of how times had changed. Those who wanted to end the moratorium said states needed the sales tax revenue because of their new expenses for homeland security. And those who wanted to continue the moratorium said taxes would further depress sales that have dropped since Sept. 11.

HEADLINE: Argentina Limits Withdrawals as Banks Near Collapse 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
The government has limited cash withdrawals from banks and taken a step toward adopting the dollar as Argentina's currency, as part of a desperate effort to avert a run on banks and a chaotic devaluation. 
 The measures, announced late Saturday, were another sign that Argentina is on the brink of a default on its $132 billion in public sector debt. It has already cut the interest payments it makes on $45 billion in bonds in recent days. 
 Economists said the government was scrambling to save a banking system that was once a free market model for Latin America. On Friday, depositors made frantic bank withdrawals. 
A collapse of the Argentine economy, South America's second largest, could send shock waves through neighboring economies, particularly Brazil's, which, like Argentina, is burdened by a huge foreign debt.
President Fernando de la Rua ordered that bank account withdrawals could not exceed $250 a week for the next 90 days. For needs beyond that, payments can be made by check or credit card.
He also limited transfers abroad in a decree he signed without consulting Congress.
"Argentina has been subjected to speculative attacks by people who seek to benefit from a devaluation of our currency," said Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo. "These measures will serve to preserve the savings of Argentines."
Argentines responded in a panic, rushing to cash machines before the machines ran out of money. Opposition politicians attacked the moves as an authoritarian act by a tottering government that may be planning to confiscate accounts to pay its bills.
Mr. De la Rua's decree stopped short of ordering the conversion of peso accounts into dollars, reversing earlier statements by senior officials. Mr. De la Rua said depositors could freely convert their peso accounts to dollar accounts, and mandated that high interest rates awarded to those who save in pesos be reduced to the lower levels paid to people who save in dollars.
Senior officials said the measures were intended to save a decade-old policy of pegging the value of the peso to the dollar and to avert a devaluation. But economists noted that depositors now have every reason to trade their peso savings into dollars, in what is most likely the first step toward dropping the peso as the currency altogether in favor of the dollar.
Panama and Ecuador already use the dollar as their currencies, and El Salvador and Guatemala make it easy for people to spend dollars sent by relatives living in the United States. 
But the adoption of the dollar by Argentina, with its 36 million people and sizable economy, would have widespread implications, perhaps even presaging the eventual acceptance of the dollar by the entire region as a common currency in the decades to come, much as Europe has accepted the euro. 
The government was forced to act when rumors spiraled late last week that the government was about to freeze bank accounts and devalue the peso. Some lending rates among banks soared to as high as 900 percent on Friday.
The rumors were incited by what appeared to be the disappointing results of a visit by an International Monetary Fund team considering whether Argentina deserves a $1.3 billion payment this month, after the government failed to rein in its deficit to the fund's targeted level.
As it appeared increasingly likely that the fund would withhold the money for at least a month, economists worried that the government would not be able to meet its foreign debt obligations.
In recent weeks, the government has been working to persuade lenders to swap upward of $95 billion in bonds for new ones that pay far lower interest rates. Several credit agencies in the United States have assailed the plan, saying it is tantamount to the largest default of any country in history.
Compounding the government's problems was a stunning defeat on Thursday that appeared to signal that the opposition Justicialist Party was abandoning its policy of helping the government through the crisis.
The newly elected Senate appointed Senator Ramon Puerta, a Justicialist, as president of the chamber, in effect making him the country's vice president. Vice President Carlos Alvarez resigned last year in protest over the handling of a bribery scandal.
As the new second official in the line of succession, Mr. Puerta will be acting president and have the power of executive decree when Mr. De la Rua is abroad.
In the previous Congress, the Senate president was a member of Mr. De la Rua's Alianza coalition. But Alianza fared poorly in the October congressional elections, and the Justicialists gained control of both chambers of Congress.
Mr. Puerta's selection was bitterly opposed by the government as a virtual coup attempt by a party that has been known for hardball politics since it was founded by Gen. Juan Domingo Peron in the 1940's.
The Justicialists appear divided about how hard they want to push the government. But Mr. De la Rua's critics say he has consistently shown an inability to lead, and his cabinet appears to be in a constant state of division and disarray, leading to concerns that the president will not be able to complete the final two years of his term.
Many political analysts believe that his resignation is likely if there is a cessation of debt payments, which would make Senator Puerta interim president until new elections are held.
In the short term, the limitation on bank withdrawals could slow spending at a time when the economy is already shrinking fast. Now in its fourth year of recession, the economy has suffered sharp declines in industrial production, consumption and tax receipts in the last four months.
As a stimulus for consumption, Mr. De la Rua's decree allows people to spend whatever they like using their credit and debit cards.
Consumers will pay much-reduced sales taxes when they use debit cards, an added incentive to purchase goods in a way that will create tax revenue for the government. Argentines are accustomed to buying mostly in cash in large part to evade paying taxes.
Consumers will also will be able to write checks to purchase items, but whoever cashes that check will then be limited in withdrawing $250 a week from their account on that money.
"The probability that people will not see their deposits again is very high," said Jose Luis Espert, a noted economist. "Without doubt, the economic implosion will now accelerate."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; 
Forecasters Predict Drop in Ad Spending

BYLINE:  By Constance L. Hays 

 BODY:
Two forecasters are predicting declines in advertising spending, though they say signs of a recovery are becoming visible.
 "After three big downgrades in a year" of estimates for ad spending in 2001, "our forecasts have stopped growing gloomier," said John Perriss, chief executive at the Zenith Optimedia Group in London, a media services agency owned by the Publicis Groupe and the Cordiant Communications Group. 
 He predicts a slowdown in the rate of decline, then a resumption of growth, as American ad spending falls 1.5 percent in 2002 from 2001 after falling 6 percent in 2001 from 2000. It starts to rise, he says, in 2003, by 1.6 percent from 2002.
"The terrorist attacks briefly disrupted but did not derail the advertising business," Mr. Perriss said. He is to discuss his forecast in detail this morning at the opening session of the UBS Warburg Media Conference in New York.
The other forecaster is Miles E. Groves, chief economist at the Barry Group in Bethesda, Md., who is predicting that newspaper ad spending will decline 7.7 percent in 2001 from 2000, then increase 2.3 percent in 2002 from 2001.
"Barring any further terrorist attacks, consumers should lead us out of this recession early in the first half of next year," Mr. Groves said, "with business investment doing its share by the second half."
He also estimates a possible increase in newspaper ad spending of more than 5 percent in 2003 compared with 2002.

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
In an era of tighter security, how much cyberfreedom are we willing to surrender?

BYLINE:  By Matt Richtel 

 BODY:
IN the debate about new surveillance powers for law enforcement officials, Americans, in various ways, are asking a basic question: Are we willing to curtail personal freedom in exchange for greater national security?
 Now, a debate heating up in Washington puts a twist on the query: Are we willing to curtail access to information in exchange for cybersecurity? 
 The cyberdebate involves legislation intended to assure private companies that if they share information with the government about their experiences with hackers and other types of cyberattacks, the information will be protected from public disclosure.
The idea is that such assurances will prompt companies to divulge data that could help in building a national defense for the Internet -- without having to worry about alarming the companies' customers, inciting their shareholders or opening themselves up to copycat hackers. 
"No company is going to voluntarily provide information in a forum where competitors, critics and attackers can get hold of it," said Senator Bob Bennett, a Utah Republican who is a sponsor of the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2001.
Senator Bennett added that trying to devise Internet defenses without candid information from private industry would be like "trying to run a battle, when 85 percent of the battlefield is blind to you."
But opponents say the legislation is unnecessary because other laws already protect sensitive information against public disclosure.
The opponents also say the proposed law could block average Americans' access to information crucial to assessing public policy. 
At least one issue does not appear to be in dispute. When it comes to defending the Internet, the private sector is a critical part of the equation. About 90 percent of the technical underpinnings -- whether telephone networks, Internet backbones or antivirus technology -- is privately owned and operated. 
There is much less agreement, though, about how vulnerable the Internet actually is.
Given the decentralized nature of the Internet, some experts say there is little chance of the cyberspace equivalent of the Sept. 11 attacks. But Richard Clarke, who is leading the Bush administration's efforts to create a cyberdefense, has been among those warning that the potential threats are as broad as the imagination and could lead to calamities like the disruption of energy grids.
Among the solutions Mr. Clarke advocates is greater reliance on organizations called Information Sharing and Analysis Centers, known in the trade as ISAC's.
These groups are organized under specific industries -- there is already one for financial institutions, for instance, and one for high-technology companies -- and collect data on cybervulnerabilities from their members, then share the information with other members. Companies can warn one another about a new computer virus, for example, and suggest antidotes.
The government now wants to have access to such information-swapping, so it can better understand patterns of attack and help bolster defenses. Mr. Clarke, along with individual companies and ISAC organizers, say some corporations have been unwilling to share information with the government for fear that competitors or shareholders or other groups could learn potentially compromising information under the Freedom of Information Act. 
Two bills, Mr. Bennett's in the Senate and a similar measure in the House, would make corporate information about cybervulnerabilities exempt from public disclosure.
The Senate bill, for instance, asks for an exemption from the Freedom of Information Act for information pertaining to so-called critical infrastructure, which is defined broadly as "physical and cyberbased systems and services essential to the national defense, government or economy of the United States."
The definition includes, but is not limited to, the telecommunications, electrical power, oil and gas, banking and transportation industries.
One supporter is Mark Rasch, a vice president at cyberLaw for Predictive Systems, a computer security company that oversees ISAC for the financial services industry. Mr. Rasch estimated that the bill might encourage 10 to 15 percent greater cooperation from companies, and a willingness for ISAC to share data with the government. But he added that the real issue was not disclosure of problems, "but a commitment from the government to fix them."
Opponents of the bills, meantime, worry about the type of information companies might try to hide behind the cloak of nondisclosure. They fear that industries will ask the government for financing to fight cyberterrorism, without the public's being able to examine the supporting evidence.
"On one hand, proponents say it is an area critical to public safety to point to vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure," said David Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center. "On the other, they're saying the public has no right whatsoever to oversee the government's actions."
Rena Steinzor, academic fellow at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said the exemptions could be so far-reaching as to prevent Freedom of Information Act requests for environmental matters, or other issues unrelated to cyberspace.
She noted that Raytheon, a major military contractor that had lobbied with President Bush to call for new disclosure exemptions, operates a Superfund environmental-hazard site and could have its environmental track record protected by the new law. 
She said the law was so vaguely worded that it could enable a company to claim protection for a broad swath of information on grounds that it was part of the critical infrastructure. "This goes way beyond cyberattacks," she said.
Opponents argue that there are already sufficient Freedom of Information exemptions in place, including laws that protect trade secrets and that prevent public disclosure of information submitted to the government for purposes of national security. 
But Mr. Rasch said the current exemptions do not provide sufficient reassurance to companies. Senator Bennett agrees, noting that the legislation is sharpening the focus of the current exemptions.
Mr. Clarke, straddling this part of the debate, says that while existing laws are probably sufficient, the problem is that companies do not believe they are. 
But if the issue is more a matter of perception than of reality, critics of the proposed bills, like Mr. Sobel, say that the proper approach should be educational -- not legislative. The potential cost of changing the law, he said, could be more than Americans will be willing to pay over the long run.
"It seems like the industry is trying to use this issue as a basis for closing down a whole range of public disclosure," he said. "The people on the Hill don't understand the unintended consequences."

HEADLINE: Sales of PC's Brighten a Bit This Season 

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

 BODY:
The reeling personal computer market, whose fortunes turned sharply downward last holiday season, is showing some signs of life this season.
 Since Thanksgiving, retailers and analysts say, personal computer sales have risen modestly alongside better-than-expected sales of home-entertainment equipment, like DVD players, high-definition televisions and video game consoles. 
 When it comes to buying electronics, consumers have shown some resilience in the face of the first recession in a decade, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the war in Afghanistan. Hewlett-Packard, the top-selling PC vendor in stores, reported last week that it had sold 20 percent more computers during the Thanksgiving weekend, the start of the holiday buying season, than during the same weekend last year. 
But the mild surge in personal computer and electronics sales -- in stores, on Web sites or through direct-sales businesses like Dell Computer -- may speak less to improving demand than to the desperation of the computer makers themselves.
Because most people who want a PC already own one that can handle their needs, computer makers and retailers prepared for the holiday by rolling out heavy price cuts and rebates. At some stores, including a Best Buy in Indianapolis, 75 percent of computers on sale included rebates, according to a retail survey by the investment bank Bear Stearns & Company. The incentives are an effort to encourage upgrades to faster machines and purchases of second or third computers for the home.
But despite the resulting bump in sales, many say the PC industry will continue to founder for at least another half-year, until corporations that buy large numbers of machines loosen the purse strings on their technology budgets.
"The PC business is in the doldrums, and I think it's likely to stay in the doldrums," said Steven Baker, a research director with NPD Intelect, a market research firm based in Port Washington, N.Y.
After riding the Internet wave through the third quarter of 2000, computer makers have watched their sales fall steadily ever since. The industry is expected to decline this year for the first time since 1986. While the number of computers shipped this holiday season will nudge up slightly from last quarter, cut-throat price competition will drive revenue down about 1 percent, said the International Data Corporation, a market research firm based in Framingham, Mass.
Of the major vendors, only Dell, with its built-to-order direct-sales model, is expected to turn a profit on its PC business. Dell has led a pricing war that has caused its competitors to struggle. Last week, Toshiba, which holds less than 1 percent of the market, announced that it would stop selling its desktop computers in the United States.
For vendors, the problem is that most computers in homes and offices are powerful enough to do their jobs. Corporations bought scores of new machines in fear of a Year 2000 meltdown, and, with the economy shrinking, they are in no hurry to upgrade now. And on the homefront, many PC's can handle e-mail, word processing and Internet browsing just fine.
So instead of buying new computers, consumers are tempted to spend money on new ways to use the computers they already own: digital cameras and video recorders, broadband Internet connections, and digital music players and rewritable CD drives.
Hewlett-Packard said it sold 75 percent more digital cameras and 140 percent more photo-quality printers during this Thanksgiving weekend than during the last.
Like other companies, Hewlett-Packard offered steep discounts to customers willing to buy devices bundled together. For example, for $899 after rebates, shoppers at Office Depot could buy a fast Hewlett-Packard home computer with Microsoft's new Windows XP operating system, a color printer, a scanner and a digital camera. That is generally less expensive than the price of just a single computer last holiday season.
As a result of its aggressive marketing, Hewlett-Packard sold 20 percent more computers this Thanksgiving weekend, but its PC revenue rose only 10 percent. Andrew Tallian, the company's vice president for consumer marketing, said demand was likely to slump again when vendors raised prices.
"We suspect customers went in looking for deals and might wait for more deals before buying again," Mr. Tallian said.
Adam A. Andersen, the chief operating officer of eMachines, said customer demand had caught retailers by surprise. EMachines, a discount PC maker that vies with Compaq for the second position in retail sales, takes orders from stores for an entire quarter in advance, then ships the machines from China and Korea. This year, with some stores dropping prices on eMachines to as low as $399, most sold out.
"They really undershot the forecast," he said. "Retailers were more pessimistic than they should have been going into the fourth quarter."
Although personal computer sales are exceeding already low expectations, perhaps the big winner in electronics this year will be home entertainment systems and devices. A team of analysts from Thomas Weisel Partners, an investment bank, surveyed more than three dozen retailers after the holiday season's opening weekend. Store managers reported that DVD players, surround-sound audio systems and wide-screen televisions had led the buying surge, largely because of steep price cuts.
Eric M. Ross, an analyst with Thomas Weisel, said, "For $75 I have to decide, do I want to go out to dinner at T.G.I. Friday's, or do I want a DVD player for the bedroom?"
Many analysts and executives have predicted that fears about terrorist attacks would lead to what they call "cocooning" -- the tendency of people to stay home instead of going out for entertainment.
Among the beneficiaries of that are developers of video game machines and software, where a heavyweight battle in video game systems has given the industry's prospects a strong start. Microsoft introduced its Xbox console on Nov. 15, and Nintendo followed three days later with its GameCube machine. Both are challenging Sony, which has sold more than 20 million of its PlayStation 2 systems worldwide.
Activision, a publisher of video games, said it expected sales of its top games to increase 44 percent over Thanksgiving week last year. Electronic Arts, another publisher, shipped 5 million copies of its Harry Potter video games to retailers and sold 1.4 million in the first two weeks.
"We fully expected a very strong holiday season, but I think it's getting a turbo-boost from what's going on with the economy and what happened Sept. 11," said Lawrence F. Probst III, chairman and chief executive of Electronic Arts.
In the meantime, the PC business awaits its recovery. Kevin B. Rollins, president and chief operating officer of Dell, said he expected corporations to start buying more computers in the second half of next year. He predicted that Windows XP and Intel's Pentium 4 microprocessor would offer a strong incentive to upgrade when the machines purchased before Y2K become too slow for their new corporate uses, like financial applications.
"If the economy keeps bumping along, by midyear you'll see a liftoff," Mr. Rollins said in an interview. "Not a spike, but a liftoff."

15 Die in a Third Blast By Palestinian Bombers
The third suicide bomber in just over 12 hours struck on a city bus in Haifa, killing himself and 15 others and prompting Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to declare a state of emergency in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as Israeli ministers spoke openly of removing him from power. The Israeli government tightened its already formidable blockade of Palestinian cities and villages. Palestinian officials said they had arrested dozens of militants. A1

President Bush demanded that Mr. Arafat break up Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the groups that, Mr. Bush said, train and breed the kinds of suicide bombers who killed at least 25 people in attacks over the weekend. A1

Argentina's Desperate Steps
Argentina, which is on the brink of a total default on $132 billion of public sector debt, announced it had limited cash withdrawals from banks and taken a step toward adopting the dollar as Argentina's currency in a desperate effort to avert a run on banks and a chaotic devaluation. Last Friday, depositors made frantic bank withdrawals amounting to $700 million. A3

Green Weighing Options After Hard Campaign Loss
It has been nearly four weeks since Mark Green's defeat in New York's mayoral race against Michael R. Bloomberg. Mr. Green's friends and associates say that he has largely come to terms with the loss but that he remains personally deflated. He has begun to weigh a variety of options, though few expect him to seek another public office. F1

Bridge Facelift Continues
After Sept. 11, it has been easy to forget that any of New York's massive, seemingly endless infrastucture projects, such as the Manhattan Bridge reconstruction, are continuing. But they are, and surprisingly, officials say, they have been little slowed by the terrorist attacks. For the Manhattan Bridge, which opened in 1909, the work involves addressing design problems that have troubled the span, and frustrated New Yorkers, for years. F1

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE POLITICS; 
Rifts Imperil Quest for Federal Aid To Rebuild Downtown New York

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
New York City's fight to win $20 billion in emergency-reconstruction aid from Washington is being increasingly undercut by the change in administrations at City Hall and by the sudden escalation of the race for governor in New York, state and federal officials say.
 The governor, mayor and mayor-elect have been distracted by events at home, just as New York's Congressional delegation is struggling to assure the immediate delivery of funds promised to rebuild the devastated financial district. 
 The lobbying campaign had already been weakened by infighting among the state's Congressional representatives and by rising resistance among national Republican leaders to New York's request for emergency help. But officials in Washington said yesterday that the transition and political turmoil in New York -- combined with the fact that Gov. George E. Pataki, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg have so far failed to offer a united front on what New York wants and how it should get it -- had made a highly problematic task all the more difficult. 
The fight for the money is taking place just as Mr. Giuliani is in the process of handing over control of City Hall to Mr. Bloomberg, and is considering what he will do with his own career once his term expires in four weeks.
Mr. Bloomberg, who was elected to public office for the first time a month ago, is now trying to rapidly assemble an entire government from scratch. And Mr. Pataki has found himself distracted by the demands of his own re-election campaign next year, with two potential Democratic rivals attacking him for his handling of the effort to win federal assistance for rebuilding New York.
In this uncertain environment, both Mr. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani have made moves that their aides said were intended to help New York's cause in Washington, but that many Washington officials said worked at cross-purposes to the New York delegation's struggle to nail down President Bush's promise of $20 billion in emergency-reconstruction aid and to win additional economic-stimulus measures.
Most strikingly, they said, Mr. Pataki submitted a $54 billion request for emergency federal aid that included funds for projects like a high-speed rail link to Schenectady that many members of Congress from outside New York dismissed as an attempt to profit from a tragedy. And two weeks ago, at the same time that the New York Congressional delegation and Mr. Bloomberg were pushing the administration to deliver the entire $20 billion promised by Mr. Bush, Mr. Giuliani defended the White House for seeking to delay the payment, and scolded fellow New Yorkers for not trusting Mr. Bush to deliver the promised assistance.
Since the request by Mr. Pataki and the statement by Mr. Giuliani, members of the Congressional delegation said, New York has encountered rising skepticism in Congress about how much money it needs and how soon it needs it, and several attempts by the New York delegation to win the allocation of the entire $20 billion have foundered. Even some of Mr. Bloomberg's supporters expressed distress at the actions by Mr. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani, though the mayor-elect himself has not publicly offered any criticism.
The efforts to secure aid for New York City come amid increased demands for federal financial help from businesses and agencies around the country after the terrorist attacks.
Officials in New York's overwhelmingly Democratic Congressional delegation also said that a coordinated lobbying attempt by the Republican mayor and Republican governor -- both of whom are popular in Washington and sympathetic figures in the wake of the attack -- could prove extraordinarily helpful right now, given the fact that Republicans control the White House and the House of Representatives.
But Mr. Giuliani, who has devoted all his energies since Sept. 11 to leading the city out of the crisis, has not been in Washington to lobby since the attack. Mr. Pataki has visited Washington twice in the 12 weeks since the attack.
Mr. Bloomberg visited Washington 10 days after his election, in the first of what he said would be monthly trips to the nation's capital. His appearance drew praise from Democratic and Republican officials. "Bloomberg's visit here was very helpful; he said all the right things," said one New York Democratic Congressional aide.
Since then, though, Mr. Bloomberg has been consumed with putting together a new government and assembling a budget to deal with the most brutal fiscal environment New York has encountered in at least 25 years.
"I don't get the sense that there is any kind of coordinated effort here," said Felix G. Rohatyn, who was chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation and one of the business leaders who put together the plan that led New York City out of the fiscal crisis of the 1970's. Mr. Rohatyn warned that this fiscal crisis could prove worse than the last one, and expressed concern at the pace of things so far.
"You have this situation of an outgoing mayor and an incoming mayor," Mr. Rohatyn said. "The governor hasn't, I don't believe, connected that closely with the incoming mayor to know what he wants, or to know what they jointly think they should be asking."
Several officials said they hoped that situation would change once Mr. Bloomberg takes office. Still, this interregnum could prove to be remembered as an unwelcome turn of timing.
Memories of the jet attacks on the trade center towers are still fresh, and it could be a long while before New York enjoys as much political clout in Washington as it does now.
The problems in New York come at a time of turmoil in the New York Congressional delegation, which has been divided over how to proceed and beset with political rivalries and infighting among members eager to win credit for any accomplishments and avoid blame for any failure.
Relations between Senator Charles E. Schumer, the senior Democrat from New York, and Mr. Pataki have been particularly strained since Sept. 11, with aides to both floating competing proposals on how to deal with the problem.
Members of Congress have taken note of the political difficulties Mr. Pataki is now experiencing because of the perception that he has mishandled the fight, and are clearly anxious about the potential political fall-out for their own campaigns, depending on the outcome of the fight.
And the New York delegation has never been particularly popular in Washington. Powerful Republicans in Congress and the White House -- among them, Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma and Senator Phil Gramm of Texas -- have expressed increasing opposition to New York's request for help.
To compound things, neither Mr. Giuliani nor Mr. Pataki have shown any appetite for publicly taking on the city's Republican critics.
Mr. Pataki's request for $54 billion caught members of the New York Congressional delegation by surprise, and came at a time when he was being overshadowed by Mr. Giuliani's response to the World Trade Center attack. He has been criticized for it by two Democrats who are seeking to run against him next year -- H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, and Andrew M. Cuomo, the former Housing and Urban Development secretary.
In the wake of that criticism, Mr. Pataki has been a nearly invisible figure in Washington, declining, for example, to get involved with the dispute with the White House over the $20 billion.
Mr. Pataki's supporters say that he has been working behind the scenes to help New York get assistance, and that he believes it is unwise to take any steps that might undercut his relationship with Mr. Bush.
The head of Mr. Pataki's Washington lobbying office, James A. Mazzarella, defended Mr. Pataki's efforts, and suggested that Democratic members were trying to score political points. "Many Democrats had two agendas," Mr. Mazzarella said. "One was to get as much money for New York as possible. And some of them, just as important, wanted to embarrass the president."
Mr. Mazzarella said Mr. Pataki was picking his battles and working behind the scenes with the White House and Congressional leaders. "It's important to fight for New York," he said. "But it's also important to know that this isn't going to be the last fight we have."
Representative John E. Sweeney of Saratoga Springs, a Republican and a friend of Mr. Pataki's, who has repeatedly taken on Republicans in Congress and in the White House on behalf of the New York aid request, said that the delegation should not put pressure on Mr. Pataki to do what it should be doing. "We've got to carry the weight," he said. "We were elected to do this. He wasn't elected to do this. And frankly, he's got to continue to maintain a relationship with the White House."
As for the mayor, several members of the delegation suggested that Mr. Giuliani, at this late point in his tenure, did not have an appetite for taking on such a difficult fight, particularly if it involved taking on senior members of his party.
Mr. Giuliani's deputy mayor in charge of the Washington lobbying effort, Robert M. Harding, the deputy mayor for economic development and finance, did not return a series of phone calls seeking comment.
But Mr. Sweeney defended the mayor, saying he understood why Mr. Giuliani had criticized the delegation for pushing the White House on the $20 billion. "What he was concerned about was the appearance, or the perception, that this was breaking down into a partisan mud fight," he said. "I think he was trying to squelch that or calm that down."

HEADLINE: Most Technology Executives Make Guarded Forecasts 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Dec. 1 

 BODY:
Robert W. Pittman, AOL Time Warner's co-chief operating officer, seemed unconvinced that business would turn around anytime soon.
 "It's not getting worse, but I don't see it getting better," he said to an unusually thinly filled room of investors here at Credit Suisse First Boston's annual technology conference. "It's very difficult for anyone to predict." 
 For technology executives, calling the bottom of the economic cycle for all things digital has become a risky sport. The dozens of top technology executives gathered here for the weeklong open-microphone session to reassure investors about next year's outlook were only mildly reassuring. Instead, the executives veered toward a realistic -- often conservative -- outlook, a departure for an industry once known for espousing exuberant projections. 
"None of us has any visibility right now," said David Peterschmidt, chief executive of the network infrastructure software company Inktomi. "Until we see some buying patterns change, all the analyst estimates will be pretty flat."
The difference from the this year's conference and last year's was plainly clear. Last year, while technology companies were reporting steep drops in sales almost daily, executives and investors would walk around in a funk, their eyes fixed on the free-falling stock ticker. Still, executives then held out hope that things could return to normal -- normal being the double-digit growth that technology companies were accustomed to.
This year, the reality has set in that normal may not return for a while. "What you had last year was a bunch of rookies entering the ring and in the corner was Joe Frasier," said Elliott Rogers, global head of First Boston's technology research group. "Now they understand what they're up against."
Several executives offered positive, though tempered projections. Texas Instruments' chief executive, Tom Engibous, predicted the bottom had already been reached for his company. "We now believe that the third quarter was the low point for orders and the fourth quarter will set the floor for revenues," he said.
The chairman of Dell Computer, Michael S. Dell, who said last year that he could not think of a reason to buy a computer, now said there might be reason. "We don't know when these replacements will occur, but you can't push them out forever," he told investors, noting that an estimated 30 percent of desktop computers and 25 percent of notebooks are at least three years old.
Indeed, many executives and investors say that hardware makers are poised to rebound because corporate clients and consumers may begin a "replacement cycle" -- shedding outdated computers and other technologies for newer ones.
Mr. Rogers, however, pointed out: "As we get to a point when these machines are so good, the PC replacement cycle could be like that of the refrigerator."
Thomas M. Siebel of Siebel Systems was not ready to say the replacement cycle for software would begin in full until later in 2002 but was confident it would seriously begin at that time. "I see the first half of next year being pretty slow, pretty flat. Then in the second half, I believe it will start to pull out," he said. "I believe we will look back on the third quarter as the low point for information software."
One executive who refused to accept that the business climate was weak was the chief executive of Handspring, Donna Dubinsky. She made 1999-style projections despite her company's still being unprofitable. "I just couldn't be more bullish on the future," she said. "It's just filled with opportunities."
One investor remarked to a colleague, "I wish I could go back to the future, too."

HEADLINE: New Contenders For a Theory Of Everything 

BYLINE:  By GEORGE JOHNSON 

 BODY:
In science's great chain of being, the particle physicists place themselves with the angels, looking down from the heavenly spheres on the chemists, biologists, geologists, meteorologists -- those who are applying, not discovering, nature's most fundamental laws. Everything, after all, is made from subatomic particles. Once you have a concise theory explaining how they work, the rest should just be filigree.
 Even the kindred discipline of solid-state physics, which is concerned with the mass behavior of particles -- what metals, crystals, semiconductors, whole lumps of matter do -- is often considered a lesser pursuit. "Squalid state physics," Murray Gell-Mann, discoverer of the quark, dubbed it. Others dismiss it as "dirt physics." 
 Recently there have been rumblings from the muck. In a clash of scientific cultures, some prominent squalid-staters have been challenging the particle purists as arbiters of ultimate truth. 
"The stakes here are very high," said Dr. Robert B. Laughlin, a Stanford University theorist who shared a Nobel Prize in 1998 for discoveries in solid-state physics. "At issue is a deep epistemological matter having to do with what physics is." 
Last year Dr. Laughlin and Dr. David Pines, a theorist at the University of Illinois and Los Alamos National Laboratory, published a manifesto declaring that the "science of the past," which seeks to distill the richness of reality into a few simple equations governing subatomic particles, was coming to an impasse.
Many complex systems -- the very ones the solid-staters study -- appear to be irreducible. Made of many interlocking parts, they display a kind of synergy, obeying "higher organizing principles" that cannot be further simplified no matter how hard you try.
Carrying the idea even further, some solid-state physicists are trying to show that the laws of relativity, long considered part of the very bedrock of the physical world, are not platonic truths that have existed since time began.
They may have emerged from the roiling of the vacuum of space, much as supply-and-demand and other "laws" of economics emerge from the bustle of the marketplace. If so, then solid-state physics, which specializes in how emergent phenomena occur, may be the most fundamental science of them all.
"We're in the midst of a paradigm change," Dr. Pines said. "Ours is not the prevailing view, but I think it will turn out to be the one that lasts."
Working in this vein, one of Dr. Laughlin's Stanford colleagues, Dr. Shoucheng Zhang, recently was co-author of a paper suggesting that elementary particles like photons and gravitons, the carriers of electromagnetism and gravity, might not be so elementary after all -- they might emerge as ripples in the vacuum of space, bubbling up from the quagmire in a way that can best be explained in terms of solid-state physics.
"The idea is of course crazy, thought provoking, and somewhat anti-establishment," Dr. Zhang said. "The main idea is to apply concepts from solid-state physics to answer some big questions of the universe."
The particle physicists insist that there is plenty of mileage left in their own approach. "I strongly believe that the fundamental laws of nature are not emergent phenomena," said Dr. David Gross, director of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California at Santa Barbara. "Bob Laughlin and I have violent arguments about this."
After hearing Dr. Zhang describe his theory at a seminar last month, Dr. Gross deemed it "an interesting piece of work." He said he found the mathematics "beautiful and intriguing, and perhaps of use somewhere."
That may sound like faint praise, but the particle physicists have reason to be wary. The squalid-staters are challenging them in a debate over how the universe is made and how science should be done.
Following the method of Plato, the particle physicists are inclined to see nature as crystallized mathematics. In the beginning was a single superforce, the embodiment of an elegant set of equations they call, only a bit facetiously, the theory of everything. Then along came the Big Bang to ruin it all.
The universe cooled and expanded, the single force splintering into the four very different forces observed today: electromagnetism and the weak and strong nuclear forces, which work inside atoms, are described by quantum mechanics and special relativity. The fourth force, gravity, is described by an entirely different theory, general relativity.
The particle physicists' ultimate goal is "grand unification" -- recovering the primordial symmetry in the form of a single law -- a few concise equations, it is often said, that could be silk-screened onto a T-shirt.
This approach, in which the most complex phenomena are boiled down to a unique underlying theory, is called reductionism.
The problem, the solid-staters say, is that many forms of matter -- ranging from the exotic like superconductors and superfluids to the mundane like crystals and metals -- cannot be described in terms of fundamental particle interactions. When systems become very complex, completely new and independent laws emerge. "More is different," as the Nobel laureate Philip W. Anderson put it in a landmark paper in 1972. To the solid-staters, it would take something the size of a circus tent to hold all the equations capturing the unruliness of the physical world.
Like Aristotle, they lean toward the notion that it is the equations that flow from nature instead of the other way around. Mathematics is just a tool for making sense of it all.
"For at least some fundamental things in nature, the theory of everything is irrelevant," declared Dr. Laughlin and Dr. Pines in the Jan. 4, 2000 issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. "The central task of theoretical physics in our time is no longer to write down the ultimate equations but rather to catalog and understand emergent behavior in its many guises, including potentially life itself."
There may not be a theory of everything, they say, just a lot of theories of things. This is exactly the kind of squalor the particle physicists abhor.
Dr. Grigori E. Volovik, a solid-state physicist at the Helsinki University of Technology in Finland, champions an idea he calls "anti-grand unification." In a review article last year (xxx.lanl.gov/abs /gr-qc/0104046), he ventured that the universe may have begun not in a state of pristine symmetry but in one of lawlessness. The laws of relativity and perhaps quantum mechanics itself would have emerged only later on.
The notion of emergent laws is not radical in itself. A flask of gas consists of trillions of molecules randomly colliding with one another. From this disorder, qualities like temperature and pressure emerge, along with laws relating one to the other.
So take that idea a level deeper. Physicists now believe that the vacuum of space is, paradoxically, not vacuous at all. It seethes with energy, in the form of "virtual particles" constantly flitting in and out of existence. So perhaps, Dr. Volovik suggests, even laws now considered fundamental emerged from this constant subatomic buzz.
Solid-state physics offers clues to how something like this might occur. The atomic vibrations that ripple through matter are, like all quantum phenomena, carried by particles -- called, in this case, phonons.
Just as photons carry light and gravitons carry gravity, phonons carry the subatomic equivalent of sound. Like bubbles in a carbonated beverage, phonons -- physicists call them "quasi particles" -- appear only when the medium is disturbed.
In the world of solid-state physics, quasi particles abound. In some substances, like the semiconductors used to make computer chips, the displacement of an electron leaves behind a "hole" that behaves like a positively charged particle. An electron and a hole can sometimes stick together to form a chargeless quasi particle called an exciton. Other such ephemera include magnons and polarons.
Evanescent though they are, quasi particles act every bit like elementary particles, obeying the laws of quantum mechanics. This has led some mavericks to wonder whether there is really any difference at all. Maybe elementary particles are just quasi particles -- an effervescence in the vacuum.
Particularly intriguing is a phenomenon, occurring at extremely low temperatures, called the fractional quantum Hall effect. In certain substances, quasi particles appear that act curiously like electrons but with one-third the normal charge. (Dr. Laughlin won his Nobel Prize for a theory explaining this.)
Quarks, the basic building blocks of matter, also carry a one-third charge, a coincidence that has fueled speculation that emergence may be somehow fundamental to the very existence of the physical world.
A stumbling block to carrying this idea further has been that the quantum Hall effect seems to work only in two-dimensions -- on the surface of a substance. But in a paper published in the Oct. 26 issue of Science, Dr. Zhang and his student Jiangping Hu showed how to extend the phenomenon. In their scheme, the physical world would be a three-dimensional "surface" of a four-dimensional "quantum liquid" -- an underlying sea of particles that can be thought of as the vacuum.
Analyzing the ripples that would appear in such a medium, the two scientists were surprised to find that they mathematically resembled electromagnetic and gravitational waves. But there are problems with the model. At this point, the hypothetical photons and gravitons that emerge from the equations do not interact with other particles, as they do in the real world.
"The coupling is zero, so apples are weightless, as is everything else," said Dr. Joseph Polchinski, a string theorist at the University of California at Santa Barbara, who recently discussed the model with Dr. Zhang.
And there is what the theory's inventors concede is an "embarrassment of riches" -- the equations predict hordes of exotic particles that do not exist.
"The hope is that some modification of the theory, not yet specified in detail, will remove the extra fields and turn on the coupling," Dr. Polchinski said. "Whether this can be done is at this point a guess. Overall my attitude now is interest with a high degree of skepticism."
If the theory can be made to work, it may point to a new way of unifying quantum mechanics and relativity. But Dr. Zhang is careful not to oversell what he considers a work in progress.
"Our work only made a tiny step toward this direction," Dr. Zhang said, "but it seems to indicate that the goal may not be impossible to reach." At the very least, he said, his work may inspire more collaboration between particle physicists and solid-staters.
Ultimately, though, the two sides know that they are talking across a divide. Taken to its extreme, emergence suggests that all the fundamental laws, even quantum mechanics, may be secondary -- that at the base of reality is random noise.
Dr. Polchinski said he found that idea discouraging.
"To me, the history of science seems to be a steady progression toward simpler and more unified laws, and I expect to see this continue and to contribute to it. Things may take many surprising twists and turns," he said, "but we reductionists are still quite happily and busily reducing."

HEADLINE: New Leader Makes Plans to Revive a Faltering A.M.A. 

BYLINE:  By MARK BLOOM 

 BODY:
Michael D. Maves is a former cancer surgeon who boasts of deft administrative skills that resuscitate ailing medical institutions. He cites turnaround successes with a crippled academic medical department and a stagnant national association of ear, nose and throat specialists. But now Dr. Maves, 53, faces a challenge that dwarfs anything in his past. He was hired last month to revive the struggling American Medical Association.
 As the chief executive of the group, he will need every bit of what he learned in business school at the University of Iowa, where he earned an M.B.A.; his self-professed talent in conciliation and activism in medical politics will also be essential. 
 The A.M.A. is no longer as prestigious or influential as it once was. Only one in four practicing physicians is a member, less than half the percentage of a generation ago. The association claims 290,357 members, but a large percentage are students, residents and retirees.
"To the public, the A.M.A. is still a powerful brand name," said Dr. Jack Lewin, the executive vice president of the California Medical Association. "The irony is that for physicians the A.M.A. has lost power and relevance."
The medical association has shrunk in size and influence for a variety of reasons. Founded as the voice of individual, independent medical practitioners, it has not adjusted well to the world of large group practices, the advent of managed care, the rise of powerful specialty groups and the influence of the government's Medicare program. For representation, doctors often turn to their specialty societies rather than to the A.M.A. 
At the same time, a series of gaffes by the association left many doctors disgusted, further eroding membership.
The group spent the last years of the 20th century reeling from crisis to crisis. Foremost among them was an ill-advised arrangement in 1997 with the Sunbeam Corporation in which the association agreed to bestow its stamp of approval on certain Sunbeam products, like humidifiers, heating pads and blood pressure monitors, in return for a percentage of any increase in sales.
The A.M.A. was widely condemned and accused of selling its good name, and it backed out of the deal. Sunbeam sued for breach of contract, and the doctors' group wound up paying $9.9 million in damages and legal fees. Top A.M.A. executives were fired.
The Sunbeam incident led directly to the most recent spectacle, which took place last June when the A.M.A.'s House of Delegates, its policy-making body, gathered in Chicago. Doctors arrived to find their executive vice president, Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson, who had been hired in the aftermath of the Sunbeam incident, in open warfare with the association's trustees.
During the meeting Dr. Anderson filed suit against the A.M.A. for breach of his employment contract, and its chairman, Dr. Timothy Flaherty, for defamation. A few days later, Dr. Anderson was fired. 
Just before the House met, Dr. Anderson had tried to fire the A.M.A.'s general counsel, alleging that he cost the association millions in a botched Chicago real estate deal. The board refused to allow the dismissal.
This refusal, said Dr. Anderson, violated his employment contact. And he accused the board of protecting the general counsel because, Dr. Anderson said, the lawyer had a smoking-gun memo showing the board had known all about the Sunbeam deal before it went through. The board has denied that accusation.
Citing continuing litigation, neither side will comment further.
Other controversies also hurt membership. A year after the Sunbeam episode, under intense pressure from the Republican leadership in Congress, the A.M.A. temporarily abandoned its traditional neutrality on abortion and backed the effort to ban the procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion. Perhaps significantly, the medical group failed to sway the three senators whose votes were needed for passage.
Less evident outside the medical field, the association was also criticized by its members over an arrangement with the government to set up a schedule of Medicare payments. Doctors called the plan for compensating evaluation and management of patients unworkably complex. This contretemps, still unresolved, may have cost the most members of all.
Then there was the summary dismissal of Dr. George Lundberg, the editor of the respected Journal of the American Medical Association. He was fired by Dr. Anderson for rushing to print a survey on oral sex, allegedly injecting the medical association into the Clinton impeachment debate.
What the disarray in the A.M.A. means to the patients of America is not entirely clear. The association couches its actions as being in the interests of patients, but not everyone agrees.
Some critics assert that the group's primary role is the economic betterment of its members. Dr. Yank Coble of Jacksonville, Fla., the president-elect, dismisses that as nonsense. Dr. Richard F. Corlin of Santa Monica, Calif., the current president, said there was no way to quantify how much of the A.M.A.'s effort is self-serving.
But he cited the effort the group has made to support a strong Patient Protection Act, even to the point of a break with the Bush administration and the A.M.A.'s traditional Republican allies in Congress, as an example of how the association works in the public's interest. This week the association promoted its efforts to help physicians prepare for bioterrorism.
Largely unaffected by the A.M.A.'s troubles has been the huge role it plays in medical education, staffing or taking part in a variety of committees that set standards for medical schools and residency training in the United States.
Through its Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, the A.M.A. is a world-renowned arbiter of medical ethics. It publishes a variety of respected medical journals, in addition to The Journal of the American Medical Association. It is, however, best known in Washington as an advocate for the interests of doctors in often-arcane payment wrangling.
Now comes Dr. Maves. His selection was denounced by Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the Health Research Group in Washington, a longtime critic of the association, who called the choice inappropriate because Dr. Maves had spent the previous two years as president of the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, a trade group for makers of over-the-counter drugs and supplements. 
But Dr. Maves had other credentials. For four years he had been executive vice president of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. The group is a constituent of the loose federation of 111 societies of specialists and 55 state and territorial doctor associations that make up the A.M.A.
Dr. Maves had also been on the staff of the formal investigation into Sunbeam, and he had been a member of an important A.M.A. committee on Medicare payments to doctors. Before that Dr. Maves had been an active cancer surgeon and chairman of otolaryngology at Saint Louis University and the University of Iowa.
Dr. Maves said he saw his new job as "a calling" and viewed the A.M.A. as a "treasure in many ways" -- though one that, perhaps, needed restoration. He said he hoped the group would reassume its place as the voice of American medicine.
"Challenges get me going," he said.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook: Beyond Renovation, Into the Stuff Of Dreams; 
Time for Artistic Vision At Lincoln Center

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY TOMMASINI 

 BODY:
The strife that has broken out among the performing arts organizations of Lincoln Center as they struggle to reach a consensus on a major reconstruction plan is not surprising. There has always been tension in the alliance, which was conceived more as an urban redevelopment project than as a joint artistic venture. If Lincoln Center had never been built and were being proposed today, the idea might well be rejected.
 When construction began in the late 1950's, cities were in trouble and the suburbs were ascendant. Hence the proposal, spearheaded by Robert Moses, for a safe enclave of culture, with ample underground parking so suburbanites could drive into town and attend an event without setting foot on a New York City street. As New York rebounded, several Lincoln Center constituents realized that in some ways it might have been easier to forge a clear identity had they remained independent entities, each with its own ties to a city neighborhood. 
 It's too late to think about that. Lincoln Center's constituents are bound together by architecture, and that architecture is in need of repair. They are not bound together artistically and never have been. The redevelopment proposal, now projected at $1.2 billion, seems focused on initiatives that have little direct relation to their artistic mission. Making the public space more attractive and accessible is a worthy goal but not the most important. The project should be a visionary effort, a chance for each organization to address longstanding issues that have affected its artistic growth.
The problem is that each organization has its own agenda.
One reason Joseph Volpe, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, has been such a powerfully dissenting voice on the redevelopment board is that his company -- the largest constituent, with the greatest financial influence -- does not stand to gain that much from the project. The opera house turned out well from the start. The acoustics are excellent except in certain pockets of seats under overhanging balconies. Sure, the Met could use more backstage space, and an expanded front lobby would be great. But Mr. Volpe has said that the Met could get by with some overdue maintenance.
The New York City Ballet has also done well. The company was one of America's premier artistic institutions when it moved there in 1964. It lent prestige to the venture and got a lot out of it, starting with a house, the New York State Theater, that was designed exactly as George Balanchine, a godlike figure in international dance, wanted it. If, as some think, the company has slipped artistically since the Balanchine era, this has little to do with its home.
The two organizations that have struggled most at Lincoln Center are the New York City Opera and the New York Philharmonic. Since relocating to the State Theater in 1966, the City Opera has been frustrated by the dull acoustics of the auditorium. Balanchine insisted that the stage be built so that ballet audiences would not hear one foot fall during performances. He got his wish, much to the chagrin of the opera singers who perform there. Similarly, the Philharmonic has long found Avery Fisher Hall a frustrating auditorium for symphonic music, even after several renovations, including a complete gutting and reconstruction in 1976. Both companies are counting on the redevelopment project to fix the problems.
But how will their reconstruction plans foster their artistic missions? So far only the City Opera has done a good job of explaining this.
Paul Kellogg, the general and artistic director of the City Opera, says the problems with the State Theater are so imposing that a new opera house, ideally near the current Lincoln Center campus, is essential. Mr. Volpe has been a vocal opponent of the plan. He might have enhanced his public image by embracing the City Opera as a training ground for young singers rather than treating it as an unwelcome competitor. 
Mr. Volpe's objection is purely pragmatic, he asserts: he doesn't want the Met in any way saddled with shared responsibility for another Lincoln Center opera house he deems an impractical extravagance. The other influential dissenting voice, though a gentler one, has been Beverly Sills, the chairman of Lincoln Center, a former director of the City Opera and its all-time greatest star. She would like to see the State Theater renovated in ways that address as many of Mr. Kellogg's concerns as possible.
With the economy losing strength, chief executives in all fields are under pressure to define the missions of their companies clearly. Mr. Kellogg can do so succinctly. If the City Opera is to make an important artistic contribution to New York culture, Mr. Kellogg says, it must distinguish itself from the Met. Under him the company has tried to do this by presenting unusual repertory that the Met tends to avoid, especially smaller-scale 20th-century and American works, as well as Baroque operas; and by presenting staples in innovative productions with younger singers who act well and look their parts.
His frustrations at the State Theater are in contrast to his experience as artistic director of the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y., whose commodious and acoustically splendid hall seats just 900 yet has a stage nearly as big as the State Theater's. The alliance he formed between Glimmerglass and City Opera has been at once sensible and exasperating. Too often vibrant new productions introduced at Glimmerglass, where it's easy for audiences to become engrossed, fail to have the same impact at the State Theater.
Though the size of the State Theater (2,700 seats) is a factor, the main problem is its poor acoustics. In 1999 Mr. Kellogg took a risky step and installed a Dutch-designed electronic sound enhancement system. He argues, somewhat defensively, that using the latest technology to enhance the hall's acoustics is not the same as using amplification. Still, "sound enhancement" seems a euphemism for a system that picks up sounds through dozens of tiny microphones and disseminates them through some 100 small speakers discreetly placed throughout the auditorium.
At first the move elicited intense criticism from many opera buffs and critics, myself included. Now two years later Mr. Kellogg receives few complaining letters, suggesting that the predicted slippery slope syndrome has begun. Audiences are getting used to sound enhancement, especially the opera neophytes Mr. Kellogg has attracted to his productions, who grew up with amplification.
Mr. Kellogg stands by his move, but he would gleefully ship the sound system back to the Netherlands if he could have a new house with proper acoustics. A major renovation of the State Theater to correct the problem is still possible, but he would have to come to terms with the managers of the City Ballet, for whom the State Theater is a sacred site.
Ms. Sills is essentially committed to the idea of the City Opera remaining at the State Theater. "I know I'm not popular with Paul when I say that," she said recently. "It would be wonderful to have a new house for the company. But the way the economy is today, and the maintenance that would be involved -- not to mention the fact that the City Opera has a 10-year lease with Lincoln Center, and they just can't dump the building on the City Ballet -- I'm just not sure it will be possible."
Ms. Sills, who spent the glory years of her career singing at the State Theater, defends its basic acoustics and is quick to point out that no one complained about the sound in the hall back when she was performing with a roster of young singers that included Placido Domingo, Sherrill Milnes, Donald Gramm and Carol Neblett.
Before the move to Lincoln Center the company performed at City Center on West 55th Street, where problems included poor wing space and partly obstructed sight lines from the upper balcony. Yet, Ms. Sills admits to missing the place.
"Sometimes I wish we had stayed," she said. "We could have raised funds, sold the air rights, had a 52-week season and even run a summer conservatory for young people in that smaller theater downstairs." But Julius Rudel, then general director, was "anxious for us to be part of the glamour," Ms. Sills said, "to be part of where the action was."
The latest redevelopment plan sets aside $240 million for a new opera house if -- and it's a big if -- a site can be found off campus. Otherwise up to $87 million would be spent to renovate the State Theater, with improving acoustics as the top priority.
Mr. Kellogg cannot have it both ways. If City Opera is to remain affiliated with Lincoln Center, he may have to trim his vision and be content with a renovated State Theater. From an artistic standpoint it would be a courageous step to leave Lincoln Center, take the $50 million already pledged to a new house, raise more money and build elsewhere in town, preferably a smaller house, 1,800 seats or less. Imagine it: a full-time New York City version of the Glimmerglass Festival in Chelsea or SoHo. Now that would distinguish the City Opera from the Met.
Give Mr. Kellogg credit, though, for at least linking his desire for a new hall to a clear artistic vision, something the New York Philharmonic has yet to do. The orchestra is calling for another enormous renovation of Avery Fisher Hall. Some $326 million has been designated. It would hardly cost more to tear the place down and start over.
The orchestra asserts, persuasively, that the building is in need of major attention, that office and rehearsal spaces are inadequate. The main problem, though, is acoustics. Once again the plan is to gut the hall and redesign the interior.
Yet the hall's acoustics, though somewhat dry, are not that bad. True, the place is no Carnegie Hall. But music makes an impact there. Moreover, gut-ripping renovation jobs are risky. The acoustics could turn out to be only marginally better.
If part of the money for the Lincoln Center redevelopment is to come from the city, it is fair to ask: What is this money being spent for? What is the artistic mission at stake? And since Sept. 11 and its financial impact, these questions are more important and difficult than ever.
Much of what ails the Philharmonic could be fixed through bold artistic leadership without a single improvement to its hall. There are signs of new vitality in the troubled world of classical music, but the good news is coming less from America's established opera companies and orchestras than from smaller, adventurous organizations, like Miller Theater at Columbia University. Contemporary-music programs under its director, George Steel, routinely attract eager, mostly younger audiences, the jeans-and-sweatshirt crowd that every major orchestra should be courting.
With some exceptions, orchestras seem particularly stuck in place. The subscription series, designed more to lock in audiences than to facilitate imaginative programming, should no longer be sacrosanct. Here the Philharmonic faces a particular challenge. At Carnegie Hall, New Yorkers can regularly hear the esteemed orchestras of Europe -- the Berlin Philharmonic, the Vienna Philharmonic, the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra -- play the great European repertory with an authority that comes from centuries of tradition. It can not be enough for the New York Philharmonic simply to mimic this programming. Shouldn't there be something distinctively New Yorkish about its repertory?
Unless the whole approach to presenting orchestra concerts changes, winning younger audiences will not be easy. A fancy new hall in which to play the "Eroica" Symphony will not do it. It's something to consider as Lincoln Center's constituents consult architects and line up fund-raisers.

HEADLINE: THE DOCTOR'S WORLD; 
First Challenge In Anthrax Case: Not Missing It

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.

 BODY:
Is anthrax really as rare in this country as experts believe? Given the resemblance of its early stages to other ailments -- skin anthrax can look like a spider bite or acne, and the inhaled form like a viral respiratory infection -- many people have wondered whether other cases may have occurred in the past, unrelated to terrorism, and been misdiagnosed.
 Until the intentional spread of anthrax in recent months, only 18 cases of inhalation anthrax had been reported since 1950, and 227 of the skin form from 1955 to the beginning of the intentional spread this fall. Additional anthrax cases may have gone undetected over the years, but the number would be small, infectious disease experts said in interviews. 
 "No matter how I think about this, I doubt that we would miss more than the rare, rare, rare case," said Dr. David Gilbert, the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. 
"I am sure we can come up with some extenuating circumstances where patients have slipped through the system, but it is very unlikely that we've missed lots of cases" because the illness is so striking, said Dr. Gilbert, who practices at Providence Portland Medical Center in Oregon.
No one knows the precise number. Since the death of Ottilie Lundgren, 94, on Nov. 21, federal and state epidemiologists have scoured medical records in hospitals and offices in Connecticut for clues to missed cases and turned up none.
Still, widespread publicity about the recent outbreak unquestionably led doctors to diagnose anthrax in some cases that they otherwise would not have detected because they have had so little direct experience with the infection.
One such case is that of a 7-month-old boy in Manhattan, who is thought to have contracted the infection when his mother, an ABC news producer, took him to work on Sept. 28. The child nearly died from skin anthrax in October.
The boy's physician, Dr. William Borkowsky, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at New York University, said he made a point of studying anthrax when bioterrorism became a threat in recent years. Even so, Dr. Borkowsky said he would have diagnosed the infant's lesion as a spider bite if he had not known that anthrax was present in New York City.
The reason is that when Dr. Borkowsky first examined the infant's skin lesion on Oct. 2, tests showed no evidence of anthrax. The infant also suffered kidney damage, bleeding and a type of anemia that rapidly destroyed red blood cells and required four blood transfusions.
"The syndrome this child had had never been described in anthrax" but had been linked to spider bites, Dr. Borkowsky said. "The skin lesions were compatible with anthrax, but the rest of the picture was incompatible because we reviewed all published cases of anthrax dating to the 1950's and never found the particular blood problem, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, linked to anthrax in an adult or a child."
But as soon as Dr. Borkowsky learned about the first cutaneous anthrax case in New York City on Oct. 12, he said he called an official of the New York City Health Department and also sent an e-mail message describing the case. But he received no reply.
Frustrated, Dr. Borkowsky then called another branch of the Health Department, the Poison Control Center, which was handling calls for suspected anthrax. But he had trouble finding an official who knew about anthrax.
Eventually, Dr. Borkowsky spoke to Dr. Farzad Mostashari, an epidemiologist assigned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the New York City Health Department, who examined the child that night. Dr. Mostashari said the infant's lesion looked exactly like the one that he had seen four hours earlier in Erin O'Connor, 38, the first recognized anthrax victim in New York City.
Dr. Borkowsky had frozen some of the child's blood with the intent of testing it later for evidence of a spider bite. Instead, the doctors used the blood to confirm anthrax.
It took a month for the child's kidneys to regain normal function, Dr. Borkowsky said, and now he is fine.
In reflecting on the case, Dr. Borkowsky said that if he had not learned about the presence of anthrax in New York City, he would have diagnosed a spider bite because the baby's symptoms were "so atypical of what I was expecting for anthrax."
Milder cases of skin anthrax may have gone undetected because they can be cured by antibiotics, even if the drugs are prescribed for some other reason. Also, skin anthrax can heal on its own and even resemble bad acne.
In comparison, inhalation anthrax progresses much more swiftly and strikingly than skin anthrax. Yet there are disquieting signs that some cases may have been missed because of recent changes in medical practice and education that have made doctors less vigorous in pursuing a diagnosis at the bedside or in a microbiology laboratory. These changes began even before managed care affected the economics of medical practice and teaching, and have accelerated since.
"It is possible that a fluke case or two of inhalation anthrax over the years, not every year, could have gone undetected," said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "But we have not missed six or seven cases a year."
"When these people get overwhelming sepsis associated with inhalational anthrax, it is tough to miss, even when you are not thinking about it," Dr. Fauci said.
Referring to a laboratory test known as the Gram stain that can help detect Bacillus anthracis, Dr. Fauci said: "It is not easy to miss these horrible looking Gram positive rods that look like boxcars. They are very striking" and can be found in blood cultures even when patients seem healthy.
Dr. Fauci cited the case of a man who walked into a hospital with just mild intestinal symptoms and no fever; blood cultures yielded enormous numbers of anthrax bacilli.
But doctors must order such tests before the microbes can be detected, and whether they do depends on how hard they and the microbiology laboratory are willing to look. The initial culture may not distinguish B. anthracis from bacteriological cousins that are common skin contaminants, and laboratories often discard such cultures without precisely identifying the bacillus.
Because immune function tends to wane with age, older people seem to be more susceptible than younger people to infection from the same microbes. Yet doctors tend not to investigate pneumonias in the very old as thoroughly as they do in younger people. So some cases of inhalation anthrax may be missed in old people.
"If it weren't for the recent number of cases, and I had a 90-year-old lady who came in with fulminant pneumonia, and she had a Gram positive rod in her sputum, I would assume it was a bacillus contaminant species and would not have pursued it," and neither would many other doctors, said Dr. Marvin Turck, the editor of The Journal of Infectious Diseases.
"We have a lot of similar cases," said Dr. Turck, who is a professor of medicine at the University of Washington. He also said: "It would be an inappropriate way of using resources if every laboratory tried to identify every bacillus species on every sputum. But having said that, I still don't know how prevalent anthrax is in the community, though I know it is not a large number."
The traditional, standard practice was to obtain sputum and other secretions from patients with suspected pneumonia and other respiratory infections so cultures could be started before antibiotics were given.
But doctors now often do not obtain cultures from patients with suspected pneumonia or other conditions before prescribing antibiotics. In selecting the antibiotics, doctors often use a shotgun approach and use drugs that will treat a broad array of microbes, including the classical ones, like pneumococci, and atypical ones, like B. anthracis, Dr. Turck said.
Dr. Joseph S. Pagano, emeritus director of the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina, said recent changes in practice might lead to undetected anthrax cases. Dr. Pagano said that earlier in his career, when he was an infectious disease expert, he would have been reprimanded "if I ever dared to put somebody on antibiotics without first obtaining a culture and making a diagnosis because that approach makes you less likely to miss something real important."
Dr. Pagano also said he "deplored the idea of giving a patient antibiotics for a fever without even having an idea about the possibilities that might be causing it."
"But that type of sharp diagnostic thinking hardly goes on anymore," in part because doctors tend to be impatient about going through the process, Dr. Pagano said.
Dr. Turck, of the University of Washington, said that even when doctors in teaching hospitals obtained appropriate cultures, the particular cause of many pneumonias was not identified. Most pneumonias are assumed to be the result of pneumococcal bacteria, Dr. Turck said, "but about half the time you do not prove any specific microbe as the cause."
One reason is that even in the best hospitals the sputum that is collected for testing often is mostly saliva from the mouth and not secretions from the lungs, making it difficult to be sure the offending microbe is present in the sample, Dr. Turck said.
Correctly detecting the cause of an infection often requires diligence, shoe leather epidemiology and some luck.
For example, an outbreak of skin diphtheria affected more than 1,100 people in the skid row population of Seattle from 1972 to 1982. The first cases were detected "only by chance because the skin lesions did not respond to the antibiotics initially given," said Dr. Turck, who was an author of a scientific paper reporting the outbreak.
For other infections, outbreaks were caused by previously unknown microbes. Two examples are Legionnaire's disease in Philadelphia in 1976 and hantavirus pulmonary infection in New Mexico in 1993. Subsequent research showed that both microbes had caused illness that was attributed to other conditions in the past.
Inhalation anthrax causes bleeding and swollen lymph nodes in an area behind and between the lungs known as the mediastinum. The damage is so distinctive that pathologists would quickly detect them in an autopsy. But with a striking decline in the number of autopsies performed, such damage could easily escape detection.
Dr. Gilbert, the infectious diseases society president, said that although "it is worrisome that we don't do as many autopsies as we used to do in people that die with unidentified illnesses, the reason we don't do autopsies is that our pre-mortem diagnostic capabilities are so, so much better."
Nevertheless, studies have shown that such diagnostic tests often fail to detect serious conditions during life.
Reflecting on the changes in practice, Dr. Pagano said, "Maybe one of the good things that could come out of this is that infectious disease physicians will sharpen their thinking, realize the need to go back to basics and devote more time to avoid missing a rare case."

Re "The Tourism Crisis," by Bob Herbert (column, Nov. 29):
I work close to where the World Trade Center stood. 
These days, when asked how things are, I reply, "Returning to normal." But even as I say that, I know that nothing will ever be the same again. I did not lose a close one in the attacks; I did not even lose my job. But do I feel sad? Of course I do. I grieve with New York and the rest of the world.
 Yet I take it upon myself to play a part in the reviving of a fallen people. If tourists won't come because they're afraid to fly, I play "tourist." 
 To those of us who had the good fortune to keep our jobs, let's get us all out of this vicious circle of no job, no money, no spending, bad economy, no job. Let's play tourist!

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Two leading forecasters say spending will remain low for another year but will not get any worse.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliot 

 BODY:
REMEMBER the old jingle for Alka-Seltzer promising that "relief is just a swallow away?" Well, two leading forecasters of advertising spending warned Madison Avenue yesterday that much gulping would be required before a turnaround slowly begins.
 Relief is almost a year away, said the forecasters, John Perriss and Robert J. Coen, who offered their downbeat predictions at the opening session of the 29th annual UBS Warburg Media Week conference in Midtown Manhattan. Even so, they said, conditions were unlikely to deteriorate before then. 
 "This is as bad as it gets on a global basis," said Mr. Perriss, chief executive at the Zenith Optimedia Group in London. "We think we're now at the bottom of this particular cycle." 
It was the third time in a year that each forecaster had lowered estimates for ad spending as economies in important markets like Britain, France and Germany deteriorated almost immediately after marketers started cutting ad budgets in the United States.
Their estimates are in line with others made recently as the advertising industry searches for signs of a recovery after a miserable year. Ad spending is usually watched carefully as an indicator of the strength -- or weakness -- of the economy.
"The economy at the end of the year 2002 will certainly be a lot stronger than it is now," said Mr. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at Universal McCann in New York, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
Until then, he said, worldwide ad spending this year will fall 1.7 percent from 2000, to $456.1 billion from a record $463.9 billion, bringing the first global decline in advertising "since the World War II days."
In the United States, Mr. Cohen estimates ad spending in 2001 of $233.7 billion, down 4.1 percent from $243.7 billion in 2000. This would be the first decline since 1961 and the largest decline since 1938. Overseas, he expects ad spending of $222.4 billion, up only 1 percent from $220.2 billion in 2000.
"It was tough for anybody in the advertising industry," Mr. Coen said. Among reasons for the decline domestically, he added, were huge cutbacks in ad spending by dot-coms, to $2.4 billion this year from $5.6 billion last year, along with the "terrible state" of important categories like telecommunications, computers, brokerage firms and airlines.
For 2002, Mr. Coen is predicting a worldwide total of $466.1 billion, up 2.2 percent from 2001. That breaks out as follows: United States ad spending of $239.3 billion, up 2.4 percent from 2001, and overseas ad spending of $226.8 billion, up 2 percent from 2001.
Two factors that will stimulate ad spending in this country in 2002, Mr. Coen said, are the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and the competitive Congressional races next fall.
"If you're way outspent by your opponent, you're not going to win the election," he added, alluding to the New York City mayoral contest last month, in which Michael R. Bloomberg spent $69 million and won.
As a percentage of gross domestic product, Mr. Coen said, ad spending, which reached a record 2.45 percent last year, will fall to 2.28 percent in 2001 and 2.27 percent in 2002.
Mr. Perriss said that "better times" would arrive "from the back end of 2002 going into 2003." After a decline in worldwide ad spending this year of 3.4 percent from 2000, he added, there will be a slight increase in 2002, of 0.8 percent.
"Next year will be better," Mr. Perriss said, "but not a boom." Unlike the decline in ad spending, which was unparalleled in its rapidity and scale, he said, the recovery will gather momentum gradually, with increases in worldwide ad spending of 3.6 percent in 2003 and 5.3 percent in 2004.
Mr. Perriss's forecast differs from Mr. Coen's in that Mr. Perriss estimates there will be two consecutive years of declining ad spending in the United States, with decreases of 6 percent this year and 1.5 percent next year. Mr. Perriss then forecasts increases of 1.6 percent in 2003 and 4.3 percent in 2004; Mr. Coen made no predictions beyond 2002.
As if to underscore the grimness of the current situation, the Cordiant Communications Group in London, which owns Zenith Optimedia jointly with the Publicis Groupe in Paris, lowered its 2001 revenue forecast yesterday for the second time in two months, to a decline of 9 percent from a decline of 5 percent. Cordiant also announced a work force reduction of more than 1,100, or 11 percent.
"With 2001 in decline in virtually all corners of the globe, a recovery is set in late 2002 or 2003," said Leland A. Westerfield, a media analyst at UBS Warburg who attended the forecasters' presentations.
"In the near term, the chasm is still quite deep," he said, so "I couldn't see it sooner."
When ad spending improves, Mr. Westerfield said, media like the largest broadcast and cable television networks and radio will probably recover first, followed by magazines and newspapers.
Another analyst, Jack Myers, also adjusted his forecasts yesterday. Mr. Myers, chief economist at Myers in New York, which publishes media and research newsletters, now estimates American ad spending this year will fall 6.8 percent from 2000, rather than 6.6 percent, and fall 5.7 percent in 2002, rather than 6 percent. For 2003, he predicts an increase of 1.2 percent, and for 2004, he predicts an increase of 3.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Economic Reports May Be Signs That Recovery Is on the Horizon 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
Consumer spending surged and construction unexpectedly rose in October, while manufacturing improved last month, according to data released today. The three reports signaled that the economy might be bouncing back from the recession, the first since 1991.
 Spending increased a record 2.9 percent, Commerce Department figures showed, which was more than analysts had expected. Construction of houses, offices and government projects was up 1.9 percent, the government said, contrary to expectations of a drop. 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management said that its factory index rose to 44.5 in November from 39.8 in October, a sign that industry may be reaching the end of a 16-month slump. Analysts had expected a reading of 41.7. The reports suggest that the economy may be less weak in the final quarter of the year than economists had forecast after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
"Economic recovery will be apparent in the first quarter of 2002, though the actual recovery is probably already under way," said Edgar Peters, chief investment officer at PanAgora Asset Management in Boston, a company that manages $12 billion.
The October rise in consumer spending followed a 1.7 percent decline in September, the Commerce Department said. Incomes totaled $8.77 trillion in October when measured at an annual rate, the same as in September. Incomes were restrained by the biggest drop in wages in almost eight years as a result of a large number of layoffs in recent months.
The rise in spending combined with no increase in incomes led to a drop in the personal savings rate, to a record-low 0.2 percent from 4.6 percent the previous month. The indicator weighs current income from wages, salaries, businesses and government payments against spending. It does not account for borrowed money, income from investments or withdrawals from prior savings.
While the stagnation in incomes raised doubts about whether Americans would sustain their spending spree, the October consumption increase gave the fourth quarter a strong start. Likewise, the $863.5 billion annual pace of construction spending in October will add to the fourth-quarter gross domestic product. The rise in the factory index suggests that gains may continue.
The factory index, while showing improved conditions, still pointed to a contraction because its reading was below 50. The index has stayed below that level since dropping to 49.9 in August 2000.
A component of the index, which gauges new orders, rose to 48.8 from 38.8, the biggest one-month gain in at least 20 years. The production index climbed to 47.1 from 40.9. The total index had reached a high for this year of 47.9 in August, a signal that a recovery was in the making before Sept. 11.

HEADLINE: H.M.O.'s Flee Medicare Despite Rise In Payments 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
The federal policy of increasing payments to health maintenance organizations in the hope of persuading them to stay in the Medicare program has largely been a failure, federal investigators said today.
 The investigators, from the General Accounting Office, said that H.M.O.'s had continued to leave Medicare and that very few had returned to the program, despite the higher payments. 
 Some health maintenance organizations said they would stay in Medicare next year, but were planning very large increases in premiums, co-payments and other fees.
About 5.6 million people, or 14 percent of the 40 million Medicare beneficiaries, are in H.M.O.'s. The new head of Medicare, Thomas A. Scully, said in June that he and the Bush administration wanted to have 30 percent of Medicare patients in such health plans by 2005. 
In each of the last two years, Congress increased Medicare payments to H.M.O.'s in an effort to reverse their exodus from the program. But the General Accounting Office told Congress today that the higher payments had had "little effect on the number of beneficiaries with access" to managed-care plans.
For the typical H.M.O, Medicare payments increased an average of $16 a person per month this year, although the increase was much higher for some plans and lower for others. Before then, the minimum monthly government payment was $415.
In a report to Congress, the accounting office said that many health plans had used the money to increase payments to hospitals and other health-care providers, but that relatively few had enhanced benefits for the elderly. 
Congress is again weighing plans to increase payments to health plans, which have been popular with beneficiaries because they cover prescription drugs and other items not in the original Medicare program.
Susan M. Pisano, a spokeswoman for the American Association of Health Plans, the main lobby for H.M.O.'s, said the increase in Medicare payments had not been enough to offset cuts made in 1997. 
"Medical inflation has outstripped the increases in Medicare reimbursement," Ms. Pisano said. "Costs are rising 8 to 12 percent a year. Some hospitals are demanding increases of 30 percent in the payments they receive from health plans. But for many plans, Medicare reimbursement has been rising only 2 or 3 percent a year."
Democrats said they found such arguments unpersuasive. 
Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, said: "Congress continues to pour money into the coffers of Medicare H.M.O.'s in hopes of providing better care to America's seniors. But the H.M.O.'s keep stranding hundreds of thousands of beneficiaries annually by either leaving the program or reducing benefits. It is foolish even to consider throwing more money at this failed system."
On Jan. 1, 536,000 elderly people are to be dropped from health maintenance organizations that are curtailing their participation in Medicare. Those actions are being taken after three years in which health plans dropped more than 1.6 million Medicare beneficiaries, 933,600 this year, 327,000 at the start of last year and 407,000 in 1999.
Congress had hoped that H.M.O.'s would use some of the new federal money to provide more generous benefits. But many have cut back benefits, saying Medicare payments were still far too low.
Next month, one plan, run by the UnitedHealth Group, is to introduce a huge new co-payment, charging Medicare beneficiaries in Wisconsin $295 for each day in the hospital, subject to a limit of $4,800 a year on all out-of-pocket costs. At present, the company does not charge any co-payment for such inpatient hospital care. United had originally wanted to charge $350 a day, but in negotiations with the government it agreed to the lower amount.
Representative Gerald D. Kleczka, Democrat of Wisconsin, said, "My constituents and I are outraged at the new co-payment, which is unacceptably high." 
Stephanie Sue Stein, director of the Milwaukee County Department on Aging, said the higher co-payments would cause havoc for 16,000 elderly people who relied on the United health plan in Wisconsin. 
"It looks to us as though the benefit changes for 2002 are designed to discourage enrollment of beneficiaries who have health care needs," Ms. Stein said. 
The president of government programs at United, Richard Jones, said it did not have much choice. "Medical cost inflation has exceeded 20 percent a year over the last few years and has caused mounting financial losses," he said. "We are faced with a Hobson's choice. We can either stay in markets by reducing benefits or exit and lose the chance to serve Medicare beneficiaries."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Fewer Donors and Less Cash for Neediest Cases Fund

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
As the annual 90-day appeal for The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund reached its 30th day yesterday, accountants reported that the fund had received $774,831 less than it had by the same point last year, a drop of 22 percent. They also reported that 2,069 people have given to the fund this year, 42 percent fewer donors than last year at the 30-day mark.
 While some of the decline may be the result of a change in the timing of this year's appeal, officials at The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers the fund, attribute much of the decline to the difficulties of raising money for causes not related to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
 Months before the terrorist attacks, officials who run the fund, in consultation with the seven local charities it supports, decided to begin this year's annual appeal for donations three weeks earlier than the starting date that had been used since 1980 -- the Sunday after Thanksgiving. 
The timing of the appeal was meant to coincide with the good will of the holiday season, but so far, it appears to have had little effect on the pace of giving. 
In fact, the pace has slowed. Officials at the Times Company Foundation, and some officials at the seven charities, said that many people who contributed to funds set up to help victims of the attack, including The New York Times 9/11 Neediest Fund, may be deciding not to spend more on another charity this year.
"Some of the decrease could be due to the fact that we started earlier, and people do wait until the end of December to give for tax purposes," said Alicia A. Erickson, the financial analyst who accounts for donations to the fund, "but probably a lot of that is because so many people have given to the 9/11 fund."
The charities supported by the Neediest Cases Fund report a similar pattern in their own fund-raising efforts. "There's been so much giving in the aftermath of 9/11 that people feel themselves not in a position to give additionally," said Donna A. Santarsiero, executive director of the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of the charities supported by the fund. 
Though the 9/11 fund, which as of yesterday had received $47.1 million and spent $17.7 million, ended its active appeal on Oct. 11, money continues to flow into it at a faster pace than to the Neediest Cases Fund. Last week, the 9/11 fund received $375,460 from 450 donors, while the Neediest Cases Fund received $198,096 from 513 donors.
The appeal for donations to the Neediest Cases Fund lasts for three months, but the fund accepts donations all year. Of the $2,676,659 received by the fund so far, $2,143,774 was given before Sept. 11.
While some agencies supported by the fund reported that giving has decreased, others said that contributions have remained steady. 
"We have found that giving remains strong and that 9/11 has served to underscore the importance of community, and of caring for the those that are most in need," said John Ruskay, chief executive of UJA-Federation of New York. "In some ways, paradoxically, we have found that the horror of 9/11 has led to a reframing for many of their own values and commitments, and has led many to feel that they want to help."
Jack Rosenthal, the president of The Times Company Foundation, said that while money donated to the 9/11 Neediest Fund goes to help people who are suffering because of the destruction of the trade center, money given to the Neediest Cases Fund goes where it does every year, to relieve desperation among the poor people of New York City.
"The money is not fungible," Mr. Rosenthal said. "The generosity to the 9/11 Neediest Fund doesn't reduce by a nickel the need of the poor people of New York. If anything, their need this year increases because of the recession and the welfare cutoff that went into effect Friday."
Mr. Rosenthal said that the foundation will sponsor an art sale at the Luhring Augustine Gallery in Chelsea from Jan. 15 to 19 to benefit the Neediest Cases Fund. "We feel a duty to do everything we can to call public attention to the campaign, and we've won the assistance of a dozen truly world-famous artists who have agreed to participate in a benefit sale of their work." 
Officials at the fund hope that with the additional attention, more people will follow in the steps of those like Susan Ralston of Manhattan. 
Enclosed with her check for $500 given on Nov. 19, Ms. Ralston wrote: "I am increasing my contribution to the Neediest Cases Fund from $100 to $500 to help make up for any falling off of contributions as a result of the outpouring of generosity to the 9/11 charities."
Perhaps a letter from Mollie Torras of the East Village says it best. Along with her $10 gift to the Neediest Cases Fund on Nov. 27, Ms. Toras wrote, "I hope the fund will soon catch up to the '00 level."

HEADLINE: New Plan Announced For Area of Rockaways 

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW 

 BODY:
Almost four decades after the city razed the last crumbling summer bungalows in the Arverne section of the Rockaways, officials yesterday announced a new plan to develop a large portion of the 300 acres of vacant beachfront property in that Queens neighborhood.
 The latest plan, a $350 million project to construct one- and two-family houses, midrise apartment buildings, a retail center and a school on 100 acres of the Rockaway peninsula, comes after a series of other plans for the 60-square-block area failed to take hold. Among the others were Arverne-by-the-Sea, a 1989 plan to build 7,500 apartments in the neighborhood, and Destination Technodome, a 1997 plan for a $1 billion sports, entertainment and hotel complex, featuring an indoor ski slope, skating rinks and movie theaters. 
 But the earlier visions fell victim to economic troubles or developers who pulled out, leaving one of the largest undeveloped urban oceanfront lots in the nation empty since the 1960's, when Mayor John V. Lindsay ordered the demolition of the remaining summer cottages there. 
Announcing yesterday that a Long Island developer had been selected to build 2,300 residential housing units, 250,000 square feet of retail space, a day care center, a community center with a swimming pool and an 800-seat charter school that would be run by a private company, city officials described the latest plan as a scaled-down version of the 1989 proposal and said they were confident it would move ahead.
They also said that because the latest plan is less ambitious than previous plans and the Rockaways have become more appealing to home buyers, they did not expect the new development to stumble as others have. 
"This has been a long time in coming and we have had some false starts," said Claire Shulman, the Queens borough president, who joined Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and other officials for the announcement at City Hall yesterday. "But we now have a very good proposal that we believe will give a shot in the arm to the Rockaways."
Officials have resurrected the name of the 1989 plan, Arverne-by-the-Sea, for the new project, which is being developed by Benjamin-Beechwood L.L.C., a joint venture of the Benjamin Development Company of Garden City, N.Y., and the Beechwood organization, based in Jericho, N.Y. The 100-acre site being developed is bounded by Beach 62nd Street on the east, Beach 74th Street on the west, the Rockaway Freeway on the north and the boardwalk and the ocean on the south. 
Officials said they were still looking into similar plans for the remaining 200 acres of the vacant city-owned land in Arverne, called the Arverne Urban Renewal Area, but had no specific proposals. 
Bruised after losing scores of relatives, neighbors and friends in the World Trade Center attack in September and then watching an airplane crash into the middle of a Rockaway neighborhood last month, Rockaway residents and officials said they were buoyed by yesterday's announcement. 
"After what Rockaway has gone through after the last two months, this certainly is good news for us," said Jonathan L. Gaska, district manager of Community Board 14, which has debated and voted on various plans for Arverne over the years. "This is something that can be done; it's not this grandiose Disney-like vision."
However, some said they had seen so many unrealized plans for Arverne and other parts of the peninsula -- separated from Queens and Brooklyn by toll bridges over the Jamaica Bay and from Manhattan by a 90-minute subway ride -- that they were skeptical.
"We've been shown a lot of pretty pictures in our time," said Liz Sulik, a resident of Belle Harbor, the neighborhood where an American Airlines flight crashed last month, and president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Rockaways. "This has to be more than just a pretty picture. It has to work."
Officials estimated that construction on the first phase of the project would begin by June 2002.

HEADLINE: Sotheby's Case Ends on Issue of Character 

BYLINE:  By RALPH BLUMENTHAL and CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
Summing up their cases in the criminal conspiracy trial of Sotheby's former chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, the lead prosecutor portrayed him yesterday as a devious price fixer who cut an illegal deal with Christie's, the archrival auction house, while a defense lawyer called him the innocent dupe of a scheming deputy desperate to avoid prison.
 Deriding what he called "the dumb, hungry Taubman story" -- defense witnesses had testified that the defendant was more interested in what was for lunch than in the company's profits -- the prosecutor, John G. Greene of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said the evidence showed that Mr. Taubman conspired with his Christie's counterpart at 12 secret meetings in the mid-1990's. Mr. Greene asserted that he then directed the auction house's chief executive, now his main accuser at the trial, Diana D. Brooks, to carry out his orders to fix commission rates with her counterpart at Christie's in a scheme that cost customers millions. 
 But a lawyer for Mr. Taubman, Robert B. Fiske Jr., said Ms. Brooks had lied so often to associates and investigators to cover up her own admitted role in the scheme that she was "a walking reasonable doubt." 
He told the jury, "If you don't believe Dede Brooks beyond a reasonable doubt, you must acquit."
Throughout, Mr. Taubman, 76, a multimillionaire shopping center developer and art collector, sat impassively at the defense table, listening to proceedings on a wireless headset, gazing at the jury, sucking on a mint and, now and then, closing his eyes for a catnap.
The final pleas to the jury came on the 14th day of a trial in Manhattan federal court that is the climax of a four-year investigation that unearthed one of the biggest art scandals in recent history and exposed a pattern of cozy, lucrative and often illegal dealings between two houses that had often been portrayed as cutthroat competitors.
The trial involved 5 government witnesses, including Ms. Brooks, and 14 defense witnesses, including a federal appeals court judge. 
Among the government witnesses was the former chief executive of Christie's, Christopher M. Davidge, who broke open the case at the end of 1999 when he surrendered hundreds of pages of internal records documenting a scheme between the two houses to increase lagging profits by eliminating costly incentives to clients and raising rates to sellers. 
Mr. Davidge, who along with Christie's obtained amnesty from prosecution, and Ms. Brooks, who pleaded guilty in hopes of winning leniency, both later testified that they acted at the behest of their bosses, Sir Anthony Tennant, the former chairman of Christie's, and Mr. Taubman. Both chairmen were later indicted, Mr. Taubman pleading not guilty and going to trial, and Sir Anthony thwarting extradition by refusing to leave his home in England.
Even before the trial began, the effects of the scandal had rocked the auction industry. Mr. Taubman stepped down as Sotheby's chairman (he is still the company's controlling shareholder), Sotheby's pleaded guilty to antitrust violations and paid a $45 million criminal fine, and both auction houses together paid aggrieved customers a civil settlement of more than $512 million. 
An argument over a 225-year-old quotation the government sought to place, along with chart, before the jury set the combative tone yesterday. The chart depicted private meetings the government said Mr. Taubman held illegally with his counterpart at Christie's, Sir Anthony Tennant. The quotation was from the economist Adam Smith in 1776: "People in the same trade seldom meet together even for merriment and diversion, but a conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public or in some contrivance to raise prices."
Judge Daniels ruled that since Smith was not a witness in the case, the chart should not include his testimony, but that Mr. Greene was free to cite the remark in his summation, which he did.
Given what has already been admitted by the auction houses, Ms. Brooks and Mr. Davidge, both sides readily agreed there had been a price-fixing conspiracy. "The only question," Mr. Greene said, "is whether Alfred Taubman was engaged in that conspiracy." Reminding jurors of the 12 private meetings that Mr. Taubman's diaries and calendars showed he had with Sir Anthony between 1993 and 1996, the prosecutor asserted that that Mr. Taubman was.
Some of the notations were in coded form, he said. "If these meetings were legitimate," he said, why did Mr. Taubman never mention them to his chief executive at the time, Michael Ainslie, who was Ms. Brooks's predecessor? "But he didn't say a word about them," Mr. Greene went on. "Why was that? Because he was discussing things that were unlawful to discuss."
Mr. Fiske, in his summation, said Mr. Taubman was not trying to hide anything by listing Sir Anthony as "Tony" or "a gentleman" among his appointments. "They were social friends," he said. Others Mr. Taubman met were noted in similar ways, Mr. Fiske said. He said the discussions concerned harmless trade issues.
He even offered the jury a list of meetings Mr. Taubman had at his apartment, with people like the restaurateur Warner LeRoy and Sally Ganz, the famed collector whose estate was eventually sold at Christie's.
Mr. Fiske noted inconsistencies in the document and ridiculed it. "Mr. Taubman and Mr. Tennant are supposed to be up there at 10,000 feet directing things," he said. But the only conspirators were Ms. Brooks and Mr. Davidge, he contended. 
Much of the prosecution's case relied on Ms. Brooks, who testified that Mr. Taubman agreed with Sir Anthony that both companies would raise their rates to auction sellers and make the new, higher charges nonnegotiable, depriving customers of their leverage in bargaining for better rates. She testified that she and Mr. Davidge were to work out the details. 
Mr. Greene argued that in the past she had had to lie to protect the conspiracy, but that once in court, she spoke the truth.
Long before the trial, when lawyers for Sotheby's, prompted by the federal investigation, questioned her about any collusion, of course she denied it, Mr. Greene argued, adding: "She'd be disgraced. She and Taubman would have to resign and face criminal charges." 
Mr. Fiske attacked Ms. Brooks's credibility, calling Mr. Taubman her "get-out-of-jail-free card."
He also recalled that a Sotheby's lawyer, Donaldson Pillsbury, disputed her account of a remark she said Mr. Taubman made to her. At one point in her appearance, Ms. Brooks testified that Mr. Taubman had told her after the conspiracy began to unwind, "you'll look good in stripes." Mr. Pillsbury, who was also at the meeting, testified that Mr. Taubman made the remark self-mockingly about himself: "How'd you think I'd look in stripes?" 
Mr. Fiske said: "When you go back into the jury room and ask yourself if she's to be believed here, remember how she lied. Isn't she trying to con everybody in the jury room the way she conned Sotheby's lawyers?"
But Mr. Greene had the last word, and he said the jury did not need to find Mr. Taubman guilty beyond all doubt, just a reasonable doubt. He said Mr. Taubman kept his diaries because "he never expected they would be subpoenaed."
"He thought he was above the law," he said. He argued that Mr. Taubman could not have been as ignorant of the plotting as his defense contended. "You don't become a millionaire without knowing how to read the bottom line." 
The jury is expected to get the case today.

HEADLINE: China Will Accept Soybeans From U.S. 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
China has agreed to import United States soybeans temporarily while it adopts new rules governing purchases of gene-altered crops, the United States trade representative's office said today. 
 In June, China blocked imports of genetically altered soybeans, jeopardizing a $1-billion-a-year export market for the United States. 
President Bush raised the trade dispute with Chinese leaders at an economic conference in Shanghai in October. Though sales of soybeans from the United States have resumed, China had not officially agreed to any interim resolution until now, the trade office said. 
 China will accept soybeans from the United States if they are accompanied by a government certificate saying they are safe for the environment, safe for humans to eat and safe for livestock feed, the trade office said.
About 68 percent of the soybean crop in the United States is genetically engineered, principally to make the plants resistant to the Roundup herbicide produced by Monsanto. 
China has imported or arranged to buy 2.05 million tons of soybeans from the United States since Sept. 1, the beginning of the current sales season.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE HOLDINGS; 
Enron Causes 5 Major Japanese Money Market Funds to Plunge

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
Shares of five major money market funds in Japan have fallen below their face value because of extensive Enron holdings, and the stocks of the companies that manage the funds plunged today.
 The funds are managed by some of Japan's largest banks and brokerage firms. Shares of UFJ Holdings, a banking giant, plunged nearly 10 percent, and Nikko Securities, a leading brokerage firm, slid 3.4 percent. Each ran major funds with big positions in Enron bonds. The weakness in financial stocks helped push the Nikkei 225-stock index down 3.1 percent. 
 The stampede left investors with few places to turn for steady returns and low risk. In Japan, bank deposits pay almost no interest, so money market funds have been popular with pension funds and other investors that seek security with a reasonable return. In the United States, each share of a money market fund generally carries a face value of $1 and an implicit guarantee that the price will not fall below that amount, preserving investors' principal; there have been a few exceptions.
The losses by the Japanese money funds on Enron bonds led skittish investors to withdraw cash last week, producing a net outflow for November of some 3 trillion yen ($24.2 billion).
An alternative for investors is Japanese government bonds, but they, too, have given investors a scare in recent weeks. Major rating agencies have lowered Japan's sovereign credit rating and said more cuts may be coming. The country's debt rating is now near the point where banks that hold government bonds will have to reserve capital against the chance of a default.
"This is a big headache for safe-haven investors," said Akio Yoshino, head of investment research and chief economist at SG Yamaichi Asset Management in Tokyo. "Investors are becoming very keen about avoiding credit risk, so brokers who recommended these trusts will continue to see a huge outflow," he said, referring to the funds.
Managers of funds are hoping to shore up the confidence of investors by disclosing their bondholdings and other assets more frequently -- they are now obliged to report on them only twice a year -- and perhaps by restricting themselves to issuers with credit ratings of A or better, analysts said.
If the money market funds stop buying debt of lower-rated companies, it could be a serious blow to Japan's steel makers, retailers and other highly indebted companies.

HEADLINE: Fed Now Says '02 Recovery Will Be Slow 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON with LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
Federal Reserve officials say they expect a modest and gradual recovery in the economy next year rather than the quick turnaround many investors and forecasters are expecting. That suggests the central bankers are open to at least one further interest rate cut and may keep rates lower for longer than financial markets anticipate.
 The officials said the recovery could be tempered by a variety of forces, from high levels of consumer and corporate debt to the reluctance of companies to invest in new factories and equipment at a time of uncertainty in the economy and the fight against terrorism. 
 "I am of the opinion that the recovery will not begin until mid-2002," said Anthony M. Santomero, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. "I think the forecasters are overly optimistic." 
Many private economists are predicting that a rebound will begin no later than the spring, and perhaps much earlier. Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y., said he expected slightly positive economic growth in the current quarter, after a return to relatively healthy growth rates next year.
"I'm looking for a reasonably robust recovery that will surprise people with its speed and magnitude," Mr. Shepherdson said.
Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm in St. Louis, said economic growth should resume in the first quarter of next year. "Our forecast is for what would be called a V-shaped recovery," he said, referring to the prospect that the downturn that began in March will be followed by a strong upturn soon.
Fed officials said they also saw evidence that the recession could be coming to an end relatively soon. But in several interviews, some granted on conditions of anonymity, most stressed their belief that the turnaround was likely to be slow in getting off the ground and that any real recovery might not begin in earnest until summer. They suggested that the economy might end up being more sluggish than recent statistics suggest.
Even the more optimistic among them said there were considerable risks that could hinder the economy through much of next year. Before Sept. 11, many Fed officials were predicting that the economy was on the verge of stabilizing if not recovering.
On the plus side, the officials pointed to shrinking inventories, low energy prices, a rebound in the stock market, relatively strong consumer demand and the effects of the interest rate cuts and tax reductions already in the pipeline. And there was fresh evidence today that the economy might be close to bottoming out. 
Personal spending in October rose by 2.9 percent, a record, in part because consumers took advantage of zero-interest-rate financing offers to buy automobiles, the Commerce Department reported. Construction spending in October increased 1.9 percent, the first monthly rise in six months. And there were signs that the worst might be over for manufacturing, with a survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management showing that the dropoff in manufacturing activity was slowing.
But most Fed officials remain worried that any rebound will be weak, at least initially.
In a speech last week, Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor, said his view was that "the economy should gradually strengthen over next year."
The main force inhibiting a strong comeback, Fed officials say, is the perception among businesses that the rates of return available to them from investing in new equipment remain too low given the uncertainty about demand for their products, the overall health of the economy and the risks associated with the campaign against terrorism.
In this view, the economy will not begin rolling again until capital investment rebounds. Capital investment was a primary driver of the economic boom of the late 1990's. But it fell off sharply starting last year, both a victim and a cause of a general reassessment of the potential for technology to improve business efficiency and profitability.
To the degree that businesses choose to trim capital spending in the face of economic risk and uncertainty, lower interest rates do not help much. Instead, Fed officials said, the return to more normal levels of capital spending will come about steadily -- but slowly -- as demand picks up and terrorism-inspired fear and risk diminish.
"High-tech equipment investment at elevated rates of return will, most likely, resume once very high uncertainty premiums recede to more normal levels," Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told Congress in October.
Fed officials did not say whether they would cut interest rates for an 11th time this year when they meet next Tuesday, and Mr. Greenspan did not shed any light on his intentions on interest rates in a speech here today about globalization.
Mr. Greenspan also met for lunch today with President Bush to discuss the economy. "The president was interested in listening to the chairman's points of view on the economy," said Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary.
Asked if any specific development in the economy had led to the session, the first since the economy officially was declared in recession last month, Mr. Fleischer said "the president has the economy on his mind despite developments around the world."
Investors are betting that the Fed will reduce its benchmark interest rate once more next week, to 1.75 percent from 2 percent. But investors are also betting that the Fed will reverse course next year and push its federal funds target rate up starting in late winter as the economy gains strength.
But the question of how soon the Fed will start raising rates again turns on how soon the recovery starts and how strong any turnaround will be. Fed officials are more cautious on that score than some other economists, including those inside the Bush administration. Testifying to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress last week, R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, said the notion that businesses continued to be burdened by an overhang of excess capital "seems unduly pessimistic." 
As a general matter, Mr. Hubbard said, "any capital overhang is likely to have been eliminated by the weak investment performance in 2001."
 --------------------

Remarks by Greenspan
 WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 (Reuters) -- Terrorism poses a challenge to the gains made by increasingly close global economic ties, Alan Greenspan reiterated today. 
Mr. Greenspan did not touch on the the nation's economic or monetary outlook in his remarks, which were largely a repeat of a speech he delivered on Oct. 24.
"If we allow terrorism to undermine our freedom of action, we could reverse at least part of the palpable gains achieved by postwar globalization," he said. "It is incumbent upon us not to allow that to happen."
Mr. Greenspan also said he hoped a new round of international negotiations aimed at lower trade barriers would "go forward expeditiously."

HEADLINE: GOLF; 
PGA Tour Has Courses For High School Junior

BYLINE:  By CLIFTON BROWN 

DATELINE: WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., Dec. 3 

 BODY:
At 17 years old, facing the pressure of one of golf's most dreaded tournaments, Ty Tryon became the youngest player to earn a PGA Tour card, shooting a six-under-par 66 today during the final round of the Tour's qualifying tournament. It was an uncanny performance for someone too young to rent a car, too young to drink alcohol legally, but too confident and too determined to believe his dream would not come true.
 Tryon played his best golf when he needed to, making a final-round charge at Bear Lakes Country Club that lifted him into history. Only the top 36 finishers in the original 167-player field earned Tour cards, and Tryon began the last of the six rounds tied for 50th, a difficult position for a veteran, not to mention Tryon, who missed his 11th-grade classes today and who has an English paper due Friday at Dr. Phillips High School in Orlando. 
 But instead of succumbing to the pressure, Tryon seemed inspired by it. In his best round of the grueling 108-hole event, Tryon had an eagle, four birdies and no bogeys, showing power and accuracy off the tee, control with his approach shots, a steady putting stroke and solid course management. Tryon did not make a double bogey in six days, and when inside the ropes, he seemed almost oblivious to the attention and unfazed by the situation.
Tryon finished 18 under par, tied for 23rd and one stroke ahead of the qualifying cutoff of 17 under. Pat Perez won the tournament at 27 under, and notable players earning Tour cards included Gary Nicklaus (22 under) and Russ Cochran (23 under), who shot a final-round 64, including a 29 on the front nine.
Tryon said he knew he had done something special. In his first attempt to join the Tour, Tryon advanced through three stages of qualifying and earned a place on golf's most prestigious circuit, where he will compete against Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, David Duval and scores of players more than twice his age. While it remains to be seen how Tryon will fare, he wanted an opportunity to compete against the best, and he earned it, getting his Tour card at a younger age than Sergio Garcia, who earned his at 19, and Woods, who earned his at 20.
"Hopefully I've won a few people over by doing this," said Tryon, who is aware that several players have questioned his readiness for the Tour. "I went through every stage and I did it the hard way. I knew I'd get some flak for it, but that's the way it goes. I was totally ready.
"I didn't really feel that much pressure. A lot of these guys have families, wives, children, so many expenses, this is their livelihood. I'm with my parents. I don't really pay for much. I don't have any pressure economically. I just had the pressure of wanting to be on Tour next year."
Tour rules forbid players from becoming full-fledged members until their 18th birthday, and Tryon will not be 18 until June. He is eligible to play 12 Tour events before June -- 7 with sponsor exemptions and as many as 5 with top-10 finishes or Monday qualifying.
Tryon turned professional after last summer's United States Amateur, a decision that meant he was forgoing high school and college competition. He has since signed with IMG and picked up endorsements from Callaway Golf and Target Stores that are reportedly worth as much as $1 million a year.
At 5 feet 11 inches, with a wiry but muscular build and size 13 shoes, Tryon is still growing, just as his game is still maturing. He has not decided where he will play his first event next year, but the current plan is for him to fit his golf schedule around his academic schedule. 
Today's performance will only increase the buzz around a teenager who has shown no fear while competing. Tryon made the cut in both Tour events he played this year as an amateur, with a tie for 39th place at the Honda Classic and a tie for 37th place at the B.C. Open, in which he shot an opening-round 65 to share the lead.
That performance at the B.C. Open convinced Tryon he could compete with the best. Several prominent European players have turned professional as teenagers and succeeded, including Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer and Garcia. But in the United States, the longtime norm has been for the best players to attend college for at least a while. Tryon made a daring decision to break that mold. 
Tryon's father, Bill, watched proudly today with his wife, Georgia, and two of their three other children, and he insisted that his son would handle the expectations.
Asked how he expected his son to fare next year on Tour, Bill Tryon said: "I expect less than he'll probably deliver, because that's been his history since he's been a little kid. I plot the future and have these grandiose plans, but at the same time, I'm a realist. I don't want him to feel the pressure to have to produce. He's just a kid still, but more often than not, he rises to the occasion.
"Tiger Woods is by far the best player in the world. Ty needs some physical maturity. He doesn't need any more emotional maturity. He's as emotionally mature as 90 percent of the players out there. He needs more mass, more size. Time will tell how he competes on tougher courses. Right now, he goes at the ball 110 percent. To get to Tiger's level, he's going to have to play a power and accuracy game with an 85 percent swing. That will take some years."
But for the present, Tryon was elated with where he stood, and where he was headed.
"Tonight when I go to sleep, I will know I am on the PGA Tour," Tryon said. "It's just unbelievable."

CHIP SHOTS
BOO WEEKLEY of Milton, Fla., who became a favorite by playing in sneakers and rain-slicker pants, earned his Tour card. When someone mentioned that one of his putts was knocked off track by a spike mark, Weekly smiled and said, "Spikes -- I think they should outlaw them." . . . The most heartbreaking experience belonged to ROLAND THATCHER, who saw his Tour card slip away with a triple bogey on the final hole. That dropped him from 17 under -- the cutoff -- to 14 under.

HEADLINE: A Changed Police Department Awaits Kelly in Second Turn 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN FLYNN 

 BODY:
When he returns for a second stint as commissioner on Jan. 1, Raymond W. Kelly will find a Police Department filled with old friends, a familiar office and a force so in vogue its fans wear N.Y.P.D. caps.
 But Mr. Kelly will also find that the department he inherits, and the city it patrols, face severe pressures and stiff tests that will make the commissioner's job more taxing than usual. 
 The threat of terrorism has so expanded the department's responsibilities that overtime could hit $1.7 billion this fiscal year, an amount equal to the entire police budget for 1993, when Mr. Kelly was last commissioner. 
In addition, an economic downturn threatens to sap the tax revenue that financed the department's recent expansion and to complicate labor negotiations with a police force that believes it is woefully underpaid.
And the department's manpower is dwindling, even as its duties grow. A total of 2,099 officers have retired so far this year, about 5 percent of the force and an 87 percent increase over retirements for the same period a year ago.
Even the department's success at crimefighting, which has gleamed like a polished badge for much of the last decade, is showing tarnish in spots. Crime for the year remains down, but shootings and murders have risen by double-digit percentages over the last month, and homeless people and squeegee men appear to have returned to some city streets and intersections.
It is true that crime for the year remains as low as it has been at any time in the last three decades, but a recent spate of shootings in which innocent bystanders were struck by stray gunfire seemed to date from an earlier era.
"I think there are enormous problems here," said Thomas Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, "and the man who solves these problems is going to be a great figure in American law enforcement."
Much has changed in the department since Mr. Kelly served as its 37th commissioner under Mayor David N. Dinkins. Back then, he commanded a force of 28,500 uniformed officers, not the 40,000-member department of today, which was built through budget initiatives and the merger of the transit and housing police units into the larger city force.
Crime rates were much higher eight years ago, too. Although crime began to decline under Mr. Kelly, the descent accelerated greatly during the Giuliani administration. 
The number of incidents in every major category, from murder to auto theft, has dropped by at least 40 percent over the last eight years.
But for the four-week period ended Sunday, homicides were 20 percent higher than in the same period a year ago, going to 54 from 45. Shootings also increased, by 41 percent. At the same time, some of the quality of life concerns that had helped propel Rudolph W. Giuliani into the mayoralty, like street peddlers and squeegee men, appeared to be returning. Advocates for the homeless say a record number are now living in city shelters or welfare hotels.
Several criminologists said that, even though an economic downturn can foster a rise in crime, they were not convinced that the recent spike in shootings and murder was meaningful. "Four weeks does not a trend make," said James Alan Fox, a professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University.
Police officials also have characterized the upturn as a blip, one they believe may have resulted when officers who had been on street patrol were assigned to terrorism recovery operations or bridge check posts in the weeks after the Sept. 11 attack. In recent days, Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik has begun moving many of those officers back to street enforcement, where they may deter criminals from carrying guns. In the same vein, all detectives assigned to the narcotics division were ordered last week to begin working six-day weeks, possibly until the end of the year.
In remarks last month, Mr. Kelly acknowledged he would have to find a way to muster enough manpower to respond to both crime and the threat of terrorism. "Having lived through the unthinkable," he said, "we have to be ready to live through the unthinkable again."
Mr. Kelly will also have to balance the effectiveness of traffic checkpoints and truck searches against the damage lengthy traffic jams and delivery delays may do to the city business climate. Further slowing of the local economy would not help the police effort, analysts said, because a budget drained of tax revenue may not be able to cover the cost of an ambitious enforcement program, even if the federal government continues to pay a large part of the overtime budget, as expected.
For one thing, police officers are already in arbitration seeking a raise well above that offered to other uniformed employees. If they are refused, the recent surge in police morale that came with the outpouring of respect for their work after the terrorist attack will be short-lived, a police union official said.
On the other hand, criminal justice analysts said an economic slump could help a department with an attrition problem because veteran officers looking to retire would no longer be able to find jobs so easily in the shrinking private sector. Union officials disagree, saying terrorism has increased the demand for people with law enforcement experience.
"You might lose jobs in other sectors, but the security market has exponentially grown," said John Driscoll, president of the Captains Endowment Association, the union that represents many police supervisors.
Mr. Kelly will also find that the chilly relationship between the police and many black and Hispanic citizens has thawed since the days when the shooting of Amadou Diallo led to criticism of the aggressive police tactics used during the Giuliani administration. Jerome Skolnick, an expert on policing at New York University School of Law, said attitudes toward the police shifted noticeably after the events of Sept. 11.
"The role of the police is much more widely accepted across the five boroughs in virtually every neighborhood," Mr. Skolnick said. "He starts off with good feelings toward the police."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE CHILDREN; 
Millions of Afghan Children, and No Ideas About Their Future

BYLINE:  By C. J. CHIVERS 

DATELINE: ALCHIN, Afghanistan, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
His face was dirty and his pants, cinched tight with rope, were several inches too wide in the waist. His rubber boots looked twice the size of his feet. He is 8 years old and has never been to school. He reached into his sweater, pulled out a few pages of Arabic script and began to read. 
 It was not much, merely the alphabet in Dari, but in Afghanistan it is enough to move him well ahead of his peers. He lowered the grubby book and smiled. 
 "The mullah taught me," said the boy, Qundahakha, who lives in this shepherd's village without plumbing, electricity, a health clinic or a school, and where children have virtually no idea what they will do in the future. 
The United Nations estimates that half of the 23 million Afghans are younger than 18, and although demographics are impossible to verify in a land without a census, it is clear that in each mud-walled hamlet or cold city alley the children swarm in bunches and packs. They are a huge mass of people, largely illiterate and mostly unvaccinated -- some skilled in the basics of waging war, others without any moral reference point after being raised under the Taliban's brand of law.
They are savvy to the streets and the steppe, yet without the slightest sense of the world. Here one can meet 10-year-old boys who can clean a carburetor, butcher a sheep, point out a land mine, disassemble a Russian rifle or look after a storekeeper's stall.
Only rarely does one meet a boy like Qundahakha, who is learning to read. It is even worse with the girls, whom the Taliban barred from school.
What will become of this enormous group, and how they will be incorporated into whatever sort of society Afghanistan eventually becomes, is one of the pressing questions for a nation trying remake itself after more than two decades of war.
"This is a problem of the center of the Afghan situation," said Olara A. Otunnu, the United Nations special representative for children and armed conflict. "You are talking about two generations of children and youth who have been exposed to war nonstop."
Mr. Otunnu said the problems exist on two related scales. The issues involving human need are obvious and complex. And on a deeper level, if they are not solved, he said, the children will be the seeds for more violence and terrorism. "Unless the children have viable alternatives, Afghanistan will be an incubator that can be exploited or manipulated by almost anyone," he said. "We have already seen that its problems can spread over borders."
The collapse of standards of living for Afghan youth goes beyond the near absence of organized education. Almost all of the children are living in poverty. Some are psychologically scarred. Most have few role models besides soldiers -- and their parents struggling in a hand-to-mouth economy. A few are visibly sick. 
Dr. Muhammad Nodir, a specialist in internal medicine in the nearby city of Kunduz, said that in the past year he saw two dozen children die of illnesses that in most of the world would be readily curable, including diarrhea or colds that became lung infections that could not be stopped. 
"Most of the children have a cough and other problems, you can just look at them and see it," the doctor said. "We need antibiotics."
There are also unsettling signs in children who have been exposed to so much violence and severity that they have little sense of their meaning. Mirwais, a 12-year-old boy in Kunduz, said that earlier this year he stood in a crowd on the city's main soccer field and watched the Taliban lop a hand and a foot from each of two men accused of theft. 
He saw nothing odd about it. He thought it strange that someone would ask. "They were criminal people," he said. "That is what criminal people get."
At the moment, the efforts to help children are patchwork and informal.
In Kunduz on Sunday, while dozens of children played in the muddy alleys, 11 others crammed into a 12-by-6-foot mud-walled room to practice multiplication tables. Class was in session in an underground school, an illegal education center during the Taliban's four-year reign in the city. It has continued to meet in the past week, even after the Taliban surrendered.
"The Afghan people do not have an economy, but we have good brains," said the teacher, Mahboba. "We are very smart, clever people. All we need is a chance."
Then she amended her thought: "We also need tables, we need blackboards, we need books and chalk and the other things to make schools good again." 
Like the dozens of others interviewed for this story, the children in her class brightened when they talked about the future. Then they faltered. 
They want to have jobs and earn money, but they know so little of a functioning society that they could name only the few professions they have seen first hand: doctor, shepherd, shopkeeper, teacher, mujahedeen.
One said engineer, but only after Mahboba said the word first. Another, in a moment of inspiration, realized she had learned a new line of work.
"Journalist!" she said, and the rest of the class laughed.
In the shadow of one of the city's schools, which was closed and used as a Taliban barracks, even one former senior Taliban commander said the extremist movement had devastated his country. Sitting by a wood stove with his bodyguards, the defector, Gen. Abdullah Gaurd, said he used to command 500 soldiers in the Kunduz region. He knows the extremist movement set Afghanistan, already suffering from Soviet invasion and civil war, even further back.
"It was a big calamity," General Gaurd said. "The children growing up shouldn't be like us. All of the children should be brought up better. They need doctors and school."
Asked if the classrooms and clinics should be open for girls, he said: "Yes. Even girls."
But with schools now tending to only a fraction of the population, for many other children childhood is short. Boys who would be elementary school pupils in the West are already working as apprentices in manual trades.
In the city's bazaar, Mansoor, 10, was cleaning the grease from the starter of a Russian jeep. His hands were blackened with oil and dirt. He washed the parts in gasoline. He said he has been at the job three years. "I am going to go to school next year," he said. "I will learn how to read. Right now my father feeds our family as a mechanic, and it is my job to help him."
In Alchin, children are similarly busy helping their parents tending camels, cows and sheep. Poverty was self-evident: a few of the 60 or so children who clustered around visitors walked barefoot on nearly frozen ground. Another bunch wore sandals without socks. Only four said they could read.
One girl, Zanab, 12, said that she had watched the American bombs explode on the hills nearby, and that now that the province was freed of Taliban she wanted to study. "I would like to go to school and learn how to write, and then go meet the faculty of a college," she said. 
Asked if she knew where the college was, she was quiet for a moment. "Maybe Kabul?" she asked back.
One of the parents nearby interrupted. "I want to send my children to school, but we are poor and there is no school," said the parent, Abdul Aziz. "This is the problem. Only with school can our children improve our situation."
A few hundred yards away, the gate to Qundahakha's home is a piece of metal stripped from the hood of a Russian truck. Light passes through dozens of bullet holes. He is one of the few in the hamlet who is learning to read, having picked up the alphabet from the Taliban mullah who was teaching him the Koran. 
He was 4 years old when the Taliban took over the region, and he knows no other life. He has heard his father say that there was sheep rustling in the Taliban days, and already a few sheep have been taken by hungry Northern Alliance troops. 
He thinks the Taliban mullah has given him a chance, and he looks forward to more study at the mosque. He said he will take teachers where he can find them. "I like the Taliban," he said. "The Taliban is good."

HEADLINE: National Briefing Washington: Economic Stimulus Bill 

BYLINE:  By Richard W. Stevenson (NYT)

 BODY:
 Republican and Democratic Congressional leaders agreed on a procedure for negotiating an economic stimulus bill and said they would try to begin working on a compromise today. 
The parties have been deadlocked for weeks over the measure, with Republicans insisting on tax cuts for businesses and individuals and Democrats demanding increased aid to the unemployed and low-income workers. With the economy in recession, Congress is likely to have to consider raising the federal debt limit next year, an indication that plans to reduce the national debt could fall victim to the downturn.

HEADLINE: 2 Rival Chip Makers Consider Joining Forces 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
Two archrivals in the chip-making business, Hynix Semiconductor and Micron Technology, have begun negotiations on a strategic alliance that the chief executive of Hynix, Park Chong Sup, predicted today would "change the landscape of the chip industry."
 Mr. Park said it was too early to say if the talks would lead to a full-blown merger of the two companies. "We'll know whether it's go or no-go within a month," he said. 
 Responding to rumors of an imminent deal that have circulated here for weeks, Mr. Park and Micron's chairman, Steve Appleton, issued a joint statement today saying their companies were "evaluating a broad array of strategic options."
Industry analysts said the possibilities included an arrangement for Hynix, which is struggling with $8.6 billion in debt, to produce semiconductors for Micron, which leapfrogged over Hynix to move to second place in the world memory chip field, behind Samsung Electronics.
Another option may be joining forces on research and development. Analysts said Hynix, starved for cash, is falling dangerously behind in research and development as its creditors argue over resolving its debt problems.
"We're looking at all alternatives -- anything's possible," said Daniel Behrendt, a manager in investor relations at Hynix. 
In the meantime, Mr. Behrendt said, Micron, based in Boise, Idaho, will stop complaining that Hynix is being kept alive by government subsidies, in the form of rescue plans led by creditor banks that are largely owned and controlled by the government. Under the latest plan, Hynix creditors have agreed to write off $1 billion that Hynix owes them and to accept Hynix stock in payment of $2.5 billion more.
While Micron may also take an equity stake in Hynix, analysts said they doubted that Micron was prepared at this stage to take majority control of Hynix in a deal akin to the one General Motors is completing with Daewoo Motor, the bankrupt automaker.
"General Motors is a financially stronger firm in discussion with a much weaker firm," said Richard Samuelson, managing director of UBS Warburg Securities in Seoul. "Micron only has about $1 billion in cash available at this moment. Hynix is a big chunky thing for them to swallow whole. The relationship would be more like a supplier agreement than a merger."
Still, news of the talks heartened South Korea's finance minister, Jin Nyum, enough to prompt a prediction from him that both Daewoo Motor and Hynix Semiconductor, two of the government's biggest headaches as it tries to pull the country out of its current economic slump, would soon resolve their problems.
The companies were pillars of two of South Korea's largest conglomerates, the Daewoo Group, which collapsed in mid-1999, and the Hyundai Group, which broke up into several smaller groups this year.
Mr. Samuelson said Hynix might cooperate with Micron as it perfected and began mass-producing its latest memory product, a 256-megabyte synchronous dynamic random access memory, or SDRAM, chip that it hopes to market in 2002.
"It's very costly to get economies of scale and bring the error rate down," Mr. Samuelson said. While Micron's profits have suffered in the current slump, he added, "they are not taking huge losses like Hynix."
Mr. Behrendt said Hynix was retooling its plant in Eugene, Ore., to begin making the chips, which could be marketed as a Micron product.
Hynix has had to sell its mainstay 128-MB DRAM and 64-MB DRAM chips at a loss in recent months as prices worldwide have plummeted by 90 percent in a year. 
Investors, buoyed by word of the talks, bid Hynix shares up today by the daily limit of 15 percent on the Korea stock exchange, closing at 2,465 won ($1.95) a share. Micron Technologies stock closed at $28.56, up $1.40.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
As Investors Worry About Mideast and Enron, Shares Fall

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday with selling generated by a sudden leap in Middle East hostilities and concern about the corporate fallout from Enron, the former Wall Street darling that is now the largest bankruptcy case in American history.
 These concerns overshadowed the optimism that made November the best month for the market since April, with a 7.5 percent gain in the broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Stocks have been on a tear after skidding to three-year lows on Sept. 21 in the wake of the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average declined 87.60 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 9,763.96, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 25.68 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,904.90. The S.& P. 500 shed 9.55 points, or 0.8 percent, dropping to 1,129.90. 
"We've had quite a bit of a rally since the lows in September and then you've got the Mideast situation and the Enron thing," said Michelle Clayman, chief investment officer at New Amsterdam Partners. "Maybe there's a little bit of profit taking here."
Argentina's continuing financial crisis has also contributed to Wall Street's jitters, helping to overshadow a batch of better-than-expected economic data, including a report that United States manufacturing activity fell at a slower pace last month.
Shares of Enron rebounded 14 cents, to 40 cents, but this is still well under a dollar and a far cry from its year high of almost $85. Enron was a drag on the stocks of utilities and some leading Wall Street firms, including Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase & Company, on fears they might suffer losses from their dealings with Enron, the once-mighty energy trader.
Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday and sued Dynegy, its rival and onetime suitor, for $10 billion for pulling out of a last-ditch rescue merger. Dynegy followed with a countersuit. Dynegy stock fell $3.18, or 10.5 percent, to $27.17.
Tension grew in the Middle East with a series of Palestinian suicide bombings in Israel and Israel's retaliation. Israel launched missile strikes on Gaza City and buildings near Yasir Arafat's headquarters.
The violence there, along with optimism that Russia will comply with calls from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, sent oil prices soaring.
 --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury bond prices rose as heightened tension in the Middle East, Enron's bankruptcy and a slide in stocks bolstered the attractiveness of government debt.
Gains were limited after a manufacturing index rose more than expected in November, bolstering speculation that a quarter-point interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve's Dec. 11 meeting might be its last.
The Treasury market has been "like a yo-yo," said Bob Ried, an economist and partner at Ried Thunberg & Company, a research firm in Westport, Conn. 
The 10-year Treasury note rose 14/32, to a price of 102 12/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.69 percent from 4.76 percent on Friday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 20/32, to 101 30/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.24 percent from 5.29 percent on Friday.

HEADLINE: Despite Ills, Automakers Report Solid Sales for November 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

 BODY:
Auto sales remained strong for much of November but began to slow after Thanksgiving, when the Big Three automakers started to restrict their interest-free financing offers. Still, the nation's auto industry remains on pace for what should be at least the third- or possibly the second-biggest sales year ever.
 General Motors said yesterday that it would increase first-quarter production by 7 percent to replenish a stock of vehicles diminished by record October sales and a strong November. G.M., the world's largest automaker, also said it would step up production by about 15,000 vehicles this quarter, and it said the increase would have a favorable effect on earnings projections. 
 That does not mean all is well in the Motor City. 
"We do have to realize we are not going to defy gravity and continue to see sales at record levels," said Paul Ballew, G.M.'s general director for global market and industry analysis.
"It was pretty clear as the month went along that sales started off at a pace that was not that different from October and then faded as the month went through," he added. 
Financial analysts have been waiting for the payback to materialize from the wave of interest-free financing deals. Although the deals have been great for buyers and have propelled sales, analysts expect they have stolen hundreds of thousands of sales from next year and only delayed much of the economic pain for the Big Three: G.M., Ford Motor and Chrysler. 
October sales set a record seasonally adjusted annual pace of 21.3 million vehicles as the economy was in recession. That pace fell to an annual selling rate of 18 million vehicles in November, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank, but was a 9.5 percent increase from November 2000.
Analysts and automakers are projecting the year's final sales rate will be around 17 million vehicles, about the pace in 1999 and behind the record 17.4 million sold last year.
But the slowdown late in November, many believe, tells of a tougher environment to come. 
"The payback for the zero percent financing programs began in November," John Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said in a research note. "We expect industry demand to decline through 2002, and likely into 2003."
George Pipas, Ford's sales analyst, said, "There was a noticeable falloff in the last week."
"Not dramatic or frightening, just noticeable," he added. "It was coincident with the change in our incentive program that started on Nov. 21. Perhaps that week provided a window into December."
Wall Street reacted negatively to the news yesterday, as shares of all three top automakers declined.
Shares of Ford Motor were battered, falling 6 percent, to $17.80, after a report over the weekend that the company would warn that its fourth-quarter loss would be steeper than expected. Ford's sales rose 4.4 percent for November, less than analysts expected considering the incentive programs that the company had in place. Ford's market share has declined to 23.2 percent so far this year, from 24.2 percent in the first 11 months of last year. 
Officials at Ford have not commented on the report about its fourth-quarter losses. But Ford acknowledged a new round of cost cutting yesterday, including an indefinite suspension of matching salaried workers' 401(k) contributions 60 cents per dollar; increased out-of-pocket health-care costs for workers; the suspension of merit raises for more than 2,000 top managers; and the layoff of 600 hourly workers at a truck plant in Edison, N.J.
The Chrysler Group reported another month of lagging sales in November, with overall sales falling 6 percent. Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, was the only company among 10 automakers to report a drop in United States car and truck sales, according to the AutoData Corporation. Shares of DaimlerChrysler fell 2.4 percent, to $41. 
At G.M., sales rose 13 percent in November. If its results affirmed G.M. as the healthiest of the wounded Big Three domestic manufacturers, they will probably not please environmental groups concerned about oil consumption as the country fights a war in Central Asia. G.M.'s sales have been propelled almost entirely by gas-guzzling pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. Company officials said G.M. was on pace to sell more S.U.V.'s this year than any other company had before in a single year. G.M. also projects it will have its best sales year for pickup trucks in more than two decades. 
Despite its sales gains, shares of G.M. fell 1.3 percent, to $49.03.
G.M. has shown signs of making a move on the beleaguered Ford Motor as Wall Street's pick among the Big Three. In the third quarter, the mutual fund companies Fidelity Investments and Capital Research bought G.M. shares while they sold Ford. But G.M.'s incentive strategy remains a concern for analysts, and most professional investors appear to fear the weakness of all the Big Three automakers, which are faced with stiff and persistent competition from abroad. 
Sales at Toyota, the nation's fourth-largest automaker, were up 10 percent for November. Honda's sales in the United States rose 11.5 percent, while Nissan gained 7 percent. Foreign manufacturers' sales gains have come even as the companies have relied far less on the costly incentives that have been eroding the profitability of the Big Three. Ford is expected to post its first lost since 1992 this year, and the Chrysler Group is also expected to report a loss.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE WARNING; 
White House Issues Alert Of New Terrorism Threat

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
The government warned this afternoon that there could be new terror strikes against the United States in the next several weeks, perhaps tied to the final days of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan or other religious observances.
 The urgent alert by Tom Ridge, the White House director of homeland security, was the third since the attacks of Sept. 11 in which the federal government had put the nation on a state of heightened vigilance without providing any detail about the nature of the threat or possible targets. 
 "Now is not the time to back off," Mr. Ridge said in a late-afternoon appearance in the White House briefing room. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation issued the advisory to 18,000 state and local law enforcement agencies around the country. And Mr. Ridge notified the nation's governors of the new alert in an afternoon conference call.
Intelligence analysts have reported that threats monitored from multiple sources had become more numerous in recent days and were considered credible enough to issue a warning, Mr. Ridge said. He said President Bush had personally approved the latest announcement.
"The threats we are picking up are very generic," Mr. Ridge said. "They warn of more attacks but are not specific about where or what type. We do know that the next several weeks, which bring the final weeks of Ramadan and important religious observations in other faiths, have been times when terrorists have planned attacks in the past."
Senior government officials said the warning had been based in intercepted communications related to Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, Al Qaeda.
One official said there was precedent for plans by Islamic militants to take action in the last days of Ramadan, which ends in mid-December.
"The sources are more credible and, let me just say, the decibel level is higher as they talk about potential attacks," Mr. Ridge said. He added that the alert would be in effect for several weeks.
The warning followed three Palestinian suicide bombings over the weekend in Israel that brought retaliatory Israeli air strikes today. But Mr. Ridge said there was no sign that the threat had been related to the escalating violence in the Middle East.
The alert also came as fighting in Afghanistan intensified in the last major Taliban stronghold, Kandahar, and as United States warplanes continued to bomb caves and bunkers where Mr. bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders were believed to be hiding. 
United States officials now believe that Al Qaeda's leadership in Afghanistan is virtually incapable of communication with its cells around the world. Officials involved in the alert declined to characterize what they were hearing, but the situation in Afghanistan suggests that the intercepted communications were among operatives outside that country.
The Justice Department and F.B.I. earlier issued two other general terrorist alerts, each time drawing criticism that they were creating a sense of panic that ran counter to efforts to get Americans to resume their normal lives. Today's warning came as retailers hoped for a strong Christmas shopping season to help lift the nation out of its economic recession.
Mr. Ridge today acknowledged the questions and criticisms about issuing generalized warnings, but said that judging the intelligence was an art, not a science.
"It would be so much easier, admittedly, if there were a little more specifics we could refer to," he said. "But there are not."
Mr. Ridge said he did not want Americans to cancel holiday plans, but he also did not want them to relax unduly. "The further removed we get from Sept. 11, I think the natural tendency is to let down our guard," he said. "Unfortunately, we cannot do that. We are a nation at war. We are the targets of enemies who have demonstrated they have no remorse about killing thousands of innocent civilians."
White House officials said that the heads of the law enforcement and intelligence agencies had all agreed that the alert should be issued.
Attorney General John Ashcroft has taken the brunt of the criticism in the past for such warnings. But officials said the appearance by Mr. Ridge alone to announce the alert was not a move to deflect attention from Mr. Ashcroft. 
The attorney general was in Canada today to sign an agreement on border security, including more sharing of information between the two countries.
Now that Mr. Ridge had begun to settle into his new job, Susan Neely, the communications director of the office of homeland security, said, "It seemed more fitting that he speak on behalf of all the agencies in the homeland security council."
The last threat alert was issued Oct. 29, the one before it on Oct. 11. In both cases no attack followed and federal officials suggested that heightened vigilance might have helped to foil planned attacks.
On another issue, the puzzling anthrax death of Ottilie W. Lundgren, a 94-year-old Connecticut woman, Mr. Ridge could offer no definitive explanation. He said that while cross-contamination of the mail might be a plausible cause, swabs taken from places in her house where mail might have been deposited showed no traces of the deadly germ.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Delinquency Rate Hits 10-Year High 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
The percentage of homeowners behind on mortgages in the third quarter rose to the highest level in 10 years as layoffs and a shrinking economy left more families short of cash. 
 The mortgage delinquency rate, or the percentage of loans with payments overdue at least 30 days, rose to 4.87 percent, up more than one percentage point from a year earlier, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said. 
The rate rose from 4.63 percent in the second quarter and is approaching the 5.20 percent it reached in 1991 during the last recession. 
 The weakening gross domestic product and job losses in the technology and manufacturing sectors have affected homeowners' ability to keep their mortgage payments current, said Douglas Duncan, the Mortgage Bankers Association's chief economist. 
Countrywide Credit Industries, the No. 1 nonbank mortgage lender, said delinquencies in its mortgage portfolio grew to 5 percent in October, up from 4.40 percent in the same month last year. 
The weakening economy and the rise in delinquencies have also contributed to a slip in the median home price in October to $145,300 from $147,400, the National Association of Realtors said. The median home price has declined 5 percent since August. 
"There are some red lights from this report," said Dale Westhoff, head of mortgage research at Bear Stearns & Company. "The housing market is clearly in a period of contraction." 
The housing market had been one of the bright spots in the economy and home prices rose through August, helped by a series of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

HEADLINE: Venezuela's New Oil Law Is Seen as a Risk to Growth 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
A sweeping law signed last month by the left-leaning government of President Hugo Chavez could put a damper on foreign investment for increasing oil production just as the United States' market for Venezuelan oil seemed about to expand, oil analysts and economists say.
 This country already provides 15 percent of American oil imports and, with the largest proven reserves outside the Middle East, has been positioned to become a more important supplier. The political instability of the Middle East might have been expected to make Venezuela, a short four-day tanker trip from the United States, an even more attractive alternative for foreign multinationals and American policy makers. 
 The new law, which nearly doubles royalty payments and gives majority control of projects to the government, may slow oil industry expansion plans and could eventually lead foreign multinationals to look for projects in other countries, analysts said. 
"There is a unique moment, an opportunity, where there is a consensus -- movement away from dependence on the Middle East," said Lawrence Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc., an industry-supported consulting group in New York. "Given the long history of Venezuela and the United States, it is an opportunity I think they are missing."
This could prove disabling for Venezuela, because oil revenues account for 50 percent of government revenues and 80 percent of exports.
Already, tumbling oil prices are seen as a bad sign for Venezuela's economy. The value of the country's oil has fallen 40 percent since last year, and the worldwide economic slowdown could ensure that prices remain low. 
That is especially worrisome for the Chavez government, which has promised to improve the lives of the poor by funneling more money to social programs, schools and clinics. Last year, government spending increased by 42 percent, bankrolled largely by high oil prices. Now, future spending is in doubt.
"If oil prices go down and investment goes down, he is going to be looking at a shrinking pool of resources," said Sondra Scott, who analyzes the Latin American oil industry for Cambridge Energy Resources Associates, a Massachusetts consulting company.
Government officials, however, said the new law would increase much-needed revenues and unify a series of unwieldy oil laws that go back nearly 60 years. 
Under Alvaro Silva, the energy and mining minister, the administration has been determined to offset earlier agreements that officials here believe gave too much away to foreign multinationals. Administration officials also contend that the state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, will be able to pick up the increasing costs expected for future exploration and production projects.
Those who helped draft that law said foreign companies would always be lured here by Venezuela's choice offerings: 77 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and perhaps hundreds of billions of barrels of heavy oil, more than the proven reserves in the Middle East.
"This is normal, normal, to hear complaints," said Mazhar al-Shereidah, an oil economist who worked on the government's committee that studied the law. "If I am a giant multinational, and I hear the terms are going to change, then it is in my interest to foment criticism, to say I am going to go away."
Government officials also say critics of the law, like Venezuela's powerful business groups, are motivated by their hatred of Mr. Chavez. The former army paratrooper and coup plotter has turned Venezuela on its head by toppling corrupt political parties, writing a new Constitution and taking control of the legislature.
"We have a national policy for the development of the economy," said Tarek William Saab, chairman of the foreign relations committee of the National Assembly. "And that is to confront the neo-liberal system, where everything is in the name of private capital, and nothing is for the country." 
In this politically charged country, though, opponents of the law see it and other economic legislation in apocalyptic terms. 
"Forget about future projects," said Robert Bottome, a harsh Chavez critic and editor of a respected economic journal, Veneconomia. "They're just dead." 
Many analysts, like Ramon Espinasa, former chief economist for Petroleos de Venezuela, do not go so far. Still, Mr. Espinasa, who is now a consultant at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, calculated in a recent report that future investment could fall, costing $52 billion in lost exports in the next decade.
Ms. Scott's consulting company downgraded its assessment that Venezuela would increase its daily production to five million barrels a day by 2010. The new projection is four million barrels daily. Currently, the country exports 2.6 million barrels daily, about 1.5 million of which go to the United States.
The impact of the law will be most keenly felt in the region considered most vital to Venezuela's future -- the Orinoco belt of eastern Venezuela, where ExxonMobil, TotalFinaElf of France, the Phillips Petroleum Company and other large multinationals have in recent years signed contracts to pump difficult-to-refine heavy oil.
To lure companies to undertake the highly expensive refining of the tarlike oil, the government of President Rafael Caldera signed deals in the mid-1990's that provided royalties of 1 percent, and a 34 percent tax rate. 
But under the new law and other legislation, royalty payments rise to from 20 percent to 30 percent for companies that produce heavy crude, while taxes rise to 50 percent. Outside this region, the royalty rates would increase to 30 percent from 16.7 percent, though taxes would fall to 50 percent from 67 percent.
"I think the government's message is they don't want" the multinationals, said Rafael Sandrea, president of the oil committee of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry.
The oil companies have been more diplomatic, with Jerome Auzenne, general manager of Phillips Petroleum's operations here, saying his company is "a guest in someone else's home," adding, "We won't tell them how to run their home."
Still, Mr. Auzenne noted that the Phillips project, with ChevronTexaco and Petroleos de Venezuela as partners, was made more palatable by the earlier agreements, which would not be affected under the new law. 
But future projects will have to be carefully considered, he said, noting that most other oil-producing nations are trying to improve terms of possible agreements to lure investors. "We have a lot of opportunities," Mr. Auzenne said.

HEADLINE: At $92.60 a Vote, Bloomberg Shatters An Election Record 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Sixty-eight million, nine hundred sixty-eight thousand, one hundred eighty-five dollars.
 That's how much Michael R. Bloomberg spent from his personal fortune on the election that made him the mayor of New York City, according to documents his campaign filed yesterday with the city's Board of Elections. It breaks all records for spending in municipal elections by tens of millions of dollars. 
 It is just $2 million less than Ross Perot spent on his 1992 presidential campaign, and it is more than the $48.6 million Steve Forbes spent on his 2000 presidential campaign, and the $63 million Jon S. Corzine spent on his record-breaking campaign for one of New Jersey's United States Senate seats in 2000. 
And it means that Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican, wound up spending $92.60 for each of the 744,757 votes he won in the Nov. 6 election against Mark Green, a Democrat. (Mr. Perot, by contrast, spent about $3.59 per vote in the 1992 presidential race.)
"You know how they talk about how being mayor of New York is the second toughest job in the country?" asked Larry Noble, the executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group that studies money and politics. "It's now the second most expensive job as well."
Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire, spent his own money on the campaign, choosing to ignore the city's campaign finance law, which seeks to restrict the influence of money on politics by requiring candidates to limit the amount of money they raise and spend in order to qualify for public matching funds. Mr. Green, his opponent, who participated in the program, spent roughly $16.5 million, his campaign said.
The Bloomberg campaign was the Rolls-Royce of campaigns. It spent more money on television advertisements and mailings in the last two weeks of the campaign than the Green campaign spent on the whole race. The filings show that from Oct. 23 on, the Bloomberg campaign spent $8.4 million on television, $6.4 million on polling and, in a surprise, $9.6 million on glossy color campaign mailings -- more than it spent on television ads -- in that final stretch.
It is more money than Mr. Bloomberg apparently envisioned spending earlier in the campaign. Last spring New York magazine reported that Mr. Bloomberg had said that he would not spend as much as $30 million on the race, quoting him as saying, "At some point, you start to look obscene."
In the summer, when it became clear that he would probably spend more than $30 million, Mr. Bloomberg told The New York Post that he did not remember saying it would be obscene to spend that much. "My recollection is that I said you could not spend on New York City's race what was spent on the last Senate race here or the Senate race in New Jersey," he was quoted as saying.
But the campaign filings show that he spent more than was spent on either race. Rick A. Lazio spent $40.5 million in his unsuccessful bid against Hillary Rodham Clinton, who spent $29.8 million. And Mr. Corzine spent $63 million in the Senate race in New Jersey.
Bill Cunningham, a senior Bloomberg campaign strategist, said that he did not think it was fair to compare Mr. Bloomberg's spending with Mr. Corzine's, because the figures had not been adjusted for inflation. 
"You know, we always talked about spending what was necessary to get our message out, and ultimately, that's exactly what we did," Mr. Cunningham said.
The nearly $69 million Mr. Bloomberg spent is more than 10 times what a candidate typically spends running for United States Senate, and roughly 97 times what a candidate spends, on average, running for the House of Representatives, according to Mr. Noble of the Center for Responsive Politics. It is more than half the $133 million -- not counting soft money -- that Al Gore spent running for president in 2000. (George W. Bush spent $193 million, according to the center.)
The previous record for spending on a New York City mayoral race was set by Ronald S. Lauder, who spent $14 million in 1989, when he lost the Republican primary to Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Mr. Perot, who was previously Exhibit A in the billionaire candidate category, spent $63.5 million of his own money in his 1992 race, which raised an additional $7.5 million from others. And Mr. Forbes spent $38.7 million of his own money in the 2000 race, raising another $10 million.
Mr. Bloomberg spent only his own money. Despite his decision not to participate in the city's campaign finance program, he was endorsed by Senator John McCain, a leading advocate of campaign finance reform, who said that the issue should not be a "litmus test."
Mr. Bloomberg's millions allowed him to saturate the airwaves with well-produced television advertisements. The campaign even bought some of the most expensive time on television, during the World Series. An analysis by the Wisconsin Advertising Project at the University of Wisconsin at Madison found that Mr. Bloomberg ran roughly 6,500 television ads and Mr. Green 2,500.
The money also allowed the Bloomberg campaign to send out many glossy color mailings, on hard paper stock, praising his endorsements and attacking Mr. Green. In the final week, the campaign sent out a mailing suggesting that Mr. Green would raise taxes and roll back the Giuliani administration's successes in fighting crime. Still, it was highly unusual for a campaign to spend more money on mailings than television advertisements in the final weeks of a campaign.
Mr. Green's campaign manager, Richard Schrader, accused Mr. Bloomberg of buying the election. "He bought it fair and square, and by spending a historic amount on television ads he controlled the airwaves and altered people's perception of reality," Mr. Schrader said.

Israel Strikes Back In the West Bank and Gaza
Israeli warplanes, helicopters, tanks and bulldozers attacked the symbols of Yasir Arafat's authority in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, destroying three helicopters and a headquarters building, though he was elsewhere. The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, accused the Palestinian leader of provoking war by pursuing "the path of terrorism." The raids were prompted by three suicide bombings in Israel over the weekend that killed 25 people; the radical Palestinian group Hamas took responsibility. A1

HEADLINE: The Weaknesses Of Science For Profit 

BYLINE:  By Harold Varmus; Harold Varmus, a Nobel laureate in medicine, is president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and former director of the National Institutes of Health.

 BODY:
Last week Americans briefly diverted their eyes from Afghanistan to consider the announcement by a small New England biotechnology company that it had created human embryonic clones. President Bush expressed grave concern, and some members of Congress made renewed calls for legislation to ban the practice outright. One might think that a cloned human baby had been born.
 In truth, what the investigators did was much less significant, and it was undertaken for a different purpose. They attempted to adopt one step of the process used for cloning animals -- the transfer of a cell nucleus -- as part of a strategy to develop human embryonic stem cells. They removed the nuclei from several human cells and placed each one in another cell, an egg cell. In a very few instances, the reconstructed cell went through one or two divisions, generating no more than six cells -- not enough to allow the derivation of stem cell lines. 
 Many of us in the scientific community criticized the company's report as premature because it showed little experimental progress and advanced no new ideas. Supporters of medical science lamented the company's naivete because the announcement precipitated an unnecessary political firestorm and provoked the threat of new barriers to potentially beneficial research.
So why did the company make its announcement? Although its executives claimed to be excited about the findings and said the information would promote educational debate, the actual reasons may be more self-serving. Biotechnology companies are dependent on investors, and investors like publicity.
Such behavior is, of course, both legal and expected, but it is one of the unhealthy aspects of confining certain kinds of research to the private sector. Our country is notable for doing this in areas of ethically sensitive science. In Britain and most other countries with major investments in science, a national decision is made at the outset about whether to allow such work to be done at all, regardless of who pays for it. In contrast, Americans tend to focus our debate on whether it is permissible to use federal funds -- taxpayers' dollars -- to finance the work.
This odd strategy does have the benefit of allowing such work to proceed in at least one venue: commercial labs. For example, over the past two decades, federal financing for in vitro fertilization -- as a therapy for infertility or as a topic for research -- has been prohibited. But this policy has not kept the private sector from pursuing in vitro fertilization as a practical solution to infertility; tens of thousands of new parents and their babies have been the beneficiaries.
Thus the policy achieves two goals: it does not offend taxpayers who oppose the use of federal money to support work that violates their ethical standards, yet it allows researchers to pursue innovation on the frontiers of science -- so long as it's privately financed.
On the other hand, because this policy prevents academic investigators from studying in vitro fertilization with funds from the National Institutes of Health, it compromises efforts to learn the fundamental principles of fertilization and to improve the basic technology. Moreover, it leaves the field largely in the hands of the for-profit sector -- where commercial realities must be considered along with scientific progress, where full disclosure is not the norm, and where oversight is limited.
Last week's episode further illustrates the importance of involving federally financed scientists in work that is permitted in the private sector. The "nuclear transfer" strategy pursued by the company in question is not intended to produce cloned human beings ("reproductive cloning"), a goal that nearly all agree is unacceptable. But the approach is excluded from federal financing by a provision in the N.I.H.'s annual appropriations bill, and federal money could not even be used to study any resulting stem cells, since President Bush's Aug. 9 directive prevents the use of federal funds for research into any stem cells not already in existence at the time of his speech.
Still, stem cells made by nuclear transfer could have substantial advantages over existing stem cell lines for studying basic processes of human development. This is an aspect of the work more likely to be pursued by academic scientists than by those working in industry, because its commercial uses are much less certain, although extraordinary discoveries might be made.
Nuclear transfer has more obvious value, both economic and medical, as a method to make stem cells for therapy: such cells would not be rejected if returned to the original donor of the cell nucleus (or to others with a similar genetic makeup). This is one of the potentially viable means to overcome immune barriers to cell-based therapies for a variety of dire diseases.
Such research is vital not just to biotechnology companies and their investors, but to the nation as a whole. By structuring our system so that only those with private funds or a commercial motive do this pioneering work, we curb our full capacity to expand our scientific understanding.

HEADLINE: Congress Pushes for School Reform 

 BODY:
George W. Bush's promise to end "the soft bigotry of low expectations" that permits minority children to fall permanently behind at school seemed destined to go nowhere after Sept. 11. Even before then, the House and Senate appeared hopelessly tied up in bickering over the federal government's proper role in aiding local schools. But now the leaders of both parties have quietly reached tentative agreement on a ground-breaking bill that holds the states accountable as never before for rescuing failing schools and closing the achievement gap between rich and poor students. The only danger is that the federal government will deluge the schools with new mandates while providing too little money to get the job done. 
 The most valuable part of the plan is a requirement that the states conduct annual testing in reading and math for students in grades three through eight. These tests would allow parents to learn how their children's schools stack up against others in the state, and how they are progressing year to year. Faced with a conservative backlash against the idea of national tests, Congress came up with a sensible compromise, in which the government will use a well-established national assessment system to make all the different results comparable. 
 Many lawmakers had been nervous about setting strict timetables for closing the achievement gap between minority and non-minority students. They were worried that setting standards too high would lead to the failure of hundreds of their own local schools. The latest version of the plan, which gives the states 12 years to close the gaps, should calm those fears without sacrificing the interests of poor and minority students. This latest bill sets reasonable achievement levels that will be raised gradually over time.
Congress has dropped Mr. Bush's idea of giving vouchers to students in failing schools. A school that makes no progress for two years would receive various forms of extra help. After three years of no progress, children would be allowed to transfer to another public school in the district. After four years, the school would be forced to provide supplemental instruction and curriculum. After six years, the school would be radically restructured, its staff and leadership changed. The conferees have called for increased spending on after-school programs and more money for Title I, the federal project targeted at the country's poorest districts and students.
Taken together, these provisions have the potential to improve public schools dramatically all across the United States. They are not a cure-all. Some are already in place in New York City, which is far from a perfect school system. They are only a start, and even the start will not be much help without proper funding. The national recession has already caused the states to cut billions of dollars from state education budgets. The leaders of the House-Senate conference committees seem to understand that these reforms cannot be taken seriously without substantial federal aid. But they still need to do some work in convincing the White House and their own colleagues.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: DRAGNET IN EUROPE; 
Spain Pursues Terrorists Among Its Muslim Immigrants

BYLINE:  By SAM DILLON with EMMA DALY

DATELINE: MADRID, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
Until recently, Madrid's Muslim community was so small that most Arabs knew each other. One was Ahmad Mardini, who emigrated from Syria three decades ago, married a Spanish woman and built a conservative life as a shopkeeper. He even phoned the authorities once to complain about graffiti scrawled on a neighborhood wall praising Spain's home-grown Basque terrorists.
 But in the last decade, Spain's Islamic population has exploded. Today it is a sea of strangers, as Mr. Mardini learned the hard way. A bearded young Arab who had recently arrived in Spain asked to buy his watch repair shop. Mr. Mardini agreed to sell, but something did not seem right. "He had fat fingers, so how was he going to fix watches?" Mr. Mardini wondered. 
 His premonition proved correct on Nov. 13, when as part of an antiterrorism dragnet, the police arrested Mr. Mardini and the buyer. Mr. Mardini has since cleared himself and been freed, but a Spanish judge has accused the man who bought his business of belonging to a sleeper cell loyal to Osama bin Laden. 
Like Mr. Mardini, many Muslims in Spain are feeling burned by the dawning realization that their community has become a busy logistical rear guard, apparently humming with Islamic terrorists.
Mohamed Atta, a suspected coordinator of the Sept. 11 suicide hijackers, visited Spain twice in the months before the attacks, and the police have carried out three roundups in six months of men accused of belonging to Mr. bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda. Officials say Islamic militants have sunk roots into an Arab immigrant population growing so fast that it is now 15 times as large as it was a dozen years ago.
An overwhelming majority of the newly arrived immigrants are law-abiding North African laborers, although many lack valid work papers. But a terrorist fringe appears to pose a threat that some authorities acknowledge was underestimated before the Sept. 11 attacks. 
The police are monitoring about 200 Arab immigrants suspected of working with 20 Islamic terrorist cells, a senior Spanish law enforcement official said in an interview.
"If we don't take out their infrastructure now, there'll be another major attack," the official said. "It's that simple."
Spain's No. 1 security concern continues to be the Basque group known as E.T.A., whose initials stand for Basque Homeland and Freedom.
Islamic terrorists have mounted only one major attack in Spain, the bombing of a restaurant near an American air base outside Madrid in 1985 that killed 18 Spaniards. E.T.A. has committed countless atrocities that have left 800 dead over 30 years, and just last month killed two traffic police officers and exploded a car bomb in Madrid that wounded 100.
Security forces have devoted fewer resources to combating Muslim terrorists, although during one period in the mid-1990's the police carried out sweeping arrests of Algerian extremists after linking them to bombings in the Paris subway.
But in the five years since, the Algerian groups have rebuilt their networks, and other Islamic militants from across North Africa and the Middle East have recruited new terror cells among the growing Muslim population, said Fernando Rei nares, a counterterrorism expert at the University of Burgos. 
Mr. bin Laden's apparent success in persuading several previously autonomous terror cells operating in Spain to cooperate with Al Qaeda has been even more worrisome, he said.
"They're hiding in the Arab immigrant communities," Mr. Reinares said. "We're seeing the globalization of Islamic groups in Spain, which before were only concerned with events in their home countries. Now they cooperate with terrorists all across the world."
The timing of the most recent roundups in the weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks has led some analysts to conclude that Spanish authorities could have acted earlier. An extensive analysis published recently in Madrid's largest newspaper, El Pais, described the strategy of Spain's security forces toward Islamic militants before Sept. 11.
The policy was to "watch them, listen to them and keep quiet," El Pais said. "Don't wake up the lioness as long as she remained inactive in our territory, but use the information obtained about them to alert other countries when their security appeared in danger, and exchange it for information useful to Spanish security." 
"But all that has changed," the paper said, because the ferocity of the Sept. 11 violence convinced the Spanish authorities that "now it is not only the E.T.A. that must be combated."
The director of Spain's National Police, Juan Cotino, denied any recent change in policy. "We've been detaining Islamic fundamentalists for many years, not just since Sept. 11," he said recently. "The environment has changed internationally, but our investigations in Spain were under way long before." 
The new terrorists can hide in a community that has swelled. During the economic boom that followed the death of Franco in 1975 and Spain's entry into the European Union in 1986, the immigrant flow became a torrent. Spain had plenty of jobs at a time when other European countries were limiting migration.
By the mid-1980's there were perhaps 30,000 Muslims in Spain. Today an estimated 500,000 Muslim immigrants live and work alongside Spain's 40 million people, said Gemma Martin Munoz, a sociologist of Arab culture at the Autonomous University of Madrid.
The immigrants have returned to a land their ancestors once ruled. The armies of Muhammad conquered the Iberian Peninsula in the eighth century, and their descendants stayed for 700 years, weaving an extraordinary cultural legacy that continues to be vibrant. 
Al Andalus, as the Islamic civilization in southern Spain is known to Arabic speakers, remains seared in the minds of millions of Muslims worldwide.
In Mr. bin Laden's Oct. 7 videotaped message from Afghanistan that was broadcast around the world, his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, vowed that "the tragedy of Al Andalus" would not be repeated.
Mr. bin Laden and one of his brothers, Tarek, visited Alhambra -- the palace, overlooking Granada, of the last Muslim rulers of Spain -- in the early 1980's, renting the salons of an adjacent luxury hotel, according to news stories written at the time in Granada's main newspaper, Ideal.
Mr. bin Laden's visits came as Islam was flowering anew in Spain. In 1982, Arab donors financed construction of the first mosque built in Spain in five centuries, in the Mediterranean beach resort of Malaga. In 1992, a grand new mosque was inaugurated in Madrid, and now 3,000 Muslims pray there each Friday.
Ahmed Elmejjaoui, 40, a Moroccan who moved to Spain in 1988, is a security guard at that mosque. His views on the recent arrests of Islamic militants seemed to mirror those of a silent majority of Muslim immigrants, who in no way approve of terrorism. "I think it's fine they took these people in," Mr. Elmejjaoui told a visitor to the mosque one recent day. "If they weren't obeying the law, they deserved arrest."
Mr. Elmejjaoui, like Mr. Mardini, the shopkeeper, also feels a bit burned. His next-door neighbor in a southern Madrid housing project was Jasem Mahboule, a moody Syrian who rarely said hello and was, to Mr. Elmejjaoui's astonishment, detained and charged with terrorism on Nov. 13.
Other arrests in the last six months illustrate how the militants have discreetly insinuated themselves into the fabric of immigrant life.
Muhammad Bensakhria, 34, an Algerian lieutenant to Mr. bin Laden, had lived in a comfortable neighborhood in Frankfurt, living the life of an affluent businessman. 
But after the German police broke up most of his cell a year ago, Mr. Bensakhria fled to Alicante, a port on Spain's Mediterranean coast that has ferry service to Algeria. When the police arrested him in Alicante in June, Mr. Bensakhria was living on the street.
On Sept. 25 the police arrested six Algerians accused of taking part in plans to bomb the American Embassy in Paris. 
They were seized in immigrant settlements all across Spain, in places like Almeria, the southeastern province where thousands of Muslim immigrants work as laborers on coastal truck farms; Murcia, where migrant laborers harvest lettuce and work in vegetable canning factories; Valencia, where Arabs pick oranges; and Huelva, where North Africans harvest strawberries.

HEADLINE: Mayor Submits $766 Million In Cuts to Balance City Budget 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced a $1.3 billion modification to the city's budget yesterday that included $766 million in cuts to various city agencies. The mayor had called for 15 percent cuts from almost all the agencies -- save uniformed forces and the Board of Education -- in October, citing a large budget gap caused largely by the terrorist attack in September.
 The resulting cutbacks, which require the approval of the City Council, could leave the city with a surplus of roughly $500 million at the close of the fiscal year in July, the mayor said. But the new budget does little to address the budget gaps of roughly $4 billion projected in the following two years that Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg will face. 
 Mayor Giuliani offered scant details yesterday about specific programs or services that would be affected by the budget cutbacks. 
He insisted that city services would not suffer, and that most of the trims were made by eliminating or reducing programs that were in the works for the end of the year. He also said that he did not see a need for layoffs.
Last night, the City Council staff and officials at the agencies said that they had yet to see the details of what was being cut. Agencies were asked to submit their trims last month, and all of those cuts were subject to the mayor's approval. In some cases, he said, he added back money, and in other cases, he removed even more. 
He expects to submit the substance of the budget to the Council today, which will then negotiate the cuts with him. The Council has 30 days to vote on the measure; otherwise it goes to the incoming Council.
Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone said yesterday: "The Council will ensure that the burdens are shared equally by all New Yorkers during these tough fiscal times. It is vital that the mayor works with the Council so as to leave the city's fiscal house in order." Mr. Giuliani expressed confidence that the Council would approve his cuts, though many within the agencies and the Council believe that most cuts will affect pet programs of the Council. 
Although the mayor had called for 15 percent cuts from all except uniformed services, where he required 2.5 percent cuts, the trims were not uniform. Some agencies, like the Department of Sanitation, made close to 5 percent trims, while the Health Department had only 3 percent cut. Libraries, which had already reduced services in many branches, will receive a 10 percent cut. 
"The New York Public Library is still looking at what Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's reductions will mean in terms of service," read a prepared statement from the public relations office of the New York Public Library. Someone at the library with knowledge of the its financial situation said it was doubtful that many branches would be able to continue Saturday hours. 
Several agencies helped close the $1.2 billion budget gap created after Sept. 11 by producing fresh revenues, often as a result of reimbursement from the federal or state government for expenses related to the attack. 
For instance, the Police Department brought in $200 million in November, while Citywide Administrative Services brought in $29 million. The mayor's office, which trimmed less than 1 percent from its budget, said that it had contributed $89 million to the city's coffers in November. As a result, the city ended up with $26 million more in its coffers than it had anticipated. 
It is clear that most of these cuts will do little to aid Mr. Bloomberg as he faces union negotiations and a possible continued soft economy over the next few years. According to the mayor's projections yesterday, in the 2003 fiscal year beginning in July, the next mayor will face a $3.5 billion budget gap, growing to $3.9 billion the following year.

HEADLINE: Some Skimp on Tinsel as Others Splurge 

BYLINE:  By MELINDA LIGOS

 BODY:
This year, many managers are cutting back or canceling office parties, but Alfred Portale is not one of them.
 Mr. Portale, chef and co-owner of Gotham Bar and Grill in New York, plans to close his Greenwich Village restaurant on Super Bowl Sunday for a postholiday gathering that will include more than 400 employees and their family members. 
 Santa will be there. As will Winnie the Pooh, some characters from "Toy Story," a host of Pac Man and air-hockey machines, five large-screen televisions, gift bags for the children, and an open bar and lavish spread for the adults. The annual event is the only time that many employees, from dishwashers to food servers, feel comfortable coming into the restaurant as patrons, Mr. Portale says. 
"The show must go on," he said, adding that he "wouldn't dream in a million years" of abandoning a tradition he began 16 years ago.
Around half of all companies are pooh-poohing the idea of skimping on holiday gatherings this year. A survey last month by Battalia Winston International, an executive search firm, found companies split on the issue. Of those changing their plans, 82 percent said their holiday parties would be smaller or less expensive than in years past, and the remaining 18 percent will have no parties. Many gave the weak economy and the war on terrorism as rationales.
But for Mr. Portale and others like him, it is more important than ever to hold holiday parties, both to bolster employees' spirits and to defy the terrorists.
"We have all been through a lot of bad stuff this year," he said. "We need this party more now than we ever have before." The event will set him back more than $8,000, not counting the thousands in lost revenue from closing the restaurant for the day.
Michael Silver, president of Equis, a commercial real estate firm in Chicago, shares that sentiment. Not only is the Equis Chicago branch holding its regular holiday dinner at one of the city's most expensive restaurants, Naha, but for the first time it is inviting its 150 employees to bring along spouses. The five-hour party will include live entertainment and top-shelf liquor, even though profits are down 8 percent.
"I don't care if the economy's bad," Mr. Silver said. "I want our employees to feel a sense of community right about now." He derided managers who have canceled holiday parties this year as Scrooges. 
Companies going ahead with elaborate celebrations are often tapping into nationalism awakened by Sept. 11.
"We're seeing a huge pro-America sentiment in the corporate parties we're planning," said Carey Smolensky, chief executive of Carey Smolensky Productions, an event-planning and promotions company in Wheeling, Ill. Mr. Smolensky said he had had an "unusually high number of requests" for items like flag pins and Christmas trees painted red, white and blue. At a party for a jewelry company, he had a large group of vocalists light candles and sing "God Bless America," he said.
"Everyone's looking not just to party, but to send employees a message that's more poignant and heartfelt," he said.
The HomeBanc Mortgage Corporation in Atlanta briefly considered canceling its festivities but decided to go ahead to bolster employee morale. The party in Atlanta, held on Monday, had 1,800 guests. HomeBanc also scheduled parties in late November and early December in Tampa, Orlando, Palm Beach and Davie, Fla., in some cases expanding the guest lists by more than 40 percent from last year, according to Andrea Back, vice president for marketing.
"We have an awful lot to celebrate this year," Ms. Back said, noting that the company surpassed $4 billion in sales for the first time. "And many of our competitors are canceling their events, so this is our time to really shine." The theme was "home for the holidays," she said, and 18-wheeler trucks were commissioned to ship components of a life-size house to each event to serve as decor. Live bands played underneath a fake fireplace, and enormous windows and columns lined each ballroom.
In between feasting on chocolate fondue and made-to-order pasta, guests in floor-length gowns and tuxedos were asked to contribute to Habitat for Humanity, one charity the company supports. "Even though the events are huge, they're very touchy-feely this year," Ms. Back said.
Other companies are putting together holiday festivities with the notion that next year's might not be as glamorous -- or happen at all. In San Diego, one dot-com, an automotive financing start-up, has booked On Broadway, a restaurant that is available for parties, for its holiday get-together for more than 300 employees. The start-up was recently purchased by a larger firm, and company executives fear this might be their final chance to have a party together. 
At the $30,000 event, employees will nibble on shrimp and crab claws and have a chance to win a free trip to Las Vegas. "They're going all out," said Jackie Martinez, director of sales for On Broadway.
Not all employees are leaping at the prospect of holiday gatherings. Last month, Martha Stewart e-mailed 65 employees at her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, asking them to volunteer to be hosts of an intimate holiday gathering in their homes in lieu of the large party the company gave last year, according to one employee who asked not to be identified. She offered each taker $300 to help defray catering costs, but said that the host would not be able to choose who would attend: each would be assigned a guest list of 10 employees, selected at random.
When few people offered to play hosts, Ms. Stewart sent another e-mail message telling employees that "the terrorists have succeeded if so few of you participate."
But the employee said, "She still didn't have many takers." 
Susan Magrino, a spokeswoman, confirmed the account and said the company has since scrapped the idea of the home-based get-togethers and is considering several other options, including a holiday lunch.

JUST when you were re-evaluating your life-work equation in the context of a changed world, and now that you are worrying that the career you were so proud of might evaporate in this sagging economy, a researcher at the University of Michigan has proof of what you already suspected: your mother thinks you have your priorities out of whack.
 Deborah Carr, a sociologist at the Institute for Social Research, analyzed data on 200 Wisconsin mothers from the class of 1957. She found that while nearly two-thirds say their daughters are more successful in their careers than they were, they also say their daughters are less happy. "The mothers think the daughters are stressed out," she says. "They're juggling work and family, or, even worse from the mother's point of view, they're too busy to get married." 
 Her study quotes Janice, a bank teller whose daughter is a junior high school teacher. "At her age," Janice says, "I was married, I had a house, had a husband. She's single, no boyfriend, she lives in an apartment by herself. I'd say it's better for her to be married, but that's just my opinion."
My own mother has been telling me something like this for years. In the world according to Mom, the ideal timetable for life is to have kids in your 20's, then move full steam into a career when they are grown. In other words, the way she did it.
I have a most unusual mother. She collected two master's degrees and a Ph.D. during those "downtime" years while her three children were young, and she graduated from law school when I graduated from high school. She is emblematic of her generation, however, in that she did things serially, while me and mine are hell-bent on doing it all simultaneously.
One can argue that women plunge into the work force straight from school because they have more challenging options than their mothers did. Dr. Carr found the daughters in her study were better educated than their mothers, and it only makes sense that they are eager to put that education to use.
"If I had gone through all those years of training and didn't use it, I would have thought it was a major waste of time, money and effort," says Karen Allendoerfer, a Princeton graduate who earned a Ph.D. in neurobiology from Stanford University and who is now the mother of a toddler.
Dr. Allendoerfer and I know each other from an Internet news group which spends each day debating and discussing everything about parenting. Lately, the online talk has been about why professional women wait to have children. Some of the most eloquent voices agree with my mother.
"My daughter was born when I was 33," says Sister Smith Amsbary, who earned her master's degree in English at Middlebury and who has put off a Ph.D. while she cares for her 2-year-old full time. "Physiologically, the optimal average age for a woman to have a child is about 25. Nevertheless, these days, most well-educated women I know choose to postpone until their 30's."
Ideally, Dr. Allendoerfer agrees. "Women should be able to have children in their 20's and then go to med/grad/law/vet school in their 30's, rather than the other way around, which is how most of us are currently doing it."
No one, not even Mom, thinks life will go back to the way it was -- and for good reason. The entire feminist movement was about allowing women into professions that require an early start. As careers for women went from exception to expectation, however, we gained most of the benefits of a man's world, and all of the negatives. The working world is built around a male life cycle, and women see themselves with no choice but to cram their own lives into it.
Dr. Allendoerfer, who turns 36 this week, is one of those women. Intellectually, she believes in having children early, even if it means postponing a career. But, she says, "I wasn't brave or enterprising or something enough to try it myself -- not to mention the fact that I hadn't met the person I wanted to have children with."
The reality of her life as a scientist, she says, is that "there's an especially damaging stereotype that scientists do their best work while they're young." The specter of job discrimination alone, she says, is reason to plunge immediately into work.
Which is why we are all feeling stressed. And which is why our mothers are worried about us.
But if it helps at all, there is another message to be found in Dr. Carr's study: your mother is proud of you. And if you'd find a spare moment to return her phone calls, she would probably tell you so.

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT; 
Seeking a Business Degree, Across the Pond

BYLINE:  By VIVIENNE WALT 

 BODY:
A few years ago, David Pagliaro stumbled into an M.B.A. school fair at the Grand Hyatt New York, skirted past the students mobbing the Harvard and Stanford desks and headed for a stand with no visitors -- the one for the London Business School.
 "I'd never heard of them," he said, "but they were pretty condescending. They said: 'We're one of the best schools in the world and you'd be lucky to get in.' So of course I decided I had to get in." 
 Mr. Pagliaro, 27, graduated from the school last year with a master's degree in business administration and now works as a consultant for the London office of Booz Allen Hamilton.
For years, Europe's top business schools -- the London Business School; Insead in Fontainebleau, France; and the International Institute of Management Development, known as I.M.D., in Lausanne, Switzerland -- maintained a low profile. After all, they had government financing, and more than enough candidates to choose from all across the globe. They saw no need to market themselves aggressively, and people like Mr. Pagliaro stumbled upon them almost by accident.
But that is now changing. The schools, which have minuscule endowments by American standards, are facing a cash squeeze as cost-conscious governments stem the flow of subsidies. So for the first time, they are starting a sustained recruiting effort in a place where they can hope for a long-term financial payback: the United States.
"For Americans, the tradition of alumni donations is very strong, it's a very generous community," said Nick Barniville, marketing manager for Insead, which accepts about 725 M.B.A. candidates a year in two groups. "If we can get the number of American students up, we will also have much better international visibility and be able to attract top-flight faculty." Mr. Barniville has spent several weeks this year promoting Insead in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and other American cities.
His efforts are paying off, too. The 46 American students entering Insead's M.B.A. program in January are double that of last January, at about 11 percent of the class. Likewise, the proportion of Americans beginning M.B.A.'s at the London school last September was the highest yet, at 18 percent of the class, up from 13 percent a year earlier. At the much smaller I.M.D., American representation has remained about the same, at around 7 percent.
The schools' main draw is the international character of their student bodies and course work, a mix that holds a huge advantage in the global economy but that is largely absent in America's elite institutions. Although all three M.B.A. programs are taught in English, no nationality dominates, not even that of the host country. Only about 10 percent of students at Insead are French, and just 3 of I.M.D.'s 85 students are Swiss; the others come from 35 countries.
There are other big inducements, those interviewed say. Unlike American two-year M.B.A. programs, both Insead and I.M.D. offer intensive one-year courses, trimming students' costs and the time spent building a career. With the average age of students around 30, about five years older than that of most American classes, the length of study is an important consideration.
Now, the renewed interest in business schools among young adults -- prompted by the terrorist attacks, the collapse of the dot-com world and the recession -- is adding to the appeal of foreign schools.
"Since Sept. 11, I've had calls from four people in New York City saying their job had either gone or was threatened, and that they were considering coming to Europe," said Katty Ooms Suter, the M.B.A. admissions director at I.M.D. With sympathy for New Yorkers running high, Ms. Suter waived the Sept. 1 deadline for applications for them.
American students at the European schools say that since Sept. 11, their friends, too, have begun calling to quiz them about Europe. "Most people I've spoken to in America viewed the U.S. as a safe haven," said Jon Koplin, 27, who will complete a one-year M.B.A. at Insead this month. "Now the economy's down and there is terrorism, and they are more open to coming to Europe to work or live."
It is not just the new recruiting effort by the European schools that has raised their visibility in the United States. They got a big boost last year when Business Week magazine's influential M.B.A. rankings listed foreign schools for the first time. The magazine placed Insead top among non-United States business programs, with London Business School second, the University of Navarra's I.E.S.E. graduate school of management in Barcelona third and I.M.D. fourth. 
Other new moves are intended to strengthen American ties. Insead announced an alliance with the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania last May, with exchange programs that will tap directly into American talent; it also opened a Singapore campus this year.
And starting in January, the London school's new dean will be Laura D. Tyson, President Bill Clinton's economic adviser and now dean of the Haas School of Business at the University of California in Berkeley.
But that does not mean the schools are losing the international diversity that sets European schools apart from their American cousins. Philip Rosenzweig, who left his faculty job at Harvard Business School five years ago to teach strategy and international management at I.M.D., says he is still startled by the differences.
"At Harvard, one-third of our students were from abroad -- and half of those had done undergraduate work in the United States -- and we used to say: 'Gee, look how global we are,' " he said. "Here, I walk into class and there are people from all countries in the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, you name it."
For many students, simply living in Europe is seductive enough.
"Here I am sitting looking across Lake Geneva at the Alps," said Garrick Hileman, 28, from Seattle, who joined the M.B.A. program at the International Institute after leaving a high-technology incubator company in San Francisco. "I spend weekends in Italy. I go skiing in Chamonix, France. I mean, this is a little slice of heaven."

HEADLINE: Sydney, the Next Wave 

BYLINE:  By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia 

 BODY:
JUST as they are in New York, times are tough for restaurateurs in Sydney -- "tougher than tough," as one of the local superchefs said.
 Overexpansion for the Olympic Games last year, followed by the onset of a worldwide economic slowdown and a new sales tax here, followed by the events of Sept. 11, has resulted in the closing of some of the city's best-known restaurants, the scaling back of ambition at others and a sea of empty tables at still others. Clearly, the high-powered Aussie culinary bandwagon has lost some momentum. 
 A famished visitor arriving in Australia for the first time would barely notice, though. Demonstrating conclusively that Sydney's ascent during the last decade into the top ranks of the world's restaurant cities, right up there with Paris, New York and London, was no passing phase, exciting new places are opening and somehow flourishing, or at least surviving, and established stars are rehoning their skills. 
Wockpool, a glass-fronted pan-Asian pleasure palace overlooking Darling Harbor, is no more. Christine Manfield's Paramount, where a dozen or more disparate ingredients cohabited happily if improbably on a dinner plate, has closed, as has David Thompson's pioneering Darley Street Thai.
Things got so slow at MG Garage, home away from home for the hip and well heeled, that the chef and proprietor, Janni Kyritsis, began offering a single dish and a glass of wine at lunch for $15. At that price, he said, "we don't make any money, but at least it makes a joyful restaurant."
Julie Pignolet, an editor whose husband runs Sydney's best bistro, Bistro Moncur, said, "I'm afraid Sydney had too few consumers for too much creativity." 
But what's to fret about when you can tuck into dishes like Mr. Kyritsis's beef steamed in dough made with bone marrow, with a smear of tapenade inside to fight off blandness, or his finely balanced desserts, never too sweet, made with the tropical fruits that come so easily to hand on this fertile continent -- cedar lemons, passion fruit, kumquats and mandarin oranges?
Kylie Kwong, the gifted young chef who helped put Wockpool on the map, is packing them in at Billy Kwong, where the tables are smaller and the decor is plainer but the food is every bit as good. Mr. Thompson, who claims to have learned his trade from "those old biddies in the markets" in Bangkok, has decamped for London, where he now runs the acclaimed restaurant Nahm, but one of his proteges, Martin Boetz, carries the Thai banner high here.
As usual, Neil Perry, the ebullient, pony-tailed butcher's son who defined the New Australian cuisine with dishes like his luscious stir-fried blue swimmer crab omelette, is at the center of the story. Not long ago, he was running not only Rockpool, his flagship, but also Wockpool, Bistro Mars, Cafe Fish, Star Bar & Grill and so many other enterprises that he nearly lost count.
Rockpool was aswarm with customers during the Olympics, serving dinner to 250 people a night in a room that usually accommodates 150. Mr. Perry, a kind of antipodean Wolfgang Puck, cooked until 2 every morning. Well-fed sports writers from around the world mentioned him in dispatches.
"But right afterwards, business started drying up," Mr. Perry, clearly a chastened man, said. "I had 440 people on staff -- 440! I was heavily involved in developing new in-flight meals for Qantas. I could feel myself losing control. The moment had obviously come to clean out."
So Mr. Perry pared his operation to the minimum, selling or closing all the restaurants except Rockpool and concentrating on that, Qantas and (to a lesser degree) a casual new spot called XO, featuring Wockpool-esque dishes like a crispy pork hock with caramel, chili and lime sauce. He himself went back to the stove more or less full time, developing smashing new dishes like a sweetbread tarte Tatin and a tremblingly light custard tart with dates.
The upshot? Australian Gourmet Traveller, the country's leading food magazine, made Rockpool, now a dozen years old, its restaurant of the year for 2001, with this comment: "Since Perry returned to the kitchen of Rockpool we have found again what we loved when it first opened -- a surprising, complex, innovative, always memorable and complete dining experience."
Whew! But it's still true: You can eat badly in Sydney, but only if you work at it. In the best restaurants, like Tetsuya's and Salt, Banc and Claude's and MG Garage, about which I have reported previously, you can eat as well, and with more sheer glee, as almost anywhere.
On our most recent trip to Australia, my wife, Betsey, and I returned to old favorites, of course, but we also scouted some new places. Notes on four of the best of those follow, along with updates about three other places, which, like Rockpool, seemed to us to have raised their already high standards in the last two or three years. There are also a few words on a most unlikely "discovery" -- a delightful cafe in a botanical garden in the Blue Mountains.
This is by no means a definitive list. Local foodie friends told us we had made a mistake by not visiting Marque, whose chef, Mark Best, was trained by Alain Passard at l'Arpege in Paris and by Raymond Blanc near Oxford in the English countryside, to taste his boudin blanc with lentils. We also missed the prawn ravioli, "as seamless as a Savile Row suit," in one critic's view, at Celsius, a downtown restaurant newly opened by Peter Doyle, a veteran at the stove and on a surfboard.
Even we have limits.
VII, at 7 Bridge Street, was created by Eng Joo Ang, a local businessman, and he hired not one but two chefs to get it started: Harunobu Inukai, who worked for Joel Robuchon in Tokyo, and Noriyuki Sugie, who worked for Charlie Trotter in Chicago. The room is formal for Sydney, with iron columns and an exceptionally high pressed-tin ceiling.
Ambitiously conceived, the food is cooked with verve and arranged on the plate with surgical precision. With Premier Bob Carr of New South Wales and his wife, Helena, we ate for three hours, working through 13 dishes, and except for one slightly overcooked vegetable, everything was exquisite.
Highlights: A tiny cucumber "cup," filled with gazpacho, that shattered satisfyingly when I bit into it. A savory steamed custard, topped with bonito jelly, served in a pullet-egg shell. Sweet corn soup with a basil emulsion (the colors!). A seafood hotpot: bouillabaisse with a gingery Asian accent. Marbled beef, with an oxtail-stuffed onion and wasabi-flavored meat jus.
The food gave me goose bumps, and I was not exactly indifferent to the wines (a juicy 1996 Bannockburn SRH chardonnay from Victoria and a 1993 Paringa Estate pinot noir from the same state, which tasted like Mom's cherry pie).
Kylie Kwong's name sums up the new Australia. It's an Australian- Chinese hybrid, just like her cooking. I would eat in her little kingdom, BILLY KWONG, once a week, I swear, if it weren't a 20-hour flight away. You sit elbow-to-elbow on Aalto-style stools, beneath a big Noguchi-style light fixture, with a very urban, very happy, very noisy crowd that has stood in line to get in. You buy your wine, if you want any, at the carryout across the street.
All of which I usually hate, grouch that I am, but not here.
We left it to Ms. Kwong, a smile-wreathed 32-year-old, to order our dinner. Six of us polished off dish after dish, each delivered rat-tat-tat to our table as soon as we had finished its predecessor: a tart and refreshing tofu salad with rice wine, pickled vegetables and black fungus; steamed oysters with a dipping sauce of ginger, shallots and nuoc mam; steamed prawn wontons with chili oil and black vinegar; chive crepes with a delightfully complex caramelized eggplant salad; fillets of King George whiting -- my favorite Australian fish, always dependably firm, never soggy -- steamed to an ethereal turn.
It was enough to make me swear off meat, but that might have denied me the crisp-skinned duck, served with a sauce made from ruby grapefruit. So I chowed on, agreeing at every bite with my friend Bruce Wolpe across the table, who had warned us when we arrived, "You come here to eat, not to dine."
The bill was $50 Australian a head (or $26 American). It would have been a bargain at $50 American.
Acoustics at LONGRAIN can be terrible -- it opened 18 months ago in an old industrial building filled with hard edges -- but that's the only complaint I have. Service by youngsters in gray shirts and black trousers (still colors of choice in Sydney) is knowing and gentle; the long, 16-person communal tables are perfect for sampling what your neighbor ordered, and Martin Boetz's cooking is agreeably light, with more sour and vegetal flavors and fewer fiery and fishy ones than Mr. Thompson's.
Eggnets are the chef's showpiece -- webs of fast-fried egg, wrapped around pork, prawns, peanuts and sprouts, dabbed with sweet vinegar. Yummy. The green chicken curry with green beans, kaffir lime leaves and lime-size sour "pea" eggplants, served on rice noodles, also had that exquisite balance among hot, sour, sweet and salty tastes that marks great Asian food.
Everything is irresistibly fresh, even the braised shin of beef with red chili and bunches of coriander and mint. Sam Christie's short, keenly priced list of rieslings and semillons harmonizes well. If you finish with coconut ice cream and bananas roasted over coals -- sweet, smoky, the very essence of bananahood -- you will leave, as we did, with a clean palate and a spring in your step.
Sydney's greatest joy is its many-armed harbor, and OTTO takes advantage of it like no other restaurant. Otto is built on a pier in the resoundingly named neighborhood of Wolloomooloo. Makes SoHo sound a bit tame, doesn't it? Most of the year, the weather is warm enough to sit outdoors in Philippe Starck chairs, take in the skyline, gawk at the stars and smell the salt breezes. (We were there in August, equal to our February, and it was fine.)
The place is named after the Italian word for "eight," not for Otto Kahn or Otto Preminger or some other worthy. Maurizio Terzini is a maitre d' of textbook silkiness, but the waiters, who look like models for Dolce & Gabbana, push too hard and know too little.
As for the food, it just missed. A fine fritto misto was marred by excessively large chunks of vegetables; too much blood orange obscured the sweet delicacy of beautifully seared sea scallops. But a thinly cut, quickly grilled steak with plenty of lemon juice hit the spot, as did a pear poached in Campari and grenadine, served with mascarpone. We loved the discreet note on the menu: "Please call to book our berth when you are arriving by boat."
Two things, both good, have happened to TETSUYA'S, the most innovative of Sydney's restaurants. It has moved from a humdrum, 1,000-square-foot building in the outer suburbs to a 21,000-square-foot building downtown, where indoor waterfalls and rock gardens evoke the mood of dinner in the Ginza.
Except it's better. You can always tell when Tetsuya Wakada's oysters are coming; the briny scent hits your nostrils before you see them. You sense his innovative gifts, rooted in Asia, when you taste his confit of Tasmanian ocean trout, moist, sweet, delicate, accented by its own roe and by salsify. A leg of lamb, slow-roasted for six hours, shows his mastery of the classical European idiom; so does a floating island that floats right off the plate.
When I first ate Tets's food, I was bowled over, but I thought it a bit overwrought, like that of his chum Charlie Trotter. This time it was simpler, stripped of excess gestures, but still elegant, still delectable.
Serge Dansereau had just got started when we first visited the BATHERS' PAVILION, a restored Art Deco bathhouse on Balmoral Beach. Now he has hit his stride. There can't be many places on this planet better for a jolly Sunday lunch on a sunny day, as a rowdy bunch of us found. We ate nothing but seafood, all first class, especially a tuna, scallop and cuttlefish sashimi with sea urchin sauce -- tip-top ingredients enlivened by a clever idea.
"Your average ocean shark hasn't eaten as much fish or had as much fun as I have today," said our old pal Tony Clifton of Newsweek magazine. 
Lunch or dinner, no matter what the weather is, Damien Pignolet's BISTRO MONCUR is a lively, civilized urban rendezvous. Along with down-home French classics like house-made Lyonnaise pork sausages, Provencal fish soup and duck braised with green olives, all immaculately realized, the menu always lists a few modern items, like seared tuna with gnocchi, beets and anchovies. The sirloin steaks come with that vintage treat, Cafe de Paris butter. 
Bistro Moncur has been a Sydney institution since it opened, and it keeps improving, without losing its personality. Like Allard in Paris, the ur-bistro of my salad days, it proves that fancier is not always better.
The MOUNT TOMAH BOTANICAL GARDEN, 65 miles west of Sydney, 3,000 feet up in the Blue Mountains, is a paradise of cool-climate flowers. The proteas are world famous. But I had a lot of trouble keeping my mind on horticulture after lunch in John and Lidia Henriksen's restaurant overlooking them.
Fearing tea-room banality, we sat down instead to plump grilled langoustines, their sweet flavor punched up with lemon juice, butter, basil and garlic, and a gutsy Balinese-style pork curry, rich with turmeric, lemon grass and palm sugar. Who knew? We should have. Lucky Sydneysiders have grown accustomed to finding vividly flavored food wherever they wander, even in a garden.
First of four reports from Sydney and the west.

HEADLINE: In a Stressed City, No Room at the Bar 

BYLINE:  By MARIAN BURROS

 BODY:
THEY were three deep at Guastavino's bar last Thursday night, downing flirtinis, cucumber martinis and patriots, a red, white and blue martini suitable for the times. Bartenders kept up a steady beat -- mix, mix, mix -- while waiters rushed to deliver trays of frothy daiquiris and coffee martinis. 
 It wasn't unusual. 
 Almost three months after the terrorist attacks, New Yorkers are drinking more than ever. Even as restaurants struggle with empty seats and fewer diners willing to pay high tabs, liquor sales are climbing at bars, restaurants and some liquor stores throughout the city.
At a few places -- a diverse list including Pravda, the Regency Hotel and McSorley's -- liquor sales were 25 percent higher last month than they were in November 2000. And as the holiday season gets into full swing, the numbers are bound to increase. 
"People who were drinking three drinks are now having four or five," said Richard Schertzer, a senior bartender at Pastis, the brasserie in the meatpacking district. "They are drinking more martinis and fancy cocktails than before, even late at night, at 1 or 2 in the morning."
"The mood is different," he added. "Once people get out and see a few smiling faces around, they take it as a nice escape and use it to have a bit more fun."
Whether people are drinking to relieve anxiety and stress, as psychiatrists believe, or because they want to socialize more and drinking is part of that, all over town bars are fuller and livelier. There's more hard liquor and less high-end wine; more big groups and fewer singles. People are staying later, locked in late-night conversation rather than giddy revelry.
The dramatic rise in consumption of alcoholic beverages immediately after Sept. 11 was a nationwide phenomenon, liquor distributors and others in the business say. But nowhere was it more evident than in New York. After the first couple of weeks, there was a significant drop -- until last month, when business came back, with a vengeance. Not only was it up in Manhattan and in some of the boroughs but also in nearby Long Island and Connecticut suburbs. 
Discus, the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, plans to release national consumption figures next year. But ACNeilsen, which also tracks national retail sales of wine and spirits, reports that the sales volume of alcoholic beverages has been up every week since Sept. 11 compared with last year. For the week ending Nov. 3, the most recent figure available, volume rose 4.2 percent.
"At first, people felt a little uneasy and didn't want to appear to be celebrating -- now I think there is a certain nervous fatigue that propels people," said Kurt Eckert, the wine director for Jean-Georges Vongerichten's five New York restaurants, where liquor sales were up 3 to 4 percent. "People are a bit relieved, but the recent plane crash, anthrax in addition, have left people a bit shaken. There has been a drop in the number of people dining, but they are ordering more wine."
At Guastavino, business in the restaurant is down, but business at the bar last month was up 10 percent compared with a year ago. The restaurant is staying open later on weekends and has installed a disc jockey. At McSorley's, where the average customer drinks 8 to 10 glasses of ale, business has picked up substantially in the afternoons, according to Matthew Maher, the owner.
"If you walk into Smith & Wollensky, you think it's a great night because you can't get near the bar," said Alan Stillman, chairman of the Smith & Wollensky Restaurant Group, "but the restaurant is not full. More liquor is being consumed by fewer people."
And at many places, the cast of characters is quite different. Guastavino, for example, was long known as one of the best pickup spots in town. Since Sept. 11, the revelers have been coming in groups of three or five, even eight, eager to be with their friends. 
Like Karla Koontz, 27, who is unemployed. "I think I'm hanging out more because I want the company," she said. "It's not so much partying at clubs late, it's more good conversation."
Many, who at first laughed nervously when asked if they were drinking more, and wanted to make certain no one thought they were drinking too much, eventually acknowledged that their consumption had increased, if only because they were going out more. For a lot of people -- even 20- and 30-somethings, who in the past thought they were immortal -- Sept. 11 was an awakening. 
"I used to be health-conscious," said Mark Booker, a 36-year-old real estate investor, sitting at a table in the Pastis bar. "I used to work out; now I don't give a damn. I used to go out twice a month; now I go out twice a week. It's friends coming together to embrace each other. And the reason I am drinking more is because I'm out more."
Sitting with two friends at Guastavino's bar, Marty Majchrowicz, 33, the president of a medical education company in New York, said he was spending a lot more time with friends. "I'm feeling less inhibited and feeling less guilty about going out and drinking," he said. "I'm feeling an obligation to spend more money in the city. I'm eating out more often, about four nights a week, and drinking more cocktails, two or three."
Others say they are drinking to relieve stress. "Boy, are you at the right table," said Esther Gweft, 51, a lawyer who does public relations for Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. "I'm a two-glass-of-wine person at home, but now it's three, three and a half glasses. My staff is stressed. Everything makes them anxious because of 9/11. I have two kids, and my son got very anxious. You get stressed trying to keep everyone else cheerful."
At the Regency Hotel, "people are coming at 5 o'clock and staying all evening," said Clark Wolf, a consultant to the hotel. "Since Oct. 1, sales have been hard core: cocktails, manhattans, bottles of wine, vodka on the rocks and martinis -- no flavored martinis, just the real stuff."
At Excelsior, a bar in Brooklyn, "people are definitely drinking more," said Richard Kennedy, the owner. "Our figures are up 8 percent over last year."
Jean-Claude Baker, the owner of Chez Josephine, is stunned that his bar business is up 25 percent over last year. "The past two months have been the best ever in 15 years," he said.
Retail sales in New York are less uniform. Michael Aaron, chairman of Sherry-Lehmann, the East Side wine merchant, said that even though sales in September were down 25 percent from last year, and in October were down 20 percent, they were up 15 percent in November. And he said he was selling much more expensive wines than a year ago, which flies in the face of what is happening in restaurants. 
At Acker, Merrall & Condit, a West Side merchant, the number of people buying wine and spirits is up 15 percent for October and November. But at Gotham Wines and Liquors business is flat, and at Garnet Wines and Liquors, Marty Laufer, an assistant sales manager, said: "It definitely is not what it was last November -- we are seeing more hard liquor but not so much high-end wine."
Based on interviews with alcoholic beverage distributors who sell to markets around the country, the picture is mixed elsewhere. The overall impression is that the precipitous drop in sales in New York immediately after Sept. 11 was felt in a few cities, particularly those dependent on tourists and business travelers, but that those places have rebounded and that business has remained strong elsewhere. 
Kerri Madigan, president of Rosenthal Wine Merchant, said business was very good in November. "Retail and restaurants finished off very strongly compared to last year in New York. The East Coast was way ahead of last year, up about 15 percent on both coasts. The middle of the country stayed very strong."
And some distributors have noted that in places where restaurant and bar sales are off, sales at retail stores are up.
Lee Schrager, director of media for Southern Wine and Spirits in Miami, the largest distributor in the world, said he did not think Sept. 11 had as much impact on the rest of the country as it did in New York.
It is hardly surprising. New Yorkers have been through a lot. 
For certain people, like recovering alcoholics, the problem can be very serious. Joseph Califano, president of the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, is worried about them. "With a more traumatic and intense tragedy than Oklahoma City, I am concerned that we will have a greater increase in alcohol abuse in New York than was experienced in Oklahoma City," he said. "And that was substantial."
People do a variety of things to ease discomfort, said James Bernard, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in New York. "Drinking or self-medicating is just one of the behaviors," he said. "One of the central ingredients in people I've seen is a feeling of helplessness, which is one of most intolerable feelings for most people."
Dr. Gail Saltz, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who is chairman of public information for the New York Psychoanalytic Institute, said she had seen a definite increase in alcohol use in her patients. "People aren't often aware when they self-medicate for anxiety," she said. "They are also using it because they can't sleep, and the reason they can't sleep is anxiety."
At Pastis, Chris Horn, 43, a casting director, ordered a second bottle of wine while the first was still half full. He said he was definitely consuming more these days.
"When you sit down to relax and start talking, you don't realize it," he said. "Usually we have one and a half bottles. A year ago, it was one bottle."

HEADLINE: U.S. Students Are Middling On Test Given In 32 Nations 

BYLINE:  By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
An examination measuring practical knowledge in math, science and reading among students in 32 industrialized nations shows that those in Canada, Finland and New Zealand lead the world in all three categories, with American students performing at only average levels.
 The exam, administered to a quarter-million 15-year-olds by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, measured reading, science and math skills with questions that approximated real-life situations. It was meant to gauge the ability of students to operate in the world as they neared the end of their time in elementary and secondary school. 
 As in reading exams administered nationally and in earlier international tests in mathematics, American students as a whole performed unspectacularly. Of the 28 O.E.C.D. member nations that took part in the testing -- 4 participants were not members of the organization -- only Greece, Portugal, Luxembourg and Mexico performed significantly worse than the United States in science. And only those countries plusItaly did substantially worse in math.
The United States education secretary, Rod Paige, said he was disappointed that American students had not stood out. "In the global economy," Dr. Paige said, "these countries are our competitors. Average is not good enough for American kids."
An analysis of the test results by the Paris-based organization showed that at least in reading, as many American students performed in the top percentiles as did students in the highest-performing countries. The problem was that there were also large numbers of American students who read in the lowest percentiles. Barry McGaw, the organization's deputy director for education, said these results suggested that the United States could improve its standing by directing help at its lowest-performing students. 
Dr. McGaw added that although educators had long debated whether schools could succeed despite instability or poverty in a child's home, the report accompanying the test results showed that some countries, like Finland, had done well at educating students of all backgrounds; poor home conditions in other nations, including the United States and Germany, pose a greater obstacle to student achievement, he said. 
The report also showed a variety of differences in performance by sex. In every nation, girls did significantly better than boys in reading. In half the countries, boys did much better than girls in math, a subject in which girls did not perform significantly better anywhere. In science, boys did much better than girls in three countries, although girls in New Zealand performed significantly better than boys there.

HEADLINE: Our Towns; 
Commerce Comes Calling In the Park

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS

DATELINE: PLAINFIELD, N.J. 

 BODY:
IT may have lawns, benches, winding pathways and frolicking children, but whatever you do, don't call the four-acre greensward in downtown Plainfield a park.
 A municipal sign anointing it Roberto Clemente Memorial Park has been removed. To clear up lingering confusion, city officials recently dismantled the Victorian gazebo that once graced its center. 
 Set in the heart of this bedraggled city, the Park-Madison site, as officials prefer to call it, may soon sprout a four-story complex of stores, county offices and parking. The deal will earn Plainfield $1 million and inject desperately needed life into a city that has been floundering since the late 1960's, when school busing and race riots fueled the familiar scourge of white flight and economic decline. 
There is only one problem. Under state law, any land that has been used as a park must remain a park. Of course, there are loopholes. Municipalities can claim that bureaucrats mistakenly designated a space as parkland. Even though Plainfield spent $300,000 in federal money making the place look more like a park, and despite the fact that dozens of permits are given out for carnivals and community fund-raisers -- officials are saying that the Park-Madison site was never a park.
"It was a clerical error," said Dan Damon, a spokesman for the city, which has a population of 48,000, explaining why the plot was placed on a New Jersey open spaces inventory. Although state officials insist on calling it a park, the site's future rests with Robert C. Shinn, New Jersey's commissioner of environmental protection, who is expected to decide in the coming weeks.
The land, which was cleared 35 years ago, was originally part of a federal urban renewal project that died when financing evaporated. Mayor Albert T. McWilliams said the improvements, which started a decade ago, were meant only to turn an embarrassing eyesore into a temporary urban amenity. "To us, that land has always been a symbol of Plainfield's inability to progress," Mr. McWilliams said. "The only reason we put grass there was to keep the dirt from blowing all over the place."
TELL that to Myrna Rivera, 32, an office cleaner from Ecuador, who was taking her 2-year-old daughter, Vivian, for a stroll on a recent warm afternoon. "We love this place," she said. "We would be very sad if they took it away."
Although Plainfield's growing Hispanic population stands to lose a cherished swath of greenery, it is the city's wealthier residents who are battling the backhoes. In a city that is 83 percent minority, Plainfield officials privately say that that the most vociferous proponents of keeping the site green are white. Mr. Damon calls them "the newcomers."
Deborah Dahl, a consultant to nonprofit organizations, has been leading the charge. She believes that Plainfield is making a grave error by paving over what they call the village green. "The health and economic vitality of a town is shaped by its center," said Ms. Dahl, who bought two rambling mansions here two years ago and is converting one into corporate apartments. "When potential home buyers or employers come here, the first thing they see is this beautiful open green. It says: 'This is great place for children. This is our soul.' "
The debate, tinged by talk of racism and underhanded politics, has become rancorous. Ms. Dahl says the city tried to secretly push the project through the approvals process. Mr. Damon accuses her of spinning lies. Others complain that the project, anchored by social services, is less than ideal. Downtown, they point out, is littered with empty buildings begging for revitalization.
"The city has no foresight," said Murray Roberts, who moved here in 1968, when most middle-class residents were fleeing. "To me it sounds like a political deal, the perfect place for patronage. If they really want to develop downtown, they should improve the park and then enhance the area."
At its core, the dispute is a clash between visions of how to revive a wounded city. Ms. Dahl said the future of Plainfield, blessed with one of the country's largest collection of Victorian architecture, lies in drawing affluent homesteaders, people much like herself. 
But Mr. McWilliams believes the elixir for Plainfield's woes are lower property taxes, a feat that can only be achieved by luring more commerce. Sure, downtown is littered with empty buildings, he says, but so far, no one is clamoring to buy them.
"These people are just sitting on the sidelines saying, 'Do this, do that,' " he said. "But bring me an interested developer and I'll be happy to listen."

HEADLINE: The Latest Blow to Buffalo: A Layoff of Hundreds at Schools 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
Diana Seifert wants to stay in Buffalo even though, by her count, she has lost five jobs in the past eight years because of layoffs in the health care field. So this year, she began teaching in the city's public school system because she loved children and heard that there was a shortage of good teachers.
 But now, Mrs. Seifert is out of a job for the sixth time. 
 "It's heartbreaking," Mrs. Seifert, 41, said Friday afternoon as she tearfully hugged her students at the Waterfront Elementary School. "I told them that I'm not sick, I'm not dying, but you know, they don't understand. It's hard for me to understand how it could reach such a drastic point." 
The Buffalo school district is expected to lay off 557 of its 7,000 employees -- including 433 teachers -- this month in a desperate effort to reduce a $28 million shortfall in its current budget. The widespread job cuts in the state's second-largest school district have led to demonstrations by hundreds of students, parents and teachers in the past two weeks, and forced most of the 78 schools to increase class sizes and eliminate programs mid-year.
"This is the worst disaster we've ever had in this school district," said Marion Canedo, the Buffalo superintendent. "I'm just sick about it. There isn't a school that isn't affected."
The school layoffs are the latest setback for a historic waterfront city of nearly 300,000 that is engulfed in its worst financial crisis in years. Long accustomed to last-minute infusions of state aid, school and city officials here say they were caught by surprise in October when their request for an additional $54 million -- $31 million for the city and $23 million for the schools -- was turned down by state political leaders. 
By then, the anticipated money had already been counted and spent in Buffalo. The school district and city government have separate budgets, and separate operations, though they share revenue from city taxes and fees. The school district does not have separate taxing authority.
School and city officials say the drawn-out state budget process forced them to use estimates of state aid -- rather than actual amounts -- to pass their own budgets on time, and then the Sept. 11 terrorist attack in New York City changed everything because it caused a steep drop in state revenues that would have normally been used to help struggling cities.
"In Buffalo, 450 miles away from the scene, we're being very negatively impacted," said Mayor Anthony M. Masiello, a Democrat and the city's chief lobbyist in Albany. "Traditionally, we always get close to what we ask for. We would have made it work without the pain we're in now."
City officials laid off 75 workers last month, and are considering layoffs of police officers and firefighters, among others, as part of a financial recovery plan to be released later this month. The mayor said he might propose selling off city assets, combining some city and county services, and transferring parks, baseball stadiums, art galleries and theaters to the county's control.
But many longtime city residents and others say that Buffalo had chronic financial problems long before the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, and that the steady flow of state money had only propped up a sprawling, inefficient government. 
"The city was never doing fine," said Joseph Bernat, 54, a dentist who moved to Buffalo in 1964. "It's very inefficient with a lot of bloated services, and a lot of union-driven contracts that are too expensive for a city of our size."
Joel A. Giambra, a Republican who is the Erie County executive, said he had been advocating a leaner city government since serving as the city comptroller in the mid-1990's. "It's easy to blame the state," he said. "But crisis breeds opportunity, and this is the tough love that this community has needed."
Though cities and towns across New York are struggling with less state aid than expected, things are particularly bad in Buffalo because it has become so dependent on the state's largesse in recent years. The city and its suburbs in Erie County are considered a key swing district in statewide elections, and have benefited from the patronage of powerful state leaders, including Gov. George E. Pataki and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.
For instance, in a recent report about Buffalo's financial problems, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall noted that state aid to the city government had increased 76 percent to $102 million in 2000-2001 from $58 million in 1995-1996, even as revenue from the city's property taxes shrunk to $141 million from $148 million because of the declining population and eroding tax base.
Mr. Masiello said he had been disappointed that state political leaders had not come through with more state aid for Buffalo during its current crisis. "These people have helped us in the past, and we appreciate it, but now all of a sudden to walk away from the problem and leave it in our laps is unconscionable."
Suzanne Morris, a spokeswoman for the governor, said Mr. Pataki had acted last week to speed up the release of $48.6 million in previously approved state aid for Buffalo to ease its cash flow problems. "Keeping in mind that in the wake of Sept. 11, the state is facing major fiscal challenges, including a projected $9 billion shortfall in revenue," she said, "we will continue to look for additional ways to help."
But no new state money is expected for Buffalo, at least for now, state political leaders say. "I think all local governments need to be aware that the downturn in the state's economy is going to have consequences for them," said State Assemblyman Paul A. Tokasz, a Democrat who represents part of Buffalo and is the majority leader in the assembly. 
The reality of less state aid has shocked the Buffalo school district, where state money has come to pay for nearly three-quarters of its operations. According to State Education Department figures for 1999-2000, 73 percent of the district's budget came from state revenue sources, compared with 66 percent in Syracuse, 62 percent in Rochester and 44 percent in New York City.
Ms. Canedo, the superintendent, said that her schools simply did not receive enough from city taxes to make up the shortfall in expected state aid this year. "It's not like we're being foolish and putting all our eggs in one basket," she said. "But where else do we get the money from?"
The school district has slashed spending on equipment and supplies, and may have to close three or four schools next year. The single biggest savings -- the layoffs -- will shave only $18 million from the district's $28 million budget gap. (The district also had to offset more than $5 million in unplanned expenses for charter schools after a larger number of students enrolled than expected).
The school layoffs have united city and school officials, union leaders, teachers, parents and students in a massive campaign to lobby for more federal and state aid. They have flooded state politicians with angry letters and staged rallies almost daily across the city. Hundreds of students have walked out of their classrooms in protest.
For teachers like Tina Paoliello, the layoffs have been devastating. Ms. Paoliello, 28, spent four years teaching in Charlotte, N.C., so that she would have enough experience to get hired back home in Buffalo. She worked at the Waterfront Elementary School for just three months before being laid off on Friday.
"My goals are just squashed," she said. "I wanted to buy a little house, and that's not going to happen for a while. Everything's on hold. I feel real helpless, I don't know what to do."
At the same school, Mrs. Seifert was packing up what was left of her classroom on Friday afternoon. Her chalkboard had been washed clean, her posters taken off the walls, and all 19 of her students reassigned to other classes. Even the tables and chairs were being rolled away.
"I really wanted to teach in the city, even though I grew up in the suburbs," she said wistfully. "Because I felt the city needed good teachers. I don't have any regrets because it was a wonderful experience."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Technology Issues Give Equities Enough Legs to Climb

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Strength in the technology sector sent stocks soaring yesterday in a rally that gave investors hope the market's post-Sept. 11 advance still had momentum.
 The Dow Jones industrial average had a triple-digit advance, as buying gained intensity late in the session. 
 But analysts were skeptical that the market was beginning another extended run upward and noted that there were only a few signs that business and the economy were stabilizing. 
The Dow closed up 129.88 points, or 1.3 percent, at 9,893.84. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index rose 58.20 points, or 3.1 percent, at 1,963.10. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 14.90 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,144.80.
"I'm not seeing any news today that is specifically causing this, but it looks like investors are anticipating better times ahead and saying that we better own stocks because the tide is getting ready to turn," said Bill Barker, an investment strategy consultant with RBC Dain Rauscher.
"It also could be seasonality. December historically is a pretty good month for the market, and we usually do get a year-end rally," he said.
The market also got a lift from comments by President Bush, who, speaking in Florida, demanded action from Congress on an economic stimulus package.
Cisco Systems rose 66 cents, to $20.52, after its chief executive told analysts that orders met expectations in November, although he also implied that the company's outlook had not changed.
Enron rose 47 cents, or 118 percent, to 87 cents, on speculation that up to $1.5 billion in new financing from J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup would help rescue the energy company, which filed for bankruptcy protection on Sunday.
J. P. Morgan Chase gained 67 cents, to $37.22, while Citigroup advanced 92 cents, to $47.83.
 --------------------

Treasuries Are Higher
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury bond prices rose yesterday as investors said they expected the employment data on Friday may show that the jobless rate rose to a five-and-a-half-year high in November.
A surge in the unemployment rate would bolster expectations the Federal Reserve would follow an expected interest rate cut next week with another in January. 
The 10-year Treasury note rose 9/32, to a price of 102 21/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.66 percent from 4.69 percent on Monday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond climbed 20/32, to 102 18/32. The bond's yield declined to 5.20 percent from 5.24 percent on Monday.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

The federal Environmental Protection Agency's administrator, Christie Whitman, said yesterday that the agency would move forward with a nearly $500 million dredging plan to remove PCB pollution from the upper Hudson River. In doing so, the agency rejected General Electric's efforts to scale back the cleanup.
 The E.P.A. plan, which would be one of the largest and most complex environmental cleanup projects in the nation's history, is essentially identical to the government's initial proposal, issued in August. Environmentalists said the decision to stay the course was a major victory. 
 It comes at a time of deep economic and political uncertainty, and without being complicated by new technical requirements that many experts said could have delayed or derailed the project.
"This is everything we were hoping for," said Ned Sullivan, the president of Scenic Hudson, a conservation group that has pushed for the river's cleanup for decades.
General Electric, which is largely responsible for the PCB's, which were spilled from its electrical component plants north of Albany, has argued that dredging is an environmental risk in itself. In a huge advertising and lobbying campaign, the company contended that PCB's now buried in the river's mud could be "resuspended" by dredging, thereby released to pollute the river all over again.
Ms. Whitman said in a statement that questions related to resuspension, along with other details about the work, would be addressed in the final project plan, but that they would be explored in a public process simultaneous with the design phase, and would therefore not slow down the project.
"We are going ahead," she said. "We will do so with a continuing open process."
A spokesman for G.E., Mark L. Behan, said the plan had not yet been forwarded to the company and that until G.E. officials had an opportunity to read it thoroughly, they would not comment.
One of the leading opponents of dredging in Congress, Representative John Sweeney, a Republican who represents the upper Hudson region, said that while he still does not like the plan, the E.P.A.'s promise to keep the public involved could go a long way toward avoiding what he called a "big-dig mess."
"This means my constituents will have their views and concerns considered central, and until now they've been neglected," he said.
G.E. used PCB's -- polychlorinated biphenyls, oily yellow insulating material -- for more than 30 years at its factories in Hudson Falls and Fort Edward, N.Y., until the manufacturing and use of the chemicals were banned in 1977. During the time PCB's were used at the plants, an estimated one million pounds or more of the toxic material, which can accumulate in the tissues of fish and has been linked to cancer risk in humans, leaked or was dumped into the river, some of it under state permits.
The cleanup plan, which focuses on a 40-mile stretch of the river between the Troy Dam and the Thompson Island Pool, near Schuylerville, would dredge about 2.65 million cubic yards of river bottom in an effort to remove 150,000 pounds of PCB's.
Much of the pollution, environmental experts say, was dispersed broadly into the environment and cannot be recovered, however.
Environmentalists also caution that simply ordering the cleanup of the river still leaves many questions. The project's design phase alone is expected to take up to three years. During that time, issues including what type of dredging technology should be used and what kind of methods should be employed to prevent resuspension of PCB's will have to be worked out.
Plants to remove water from the dredged mud will also have to be built. And the dredging itself could take five years or more.
The work is being conceived as a two-phase project, with a public report and evaluation to be made after the first phase of dredging is complete. Environmentalists say that one of the issues to watch will be how much dredging is contemplated in each phase, since a break could alter or delay the rest of the work.
"We're all going to need to be really vigilant," said Katherine Kennedy, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a New York-based conservation group. She praised Gov. George E. Pataki for his support for the dredging plan, but said that continued attention and support by the state, through the years to come, will be crucial.

HEADLINE: Honda Opens a U.S. Factory and a Front Against the Big 3 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: LINCOLN, Ala., Dec. 4 

 BODY:
Top executives of Honda Motor criticized the Big Three today for what they view as a double standard on fuel economy. The executives said that domestic manufacturers were not willing to face the environmental implications of becoming increasingly reliant on sales of pickups and sport utility vehicles.
 "Business and some social obligation have to be equally applied to the whole company," said Koichi Amemiya, chief executive of Honda's American operations, who was in Alabama to open a minivan assembly plant. 
 "They're getting a big profit," from truck sales, he added, referring to the Big Three. "That's why they're shifting more to light trucks. Then, it comes to fuel economy, and they say 'we're a truck manufacturer, and it's not fair.' " 
On Thursday, the Senate Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on fuel economy standards, the first significant policy debate on automotive fuel economy since the Sept. 11 attacks. Congress has not significantly increased fuel economy requirements since the 1980's. Environmental groups would like to see standards for pickups and sport utilities increased.
There is some concern among officials at Honda and other foreign manufacturers that if regulators set any change to fuel economy standards -- a considerable if -- the Big Three would lobby for an across-the-board increase in mileage of, say, 5 or 10 percent, rather than a goal to reach specific mileage targets.
A percentage goal would hurt Toyota Motor and Honda, because they already have fleets with higher average gas mileage. Hiroyuki Yoshino, the president of Hondo, said, "What I'd like to have is fair treatment." He added that a percentage-improvement requirement for a company already ahead in fuel economy would be unfair.
It has been one of the best years ever for automobile sales -- despite the recession. Sales have been driven by a wave of interest-free financing deals offered by the Big Three since Sept. 11. It is also expected to be the best year for sales of sport utilities, despite violence in the Middle East and renewed debate about American fuel consumption.
"Americans are always, the bigger the better," Mr. Yoshino said. "For Japan and Europe, sometimes it's the smaller the better." Mr. Yoshino said many fuel economy goals would not be as difficult to reach as competitors had implied.
"Twenty or 30 years ago, there was already the idea of air bags, but most people thought it was unfeasible," Mr. Yoshino said. But today, he pointed out, they are everywhere.
Most automakers expect that a device called a fuel cell will eventually supplant the internal combustion engine and be a silver bullet solution to oil consumption. A fuel cell generates electric power by separating hydrogen electrons from protons, using the electrons to create a current and then recombining them with protons and oxygen. Fuel-cell-powered vehicles, ideally, emit only water.
While most automakers have prototypes of such vehicles, they are still at least a decade, and possibly much longer, away from mass production. Until then, Toyota and Honda have taken aggressive intermediate steps, for example selling small numbers of hybrid gasoline- and electric-powered cars. Next year, Honda plans to introduce a hybrid version of its popular Civic.
Ford Motor and General Motors have said they will produce hybrid vehicles of their own, but gas consumption will remain hard to improve so long as large vehicles increase in popularity, and as foreign makers crowd the market. Next year, Honda plans to roll out a new S.U.V. that will be a sister version of its Acura MDX.
Honda's larger vehicles do tend to be more efficient than the Big Three's. Honda's light trucks averaged 24.9 miles a gallon in model year 2001, according to a projection from the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental group. Each of the Big Three's truck fleets averaged from 20.5 to 20.7 m.p.g. by comparison, while Toyota was 22.1 m.p.g.
Strong auto sales have not helped profitability for the Big Three, because they are propelled by costly incentives. While G.M. is expected to report a profit, Ford and Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, are expected to report losses this year.
Sales at Honda have remained strong even though it has not offered interest-free financing deals.
That has been a boon to Alabama. Today, Honda said that it would increase its projected annual pace of production for the Lincoln plant to 150,000 Odyssey minivans next year, from 120,000. It also intends to hire 2,300 workers, up from 1,500. And, it was cheered by its new workers at a time when unemployment is rising and the Big Three are talking about closing plants.
Phillip Sherrell, 39, left a job making cabinets in nearby Birmingham to take a job in August casting cylinder heads for the Odyssey. "The plant, right now, they can't produce enough," he said.

HEADLINE: Debate at Harvard Asks If Its A's Are Too Cheap 

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 3 

 BODY:
When Yann Kumin, a sophomore at Harvard, received a B on a recent 10-page term paper, he felt that he did not deserve that good a grade. Mr. Kumin, 19, said he had spent little time on the assignment, which he submitted in one of the core courses that is required of all Harvard undergraduates.
 "I know I can do minimal work in some classes and get good grades," said Mr. Kumin, a history major, as he dragged on a cigarette outside the university's main library. "I think there's an attitude at Harvard that you've gotten in, and that it's tough to get in, and so you're going to get an easier time once you're here, almost as a reward. Kids take advantage of that attitude." 
 Thoughts like Mr. Kumin's are getting a more public airing these days as the Harvard campus engages in a broad debate over what a grade of A, B, C or D should mean at perhaps the nation's most elite and influential private college. 
The discussions were stoked most recently by a report issued late last month by the dean of the faculty of arts and sciences that disclosed a striking statistic: about half of the grades awarded in recent years to Harvard undergraduates were either A's or A-'s, a sizable increase from a generation ago. 
The debate over how many A's are too many is being closely monitored at other colleges grappling with so-called grade inflation, as well as at the graduate schools and corporations that must make sense of such homogeneous transcripts. 
On one side of the discussion are those professors who believe that Harvard has cheapened what it means to receive an A or an honors degree and has made little effort to distinguish good work from excellent work from great work. 
Harvey C. Mansfield, a longtime professor of government who specializes in political philosophy, said he believed that his colleagues were awarding so many A's because they feared discouraging students who had been accustomed to getting A's all their lives. Professor Mansfield, whose middle initial has been rechristened "C-" by critics, believes that no more than 10 percent of the students in his classes should receive an A or A-, regardless of the relative quality of students.
"If we're giving students the same grades they got in high school, we're saying that Harvard is no better than high school," said Professor Mansfield, who received a bachelor's degree from Harvard in 1953 and has been teaching here since 1962. "But these students aren't in high school anymore. They're in the big leagues. They should have to compete with each other."
He has also injected a racial component into the discussion by contending that white professors tend to avoid giving bad grades to black students, perhaps because they worry that such students might then be inclined to flee Harvard. 
"There's a feeling that you shouldn't pass judgment in a way that might hurt someone's self-esteem," said Mr. Mansfield, who is white.
While few here support the notion that one of every two grades issued by the university should be an A or A-, many professors believe that the quality of work undertaken by most Harvard students may well be deserving of a high grade -- regardless of how many other Harvard students receive that same grade.
That more A's are being awarded than a generation ago, they argue, is often a reflection of how much better the pool of students has become. (A quarter of the students admitted to this year's Harvard freshman class, for example, scored a perfect 1600, or just below it, on the SAT's.)
Harry R. Lewis, the dean of Harvard College, who has been teaching computer science at Harvard for 20 years, said he had noticed that "problems that used to be really hard for a majority of the students are now hard for the minority."
In contrast to Mr. Mansfield's contention that grade inflation began in earnest in the late 1960's, when blacks were first admitted in considerable numbers, Dean Lewis has assembled data showing that the number of A's at Harvard has been increasing at a fairly steady rate since the 1920's; if anything, the trend was relatively flat from 1969 to 1985. "A lot of the increases are a result of applying the same standard to better academic work," Dean Lewis said.
In contrast to years past, when few changes in policy emerged from such hand-wringing, there are indications that this round may be different. Harvard's new president, Lawrence H. Summers, the former treasury secretary, is "very concerned about both honors inflation and grade inflation and believes very strongly in the importance of high and rigorous standards," said Joe Wrinn, a spokesman.
In distributing last month's report, Dean Susan Pedersen wrote that a faculty-wide panel would take up the matter in the spring, with an eye on proposing "concrete action." Dean Pedersen said she already sensed "some measure of agreement" that "we were in a healthier situation about 15 years ago," when a smaller proportion of grades -- roughly one-third -- fell in the 'A' range.
But imposing a more uniform grading standard on professors who have been encouraged to think independently will not be easy. One potential end-run being discussed would expand the information on a student's transcript to provide graduate schools with a numerical indication of how other students in the same class were graded. Dartmouth and Columbia have provided similar information in recent years. 
But Emily Leithauser, 18, a freshman contemplating a major in Middle Eastern studies, believes that the only real solution lies with Harvard students themselves. "I really believe Harvard students don't always challenge themselves," she said. "And I don't know that they take criticism as well as they should."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about Harvard data showing that nearly half of all undergraduate grades in recent years have been A or A-minus omitted a reference to the news report that brought the situation to public notice. (The Lessons column the same day, about the issue of grade inflation, also omitted such a reference.) The university's acknowledgment followed a two-part report in The Boston Globe in October disclosing that 91 percent of Harvard graduates received honors in June, far more than at other elite universities.

HEADLINE: News of Ford Cutback Surprises Edison, Both Plant and Town 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: EDISON, N.J., Dec. 4 

 BODY:
Many of the older workers at the Ford Motor Company plant remember 1982, when a poor economy and flagging demand for the Escort model assembled here led to a cutback to one daily shift, from two. 
 So Monday, when veteran workers heard the surprising news that the same kind of cut, with the loss of 600 jobs, was planned for February, they reacted first with shock and indignation and then with sober and pointed questions about how long the cutbacks would last, the role of seniority and what benefits they would keep. 
 For the younger workers, the shock has yet to ebb. Some, like 24-year-old Robert Harrigan of Bricktown, who has worked in the plant's body shop for five years assembling the popular Ranger pickup truck line, the anger was still welling up. 
"I don't have seniority and so I'm definitely gone," he said during a break today as he sat in the parking lot of the offices of Local 980 of the United Automobile Workers Union. "And my wife and I just had a baby."
While he and others were angry at the company, the economy and those who had seniority, they were also angry at the union, since the leaders had given them no warning, they said. The workers also complained that even as company officials were outlining the cutbacks in meetings on the plant floor, those union officers were being curiously quiet.
"They usually talk to us, but they haven't been around much," said Anthony San Martin, an eight-year employee. "I think they think we'll be jumping down their throats."
Outside the plant, the concern is growing in Edison Township as well. Township Mayor George Spadoro noted that ever since Ford started construction in Dearborn, Mich., of a large state-of-the-art Ranger factory with its own power plant, there have been fears that the older, smaller plant in Edison was headed for mothballs. It was the start of the Ranger line at the Edison plant in 1989 that had returned the factory to a full two shifts.
"These cuts will have a ripple effect on the local economy," the mayor said of the possible loss of a shift and nearly 42 percent of the 1,425 workers. "I had been feeling comfortable about the long-term prospects for the plant, but if you make it less productive, it is more likely that it will be seen as expendable down the line."
The announcement of the cutbacks Monday was part of a package of companywide changes, including reduced health and retirement benefits for 45,000 salaried workers and the elimination of merit pay increases for top executives. Those changes, as well as the production cutbacks at Edison, were part of the company's response to sagging sales of most product lines. 
Steve Girsky, an analyst who follows Ford for Morgan Stanley, said the company suffered in particular from "excess capacity" in its Ranger pickup line. 
"I can't speak to the future, but this could be a prelude to things to come," he said. "Older plants tend not to be as efficient as newer plants, and this is an older plant."
Union local officials, like the president, Bob LaPoint, and the chairman, Richard Linn, have been hearing that line of thinking for years from corporate plant managers, and they say that they have worked hard with management to increase productivity and to improve the quality of the trucks assembled here. 
At one time, it cost $800 more to assemble a Ranger here than in other Ford plants, Mr. Linn said. 
They managed to get that down to $200 while improving quality, he said. "It's very difficult to close a top-quality plant and have shareholders and the public accept that," Mr. Linn said, hinting at the campaign that the U.A.W. local plans to mount against the cuts. 
Already, he and Mr. LaPoint have reached out to elected officials like Mayor Spadoro, United States Senator Jon Corzine and Governor-elect James E. McGreevey to begin talks on government incentives to Ford to keep the plant operating at peak levels. Mayor Spadoro said there was a good possibility of tax incentives.
Unionized workers' pay can range from $22 to $27 an hour, he said. 
As the morning shift was ending, older workers, like Robert Dockery, 55, with 31 years at Ford, said they were sure they would keep their jobs but unsure for how long. He had hoped to hold out for five more years before retiring, but the elimination of a shift convinced him that it was "just a matter of time" before the entire plant closed. 
Mr. LaPoint, the union local president, said that despite the company's talk about declining demand for the Ranger, shifts at the Edison plant were still 10 hours, not 8 hours, and Saturday was scheduled as a mandatory overtime day. 
Then, with resolve, he said, "But you always have to have hope that something will work in your favor."

HEADLINE: During a Blue-Collar Upswing, Labor Seeks a Lift 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
The theme of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s convention is written in huge letters behind the ballroom's podium: America's Workers -- Heroes Every Day.
 Those words aim not only to honor the firefighters and others who died responding to the Sept. 11 attacks, but also to capitalize on the improved standing of millions of blue-collar and government workers. 
 The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s leaders want to use this new-found respect to lift the embattled labor movement, but that will not be easy. Unions have failed to reverse their decline in membership, they face an often-hostile president and House of Representatives, and the war, the recession and the surge in layoffs have combined to weaken labor's hand in bargaining. 
Aggravating labor's problems are internal rifts, including the decision by the carpenters' union to quit the A.F.L.-C.I.O., a federation of 66 unions representing 13 million workers.
While facing these problems, John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, is trying to push labor forward but with mixed results partly because many individual unions refuse to follow his lead. At the convention at the Paris Hotel, he has prodded unions to organize more workers and to mobilize their members to lobby Congress on trade. 
When Mr. Sweeney was elected to labor's top post in 1995, his main goals were increasing labor's voice in politics and making union ranks grow after decades of decline. Unions are certainly more vocal in politics than before. But Mr. Sweeney has not succeeded in his other major goal. Union membership as a percentage of the work force has fallen to 13.5 percent, down from 14.9 percent in 1995.
Mr. Sweeney acknowledged problems. "The American labor movement is failing to help new members organize at anywhere near the level we need to," he said.
A dozen unions have embraced his call to devote 30 percent of their budgets to recruitment, and several more have promised to do so. He has also urged unions to be more aggressive in organizing immigrant workers, including janitors, hotel housekeepers, nursing home workers and fruit pickers.
Despite his prodding, unions, although they have tripled their organizing efforts since 1995, remain at less than half of his long-term goal of organizing one million workers a year.
"Given the difficulty he continues to face, where unions can pretty much decide to go their own route," said Richard Hurd, a labor relations professor at Cornell University, "I think Sweeney's doing an admirable job." 
Last spring, Douglas McCarron, president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, rocked the A.F.L.-C.I.O. by pulling his 300,000-member union out of the federation. Mr. McCarron said he was unhappy that the federation was not doing more to organize workers, but many union leaders said he betrayed the goal of solidarity and was stingy about contributing money to federation activities. 
With the former labor secretary John T. Dunlop serving as an intermediary, Mr. Sweeney is negotiating with Mr. McCarron to bring the carpenters back in. 
That is far from labor's only rift. Angering labor's allies in the environmental movement, the Teamsters and a dozen building trades unions have lobbied Congress to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. Those unions say the drilling will create hundreds of thousands of jobs. But three other powerful unions -- the service employees, steelworkers and communications workers -- have lobbied against drilling, saying it will hurt the environment and create few long-term jobs. 
While labor's chieftains are meeting here, their lobbying lieutenants are locked in two huge battles in Washington. Unions hope to persuade Congress and President Bush to revamp the economic stimulus package passed by the House so it gives far less money to corporations, extends unemployment insurance benefits and subsidizes health insurance for the unemployed.
In an unusual move, the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O. began running broadcast advertisements in Washington this week, saying New York workers already suffered from the terror of Sept. 11 and should not have to face the terror of losing health coverage and not being able to pay bills.
After years of blocking fast-track trade legislation, labor leaders are worried by plans to hold a House vote on fast track this Thursday. Such legislation would make it easier for Mr. Bush to negotiate free-trade agreements by not permitting Congress to amend the deals, allowing only a yes or no vote.
An oft-voiced complaint here is that Congressional Republicans and Mr. Bush are exploiting the war and Mr. Bush's popularity to push through pro-business legislation. In his keynote address, Mr. Sweeney said the president was doing an excellent job fighting terrorism, but he condemned Mr. Bush for "waging a vicious war on working families."

HEADLINE: Merrill to Use Fewer People For Same Amount of Research 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
When the realigning of Merrill Lynch's research department is finished at the end of the year, there will be just as many hats but fewer heads to wear them.
 The research department is shrinking along with the rest of Merrill, which is eliminating thousands of jobs to cut costs sharply. The trick for the department's new managers will be trying to trim the number of analysts, strategists and support staff members without diminishing the value of Merrill's research to investors. 
 The value of Wall Street investment research has repeatedly been called into question in the last few years as analysts rationalized the unsustainable prices investors paid for technology stocks. That skepticism found new support when Enron collapsed as analysts scrambled to retract their "strong buy" ratings on its shares. 
The Merrill analyst who followed Enron and other energy companies, Donato Eassey, is among those who have either quit or been dismissed in recent weeks. But Merrill officials did not link Mr. Eassey's departure to his analysis on Enron, just as they said Henry Blodget had not been encouraged to resign.
Mr. Blodget, who made a name for himself as a true believer in a long list of Internet stocks, was one of 2,600 Merrill employees who accepted a buyout offer the firm extended last month. He and Christine A. Callies, who was Merrill's United States investment strategist, have been the biggest names to depart. Others include Thomas Kraemer, who covered I.B.M. and other big computer makers, and Sandra Flannigan, who covered regional banks.
For now, to fill the voids, Merrill is giving some of its remaining analysts and strategists more work. Steven Milunovich, the technology strategist, will pick up coverage of Mr. Kraemer's stocks. Judah Kraushaar, who already follows big banks and brokerage stocks, will take on the regional banks, too.
"There are certain sectors where the world just changed, leaving us with too many resources in certain places, and in other places we didn't have enough," said Robert J. McCann, a senior vice president who was recently named director of Merrill's global research and economics group.
So the biggest companies that Mr. Blodget covered will fall to other senior analysts: Christopher Shilakes will again cover Microsoft, and Jessica Reif Cohen will follow AOL Time Warner. One of Mr. Blodget's junior analysts, Justin Baldauf, will cover Internet stocks like eBay, Yahoo and Amazon, said Deepak Raj, Mr. McCann's deputy.
Mr. Raj said he thought all the criticism of analysts was related to the boom and bust of the technology market and would die down. He said he and his fellow managers encouraged analysts to think independently.
"We view equity research to be at the core of the value proposition we offer clients," Mr. McCann said.
Mr. McCann said he also planned to add the firm's analysts of high-grade corporate bonds to those of high-yield, or junk, bonds to form industry teams.
Despite the cuts, Mr. McCann said that in January he and Mr. Raj would start looking for senior analysts at other firms to hire in certain crucial sectors, including food, beverages and other consumer products.
As evidence of the freedom his analysts have to speak their minds, Mr. McCann cited Richard Bernstein, who will become Merrill's chief domestic investment strategist while retaining his role as chief quantitative strategist. Mr. Bernstein is less bullish than Ms. Callies, his predecessor, but Mr. McCann said that would not be a problem.
"Some of the brokers may not like that," Mr. McCann said. "I don't think we have to have a singular voice. But I thought that our voice wasn't as clear or as tight as we'd like it to be."

HEADLINE: A New Health Plan May Raise Expenses For Sickest Workers 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Pressed by employers, some of the nation's biggest insurers are introducing a new kind of health plan that would significantly change the way employees are reimbursed for ordinary medical expenses. 
 Most working families, who have relatively low medical bills, could save money under the plans. But those with several thousand dollars in medical expenses could wind up paying much more. 
 Few experts on health care are familiar with the plans. But some health benefits experts who do know of them warn that they could be more unfair than current plans to people who are sick and that they could discourage people who need care from getting it. 
The insurers preparing to offer the plans within a year include Aetna, Humana, Cigna, the UnitedHealth Group and Wellpoint Health Networks. Some are already testing the new plans on their own employees or even with a few companies. And several small insurance companies began offering the new plans at a few companies earlier this year. 
The new plans typically require a family to pay an annual premium of $1,000 to $1,400, slightly lower than the cost of traditional managed care. Families then receive an allowance of $2,000 to $3,000 each year to spend on medical expenses, including drugs. 
But after they have spent that, they have to cover every cost above that cap, sometimes up to $5,000 or more. After the higher amount is reached, the employer picks up most of the bills.
In addition, instead of covering all but a few dollars of the cost of each drug prescription, some of the new plans will require employees to cover a much bigger portion of the cost. 
The difference between the new plans and those currently covering many Americans is striking. 
As one example, a family of three with $5,000 in medical bills and chronic medical conditions requiring several widely used prescription drugs could pay $5,634 themselves, compared with $3,420 under a traditional managed care plan, according to industry consultants.
"The effect will be to shift more of the costs into the pockets of the sick people," said Uwe E. Reinhardt, an economist at Princeton University. "The insurance industry has decided that if you are sick, you ought to eat the costs. It's a very dubious social policy."
The plans also offer online information to help consumers make their own medical decisions, including descriptions of different diseases and treatments, data on the costs of numerous treatments, and a network of doctors and hospitals that employees can use to keep their medical costs down.
A family that keeps its medical bills lower than the allowance can roll over any unspent money to pay medical bills in future years.
But for a family that uses up the allowance, the plans stop paying entirely until a ceiling is reached. At one company offering the new plans, employees who use only network doctors are responsible for a deductible of $1,000 to $5,000 in medical expenses beyond their allowance of $2,000, depending on the premium they are willing to pay. If they go to doctors outside the network, their deductible could rise even higher.
For employees whose medical expenses exceed the allowance and the deductible, the plan typically covers all medical costs provided by a network of doctors and hospitals. Employees who go to doctors and hospitals outside the network are covered for 70 to 80 percent of charges up to $1,000. After that, the plans typically cover all expenses. 
Prescriptions often become a much heavier expense. Currently, employers usually offer a separate drug plan that covers all but a few dollars of a medication. Under some of the new plans, employees must draw on their allowance to buy medications, whether they are the low-priced generic drugs or expensive brand name medications. After they exhaust the allowance, employees have to cover the full cost of any drugs until the deductible is met.
For example, a year's supply of Serevent, a widely used asthma treatment, could be nearly $800 instead of the $120 to $360 that is an employee's current share in many drug plans. An employer would begin to pay more only after an employee had used up the health care allowance and deductible. 
The insurers say the plans are intended to help companies save money at a time when their employees' medical costs have been surging, up 10 to 15 percent or more in each of the last two years. 
Many companies are seeking ways to transfer to employees more of the costs, especially of drugs, which have been the fastest-rising medical cost. 
Kenneth Sperling, a consultant at Hewitt Associates, said many employers were using the plans to shift a greater percentage of health costs to employees with the highest medical expenses. "As health care costs go up, it becomes a choice between hitting the users of the system or hitting everybody," he said. 
Insurance executives say that some of their largest customers are clamoring to try the new health plans, which offer savings for future costs for the majority of people, who have few medical costs in any given year. According to a study by William M. Mercer, a consulting firm, 75 percent of all working people account for just 15 percent of employers' medical costs, with each working family spending $1,000 to $1,500 itself each year.
Employers say that the new plans can reduce medical costs because employees have more of a financial incentive to, say, choose a generic medicine or to avoid a test or treatment that their doctor says is not necessary.
If the average person knew that a specialized scan cost $600 or $700, "it might have an influence" on whether she listens when her doctor says the scan is unnecessary, said Dr. Jack Mahoney, health planning director at Pitney Bowes, which is considering one of the plans for 2003.
But Deborah Chollet, an economist at Mathematica, a nonprofit research concern, said the new plans could be a barrier to needed care for some people. The plans would leave families essentially without insurance until they have spent several thousand dollars, she said. "Uninsured people don't consume much care" because they may have difficulty deciding whether care is necessary or not, she said.
"This is taking coverage away from people," said Ms. Chollet, a health insurance specialist. "And it is obviously a greater hardship for the lower-income workers." 
Insurance and insurance rates are usually designed around the idea of a pool of risk -- the chance that a few members of a group will have high claims that can be covered by the premiums paid by everyone else. But the new plans move away from that notion, effectively penalizing people with higher medical costs and rewarding those with lower expenses.
Indeed, when employers offer both the new plans and traditional managed care, the new savings accounts may attract largely young, healthy members, while sicker people stick with plans that cover more of their medical costs. "There are still huge numbers of unanswered questions," said Tony Kotin, a consultant in Chicago with William M. Mercer, the benefits consultant.
Eventually, however, consultants expect many employers to offer only the new type of plan.
Humana said it began offering one of the new plans to its 14,300 employees in July and would add outside customers next summer. 
Aetna, the largest health insurance company, is offering its new plan as an option to its own 38,000 employees for 2002. It plans to extend the offer to large national customers with a total of more than eight million employees for 2003, said Ronald A. Williams, executive vice president of Aetna. "We view this as a product, not an experiment," he said.
Wellpoint said it would offer one of the new plans to groups with three million members in California next year. Cigna said it would begin offering "a health savings account product" next year. UnitedHealth said that a Fortune 100 company had asked it to offer a pilot plan, which will include a health savings account and a "high deductible" of $2,500.
A handful of start-up companies specializing in the new plans, including Definity Health, Lumenos Inc., Destiny Health and Health Markets Inc., began testing the market earlier this year and are accepting both renewals and new orders for 2002. 
Several large employers, including Medtronic Inc., a medical device company; Charter Communications, a television cable group; and Textron Inc., a diversified financial services and manufacturing company, are already offering Definity plans to their employees. 
"We can't bear 12 to 14 percent inflation year after year," said Don Broecker, director of benefits for 17,000 employees at Charter Communications, based in St. Louis.
Lumenos, based in Alexandria, Va., has sold its version to several drug companies for their own employees, including Novartis, Abbott Laboratories and Pharmacia, and more than 100 smaller companies.
"I liked their spin on health care," said Bruce Gorman, 48, a shipping manager in Phoenix at Wincup, a plastic cup manufacturer that began offering the Lumenos plan on Aug. 1. He used most of his health savings account this year, but does not expect to do so next year. 
Destiny Health has signed up 3,000 employees since August at 125 companies in Illinois and is adding 1,000 a month, according to Ken Linde, the chief executive of Discovery Health, which owns Destiny.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: LIBERTY AND SECURITY -- Political Memo; 
Few in Congress Questioning President Over Civil Liberties

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
Even in peaceful times, defending civil liberties is rarely a crowd-pleasing cause. As Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, puts it, "Take free speech: most of the tough cases on free speech involve very unpleasant people saying very obnoxious things."
 So it should come as no surprise that in deeply unsettled times -- like these -- the political defense of civil liberties would be careful and constrained, many analysts say. 
 Recent public opinion polls suggest that a worried public is willing to give the administration wide latitude in the pursuit and prosecution of suspected terrorists. 
There is a small but vocal group of elected officials and activists, on the left and on the right, expressing concern about the administration's recent moves, like allowing the creation of military tribunals to try foreigners suspected of terrorism and the widespread questioning of recent Middle Eastern immigrants.
But the issue has yet to galvanize the rank and file -- or, for that matter, the leadership -- of either party. Indeed, the issue is being treated very gingerly by politicians eager to demonstrate their full commitment to the fight against terrorism.
"Traditional civil libertarians are upset, but the American people are not," said John Feehery, a spokesman for the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert. "This is no time politically to be soft on terrorists. That's where most of our people are." 
In the Senate, one Democratic strategist said, "This is one area of public policy where politicians feel pretty much the way the public does."
Asked about the impact of the polls, the strategist added, "Sure, most politicians aren't all that eager to fly in the face of three-quarters of public opinion, but I sense sincerity more than I sense cowardice."
In the House, the Judiciary Committee has been privately briefed by administration officials on these issues but has no immediate plans to hold public hearings, a spokesman said. In the Senate, the Judiciary Committee is holding hearings, including today's sessions on military tribunals and the hundreds of detainees, but few expect legislation this year to rein in the administration on these issues.
Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota and majority leader, has largely confined his criticism of the administration to economics and the budget. 
"I think the issue of civil liberties is very, very important to every member of our caucus," he said when asked about the subject at a news conference today. "We're trying to find the right balance, of course, between protecting civil liberties and ensuring that law enforcement has the tools it needs to do its job."
He noted, however, that it was hard to come to any definitive conclusion about matters like military tribunals when the administration had yet to furnish details.
Senator Byron L. Dorgan, the North Dakota Democrat who is chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee, said "there has not been a great deal of internal discussion" of civil liberties issues among Democrats since the passage of the counterterrorism bill in October. It is simply too soon, he said, adding, "I think there's still a sense of shock here, not only in the Congress but in the country, about Sept. 11, and a grim determination to go after these terrorists and bring them to justice."
These are treacherous waters for elected officials. At today's Judiciary Committee hearing, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the senior Republican on the panel, scoffed at the "alarmist rhetoric" about military tribunals and suggested that the committee ought to be focused on "getting behind our president" in fighting terrorism.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat who was running the hearing, replied coolly, "No one's trying to impede our president."
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the committee, who has pushed hardest for hearings and Congressional oversight, is increasingly becoming a target to some conservatives. The journal Human Events this week described him as "Osama's Enabler in Congress," arguing that he was raising civil liberties questions "not because he has legitimate complaints -- he doesn't -- but because he has a partisan and ideological ax to grind into John Ashcroft's back."
Still, some pollsters, including Geoffrey Garin, a Democrat, argue that this issue may not be as dangerous as it seems. Citing the case of Senator Russell D. Feingold, the Wisconsin Democrat who cast the lone vote in the Senate against the counterterrorism bill, as well as Mr. Leahy, Mr. Garin argued, "Only two people have tested the edges of the envelope here and neither of them have been harmed in the process. What the public wants and expects on this is a serious probing of the issues."
But Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster, argued, "When you have 80 percent of Americans believing there will be another terrorist event on U.S. soil, you have a pretty good sense of why people are saying, 'Yeah, let's take care of some things.' "
He added, "What this means for politicians is, there may be little sacred when you invoke the cause of fighting terrorism."
Civil liberties groups say that the debate is really just beginning, that it will take time to sway public opinion to their side. Advocates hope that support from conservatives like Representative Bob Barr, Republican of Georgia, and Republican moderates like Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania will help take any partisan edge off the debate.
But Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director, suggested that the Congressional criticism of recent weeks has turned out to be more about the need to consult Congress than the merits of the administration's proposals.
And Mr. Frank, a longtime member of the Judiciary Committee, suggests that this is a complicated case to make, politically. The measures under debate, he said, generally involve noncitizens, so the average American feels less of a stake in the discussion. And, he added: "The rights of people who have done terrible things are hard to defend. You have to keep pointing out, the question is the process to determine whether they've done the terrible things."
Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat whose district includes a large Arab-American community, said the politics of civil liberties were inherently hard. Asked how many of his fellow members were concerned, he replied, "I hear a lot of members saying they're concerned, but not many willing to say it publicly."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: NUCLEAR SECURITY; 
Safety of Nuclear Plants Again Raises Concerns

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: BRATTLEBORO, Vt., Dec. 4 

 BODY:
Some people here never liked the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant, worrying about accidents and radioactive waste. Others always thought it was a reliable, cheap and clean source of electricity. Over 30 years of arguing, they had mostly run out of new things to say and bored the general public with their arguments. But that was before Sept. 11.
 Now discussions about Vermont Yankee, and other reactors around the Northeast, are drawing big crowds. There were 600 people here on Monday night, in the auditorium of Brattleboro Union High School, not counting the 20 federal, state and local officials on stage to answer their questions. They were at it for four hours, and a while longer in the parking lot. 
 "This is a small town, in a small state," said Representative Bernard Sanders, who convened the meeting, marveling at the turnout. "People are very, very concerned."
Last month there were hearings near the Pilgrim plant, in Plymouth, Mass.; the Seabrook plant, in the New Hampshire town of the same name; and the undamaged reactor at Three Mile Island, near Harrisburg, Pa.
There was also a hearing near the Maine Yankee plant, in Wiscasset, Me., which was shut down five years ago, but where radioactive spent fuel is still stored. Next week in White Plains, a committee of the Westchester County Board of Legislators plans a hearing on whether to revoke approval of the emergency plan for the Indian Point reactors. A hearing about the dangers of spent fuel is planned for the Shearon Harris plant in North Carolina. 
"Sept. 11 has been the biggest challenge to nuclear power since Chernobyl," said David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit group that frequent criticizes government oversight of nuclear safety. "Congressmen who have had very little interest in nuclear power in the five years I've been at U.C.S. are suddenly competing with each other to examine security issues at the plants." 
Although it is not clear how seriously local governments or members of Congress can threaten the future of licensed reactors, the industry hardly welcomes the discussion. 
Until Sept. 11, the outlook for the nation's 103 nuclear power plants was improving. The years since the 1986 accident at Chernobyl have been mostly quiet, with no significant unusual radiation releases in the United States, and rising reliability. Reactors were beginning to look more attractive given the increasing demand for electricity. Several have recently won 20-year extensions on their 40-year licenses, and others have met the first challenge of deregulation of the electricity business, having sold at prices higher than analysts expected. 
But since Sept. 11, public officials have mused publicly about whether a nuclear plant would withstand the crash of a jet any better than the World Trade Center did, and the technology's opponents have found a wider audience. 
"We have handed our enemies a radiological weapon, a target of opportunity," said Ned Childs, one of dozens of people who spoke at the hearing last night. Mr. Childs lives in Dummerston, Vt., 10 miles from the plant in Vernon.
State officials have voiced the same concern. Kate O'Conner, chairwoman of the Vermont Terrorist Task Force, said Sept. 11 had prompted Gov. Howard Dean, who is a doctor, to seek a stockpile of a drug to protect the public against radiation-induced thyroid cancer, something that has been debated nationwide for 20 years.
The industry does not relish the attention. At the Nuclear Energy Institute in Washington, Angelina Howard, a spokeswoman for the industry's trade group, said some people in New York and New England had always shown "skittishness" about nuclear power. But elsewhere, she said, there were anecdotal reports that more tourists were stopping by the visitor centers at the plants, or at least those centers that were still open after Sept. 11. 
"When the public has a concern and they go look into it, usually they come off feeling better about it," she said. Opinion polls commissioned by her organization show growing approval of nuclear power since Sept. 11, Ms. Howard said.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has defended the design of the plants. Hubert J. Miller, the commission's administrator for the Northeast, said that while Vermont Yankee's designers did not have an attack by a Boeing 767 in mind when they designed it, the building is "very robust," and that nuclear plants are among the strongest buildings of any kind.
Defending Vermont Yankee's security preparations is somewhat harder. On Aug. 23, it was the plant's turn for a mock attack by federal agents playing terrorists, and the evaluators found so many deficiencies that they graded the plant "yellow," in a grading system that runs green, white, yellow and red. It was the lowest grade in the industry. 
But Mr. Miller said the problems had been corrected.
At the town meeting, calls for conservation and renewable energy drew applause, although this being Vermont, at the mention of windmills, one strong voice shouted, "They're bird killers."
Ross Barkhurst, the chief executive of the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corporation, stood his ground on reasons of safety and economics. Speaking of wind power, he said: "As long as we have the ability to compete, bring it on. Right now my best friend is the renewable energy we have in the state -- it costs about two and a half times what mine does."
Public officials here and elsewhere have described the risk of terrorist attack on a reactor, especially by big planes, as remote, though some members of the public doubt the government's ability to pick what the next target might be.
"I know the opinion of many of you is that the best thing to do is not to have a plant down here," said Edward von Turkovich, the director of Vermont Emergency Management, to loud applause. But he added, "We're going to coexist with a plant. The best thing to do is to have a plan in place."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE PRESIDENT; 
President Tries to Give Florida, and Its Governor, a Boost

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., Dec. 4 

 BODY:
George W. Bush today confronted a growing vulnerability of his presidency, the languishing economy, by promoting a government program for laid-off workers and blaming the Democratic-controlled Senate for a deadlock in Washington over an economic stimulus bill.
 But he also made time for overt Bush family politics, publicly suspended since Sept. 11, by talking up his younger brother, Gov. Jeb Bush. The Florida governor is facing more than $1 billion in state budget cuts and a re-election fight next year, probably against Janet Reno, President Bill Clinton's attorney general. Mr. Bush himself narrowly lost the surrounding Orange County to Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election. 
 "I hurt, coming into the holiday season, that you're not working," Mr. Bush told unemployed workers at a local job center, Operation Paycheck, one of 1,200 such facilities nationwide that is financed by federal money and run by the states. "But I admire your courage for going out to try to improve yourselves so you can find jobs around here." 
He also said Democratic senators "need to stop fussing and stop talking and get something to my desk that will take care of the workers and provide stimulus to this economy."
A short time later, to an enthusiastic crowd of more than 4,000 people at a town hall meeting at the Orange County Convention Center, Mr. Bush laid the credit for Operation Paycheck directly at the feet of his smiling sibling. "It's a program that Jeb has put in place to help displaced workers," Mr. Bush said.
Orlando, home of Walt Disney World, has been hard hit by the Sept. 11 attacks as people remain nervous about traveling. The tourism industry here has been ailing and has laid off thousands of workers. The Florida Agency for Workforce Innovations said that in Orange County, 4,703 people filed first-time claims for unemployment in November, compared with just 1,753 a year ago. 
Tourism is Florida's largest industry, bringing in $50 billion a year in gross sales.
"I recommend people from outside of Florida to come and take a look at Florida," Mr. Bush said at the convention center. "It's a nice place to visit and a great place to live. One reason why is because you've got a great governor."
Operation Paycheck will be financed out of the $3.4 million national emergency grant that Florida received to cope with higher unemployment since Sept. 11. The Orlando area lost about 2,000 jobs, most of them related to tourism, since the attacks. The $3.4 million is only a fraction of the $35 million that Jeb Bush asked for. 
When a reporter asked Jeb Bush if he had asked the White House for more than he thought he would get, he said, "Of course we did. "What are you doing, playing me for a fool?"
President Bush was asked 19 questions at the hourlong town meeting, his first solo one as president. Participants had been given tickets by the local Republican Party, the Chamber of Commerce and Hispanic organizations. Most questions focused on the economy, but a third grader, who gave his name only as Jordan, asked Mr. Bush how he felt when he first heard about the Sept. 11 attacks.
The president responded by talking more personally about his thoughts on that day, when he was at a school in Sarasota, Fla. "I was sitting outside the classroom waiting to go in, and I saw an airplane hit the tower -- the TV was obviously on," Mr. Bush said. "And I used to fly myself, and I said, 'Well, there's one terrible pilot.' I said, 'Must have been a horrible accident.' "
Mr. Bush then recounted that Andrew H. Card Jr., his chief of staff, told him that a second plane had hit the other tower. "And I started thinking hard in that very brief period of time about what it meant to be under attack," Mr. Bush said.
Mr. Bush was animated and gregarious throughout the town hall meeting, and at one point made light of his mother, Barbara Bush. When he was asked by a young woman, Caitlin, if he ate his meals together with his family when he was a child, the president responded, "I did eat with my family, so long as my mother wasn't cooking."
When the crowd laughed, Mr. Bush said, "Wait a minute. Just kidding, Mom. She was one of the great fast-food cooks of all time. Just kidding, Mom. We ate a lot together."

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Trying to Lure Zimbabwe to Democracy 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
Adding to growing international pressure on Zimbabwe, Congress approved incentives today intended to persuade President Robert Mugabe to halt government abuses and undertake market reforms.
 The House offered $26 million in aid, forgiveness of some of Zimbabwe's debt and a promise to help promote trade and investment if Mr. Mugabe created conditions for fair elections next spring. The Senate approved similar language in August. 
 Some House Republicans, eager to send a strong message to Mr. Mugabe, the socialist who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence in 1980, said they had considered sanctions. But American aid has already been curtailed and lawmakers voiced concerns that punitive actions would compound the misery of ordinary Zimbabweans.
"The Zimbabwean government responds to the cries of its people and its political opposition with harassment, intimidation and murder," said Representative Henry J. Hyde, the Republican chairman of the international relations committee.
The country suffers food shortages, a foreign debt of more than $890 million, an AIDS infection rate of 25 percent and the turmoil over farm seizures, which were supported by Mr. Mugabe to redistribute lands held by mostly white farmers since the colonial period. 
Zimbabwe's Supreme Court ruled today that the government had taken adequate steps to enforce the rule of law in commercial farming areas and should continue redistributing land from white farmers to blacks. The ruling was sharply criticized by the leading opposition party and by white farming groups, who say that violence is continuing on farms occupied by black squatters. 
The Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act, which passed the House in a 396 to 11 vote, also urges President Bush to deny visas and freeze the assets of those "responsible for violence and the breakdown of the rule of law in Zimbabwe."
The Bush administration had worked closely with Congress in preparing the legislation. The assistant secretary of state for African affairs, Walter Kansteiner, is to visit Zimbabwe this weekend and emphasize Washington's hope to see the restoration of human rights and an end to political violence.
But some administration officials said Mr. Mugabe, who is 77, seems determined to remain in power at all costs. "No one's quite sure what to do about it, how to make Mugabe listen," said one State Department official. "Everyone's frustrated. He's going to try to weather the storm and get re-elected and say, 'O.K., now you're stuck with me.' "
Polls show Mr. Mugabe trailing the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change. American officials say he has increasingly sought to maintain his grip by intimidating journalists, packing the Supreme Court and using veterans from the fight for independence to threaten opponents.
The European Union has threatened to impose trade sanctions unless democratic rights are restored. And Zimbabwe's neighbors, increasingly worried over the prospects for violence, a refugee exodus or economic collapse, plan to dispatch their foreign ministers to the capital, Harare, next week.

HEADLINE: A Nation Challenged 

 BODY:
 On the Ground, on the Air

PREPARING FOR A SIEGE -- The marines advanced from their Afghan desert base in preparation for the siege of Kandahar, scouting enemy movements from armored vehicles and helicopters, and setting up checkpoints to keep the Taliban from reinforcing -- or from escaping -- their largest stronghold. A1

MARINES WIDEN PATROLS -- Having established significant firepower on the ground in southern Afghanistan, the marines are probing deeper toward the chaotic swaths of territory that are still under the control of the Taliban. B2

NETWORKS SUPPORT WAR EFFORT -- The major broadcast networks are producing short television messages that convey season's greetings to troops stationed overseas. B3

INSIDER INFORMATION -- John Walker Lindh, the 20-year-old American who was captured with Taliban soldiers in northern Afghanistan could provide a bounty of useful intelligence about the recruiting methods, hideouts, supply routes and lower-level command structure of the Taliban military, senior Pentagon officials say. B3

The Afghan Future

A NEW GOVERNMENT -- After eight days of talks in Germany, agreement appeared near on the makeup of an interim Afghan government, tentatively scheduled to take power on Dec. 22. B1

A SECURITY FORCE -- Afghan leaders appear to have agreed that an international security force can be deployed, but only in Kabul, to maintain stability as a new transitional government takes power. It remains unclear whether it will be a potent military force or a largely symbolic presence. B2

ANTI-WESTERN PASSIONS -- Saudi Arabia's government grapples with the issue of how to deal with influential conservative clerics who espouse harsh anti-Western opinions and urge Muslims to fight against America. B1

REMNANTS OF VIOLENCE -- The crude metal noose said to have killed the mujahedeen commander Abdul Haq -- executed by the Taliban in October -- still hangs from a tree half a mile from one of Osama bin Laden's largest terrorist training camps. B4

Civil Liberties and Security

BUSH DEFENDS TRIBUNALS -- Before a cheering crowd in Florida, President Bush said that he needed military tribunals and other legal weapons to protect Americans, and that the tribunals would safeguard national security secrets. A1

FOCUSING ON THE ECONOMY -- The president confronted a growing vulnerability of his administration, the languishing economy, by promoting a government program for laid-off workers and blaming the Democratic-controlled Senate for a deadlock in Washington over an economic stimulus bill. B7

UNDER SUSPICION -- After Sept. 11, federal officials began knocking on the doors of hundreds of Mauritanians in Kentucky, questioning some and detaining others on immigration violations. The experience left many feeling shaken, bitter and vulnerable to suspicions of a terrorist crime that has not been connected to their country. B6

AN HONOR DENIED -- Family members of Charles F. Burlingame, who served 25 years in the Navy and was the captain of the American Airlines flight that crashed into the Pentagon, said they were shocked and angered that their request for a burial at Arlington National Cemetery had been denied. B7

Pursuing Safety at Home

GAUGING PUBLIC OPINION -- Even in peaceful times, defending civil liberties is rarely a crowd-pleasing issue. So it is not surprising that recent polls suggest a worried public is willing to cede the Bush administration wide latitude to pursue those suspected of terrorism. A1

CRACKDOWN DEFENDED -- Conservatives have begun outlining a legal defense of the Bush administration's antiterrorism crackdown, saying that the president has broad powers to protect national security in wartime, and that accusations of rights violations have been overblown. B6

DEBATE OVER SPENDING -- The Senate Appropriations Committee voted an additional $7.5 billion for measures to combat bioterrorism and improve security at ports, borders and nuclear facilities, as some Senate Republicans accused Democrats of playing politics with the issue of homeland defense. B7

MORE INTERVIEWS PLANNED -- Law enforcement officials plan to begin interviewing up to 86 Middle Eastern men in New York City as part of the Justice Department's nationwide drive to talk to 5,000 visitors from countries with suspected terrorist links. B7

Aftermath in New York

LIFE AFTER DEATH -- Dozens of women who lost loved ones when the World Trade Center collapsed were pregnant at the time. For them, giving birth will be an occasion for almost unbearable joy and sorrow. B1

A LOOK BENEATH GROUND ZERO -- In its efforts to clear ground zero with as little disruption as possible to the surrounding area in Lower Manhattan, the city is exploring the use of special, ground-penetrating radar to map the tangle of underground utilities without having to dig them up first. B8

MEDALS FOR FALLEN HEROES -- The New York Police Department's annual medals day ceremony, held this year at Carnegie Hall, afforded a chance for catharsis by the 40,000-member force, whose grief over the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks has been quieter and less visible than that of their colleagues in the city Fire Department. B8

STUDENT ALLEGES ABUSE -- A lawyer for a Jordanian student who was charged with lying before a federal grand jury investigating the Sept. 11 attacks says his client was abused after being jailed in Lower Manhattan. B8

Threats and Fears

REACTOR RISKS -- After years of arguing, supporters and foes of nuclear plants seemed to have run out of new things to say. But now, discussions are drawing big crowds of people concerned about issues such as reactors' vulnerability to terrorism. B5

CONFLICTING EVIDENCE -- Two months after the death of Robert Stevens, the first victim of the country's first anthrax assault, new tests at his workplace in Florida, American Media Inc., a publisher of tabloids, reveal a pattern of pervasive contamination that continues to mystify investigators, with evidence of a type of anthrax that can easily float in air. B5

VACCINATIONS OPPOSED -- The American Medical Association said it would not support an immediate national smallpox vaccination program, saying the potential threat of a bioterror attack did not warrant the risks. B5

HEADLINE: Mayor Commits $24 Million To Lincoln Center Rebuilding 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday authorized the city to allocate the first installment of a $240 million commitment for Lincoln Center's $1.2 billion redevelopment plan, several people associated with the project said.
 The mayor's approval secures $24 million from the city's capital budget, the first part of a 10-year commitment the mayor made before Sept. 11 toward a redevelopment program that was originally estimated at $1.5 billion. 
 The city's approval is an important vote of confidence for the project, which has been plagued by infighting at a time of economic uncertainty that will likely make fund-raising more difficult for cultural organizations. 
The allocation is particularly welcome for Lincoln Center, given that on Monday the mayor announced a $1.3 billion modification to the city's budget that included cuts of $766 million for various city agencies.
Anthony P. Coles, the deputy mayor who was the point person for the city on the Lincoln Center project, could not be reached for comment.
Lincoln Center's redevelopment plan calls for an extensive upgrade that includes a wide range of projects, from a $326 million rebuilding of Avery Fisher Hall to a $58 million redesign of entrances and lobbies at the Vivian Beaumont and Mitzi E. Newhouse theaters to a $10.5 million expansion of the facilities of the Film Society of Lincoln Center.
Disputes about various aspects of the project have yet to be resolved, and the particulars could change in the coming months. Each of the 11 constituents participating in the plan -- including the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic, the New York City Ballet and Jazz at Lincoln Center -- has the right to a veto. As a result, the plan has been rife with conflict, a situation many believe forced Marshall Rose, the chairman of the redevelopment project, to resign in October. Gordon J. Davis, the former president of Lincoln Center, resigned just a few weeks before Mr. Rose.
Ms. Sills declined comment through a spokeswoman, Janice Price. Ms. Price said that it was up to the mayor to make any announcement and that she thought the plan still had to go through a formal approval process.
But one Lincoln Center executive involved in the redevelopment said that any subsequent approval was merely a formality, given that the city has had the plans for 10 days. "It is tantamount to approval," the executive said. "The mayor responded enthusiastically and asked for the appropriate documents to proceed forthwith."
Among the issues that have yet to be decided is the future home of the New York City Opera. Building a new house for City Opera in Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center was strong opposed by the Metropolitan Opera's general manager, Joseph Volpe, and by Ms. Sills.
As a result, the master plan submitted to the city allocated $240 million for a 2,200-seat opera house outside the center's West Side campus. If City Opera chooses to stay at the New York State Theater, which it shares with the New York City Ballet, the plan calls for spending up to $87 million to improve the acoustics.

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's approval of $24 million for Lincoln Center's redevelopment plan, the first installment of a $240 million commitment by New York City over 10 years, included an organization erroneously among the participating groups. They do not include Jazz at Lincoln Center.

HEADLINE: An Echo of Big Dreams Of a World With Big Steel 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

 BODY:
The business executives gathered for a dinner on a brisk December evening in New York City's exclusive University Club. The speaker was the guest of honor, the young ambitious president of the nation's leading steel company. His chosen topic: his vision of the steel industry at the dawn of a new century. 
 He argued that United States steel makers suffered from destructive price wars and excess capacity. The companies are susceptible to economic downturns because their profit margins are being squeezed, he added. 
 He proposed a solution: the merger of several companies so they could combine operations while cutting costs. The resulting steel behemoth would be a competitive force in world markets. 
The proposal may sound a lot like what the steel industry is now proposing, but that evening was on Dec. 11, 1900. Charles Schwab, president of Carnegie Steel, was the speaker, and J. Pierpont Morgan, chairman of Federal Steel, sat in the audience with an unlighted cigar dangling from his mouth. The scene is recounted in United States Steel's commissioned centennial history. 
A dance of negotiation thus began between two of America's most prominent business personalities. The aging Andrew Carnegie was eager to devote his time to philanthropy. His price for Carnegie Steel was $480 million, an amount that Mr. Morgan accepted without any debate. 
Within months, the United States Steel Corporation became the first billion-dollar corporation through the merger of 10 steel companies. The new company controlled over 60 percent of the domestic steel market and 29 percent of the world market. Critics called United States Steel a monopoly, especially since the domestic steel market was protected by high tariffs. 
The new company owned hundreds of factories, employed 168,000 workers and controlled six sizable railroad lines. It controlled the steel-making process from beginning to end through a combination of furnaces, ore deposits and transportation companies.
But United States Steel became saddled with debt as a result of its merger. That constraint on its growth allowed smaller, nimbler competitors, like Bethlehem Steel, to gain market share. 
"They needed to run businesses as cash cows," said David Hounshell, a history professor at Carnegie Mellon University, so United States Steel became a lumbering, inefficient company. 
The company tried to milk its dominant market position for as long as it could, but it could not compete with the immediate onslaught of domestic competitors and with international rivals after World War II.
A century later, United States Steel, part of the USX Corporation, remains the nation's largest steel maker, although it produces only marginally more steel than it did in its first full year in business. 
"If it had been an efficient producer, it would not have lost market share," Professor Hounshell said. "But it systematically lost market share throughout the 20th century."

HEADLINE: Steel Producers Seek a Merger, With U.S. Help 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
Struggling with bankruptcies and hurt by foreign imports, the nation's biggest steel companies said yesterday that they were asking the Bush administration and Congress to back a plan allowing up to half a dozen steel makers to merge into a single company and to shift billions of dollars in retiree health care costs to the government.
 The companies' executives have met in recent weeks with Bush cabinet members and Congressional leaders to gain support for a plan that would fundamentally reshape an industry that has been barely profitable in the last decade and has logged further losses since Sept. 11. 
 Steel executives say the plan is needed to transform a fragmented industry of small producers into one of fewer, but larger, American steel makers that would be better able to compete with larger rivals in Europe and Asia. But to consolidate, the industry also says it needs to be rid of the costs of retiree health care benefits, which are currently estimated at $13 billion and have prevented many financially struggling companies from merging.
Among those involved in the talks are the U.S. Steel unit of the USX Corporation, Bethlehem Steel and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel. In the last week, their representatives have met with Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans; the United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick; and members of both parties in Congress. 
Though the administration has not said whether it would support the plan, a spokesman for the Commerce Department, Trevor Francis, said that "conversations are in progress." In Congress, it has the backing of powerful members from industrial states.
The plan, which is also supported by the United Steelworkers of America union, could result in a single company able to produce 30 million tons of steel annually. That would be about four times more than the current capacity of the largest producer, U.S. Steel, but would be comparable to the output of large overseas producers. 
The consolidation would take place among the older companies, known as integrated steel makers, which transform raw iron ore into steel. It would not involve the dozens of newer "mini-mills" -- companies like Nucor that take slabs of semi-finished steel and turn them into finished products.
One leader of the effort is Robert S. Miller Jr., chief executive of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, which filed for bankruptcy protection last month, becoming the 25th domestic steel maker to do so in recent years. Mr. Miller, who helped package the government's bailout of the Chrysler Corporation in 1979, was hired shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to help keep Bethlehem, a 97-year-old steel maker, afloat.
"We are telling all these people that we have an answer for the crisis in American steel," Mr. Miller said in an interview yesterday. "It is the consolidation and the rationalization of the integrated steel industry by a combination of four or five companies to come together as one large integrated steel company."
Steel industry shares were mixed on the news. USX was up almost 5 percent, to close at $16.95, while Bethlehem Steel rose 11 cents, to 47 cents. But Wheeling-Pittsburgh closed down 2 cents, at $1.49.
Industry analysts say that because the proposed consolidation could be the only way for some companies to survive, they do not expect serious antitrust objections. Though antitrust regulators do not consider an industry's health when weighing a merger proposal, they are more likely to approve a deal that involves companies on the verge of failing. 
The main barrier to steel industry consolidation is the retiree health care costs. The government's main task is to decide whether to assume future health care benefit costs of retired steel employees, who outnumber active employees 4 to 1.
For years, steel makers and the steelworkers' union negotiated generous health care benefits for employees without setting aside enough money to pay for them in the future. There are now about 142,000 steel workers and around 600,000 retirees. Bethlehem, for instance, counts 13,000 active workers and 130,000 retirees and dependents.
"Many years ago companies signed labor contracts deferring huge payments to the worker until after the executives retired, and it became someone else's problem," said Robert Crandall, a steel analyst at the Brookings Institution.
Mr. Miller of Bethlehem Steel said the health care costs had thwarted consolidation since no potential buyer wanted to assume such a large financial obligation -- a burden he compared to owning a $100,000 house with a $200,000 mortgage. 
Legislation to provide the steel industry with $1 billion a year to cover its health benefits, which come on top of Medicare benefits, was introduced in the House this year. Already it has garnered 226 sponsors, and the industry's announcement yesterday gave it even more attention.
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill has been seeking greater balance among global steel makers by encouraging countries and companies to reduce production so as to stabilize prices. He has also threatened to restrict the entry of steel imports into the United States. 
The United States represents about 12 percent of global steel production -- now around 850 million tons, even though global steel consumption is only around 700 million tons. Around a quarter of the steel used in the United States is imported, as the glut of steel worldwide has pushed down prices everywhere.
On Friday, a United States trade panel is to determine whether to impose hefty duties on steel from overseas. This follows a finding last month by the panel, the International Trade Commission, that steel makers had suffered serious injury from foreign competition -- a finding that reflects a willingness to provide greater support for steel.
But it is unclear whether the administration will back the industry's plan for the government to assume health care costs -- especially at a time when workers in other industries, most notably unemployed airline workers, have received no aid from the government. Leo W. Gerard, president of the steelworkers' union, said, however, that the aid to the retired workers was needed to save the domestic steel industry. 
"Do we want to have a strong domestic steel industry and be able to rebuild America's infrastructure?" Mr. Gerard said. "Do we want the next World Trade Center to be built with American steel?"
Asked what leverage the industry had in Congress, Mr. Gerard said: "If steel makers were to liquidate and 600,000 retirees were to lose their benefits -- bring that to 1 million family members in key industrial states -- I'd make sure all those retirees know who in Washington abandoned them."
For his part, Mr. Miller said that if steel makers did not consolidate and many had to go out of business, the government would have to assume many of the companies' pension costs through the Pension Benefit Guarantee Act. If Bethlehem was liquidated, Mr. Miller estimates, "the government would be on the hook for $2 billion" in pension guarantees.
"You multiply that across the industry," Mr. Miller said, "and it would exceed" the government's cost of paying the health care costs. 
Representative Peter J. Visclosky, an Indiana Democrat and vice chairman of the House steel caucus, said that "relieving the companies of this liability" would protect steel makers from foreign acquirers and "would allow control of the production of steel to remain in the United States."

HEADLINE: As Vote Nears, Bush Presses for New Trade Powers 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
As President Bush corners lawmakers on the White House dance floor and on Air Force One to urge them to back his bid for enhanced trade authority, his administration is warning that if Congress rejects the proposal this week "no one will negotiate" with the United States on trade.
 The House has scheduled a vote Thursday on whether to grant the president what is known as trade promotion authority, giving him the power to reach trade deals that Congress could accept or reject, but not amend. 
 Bush administration officials and supporters in Congress acknowledge that they are still short of a majority -- perhaps by 20 votes -- in the Republican-controlled House. But they say they are determined to hold a vote because dozens of lawmakers would prefer not to commit one way or the other on the sensitive issue until they have no choice. 
In the Senate, which also must approve the proposal, there is less resistance.
Republican leaders are eager to show powerful business lobbies that they are doing everything possible to advance trade. Some Republicans say privately that even if the bill fails they could gain a fund-raising edge by painting Democrats as anti-trade, a label Democrats worked hard to erase during President Bill Clinton's two terms.
Administration officials are also bluntly warning that the world will cut the United States out of international trade accords unless Congress cooperates.
"Without this authority, our ability to shape the negotiating agenda will be undermined," United States Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick said while visiting Capitol Hill today. "If we do not get it, no one will negotiate with us."
While President Bush has spent far less time lobbying for new trade powers than President Clinton devoted to passing a big China trade bill last year, Mr. Bush has begun to personally pressure lawmakers, especially wavering Republicans, as the vote approaches. He talked trade with Congressional guests at a White House Christmas dance Monday night and invited House members to join him today on a trip to Florida on Air Force One, where, as one lawmaker put it, he engaged in some "first-class arm twisting at 37,000 feet."
The administration is focusing mainly on Republican lawmakers from states that have strong citrus, textile and steel industries. Many of those lawmakers say they would like to support the president on an important matter, but have trouble defying companies and workers at home who fear that imports have hurt their livelihoods.
One target was Mark Foley, a Florida Republican who says he has not decided whether to support trade authority. He argues that past trade deals have damaged Florida's $9 billion citrus industry and that the president would have to agree to protect citrus in any new trade accord with Latin America.
"I told the president that we are not going to support anything that leaves us bare on citrus," Mr. Foley said. "I can't say he said enough to get my vote. But there's 48 hours to go."
If the bill passes, it is likely to have minimal Democratic support. But Republican leaders are engaging in some furious horse-trading with a handful of generally pro-trade Democrats, administration officials and Republican aides said.
Bill Thomas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and the main sponsor of fast-track, may support increased aid for workers displaced by trade deals, aides said. House leaders are also weighing whether to offer increased unemployment and health insurance benefits in exchange for Democratic support on the trade bill.
Trade agreements often sail through the Senate. But many Democrat and some Republican House members, who react more to individual constituents who feel imports cost them jobs, have grown increasingly wary of efforts to bring down tariffs and reduce trade barriers.
Individual trade accords, like the one that paved the way for China to join the World Trade Organization, have tended to pass narrowly, often because they are presented as strategic necessities. But the House rejected enhanced trade authority for President Clinton twice in his second term.. Labor and environmental groups have mobilized effectively to portray fast-track as an abdication of Congressional powers for a benefit that is, at best, years away.
Mr. Zoellick argues that the stakes are high. He helped forge an international framework for free trade in agriculture, services and manufactured products at the World Trade Organization meeting in Doha, Qatar, last month. He said that those talks could be stillborn unless America's trading partners believe that Congress will back any accord the administration reaches. He said the same about ongoing negotiations to create a giant free trade zone from Canada to Chile, known as the Free Trade Area of the Americas.
While failure to get the powers would be viewed as a significant setback for the administration's trade agenda, rejecting them also carries risk for Democrats.
Moderate Democrats stress that they are not beholden to a trade union agenda and that they want to increase global commerce, a position they argue is vital if they are to maintain financial support from business groups.
As a result, they say they are opposed to giving President Bush trade authority only because the House bill does not give Congress enough of an ongoing oversight role and does too little to address inequities in labor and environmental rules that they say can lead to unfair trade.
"We are far apart because while we agree on the goals we cannot agree on how to implement those goals," said Charles Rangel of New York, the ranking Democrat on Ways and Means. "The trade lobbyists do not oppose what the Democrats are suggesting on trade but the Republican leadership is not listening to us."

Getting From Here to There, With the Car Parked at Home

BYLINE:  By Elaine Louie; Information on insider sources and good deals may be sent by e-mail to rohrlich@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
 For those who are considering travel by train rather than airplane this season, a perfect trip might mean taking the Lakeshore Limited to Chicago to see "Modern Trains and Splendid Stations," an exhibition of 45 projects opening Saturday at the Art Institute of Chicago. Trains these days are faster, sleeker and more luxurious. 
And train stations themselves are "symbols of cities, and motors for economic revival," said Martha Thorne, curator of the show. The 1995 train station in Solana Beach, Calif., below, combines the look of a Quonset hut with a traditional train station clock tower. The unbuilt HST 350 high-speed train (the model below center) influenced the JR 500, a Japanese high-speed train. An airport train station in Frankfurt, Germany, seen in a model at bottom, is under construction. Through July 28; the catalog is $29.95; (312) 443-3600.

To the Editor:
 Re "Getting at the Roots of Arab Poverty," by Alan Schwartz (Op-Ed, Dec. 1): 
 Women whose only acceptable role is motherhood have many more children than women who have multiple options for their lives. 
In Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Afghanistan, women have an average of nearly six children. As a result, in each country well over 40 percent of the population is under age 15. In contrast, American women have an average of 2.1 children. With only 21 percent of the United States population under age 15, our economy can employ each year's crop of new workers, male and female.
Fighting terrorism is important for our security now, but it will take fundamental economic and social changes in poor countries to ensure our security tomorrow.

HEADLINE: European Steel Makers Say a Merger in U.S. Is Overdue 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 5 

 BODY:
European steel producers championed an effort by big American rivals today to combine into a single company as a necessary and long-overdue measure to streamline a bloated industry.
 "If we want to save the steel business, it needs to be more concentrated," said Pierre Bourrier, a spokesman for Usinor of France, which is in the process of merging with two competitors, Arbed of Luxembourg and Aceralia of Spain, to form the world's largest steel producer. "We are glad that American companies are starting to reorganize." 
 Of the major brick-and-mortar industries, steel remains one of the most fragmented, with the five largest companies producing less than 20 percent of the world's output. 
That compares with autos, where the five biggest manufacturers account for 70 percent of production, and iron ore, where three large companies are dominant, according to analysts. Steel companies have thus been squeezed between suppliers and customers.
And as the world's economies contract, declining demand for steel has pushed prices to a 20-year low.
The merger discussions among the U.S. Steel unit of USX, Bethlehem Steel and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel, which were disclosed on Tuesday, come as officials from around the world prepare to meet in Paris later this month for the second round of negotiations aimed at reducing steel capacity.
"There is no doubt that if the Americans can come forward with some concrete figures, that would facilitate the negotiations," said Wolfgang Hubner, head of the steel unit at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the meeting's host.
The stocks of European steel makers rallied today on hopes that less capacity would speed a recovery. Usinor shares climbed 6.8 percent in Paris, shares of the Corus Group of Britain jumped 13.3 percent in London and shares of ThyssenKrupp rose 7.8 percent in Frankfurt.
A number of barriers to an American deal persist, including whether the government or the companies will bear the burden of millions of dollars in health care costs for retired workers. And even if a merger were to succeed, it is not clear whether the United States market would still be protected from imports. 
Policies supported by the Bush administration, like heightened tariffs on imported steel, continue to frustrate European companies, who argue that they should not bear the financial burden of a less efficient American system.
European steel underwent its own painful reorganization in the 80's and 90's as part of a privatization program that abolished state subsidies, closed inefficient mills and reduced capacity through mergers. Recent deals created three of the top five European steel producers, including Corus, which was formed by the 1999 merger of British Steel and Royal Hoogovens of the Netherlands and ThyssenKrupp the same year.
European companies have found it easier to merge, in part because they are not saddled with health care costs coming due for an increasing number of retired employees. Because of the public health care systems of many European countries, "once a person stops working, they are no longer a liability to the company," but become the responsibility of the state, said Christian Mari, director of the European Confederation of Iron and Steel Industries.
These mergers have not entirely insulated European companies from broader economic and industry problems. Earlier this year, Corus said it would eliminate more than 6,000 jobs, a fifth of its work force, as it struggles to cope with a decline in the demand for British steel.
Today, Usinor reported a third-quarter loss of 10 million euros ($8.87 million), or 4 cents a share, in contrast to a profit of 220 million euros, or 94 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. But the company also said it saw a bottom in the steel market, forecasting that reduced industry capacity would help stem the decline in prices and pave the way for a recovery next year.
"A merger of U.S. companies would be positive," the European confederation director said. "It is desirable for the entire industry to have a more limited number of players."

Setting fuel-efficiency targets for vehicle fleets makes little sense.

BYLINE:  By Virginia Postrel; Virginia Postrel is the editor at large of Reason Magazine and the author of "The Future and Its Enemies." E-mail: vpostrel @dynamist.com.

 BODY:
GASOLINE prices have fallen sharply, to below $1 a gallon in some places, encouraging Americans to drive more. The war on terrorism, meanwhile, is raising questions about relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia and the future of Persian Gulf oil supplies. In response, some activists and commentators are calling for government action to require more fuel-efficient automobiles.
 Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a Natural Resources Defense Council lawyer, has argued that Congress should "immediately pass legislation to raise fuel-economy standards to 40 miles a gallon by 2012 and 55 by 2020." 
 Bill O'Reilly, the Fox News Channel talk show host, declared that "our greedy corporate system and our weak-willed politicians" are denying Americans 50-mile-a-gallon cars and strengthening Saudi Arabia.
More moderate analysts have focused on raising the federal fuel-efficiency requirements for light trucks, including sport utility vehicles, to the same level as those for passenger cars. All seem to agree that the Corporate Average Fuel Economy program, or CAFE, which took effect in 1978, is successful and should be extended.
Not so, say economists who study the program. The standards do not do a particularly good job at lowering consumption. And that goal itself is questionable.
Under the complex CAFE system, the federal government sets a minimum average mileage requirement for each manufacturer's fleet. Domestic and imported cars are averaged separately, and automakers that do better than the mandate, often because they make mostly small cars, can save credits for future use. Toyota and Honda used these credits when they introduced their luxury lines.
As a conservation measure, said Pietro S. Nivola, an economist at the Brookings Institution, CAFE standards did not work well because the requirements were "aimed at the vehicles, not at the consumer."
"They're basically aimed at redesigning vehicles, specifically new vehicles," he added.
Regulating new-vehicle mileage has little effect on gasoline consumption for two reasons. First, any increase in fuel-efficiency requirements takes a long time to make a difference on the road. Higher standards affect only new cars, which make up about 7 percent of registered vehicles.
While 1990 automobiles had to average 28 miles a gallon, for instance, "the total population of light-duty vehicles in 1990 averaged under 19 m.p.g., a gain of fewer than 5 m.p.g. over the average recorded 10 years earlier," wrote Dr. Nivola and Robert W. Crandall in "The Extra Mile: Rethinking Energy Policy for Automotive Transportation" (Brookings Institution, 1995). The delay is extended when CAFE mandates increase car prices, leading consumers to hold on to their old gas guzzlers.
The second, and more serious, problem with the regulations is that better gas mileage encourages people to drive more. You can go farther for the same amount of money. Or you may be able to buy a larger car and get the same mileage. Either way, total consumption does not change much.
In their book, Dr. Nivola and Dr. Crandall noted that in the 1980's, when CAFE standards were fully in force, the number of vehicle miles traveled by Americans "climbed as steeply as ever, at almost four times the rate of population growth." And when fuel prices dropped after 1981, drivers traded in their small cars for larger models.
For those worried about pollution, these results are not good news. "We have energy policy and environmental policy, and the two don't speak to one another," Dr. Nivola said. The way to reduce emissions, he said, "is through less driving rather than more efficient vehicles that people can drive much more."
There are alternatives, of course, like regulating emissions directly. Driving a clean car a lot pollutes less than driving a dirty car a little. Regardless, setting mileage targets for vehicle fleets makes little sense. Instead of regulatory mandates, economists generally prefer a gasoline tax. In a response to Mr. Kennedy, for instance, N. Gregory Mankiw, a professor of economics at Harvard University, suggested a gasoline tax coupled with income tax cuts. Dr. Nivola suggests offsetting a gas tax with payroll tax reductions.
A tax would allow consumers to make their own decisions about whether to respond to higher prices by buying more efficient vehicles, driving less or economizing elsewhere.
"I don't know of any other major industrial country that resorts to command-and-control regulations, rather than the price incentive, to conserve oil," Dr. Nivola said.
Unlike regulatory mandates, which hide costs in the price of new cars and allow politicians to blame Mr. O'Reilly's "greedy corporate system," gas taxes would make costs visible to consumers. That is politically dangerous, but it is economically efficient.
It is also fairer. A gas tax is the same for everyone. Fuel-economy rules allow for all sorts of exceptions, sometimes with unintended results. The most famous exception is the lower target for light trucks, now 20.7 miles a gallon, compared with 27.5 for passenger cars. That exception was meant to keep down the price of work vehicles. But it led to the proliferation of sport utility vehicles for personal transportation.
The real question, however, is not what policy would most efficiently encourage conservation. It is whether government policy should say anything at all about fuel economy, as opposed to emissions.
When the CAFE standards were established, federal controls kept gasoline prices artificially low. So when shocks like the Arab oil boycott and the Iranian revolution cut supplies in the 1970's, prices did not rise.
Instead, there were shortages and gas lines. The fuel-economy standards were a substitute for higher prices, an intervention to correct the ills of a previous regulation.
Those price controls were abolished back during the Reagan administration. Now when oil is short, prices rise and Americans cut back on their driving. The response is immediate, not delayed by a four-year car-design cycle. If a future upheaval in the Persian Gulf caused a sudden drop in oil supplies, consumers would still have to adjust to higher gas prices, regardless of what fuel taxes or mileage mandates were in place.
Today the main argument for CAFE standards appears to be aesthetic revulsion at big cars. Under the guise of conservation, regulation supporters can redesign the auto fleet and hammer people with bad taste.

HEADLINE: Slump in the Service Sector Was Reversed in November 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5 

 BODY:
Business at service companies expanded unexpectedly in November, reversing a slump that came after the September terrorist attacks.
 The National Association of Purchasing Management's nonmanufacturing business index increased to 51.3 last month after a record low of 40.6 in October. An index above 50 indicates expansion, and analysts were expecting a reading of 43. 
 The index is the latest in a string of reports pointing to a rebound. Consumer spending rose a record 2.9 percent in October, and construction grew unexpectedly. Orders to factories for durable goods jumped that month more than at any time in nine years, and sales of new houses were the fastest in four months.
"Nearly every economic indicator that was adversely affected by the terrorist attacks has recovered much more than the consensus had forecast," said Joe LaVorgna, senior economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York.
Still, announcements of job cuts in November reached the fourth-highest level of the year, suggesting the nation's unemployment rate will keep rising even as the economy starts to grow. Companies last month said they would trim payrolls by 181,412 positions, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc.
While 25 percent less than October's total, the figure is four times as great as the 44,152 announced in November last year. 
The purchasing managers' association gathers statistics from more than 370 purchasing executives in more than 62 areas, including utilities, law firms, hospitals, construction companies, government, retailers and electronic commerce.
The nonmanufacturing report's index of new orders rose to 48.3 in November from 40.4 in October. Indexes measuring employment, inventories and exports also increased in November.
The association's index of prices paid, a measure of costs for purchased materials and services, fell to 38.5 in November from 41.5.
Four of the report's 10 indexes -- business activity, new orders, employment and imports -- are adjusted for seasonal patterns. The other components are unadjusted.

HEADLINE: Gerhard Stoltenberg, 73; Reunified Germany's Armies 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times

DATELINE: BERLIN, Dec. 5 

 BODY:
Gerhard Stoltenberg, who reunified the armies of Germany after the Berlin Wall fell, died of cancer on Nov. 23 in Bad Godesberg, Germany. He was 73.
 Mr. Stoltenberg, a politician whose precocious rise through the ranks led him to the highest levels of power, wasted little time joining the political fray as a young man. 
 At the age of fifteen, Mr. Stoltenberg, a pastor's son from Schleswig-Holstein, was drafted to serve as an airplane gunner in the Wehrmacht, spending the last days of the war in a British prisoner-of-war camp. Returning to school after his release, he was awarded a doctorate in history in 1954 from the University of Kiel when he was 26. 
But already too deep into politics as a member of the Young Christian Democrats to pursue an academic career, he immediately ran for office and was elected a member of the Schleswig-Holstein state Parliament in the same year. Three years later, he became the youngest member of the national Parliament. 
From the time Chancellor Ludwig Erhard appointed him minister of research in 1965, Mr. Stoltenberg was mentioned as a likely chancellor. But perhaps because of a tendency toward hesitation and a stiff political style, he missed his chances. When he put his name forward in 1973 and 1976, it was Helmut Kohl who was asked to lead the party. 
As a politician, Mr. Stoltenberg's most successful years were during his 11 years as premier of Schleswig-Holstein. In 1982, Chancellor Kohl appointed him finance minister, and his fiscal policies helped reduce inflation in Germany to its lowest levels since the country's economic miracle had taken shape in the 1950's. He also helped push through the country's most significant tax overhaul.
But in the fall of 1987, he publicly balked when the United States treasury secretary, James A. Baker III, called for Germany to lower interest rates. When Mr. Baker then threatened to push the dollar lower at the expense of German exports, markets around the world fell drastically. 
Mr. Stoltenberg's stance contributed to Mr. Kohl's decision to move him to head the Defense Ministry, a post he had turned down in 1962. In his new job, he was responsible for figuring out what to do with the East German National People's Army after the Berlin Wall came down. Rather than pursuing a wholesale dismemberment of the East German forces, Mr. Stoltenberg allowed the officers to apply for membership in a reconstituted army of a reunited Germany, and for those who passed a careful screening to take posts beside their former West German enemies. 
Despite this success, Mr. Stoltenberg faced disgrace in the Defense Ministry after taking responsibility for two scandals involving arms exports. In 1992, he resigned, ending his public political career, but he continued to be a player behind the scenes as deputy chairman of the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, the Christian Democrat's political foundation.

HEADLINE: Russia Agrees, at Least on Paper, to Reduce Oil Exports 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 5 

 BODY:
Russia agreed today to reduce crude oil exports by 150,000 barrels a day, a decision that could prompt production cuts by OPEC members and other nations.
 The move appeared to break a monthlong deadlock with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The cartel announced last month that it would pare daily oil production only if non-OPEC nations like Russia, Norway and Mexico followed suit, a call that Russia had resisted until today. 
 Russia's cut, however, will exist largely on paper. The reduction in exports, to apply to the first three months of next year, coincides almost exactly with a seasonal lull in exports -- Russians use more fuel in winter -- and will not, ultimately, reduce the surge in Russian production. 
"This is putting a public relations spin on something that was going to happen anyway," said Stephen O'Sullivan, head of research at the United Financial Group, an investment firm in Moscow. "It is as much as Russia can offer painlessly, and they won't accept any pain in Russia." In the last three winters, he said, daily exports of crude have dropped by about 130,000 barrels a day.
Moscow's announcement did little to oil prices, which have been restrained by signs of large inventories and slumping demand in industrial countries. Oil prices rose modestly in London after the Russian cut was announced. By the end of trading in New York, crude oil was down 16 cents, at $19.49 a barrel. 
Executives from nine Russian oil companies agreed to the reduction, about 5 percent of Russia's daily crude exports, in a meeting today with Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov. 
Together with pledges from Norway and Mexico to cut 100,000 to 300,000 barrels a day, Russia's reduction looked to satisfy OPEC, which had insisted on cuts of 500,000 barrels a day from producers outside the cartel before enacting its 1.5 million barrel reduction on Jan. 1. Russia rejected OPEC's call on Nov. 15, and the price of oil tumbled 11.6 percent, to a two-year low of $17.45 a barrel.
OPEC did not officially address Russia's pledge to reduce exports today, but it was expected to issue a statement of support on Thursday. Bloomberg News quoted an unidentified official in the oil ministry of Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer with OPEC, as saying that the cut was a step in the right direction. The oil minister of Kuwait, another OPEC member, said his country welcomed the move, Reuters reported. 
Russia's rising output -- up about 9 percent this year -- has been taking market share away from OPEC at a time when growth in the world's biggest economies is slowing. 
Next year will be no different. Mr. O'Sullivan, the analyst in Moscow, expected Russian oil exports to rise about 8 percent in 2002 in spite of the cuts, which may not continue beyond the first quarter. New pipelines and port expansions will give oil exporters from Russia and neighboring Kazakhstan new routes to markets. By 2005, exports will rise 20 percent, according to Deutsche Bank.
Still, companies insist the cuts are real. Tyumen Oil, Russia's fourth-largest producer, said it had already reduced investment for next year by 30 percent, to about $700 million, anticipating the cut. Tyumen's production, which this year rose more than 6 percent, is projected to increase next year by about 2 percent, the company president, Simon Kukes, said. 
"These are real numbers -- we actually have to start cutting production," Mr. Kukes said. "There isn't much room for cheating."
"Russia doesn't have much storage capacity," he said, and the state-owned pipeline company, Transneft, publishes regular reports on how much it exports.
Excess crude will flow to refineries in Russia and in former Soviet states, like Belarus and Ukraine. But with Russia's domestic oil market oversupplied, producers will try to export those products, adding to the world supply. Oil products are counted as part of world supply. Of the 4 million barrels of oil Russia exports daily, 1.2 million are oil products.
"The domestic market is already glutted," said Yevgeny Khartukov, the director of the nonprofit International Center for Petroleum Business Studies in Moscow. Exports of crude will be cut a bit, he said, "but mainly through redirecting flows."
"Oil will be shipped to Belarus, Ukraine," Mr. Khartukov said, "and there it can be refined and sent to other markets."
Companies that had lobbied against reductions played down the cut. Sibneft, another large oil company, said that its plans to increase production by 22 percent next year would not be affected and that its exports in the first quarter would exceed those from a year earlier. 
While markets ponder the numbers, Russia is on course to pump more oil and to cement its role as one of the world's most important producers. 
The call on Russia to cut, "is just an element of the competitive battle," President Vladimir V. Putin, said today in an interview with Greek journalists. "Russia has oil. It is enough. What's more -- we are ready to increase our supplies for export."

HEADLINE: Central Bank in Australia Reduces Lending Rate 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Dec. 5 

 BODY:
Australia's central bank cut the overnight lending rate it charges banks today for the sixth time this year, saying it is still worried about the global slowdown and the timing of a recovery.
 The Reserve Bank of Australia cut the rate to 4.25 percent from 4.50 percent. 
 "International economic conditions remain weak, with the United States and Japanese economies in recession, growth in Europe stalled and significant contractions over the past year in a number of Australia's East Asian trading partners," Ian Macfarlane, the bank's governor, said. He said the growth prospects for this year and next year were the weakest for major countries since the early 1980's. 
Central bankers worldwide have cut interest rates in recent months, and the price of oil has slumped, injecting some confidence back into financial markets and possibly setting the conditions for an economic recovery. "Even so, the timing and speed of a recovery in international conditions are, as yet, far from clear," Mr. Macfarlane said.
Although lending conditions were already "quite accommodative" by Australia's historical standards, the central bank is predicting that inflation will fall next year, Mr. Macfarlane said. That will provide room to cut interest rates and stimulate the economy, which has been growing faster than those in comparable countries, he added, but below Australia's long-range potential.
The cash rate is now at its lowest level in almost 30 years. And yet "there's a chance we might get one more," said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro in Sydney. The international economic outlook will remain the main concern for the bank and would be the motive for another interest rate cut, he said. 
Banks immediately began cutting their interest rates on mortgages.

HEADLINE: SOCCER; 
From Israel to Trenton to Queens

BYLINE:  By IRA BERKOW

 BODY:
The dream, the driving force, the goal for the goalkeeper of the St. John's University soccer team's, which plays Southern Methodist University in the quarterfinals of the N.C.A.A. tournament in Dallas Saturday night, is no different from what he says his homeland, Israel, dreams for and seeks as a goal.
 "Israel wants peace and quiet in the country," said Guy Hertz, the Red Storm's starting goalie, "and I want peace and quiet in the goal box." 
 Hertz, dark-haired, tall and slender at 6 feet 3 inches and 185 pounds, smiled at the odd juxtaposition, at the little joke. A 23-year-old junior transfer student, he came to America two and a half years ago. In Israel, he said, he had "grown up with terror." 
"We experienced it every day," he said. But like most Israelis, he developed a way to live with the danger. 
"One thing Israelis use to get through is black humor," he said. "Like you tell a friend you are going to take a bus someplace, and he asks, 'When are you coming back?' and you say, 'I don't know.' "
Buses are blown up, as happened last Sunday in the Israeli city of Haifa, when a suicide bomber killed 15 people.
"But people there still try to live normal lives," Hertz said. "My father does, but I called my mother the other day and she can get stressed. She said she's not going out of the house. For now."
Hertz's parents -- his father, Moshe, a retired base commander and fighter pilot who figured in a recent book, "Israeli Fighter Aces," and his mother, Ruth, a grade-school teacher -- live in Ramat-Hasharon, a suburb of Tel Aviv.
In the Red Storm's goal this season, there has been quite a bit of peace and quiet. Their record is 16-2-3, and Hertz has allowed only 13 goals all season while registering 11 shutouts, including three straight 1-0 victories in the Big East tournament, the last a victory in the final over Connecticut, the defending national champions, reversing an earlier 2-1 regular-season loss.
Hertz also came up with a 1-0 shutout over Massachusetts in the second round of the N.C.A.A. tournament. Last Saturday, Hertz helped St. John's beat Penn State, 2-1, in triple overtime, leaping and diving, making four critical saves in overtime.
"Guy has kept us in games," St. John's Coach Dave Masur said. 
After practice Tuesday morning, Hertz came off DaSilva Memorial Field on the St. John's campus in Queens wearing a gray shirt with black shorts.
Hertz also wore a wrap around his right hand and wrist. He fractured his wrist when it was stepped on while he ventured out of the goal box in the shutout of UConn on Nov. 18. "I threw my body into the other players," Hertz said. "You need to be brave, or you will not win."
In practice, meanwhile, to save Hertz's right wrist and hand for games, Masur does not permit him to field balls at the goal, but has him continue to work on footwork and positioning. "You have to be ready like a tiger in the bushes," said Hertz, who would like to play the game professionally one day. "You have to be quick to the ball, like a tiger pouncing on an animal."
That happened to be an element of his game that had needed improvement. After having served a two-year stint in the Israeli Army, Hertz was offered an opportunity to come to America, go to college and play soccer, his lifelong passion. He went to Mercer County Community College in Trenton, where he became a scholar-athlete majoring in economics. Masur scouted him at Mercer.
"What I liked was that Guy was fierce, fearless, competitive and tough," Masur said. Masur's scholarship offer was accepted, beginning this season. "But he needed to practice where best to be in the goal, and over the summer he didn't do all I had hoped," Masur said. "Over the last half of the season, though, he's been impeccable."
As a Jewish student at a Roman Catholic university, Hertz has been on a learning curve. "I never heard of Mass before, and when I went I found it to be an interesting educational experience," he said.
There has also been concern about whether with, as Masur said, "all the turmoil at home for Gus," he could maintain his focus in games.
"I remember the morning of our game against Seton Hall, in October, and there had been a bombing in Israel and I was glued to CNN," Hertz said. "I had called my parents and they and my two sisters were O.K. Coach Masur, who has been great as a coach and teacher and someone who understands personal problems, asked if I could be tough emotionally and concentrate on the game. I said I could. And I went out with the idea that my family and friends want me to succeed. They're happy I do good things. And in the game I put everything out of my mind but the game."
In that Big East conference game, St. John's beat Seton Hall, 1-0. "I love playing goalkeeper," Hertz said. "You are the last one, the last hope. Everybody looks to you."
On now to Dallas and undefeated S.M.U. (21-0), the top-ranked team in the nation (St. John's is ranked eighth).
Hertz has hopes for an N.C.A.A. championship, which would come five years after St. John's won its first Division I soccer championship. And Hertz harbors hopes for resolution in his country.
"I wish for peace for us and for the Palestinians," he said. "The young Palestinians, especially, have never really tasted a good life, but in my opinion a lot of that is due to their leadership. Yet sometimes I can't blame them for throwing stones. But I have empathy for my country. The economy now, the unemployment, the insecurity is heartbreaking, but our love for the country will keep us strong.
"I had wanted to take my girlfriend, an American, to visit Israel during the Christmas break, to see the beauty of Israel, the great history, but how can I now? I need to be responsible for her. And she's afraid for me to go, but I can't be afraid. I will be going. In this time, it's harder to stay here, away from my family. It is easier to be with them."

HEADLINE: Recession Saps Consumer Confidence in Japan 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: YOKOSUKA, Japan 

 BODY:
Japan and the United States, the world's two largest economies, have shown some similarities this fall: rock bottom interest rates, deflating prices and collapsing assets. 
 But in Japan, a big difference with the United States is deep and enduring consumer pessimism, illustrated by an evening spent with Noriko Kojima, the model of a frugal Japanese housewife. 
 Ensconced in tidy neighborhood on a hillside overlooking this Pacific port, the Kojima family is comfortably middle class in a nation that is comfortably middle class. 
But as Mrs. Kojima sipped tea with a guest recently in a chilly living room, going over her computerized household finance spreadsheet, she ticked off the austerity cuts she imposed on her family: no digital television subscription, no eating out in restaurants and no showers except those needed for washing hair. 
Turning to clothes, Mrs. Kojima used new Japanese slang words derived from English: bahgen, wintah saro, summah saro, recykuru shoppu, and frea marketo. 
Big-ticket items like a new car are out of the question. "I don't feel like buying a car," she said while riding in the family's five-year-old Nissan. 
Americans, of course, have also been cutting back, and consumer confidence is anything but high. Still, in the United States, car sales jumped 26 percent in October when automakers offered zero percent financing, despite the official onset of a recession. In Japan, by contrast, where near zero interest rates are the norm, car sales fell by 20 percent, hitting a 25-year low for the month of October. In November, trends were similar but less pronounced. 
Awash with money, banks have seen their lending fall for 46 straight months. As consumer demand languishes, Japan's low interest rates amount to pushing on a string. 
Despite appearances of peace and tranquillity, exemplified by Mrs. Kojima's delicate flower arrangement in the front foyer, the rude winds of recession and economic insecurity are prompting the Kojimas, like so many other Japanese families, to batten down the hatches. 
Consumer pessimism is one central reason the Japanese economy seems impervious to more than a decade of failed government remedies. Conservatism partly stems from the fact that 65 percent of Japanese savings assets are held by people over 65 years of age. For young people, spending is crimped by anxiety about the future, a syndrome economists call "the fear factor." 
Anxiety reigns despite the fact that nearly 95 percent of Japanese who want to work have jobs. Mrs. Kojima's husband, Shuichi, a 55-year-old electrical engineer, has seen lifetime employment guarantees fray after spending all his working life at one company. 
"My husband's company has been forcefully restructuring over the last four years," she said. "He didn't get sacked, but he had to put up with a pay cut. It is getting extremely hard to get a job." 
With two sons in college, Mrs. Kojima took a part-time job last year, caring for severely disabled adults. 
A family friend, Toshiko Suzuki, recounted her own daughter's job search last spring, when she was finishing college. Mrs. Suzuki helped send out letters to 100 companies before her daughter landed a job with a credit card company. 
Looking back to the roaring growth years of the 70's and 80's, she said, "We never expected that there would be restructuring everywhere, that the economy would get so bad." 
Japan's unemployment rate has hit 5.4 percent, a postwar high. The labor market is particularly unforgiving with older jobless workers. 
Although a law went into effect in October banning age limits from job advertisements, a government survey found that only one-third of 20,000 job offers complied. 
Over all in Japan there are about two job applicants for each job. But, because of age segregation, about seven job seekers over 55 compete for each opening in that bracket. 
With the International Monetary Fund predicting that Japan's economy will shrink by nearly 1 percent this year -- and by 1.3 percent next year -- union leaders are desperately trying to hold on to jobs. To do so, they advocate job sharing and cuts in salaries, bonuses and work hours. 
"I feel in my bones that the jobless rate and the ratio of job offers to job seekers will worsen in the next two or three months," Chikara Sakaguchi, Japan's labor minister, said. 
Japanese people share this fear. 
With Japan sliding into its fourth recession in a decade, 72 percent of almost 1,500 adults polled last month said they feared that they or family members would lose their jobs over the next year, according to the Nippon Research Institute, a government-backed group. 
With 67 percent of respondents saying they expect the economy to deteriorate further in the next year, the institute said this consumer anxiety index was at its highest level since polling started in 1977. 
In a separate survey, 40 percent of more than 3,000 respondents said they were cutting personal spending. In addition, 80 percent felt job insecurity, according to the survey, conducted for the Bank of Japan. 
Nervous about the present, Mrs. Kojima is also nervous about the day five years down the road when her husband is to retire. They are not alone. In 2020, one-quarter of Japan's population will be over 65. The nation's 2000 census figures showed that Japan, for the first time, had more people over 65 than under 15. 
Mrs. Suzuki, whose husband may retire soon, said: "We worry about our old age. If we live to be 90 years old, the national pension system will not take be able to support us." 
Indeed, a government policy paper has even suggested cutting social security benefits by 20 percent, starting in 2005. Displaying a lack of confidence in Japan's fixed contribution pension system, Japanese in 1999 saved 11 percent of their incomes. 
A question mark hangs over the pension system as the level of government indebtedness has risen to more than 130 percent of gross domestic product -- by far the highest ratio of any industrialized economy. 
Given these uncertainties, the Kojimas, like most Japanese families, choose to save rather than invest, even though interest rates are so low the earnings over a year do not even cover bank machine charges if one withdrawal is made each month. 
On a deposit of $8,130, Mrs. Kojima says she makes $4.06. "That is peanuts," she said.
But other investments are too risky. Since 1990, the yen has been one of the most volatile currencies in the industrialized world, wiping out gains in foreign investments. Over the same time, a line graph of Tokyo's stock market looks like a bare-knuckle bobsled run down Mount Fuji. 
"I invested 50,000 yen in the stock market, left it there for several years, and when I took it out I got 40,000 yen," said Mrs. Kojima echoing a widespread conviction that the odds are stacked against small investors.

HEADLINE: Hempstead Takes Back New Minimum Wage Law 

BYLINE:  By ELISSA GOOTMAN 

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., Dec. 5 

 BODY:
A month and a half after passing a broad living wage law intended to put money in residents' pockets, village officials here have repealed it, saying they feared it might backfire.
 On Oct. 16, the village board of trustees unanimously passed the bill, which would have required minimum hourly wages of $9 with medical benefits or $10.25 without for village employees, for people working under village contracts over $10,000 and for employees whose companies get village subsidies over $50,000, like routine tax abatements that most businesses receive. 
 But afterward, the trustees could not agree on how and to what extent to amend the bill, which would apply to companies with at least 10 workers. Some said they were concerned that it would drive away businesses that stood to receive tax incentives from the village and that it could cripple nonprofit organizations with shoestring budgets. Representatives of two restaurants told the village's commissioner of community development that they would set up shop elsewhere if the law went forward. 
So at a meeting on Tuesday that included five hours of testimony from supporters of the bill, the trustees voted 3 to 2 to repeal it. 
"There was a great deal of confusion on the version of the living wage law that was passed on Oct. 16, on who would be affected and to what extent," said James A. Garner, the mayor of Hempstead. "Therefore, we are going back to square one, to put together a task force and come up with a living wage law that's right for Hempstead." 
"We are not walking away from the concept," Mr. Garner said, adding that he initially approved of the bill with the understanding that it would be narrowed later. "We are just simply going to do it right." 
So-called living wage laws set standards that are more generous than the federal minimum wage, $5.15 an hour, in an effort to bring low-end salaries in line with high living costs. The Hempstead bill was the third such statute approved on Long Island recently and one of more than 70 passed across the country. Last summer, Suffolk County and the town of Oyster Bay, in Nassau County, passed similar ordinances.
But the village's smaller size meant that a restaurant interested in opening there could simply choose a nearby spot outside its borders and pay its workers less. 
"We don't want to shoot ourselves in the foot by chasing away businesses," Mr. Garner said. "This is uncharted water for us."
Back in the 1950's, Hempstead was known as "the hub," the shopping and business center of Nassau County. Its downtown declined as shopping malls cropped up and suburban sprawl took hold. 
In recent years, the village has been working to restore its glory by refurbishing abandoned storefronts and recruiting large retail stores like Home Depot and Old Navy. Dr. Glen L. Spiritis, the village's commissioner of community development, said a village-level living wage could stall those efforts. "It's hard to be the only one on the block doing it when you're competing with everyone else on the block for the business," he said. "Unfortunately, we're an island within the county." 
And an excellent starting point, say supporters of living wage measures. "When they voted on it, it was 5 to 0," said Atlanta G. Cockrell, the chairwoman of the Long Island branch of Acorn, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. "I was really shocked when they came back a month later and tried to repeal it." 
While some companies might be deterred by having to pay higher salaries, Ms. Cockrell said she believed that others would come to Hempstead nonetheless. "They should have at least tried to see if it would work for one year," she said.

HEADLINE: Zimbabwe's Campaign of Violence 

 BODY:
Before Zimbabwe's parliamentary elections last year, government thugs terrorized opposition activists for months, killing dozens. Now Zimbabwe is due to go to the polls again, possible as early as February, to elect a president. Robert Mugabe, the country's ruler for 21 years, is once again inciting violence and distorting the election laws. 
 Mr. Mugabe, Zimbabwe's independence leader, has become erratic, tyrannical and indifferent to the problems of ordinary people. Because of hyperinflation and soaring unemployment, many Zimbabweans now can afford to eat only one meal a day. Mr. Mugabe has tried to recapture public support by demonizing white farmers, encouraging the violent takeover of hundreds of their farms. Not surprisingly, food production has faltered. 
 In large part because of Zimbabwe's economic troubles, recent polls show Mr. Mugabe losing his presidency to Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, a respected umbrella opposition group. A panicked government has proposed laws banning foreign and domestic election observers, obstructing the ability of likely opposition supporters to vote, barring foreigners from working as correspondents and restricting domestic journalists. 
In a recent speech, Mr. Mugabe called the opposition party and white farmers "terrorists," using the word at least 20 times. Many worry it is a signal that he is preparing to ban the opposition, or step up the violence. This month in Zimbabwe's second-largest city, Bulawayo, thugs burned down the opposition headquarters while police watched. Police arrested 14 opposition members on trumped-up murder charges. Two activists have asserted that the police tortured them to make them confess.
Wealthy countries have little influence over Mr. Mugabe, who gets no money from Washington. Still, America, the European Union and the British Commonwealth nations missed an opportunity. High-level Western officials should be criticizing him and coordinating sanctions against his inner circle. The House of Representatives joined the Senate on Tuesday in passing a sanctions bill, a positive step that is likely, however, to have only a limited impact. The West should also have been working with nations that have direct influence in Zimbabwe. South Africa could shut down Zimbabwe's railroads, power and sea access if it chose.
Zimbabwe's political and economic woes have discouraged investment in South Africa and threaten to overwhelm the region with refugees. But while leaders of Malawi and Mozambique have spoken out against Mr. Mugabe's policies, South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, has only recently begun to criticize Mr. Mugabe in public. This is welcome, as South Africa's quiet diplomacy has failed. Last March, Zimbabwe, along with its neighbors, signed a pledge to hold free and fair elections. Those neighbors, led by Mr. Mbeki, must now hold Mr. Mugabe to this promise.

HEADLINE: Police Detail Durst's Travels While He Was on the Run 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN FLYNN and CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Robert A. Durst, the real estate heir who fled a murder charge in Texas, spent his last two weeks on the run in eastern Pennsylvania, living in the environs of his old college town until his arrest last week for shoplifting, law enforcement officials said yesterday.
 The police in Hanover Township, where investigators said Mr. Durst was caught stealing a sandwich, did not know whether Mr. Durst was simply passing through or had been staying in the area, where he had attended Lehigh University 40 years ago. 
 But employees at a hotel there said yesterday that Mr. Durst had stayed in a room for 12 days, using another in a series of aliases he seems to have employed while fleeing the murder charge in Galveston, Tex. Mr. Durst had been traveling around the country since Oct. 16, when he failed to appear in Galveston for his arraignment in the murder of Morris Black, a 71-year-old neighbor.
During part of his flight, Mr. Durst posed as Mr. Black, the police said, but he seems to have used a different name, Emilio Vignoni, when he checked into the Staybridge Suites off Airport Road in Hanover Township. 
The manager of the hotel, Bruce Hoegg, said his staff contacted the police on Tuesday to report that they recognized the man whose picture began appearing in the local newspaper last Saturday, the day after he was accused of shoplifting at a local supermarket.
Mr. Hoegg said his employees were "relatively sure" the man in the paper was the same one who had checked into the hotel on Nov. 18 and stayed in a fourth-floor room for 12 days, leaving the morning of Nov. 30, just hours before investigators say Mr. Durst was caught at the supermarket.
Mr. Hoegg said the man who checked in to the hotel was driving a Chevrolet with Alabama plates and had registered under the name Vignoni, using a Visa credit card in that name to cover his bill. Mr. Durst, 58, is known to have rented a red Chevrolet Corsica in Alabama last month, using the driver's license of Mr. Black, whose dismembered body was found floating in the waters off Galveston. Over the past few months, Mr. Durst has used a half-dozen aliases and dressed like a woman at times to conceal his identity, investigators said.
In addition to the Texas murder, Mr. Durst is the subject of a recently reopened investigation into the disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen Durst, in 1982. Yesterday, New York investigators, including Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, joined Texas police officers in Pennsylvania, where they searched the rental car.
Mr. Durst, whose family is one of Manhattan's largest property owners, is being held in the Northampton County Prison in eastern Pennsylvania while he awaits a hearing on his extradition to Texas. Officials have lifted the suicide watch that he had been under. People who have been briefed on preparations for the hearing said yesterday that Mr. Durst had decided not to fight extradition. His decision is expected to be announced at a hearing today in Galveston, where he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.
Employees of the hotel where Mr. Durst stayed before his arrest did not see him wearing women's clothing or acting unusual, Mr. Hoegg said. But The Morning Call of Allentown, Pa., reported yesterday that Mr. Durst had been spotted at a restaurant, C.L. Checkers, across the parking lot from the hotel, talking to himself while drinking at the bar.
Workers at another nearby restaurant, the Golden View Family Restaurant, have also reporting seeing Mr. Durst wearing an incongruous disguise of a brown wig and a white mustache. However, he has not been reported to have visited his alma mater, Lehigh, where he received a degree in economics in 1965. 
Detective Gary Hammer of the Colonial Regional Police in Pennsylvania said that since Mr. Durst's arrest, many people in the area have reported sightings. "Every time they see a short bald-headed guy, they think it's him," he said.
The police should be able to track Mr. Durst's comings and goings from the hotel, because all the entrances have video cameras, Mr. Hoegg said.

HEADLINE: CHANGING THE GUARD: THE CONVERGENCE; 
Fusing Old and New

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON

 BODY:
Two years ago, when America Online, the cheeky Internet powerhouse, announced that it was buying Time Warner, the paragon of offline publishing and entertainment, it was seen as confirmation that new media had officially overpowered the old.
 Then the Internet boom imploded, and conventional wisdom celebrated the return of established media firms to dominating the consumption of culture. 
 Both views are out of date. What is evolving is neither new media nor old, but a complicated creature that has media companies searching for ways to fuse elements of both into a single -- and profitable -- hybrid. 
The success of the new management team announced yesterday at AOL Time Warner, analysts said, may depend on its crossbreeding skills. "The new-media paradigm is gone," said Tom Wolzien, a senior media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. "What you have is the old idea that where people are spending time is an opportunity to sell to them -- but they are spending time in new places."
The plunge in share prices of Internet media stars like Yahoo and AOL may belie the continuing impact of the Internet in America's media habits. In part, that impact may be disguised by the continuing downturn in the economy, which has both new and old media struggling to find advertisers who want to sell to their audiences. But last week, a report by the Center for Communication Policy at the University of California at Los Angeles said that television watching was down by 4 1/2 hours a week among Americans who used the Internet, compared with those who did not.
It has been clear for a while that the Internet is not going to single-handedly overturn older media and that there are huge audiences for conventional media properties like Harry Potter and the new Britney Spears album.
The trick for media companies is how to make their new and old media divisions act like more than the sum of their parts, and it is one that all of them are trying to perform with less than complete success.
"For things like sports and music that live really well online and on television, I think it's crazy not to integrate it," said Judy McGrath, president of MTV. "I don't think it's one or the other. I think it's a new kind of synthesis."
The main old-new fusion project at MTV, which is owned by Viacom, is called MTV360, which schedules programming to its viewers across its cable channels and its Web site, directing them from one location to another. The program is based on research indicating that the young viewers who watch MTV are watching television at the same time they are communicating on the Internet.
That kind of cross-promotion was one of the driving ideas behind AOL and Time Warner's merger; in addition, the presumption was that AOL's subscriber base would continue to grow, as it has. AOL's 32 million subscribers spend an average of 70 minutes online a day. During prime time, AOL attracts about 3.2 million simultaneous users, almost twice that of any cable network.
The idea was that companies who are in the places where people are migrating, as well as where they already are, stand a better chance of surviving. CBS is often cited as an example of a media company that lost an important audience by failing to move to cable fast enough.
The splintering of media platforms has companies scrambling to deliver entertainment and information on television, radio, the Internet, video game platforms, wireless hand-held devices and cellphones.
"I don't think anything takes over anything else," said Robert W. Pittman, the former chief executive of AOL who became the sole chief operating officer of AOL Time Warner yesterday. "What happens is the lines get very, very blurry."
Mr. Pittman said the company saw an opportunity to increase the amount the average household spends on AOL service from $20 per month to $150 by offering "old media" products like magazine subscriptions and other information and services through its new-media outlets. He said it might be possible to coax $200 per month out of each home that now subscribes to its cable service for $60 per month by selling other AOL Time Warner products.
Although company executives acknowledge privately that it may have taken longer than they wished, AOL Time Warner made its first major foray into cross-promotions with the release last month of the Harry Potter movie, which was heavily promoted on AOL in advertising, information features and chat room sessions.
Other efforts to mix old media and new include a service that allows AOL users to watch the latest edition of CNN Headline News from the top, no matter how many minutes of the hour are gone when they double-click on their computer icons.
"One of the goals of the merger was that we would operate as one," Mr. Pittman added. "That's what we've been doing and intend to keep doing."
The degree to which AOL really did take over Time Warner may be more evident in the company's culture than in its products, some media executives said. Time Warner was known for a decentralized structure in which the executives at its individual units had great autonomy. Now the chief executives at its operating units meet every other week with senior corporate management. 
"At least from a cost perspective, it seems like it's the AOL culture that's driving it," said Frank Biondi, a former Viacom chief executive who is senior managing director at WaterView Advisors, an investment advising company. "They've been in there cutting costs, taking higher-priced cash people and changing them to stock and compensation."
That cultural shift may spread to other media firms as well, but the need for central control may be greater at AOL because it is so big. In terms of market capitalization, the company is twice the size of Viacom, four times the size of Disney and nine times the size of Gannett, according to Mr. Wolzien of Sanford C. Bernstein.
"Own it all," Mr. Wolzien said. "That's the new paradigm according to AOL."

HEADLINE: The Home-Front Emergency 

 BODY:
The need to do more to guard against terrorism at home is obvious. Tom Ridge, the director of homeland defense, and members of Congress have certainly endorsed the idea -- in principle. Yet today, when the Senate takes up a measure that would add $7.5 billion to the budget for items like airport security and defense against germ warfare, Republican leaders will be trying to block it. The appropriation is tacked onto an emergency military spending bill that no one opposes. But an emergency also exists at home. Senators should put the safety of their constituents first and vote for the entire package.
 President Bush has threatened to veto the $7.5 billion measure if it reaches his desk, and Mr. Ridge has urged the senators to wait until next year, when he acknowledges he will be asking for more money for things like public health and food safety. Senators have been appropriately skeptical of his plea for delay. "That, simply stated, is too late," said Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican. 
 Why would the White House, which has just issued another generalized terrorism warning, want to temporize on mounting an American response? The answer is old-fashioned budget politics. Earlier this year the administration and Congress settled on a ceiling of $686 billion in so-called discretionary spending for the current fiscal year. After Sept. 11, Mr. Bush and Congress agreed to add $40 billion to deal with the terrorist attacks, half of which was supposed to be set aside for New York. Not surprisingly, the money has been used up quickly. About $20 billion is going to the military to prosecute the war in Afghanistan. Only $10 billion may go to New York. Only $8.5 billion is set aside for homeland defenses.
It makes no sense to postpone help for the nation's health facilities to recognize and treat victims of biological or chemical attack when federal health officials have testified that their departments could use the money now. If the American people were asked whether they wanted to wait until next year to appropriate money to keep nuclear facilities secure and protect the nation's borders, they would undoubtedly opt for immediate action. The other great unmet need this year is New York City's recovery. The Bush administration argues that the promise of at least $20 billion to help the city will, eventually, be spent as costs are incurred. But that is beside the point. The Senate bill would give New York a further $7.5 billion for costs that would not be covered under those emergency procedures, such as grants to businesses to keep them from moving out of Lower Manhattan. It would also commit money to the Port Authority, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and other agencies to start rebuilding now. Other parts of the package would help reimburse utilities for rewiring the area and hospitals for the emergency care they provided.
The only serious argument against the Senate package appears to be the president's opposition. Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, the ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee, says he would vote for the bill except that the White House asked him not to.
Mr. Bush has lately accused Congress of overspending, though lawmakers have stayed within all the agreed-upon limits except those related to the emergency. Recently Mitchell Daniels, Mr. Bush's budget director, has been citing new deficit projections as evidence that Congress needs to keep spending down. But the administration has found room to expand the separate economic stimulus package to include huge giveaways to corporations and the wealthy. About $25 billion in the Republican stimulus bill would simply go to help the biggest corporations in America avoid taxes altogether.
This is a time for Senator Stevens, and all his colleagues, to vote on the merits. The merits dictate that the bill be passed.

HEADLINE: 'Voices Of Negativism' 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Preparing to tell the Senate Judiciary Committee where to get off today, Attorney General John Ashcroft lashed out at all who dare to uphold our bedrock rule of law as "voices of negativism." (A nattering nabob, moi?)
 Polls show terrorized Americans willing to subvert our Constitution to hold Soviet-style secret military trials. No presumption of innocence; no independent juries; no right to choice of counsel; no appeal to civilian judges for aliens suspected of being in touch with terrorists. 
 President Bush had no political motive in suspending, with a stroke of his pen, habeas corpus for 20 million people; his 90 percent popularity needs no boost. The feebleness of the Democrats' response, however -- with the honorable exception of Vermont's Senator Pat Leahy -- is highly political. Tom Daschle is waffling wildly because he is terrified of being slammed as "soft on terrorism," which might overwhelm his strategy of running against "the Bush recession" in the 2002 elections. 
With most voters trusting the government with anything, and with an attorney general and his hand-picked F.B.I. boss having the publicity time of their lives, one might expect us negativists to be in disarray.
Here's why we are not: The sudden seizure of power by the executive branch, bypassing all constitutional checks and balances, is beginning to be recognized by cooler heads in the White House, Defense Department and C.I.A. as more than a bit excessive. 
Not that they'll ever admit it publicly; Bush will stick to his shaky line that civil courts cannot be trusted to protect military secrets and, as fearful Orrin Hatch assures him, jurors will be too scared to serve. But his order asserting his power to set up drumhead courts strikes some of his advisers, on sober second thought, as counterproductive. 
Set aside all the negativist libertarian whining about constitutional rights, goes his newest advice, and forget about America's moral leadership. Be pragmatic: our notion of a kangaroo court is backfiring -- defeating its antiterrorist purpose.
At the State Department, word is coming in from Spain, Germany and Britain -- where scores of Al Qaeda suspects have been arrested -- that the U.N. human rights treaty pioneered by Eleanor Roosevelt prohibits the turning over of their prisoners to military tribunals that ignore such rights. That denies us valuable information about "sleepers" in Osama bin Laden's cells who are in the U.S. planning future attacks. (Those zealots who cited F.D.R.'s saboteur precedent forgot about Eleanor.) 
At the C.I.A., data about China, Russia and other closed societies is gleaned from debriefing returning travelers. But U.S. kangaroo courts would legitimize harsh proceedings overseas against U.S. business executives, academics and tourists -- thereby shutting down major intelligence sources. (Interviewing 5,000 Muslim students and visitors, however, is seen by our spooks as an excellent opportunity to recruit Arabic-speaking agents.) 
At Justice, those not in the Ashcroft-Mueller axis view the tribunals as giving priority to punishment for past attacks rather than helping to prevent future attacks. Thus Ashcroft undermines Justice's justification for its nationwide dragnet. 
At Defense, the hastily drawn order must be translated into a system of trials that would not be invalidated by a Supreme Court. Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has refused to follow lockstep behind Ashcroft in deriding strict constructionists as negativist. On the contrary, Rumsfeld calls the informed outcry "useful" in refining the order. The hopeful news is that Rumsfeld has reached outside the Pentagon to get advice from legal minds not conflicted by administration ties. Lawyers inside the armed services are also determined to resist the subversion of the Uniform Code of Military Justice by Bush's diktat. 
Many attorneys friendly to this White House know that order was egregiously ill drafted. The White House counsel, Alberto Gonzales, defended the order on this Op-Ed page by denying or interpreting away its most offensive provisions. That's his signal to the Pentagon general counsel, William Haynes, to give the broadest interpretation to the order's five words promising non-citizens "a full and fair trial."
Otherwise, our Constitution would be set aside by Cicero's ancient inter arma silent leges -- in time of war, the law falls silent.

HEADLINE: Co-op and Condo Brokers Have More to Sell This Year 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
With the economy settling into a recession and Manhattan apartment buyers hesitating, the number of condominiums and co-ops for sale in New York has increased significantly from the same period a year ago.
 Jonathan Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, one of the largest appraisal firms in the city, said yesterday that although prices had declined 5 to 10 percent, the number of apartments on the market was 40 percent higher than it was a year ago, but it was still lower than it was three years ago. At the Halstead Property Company, the firm's exclusive listings were up 31 percent compared with those of a year ago. 
 The increase in inventory is caused by "the combination of the economy and the fear factor," said Lawrence Sicular, a real estate analyst who is preparing a new market report for Brown Harris Stevens, a big New York real estate brokerage firm. "Right now, we don't know which is more or less responsible for the jump in supply." 
Yesterday, the Corcoran Group reported that the number of new listings of co-ops and condominiums across Manhattan -- not just the company's own exclusive listings -- had more than doubled from the same period last year. During the last week of November, 317 owners put their apartments up for sale. In the same week a year ago, Corcoran said, 138 owners decided to sell.
Altogether, there are 8,208 apartments listed for sale in Manhattan below 96th Street, Corcoran said, up from 5,828 on Dec. 5, 2000.
Nevertheless, Barbara Corcoran, the chairwoman of the company, refused to say that the statistics represented the advent of a buyer's market.
"No, it doesn't mean a buyer's market because properties are selling for maybe 10 percent less than a year ago -- and there are still bidding wars," she said last night. In a buyer's market, she said, properties sell for "14, 15, 16 percent less."
Most brokers who were interviewed agreed, in general, that the buyers were not in the driver's seat -- yet. But Frederick W. Peters, the president of Ashforth Warburg, a brokerage firm, said that a couple of Manhattan neighborhoods were veering that way.
For example, Mr. Peters said, Carnegie Hill, which encompasses parts of the east 80's and 90's, was very hot two years ago, but is not so hot anymore. And it is not just that one neighborhood.
"It's the whole family market," he said. "Many families have just put it on hold." 
Nevertheless, brokers said, the market for one- and two-bedroom apartments is still strong. 
That is because rents have risen so high that, even as the overall economy has declined, many prospective renters are still deciding that it is cheaper to buy than to rent. Although rents have come down from their peak, many people are still eagerly buying the smaller apartments.
"If it's a toss-up whether to buy or to rent, the customer is buying," Mr. Peters said. And who is the customer? "The single career person, couples, empty nesters, rich older people," he replied. And they are buying in different neighborhoods: Sutton Place, in the 50's near the East River, which fell out of fashion five or six years ago, and Park Avenue in the high 50's and low 60's, whose time went by 15 years ago as families moved uptown.
Roberta Benzilio, who manages offices both uptown and downtown for William B. May Company, said that the Upper West Side, once sizzling hot, had slowed. At the same time, Murray Hill, only a few years ago a stepchild of the much-hotter Gramercy Park, has become a favorite with Midtown professionals.
In New York City real estate, brokers and statisticians agree that the market is invariably a case of supply and demand. And prices are already drifting lower. For example, Mr. Sicular found that the current appraisal value of one nine-room co-op on the Upper East Side was 10 to 13 percent less than it was before Sept. 11.
Paul Purcell, the president of Insignia Douglas Elliman, said he was not sure where the market was going because the World Trade Center attack had made the current market difficult to assess. "We can assess the market," he said, "when there is a market to assess." At Elliman, listings have risen to 1,050 today from 700 in August. For comparison with the last economic downturn, Mr. Purcell said, the number of listings was at least 25 percent higher in the early 90's.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Japan's dominant agency is looking overseas, but it will find that world to be much less congenial.

BYLINE:  By Ken Belson

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
IT was an inauspicious start to the second century in business for Dentsu. After 100 years as Japan's dominant advertising agency, Dentsu made its trading debut last week as investors clamored for its shares. The celebration, however, fizzled quickly after an errant "sell" order sent the new shares skidding.
 The trade was sorted out, but the damage was done. The shares finished the day up 12 percent, far below expectations. 
 The initial public offering glitch may serve as a warning about the difficulties that await Dentsu as it now looks beyond Japan, where it controls a quarter of the $50 billion advertising market. 
At home, the company has cornered big accounts like Toyota Motor, Matsushita Electric Industrial and Suntory. Its cozy connections in the political and business world have helped it win plum deals like the exclusive rights to Japan's half of the 2002 World Cup soccer tournament in June; Japan will share the rights with South Korea. Dentsu has more than 40 percent of the Japanese television commercial market, which it helped build in the 1950's. 
"Dentsu has risen along with the growth of television," said Yoshihiro Saito, president of the Advertising Economics Research Institute, whose statistics show that Dentsu is larger than its next four domestic competitors combined. "They're everywhere."
Everywhere, it seems, but overseas. The company has offices in more than two dozen countries, yet just 5 percent of its $14.8 billion in fiscal 2000 sales was earned overseas.
Dentsu may be vulnerable as the huge global agencies that have formed over the last decade -- like the WPP Group of Britain and the Interpublic Group of Companies of the United States -- extend their reach. Interpublic's McCann-Erickson subsidiary and WPP are making inroads in Japan, chipping away at Dentsu's position. These global agency companies also work with Japanese companies overseas, raising the odds that corporate giants will choose them for a global branding campaign.
"Dentsu has a unique approach that works well at home, but forget about them overseas," said Hirotaka Maeda, an analyst with HSBC Securities in Tokyo.
Now that Dentsu is publicly held, rival agencies may even try to buy stakes in the company, though the number of available shares is still limited.
"We're looking for investors, and if WPP wants to buy Dentsu shares, we can't stop it," the president of Dentsu, Yutaka Narita, told The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial newspaper.
Dentsu relies on two main international partnerships. The company formed a venture with Young & Rubicam in 1981 that focuses mainly on Asia; Young & Rubicam is now owned by WPP. In March 2000, Dentsu also bought a 20 percent stake in the Bcom3 Group, an agency company that includes Leo Burnett and D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles. The details of the partnership are murky, but Dentsu hopes to earn a greater share of billings with Japanese companies in the United States and Europe.
The money that Dentsu raised from its offering also makes other investments likely.
Even so, the company remains a creature of its home market. Dentsu originally distributed news and ad space, and it brought the United Press wire service to Japan in 1908. The government seized half the company in 1936 and turned the news service into the military's propaganda mouthpiece.
After World War II, Dentsu hired the sons of leading businessmen and politicians, a tactic that helped it win big accounts. The Dentsu groups' client list -- an incredible 6,000 companies long -- is a corporate who's who. The company is so powerful that rivals like Toyota, Honda Motor and Mitsubishi Motors all do business with the agency -- ties that would not be tolerated by industry rivals in the United States.
Dentsu also has a unique position in Japan because it controls ad space through ownership stakes in the media and produces the creative work, a dual role that would usually be considered a conflict of interest in the West.
In Japan, marketers also typically assign a bigger share of their advertising budget to one agency. That allows Dentsu to worry less about losing major accounts, particularly in television, where it holds a 40 percent share. In the West, marketers usually try to spread their advertising money around and can change agencies often, practices that would make it harder for Dentsu to apply its winner-take-all strategy overseas.
Dentsu is also heavily reliant on income from advertising, which makes up two-thirds of its revenue. Big European and American agency companies generally earn less than half their income from traditional advertising, with the rest coming from public relations, direct marketing and other services.
While it fumbles for a formula to compete in the West, Dentsu faces a tough battle at home. While the advertising industry nearly doubled in size between 1985 and 1990, it has grown less than 10 percent in the last decade. The company has benefited from the miniboom in advertising generated by Internet companies and the deregulation of the financial and telecommunication industries.
But as dot-coms fail and the financial markets sour, Dentsu expects revenue to remain flat this year at best. Noriko Manabe, an analyst with J. P. Morgan Securities in Tokyo, said that with the economy in yet another recession, he expected ad revenue to slip another 5 percent next year.
That's hardly the centennial celebration Dentsu had hoped for.

HEADLINE: Energy Traders Continue to Prowl The Floor That Enron Helped Build 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
Melissa Beckett checks prices on three computer monitors, fingers a microphone on her telephone and calls a broker in New York.
 "What's going on Billy?" says Ms. Beckett, 29, spinning in her seat on the Entergy-Koch energy trading floor here and pressing for details about the electricity market. "I'm at 30," she barks, meaning that she wants to sell power at $27.30 a megawatt. 
 No one is buying, the broker tells her, but Ms. Beckett can afford to be patient. She has already completed 16 trades, many of them profitable, and it is just 11:20 a.m.
"This has definitely been a good business," she says. "You have your losing days, but generally things have gone very well here."
That, of course, is why the Enron Corporation, until recently the world's largest energy trader, is working so hard to revive its trading business after filing for bankruptcy protection on Sunday. 
Though lower energy prices have weakened the market, rival firms and their thousands of young traders still find the prospects alluring. In Enron's wake, they have made Houston, once the corporate center of the Texas oil patch, into an energy trading capital that in its own way rivals the brokerage houses on New York's Wall Street and the futures pits in Chicago.
"There was this original idea that you could set up your energy business around trading and diminish your reliance on hard assets, like natural gas pipelines," said Michelle Michot Foss, director of the energy institute at the University of Houston. "That's what Enron said it was trying to do. And that's what other energy companies are now doing."
The trading floor at Entergy-Koch Trading -- a joint venture of Koch Industries, a privately held conglomerate in Wichita, Kan., and Entergy, a utility and power company in New Orleans -- is typical for this Wall Street of the Southwest. It is packed with casually dressed traders scanning computer screens, statistical charts, weather maps and electronic tickers pegged to the world's energy markets.
They arrive as early as 6 a.m. to read the financial tea leaves and trade power and natural gas in a burgeoning market that Enron virtually invented by aggressively pushing for deregulation in the 1990's.
In its simplest form, energy trading consists of buying a utility's excess power and selling it to another utility. But most of the trading is more complex, as utilities, power generators, banks and others seek to profit from, or hedge their bets on, shifting energy prices. 
If a fertilizer company, for example, has long-term contracts to sell its fertilizer at a fixed price, it might try to lock in long-term supplies of natural gas at, say, $5 a British thermal unit. But just in case the price drops to $2, giving some competitors the advantage of buying cheaper gas, it might buy put options, which would pay like an insurance plan.
A typical transaction could involve a chain of trades connecting 10 or more parties. So Company A sells power for delivery next month to Company B, which in turns sells it to Company C, which also hedges against the high price by making a deal with Company D. And on and on, with the trading firm taking a commission every step of the way.
In the old days -- before Enron and its allies pushed in the 1980's and 90's to deregulate first the natural gas supply business and then the electricity generation industry -- there were fewer risks to hedge against, and profits were based on government fiat. 
"The old game was you incur a cost to your business and you'd have to get those costs approved by regulators," said Andre Meade, an energy analyst at Commerzbank Securities. "The new game is you decided to build a power plant, but you have to manage the risks over the cost of getting the gas supply to operate it.
"Now you have to assure that your income will cover the cost of your capital expenses and give you some earnings," Mr. Meade said. "So when prices are in your favor, you try to lock them in. You can forecast power for 30 years, but everyone knows you're going to be wrong."
A huge share of the energy trading market involves speculation on the direction of energy prices, whether by utilities or the trading firms, analysts say. 
At Entergy-Koch, speculative trading accounts for up to 70 percent of the volume. To speculate, energy trading companies have amassed teams of analysts, traders, statisticians and even meteorologists, hoping to outsmart other market participants and take advantage of volatility in the prices of power and natural gas.
"We've taken on a Wall Street model," says David Sobotka, the president of Entergy-Koch and a former Wall Street executive. "We have a trading arm, a sales arm and an analytical side."
Energy trading has become so important to Houston that a new breed of wildcatter has shown up in the region in recent years -- freshly minted M.B.A.'s, Wall Street traders like Mr. Sobotka and mathematical wizards who had not seen a place for themselves in the traditional oil and gas business. Colleges in the area, including Rice University, the University of Houston and Texas A&M, have developed energy trading centers with big grants from companies like Enron and Reliant Energy.
With Enron in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, there are worries about whether the market it pioneered will continue to thrive. Most industry experts say it will.
"It's clearly viable," says Mr. Meade at Commerzbank Securities. "Enron didn't collapse because of energy trading. It took the good money it made in energy trading and invested in broadband, water, pulp and overleveraged its business. If they had only stuck to energy trading and marketing, they would have been a viable company today."
At Entergy-Koch, business has slowed with the economy. But Ms. Beckett is still getting up at 4:30 a.m. to commute to the trading floor. Arriving at the office, she sits down at her bay of computers, logs onto weather.com and, for good measure, engages in online chat with her company's meteorologist, who sits a few rows away.
Today's forecast: 54 degrees in Chicago, unseasonably warm. She expects a slow day, but this morning, the trades are going her way.
"I've sold a lot," she says, fidgeting. "I'm just waiting for the price of this one to get up to 35."

HEADLINE: De Niro Plans a TriBeCa Film Festival to Help Lift Spirits Downtown 

BYLINE:  By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
Robert De Niro and the film producer Jane Rosenthal say they are ready to start a film festival in their neighborhood, TriBeCa, an event intended to bring some economic and emotional relief to the beleaguered southern tip of Manhattan.
 Their TriBeCa Film Festival is to begin on May 1 with about 40 world premieres of independent and studio films, which will be eligible for jury awards, said Ms. Rosenthal, who founded TriBeCa Productions with Mr. De Niro in 1988. The films have not yet been chosen. The festival, which is to run for four days, had long been in development, she said, but was accelerated after the Sept. 11 attacks immediately turned much of TriBeCa into a ghost town. 
 Mr. De Niro and Ms. Rosenthal's effort has attracted some high-profile supporters with strong New York roots, including Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax Films; Jeffrey Katzenberg, a founder of DreamWorks; and the director Martin Scorcese.
"We'd been thinking about doing a film festival for a long time that reflected the fabric of the neighborhood," Ms. Rosenthal said. "Then when Sept. 11 hit, our neighborhood was devastated by those attacks. We both felt we could do something that would help rebuild the vitality of Lower Manhattan."
That has not been an easy task. Cultural institutions and restaurants south of 14th Street have been particularly hard hit in the aftermath of the attacks, with patronage falling off steeply in neighborhoods nearest to the World Trade Center. 
Mr. De Niro's connection with the neighborhood, where he lives, is particularly strong. In addition to his film company, which has produced recent hits like "Meet the Parents" and "Analyze This," Mr. De Niro also opened the TriBeCa Film Center, which houses more than a dozen film companies, in an old coffee warehouse in 1990. He opened the TriBeCa Grill the same year in the same building with the restaurateur Drew Nieporent. 
The festival also has the backing of Gov. George E. Pataki and Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, who said yesterday that his organization would help promote the festival through its "I <heart> New York" campaign in addition to offering logistical support. 
"Anything that brings some economy into New York, we're behind," Mr. Gargano said, adding that the festival would be especially welcome because it "is right in the World Trade Center area, and it's very important to show confidence in that area."
Details of the festival are still coming together, but it stands to be fairly ambitious. In addition to the 40 feature-length films, the festival is to offer about 20 original short films, as well as entries in documentary and student categories. While the TriBeCa Film Center will likely act as festival headquarters, screenings are to take place all over the neighborhood, as well as farther downtown. Plans are also under way for a day of panel discussions and a free outdoor screening. 
The festival's executive director is to be Trina Wyatt, the chief executive of TriBeCa Entertainment, the umbrella organization of Mr. De Niro and Ms. Rosenthal's production company. Selections will be chosen by a jury, not yet chosen, of New York film professionals; submissions will be accepted as of March 1. The festival is to be open to the public, though organizers have yet to set ticket prices or expectations for attendance. 
The festival is establishing a Web site, www.tribecafilmfestival.com, which is still under construction.
Some of the films in the festival could well deal directly with Sept. 11, said the organizers, in the form of home movies or shorts made since the attacks.
For Mr. De Niro, whose decision to base his film company in TriBeCa is credited by many with jump-starting the neighborhood's growth, the festival is a chance to give back. 
"This was not only an experience in my neighborhood, but an experience in my city and my country," Mr. De Niro said in a telephone interview. "It's just a way of helping, you know."

HEADLINE: Giuliani to Negotiate With Council Over New, Lower Budget 

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW and MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration agreed last night to negotiate with the City Council over $766 million in the current year's budget of $38 billion, after Council leaders threatened to vote down the package outright unless the mayor compromised. 
 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose budget proposal included cutbacks in programs for women, children and the elderly whose financing had already been approved by the Council, must now give the Council some alternate proposals for reductions. Because the Giuliani budget proposal is a modification to the current fiscal year budget, the 51-member Council would have to approve the entire package before the end of its term Dec. 31, with no line-item vetoes. 
 Before the administration agreed to re-examine the budget proposal, part of a plan to close the $1.2 billion budget gap left by the Sept. 11 terrorist attack and a drooping national economy, Council members had said the package was unacceptable. The reductions included deep cuts in some current and planned programs, like library programs, child care, mental health services for the elderly and school maintenance, as well as savings that various city agencies said they could achieve through more technical budget alterations. 
"We look forward to working with the administration," said a Council spokesman, Jordan Barowitz. 
Details of Mr. Giuliani's budget plan, which reflected a list of possible cuts and savings submitted to him from most city agencies and was handed to the City Council Tuesday night, emerged yesterday.
The mayor plans to resubmit his proposal to the Council next Tuesday, officials said yesterday, and the Council would then have 30 days to approve it. However, because both the mayor and many of the Council members are leaving office at the end of this month, it is likely the Council will vote on the proposal by Dec. 31. 
Mr. Giuliani's budget proposal reflected a 15-percent budget reduction to most city agencies, except uniformed forces. There were some exceptions, including the Board of Education, which is facing a 2.5 percent reduction, and the city library system, facing a 10 percent reduction. More details of Mr. Giuliani's plan, which was handed to the City Council Tuesday night, emerged yesterday. 
It is unclear how many of those programs will survive the budget negotiations, but officials with several city agencies said they had scoured their budgets for savings and trims and in some cases were not sure where else to look. 
Among the proposed reductions that stirred the most criticism from the Council yesterday were eliminating a $5 million program to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs and a $3.5 million program to place social workers in 68 centers for the elderly. Both programs had been financed by the City Council but had not begun. The mayor's plan would also cut $2.2 million from an infant mortality prevention program in the city's 10 poorest areas and reduce by half a $5 million H.I.V. prevention program. 
It would cut $1.2 million for extra garbage collections in crowded residential neighborhoods, and $2.1 million from a public education campaign on how to dispose of garbage. It would eliminate a program to take mentally retarded children to the parks and cut a program that trains residents to prune trees on city streets.
The plan would cut $9 million from the City University of New York, scaling back several scholarship programs, including one that cut tuition in half for two years for students who graduate from high school with a B average or better.
The Board of Education would face $1 million in cuts to a program that pays to put two teachers in overcrowded middle-school classes in some of the city's most troubled schools, as well as a $20 million cut in a maintenance program that includes painting classrooms, replacing curtains in auditoriums and replacing light fixtures.
But school officials said the board would not eliminate the middle-school teacher program, under way since September, and would instead find another source for the $1 million.
Under the mayor's plan, the Department of Cultural Affairs would face a $15 million reduction. 
A plan to expand subsidized day care, adding up to 10,000 children on a waiting list, would be dropped under the proposal, which would eliminate $119 million from the Administration for Children's Services, an agency that was facing one of the steepest cuts. Several after-school programs would also be eliminated.

HEADLINE: The Forest, the Trees And the Gas Below; 
Finger Lakes Residents Debate Plan For Drilling on National Woodlands

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: HECTOR, N.Y. 

 BODY:
A quilt of forgotten apple orchards and tangled pastures, the Finger Lakes National Forest, the only national forest in New York, is an anonymous 25 square miles in the lush woodlands upstate, and a speck compared with the vast acres of wilderness in the West.
 Yet over the last year, the national forest and villages around it, like Hector, have been engulfed by the same disputes about opening federal lands to oil and natural gas drilling that have swirled around places like Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
 Several companies seek to tap the estimated 16 billion cubic feet of gas below the Finger Lakes forest -- a small reservoir that could, according to the United States Forest Service, provide energy for 20 years to the 33,000 residents of Seneca County, where part of the forest lies.
Congress recently approved a one-year moratorium on drilling here, but the Forest Service, which favors limited drilling, is proceeding with an environmental study and expects to decide within the next two weeks whether the forest should eventually be opened to gas production.
Opponents of gas drilling here worry the reprieve will be fleeting. Rising tension in the Middle East has stirred enthusiasm about developing domestic energy reserves. 
"They've taken advantage of the fervor of patriotism and giving the president the chance to do what he wants," said Irene Brown, a former Hector Town Board member and an opponent of drilling. "I don't like the decision personally," she said of the temporary moratorium, "but we have to face reality." She said she would have preferred an outright ban.
The debate over economic gain versus environmental good has sheared through Seneca and Schuyler Counties, among the poorest in New York and home to the national forest. Many New York officials have protested, including Gov. E. George Pataki, a Republican; Senators Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, both Democrats; several members of Congress and hundreds of local residents. But other townspeople quietly say that many would welcome gas development as a potential source of jobs and taxes.
Opponents of drilling fear that limited drilling could expand to swallow much of the national forest. "Once the rights are handed over to private companies, once their foot is in the door, it's a pretty big foot," said John Compton, 29, a cabinetmaker here who is opposed to drilling.
Gas companies already produce natural gas in southwestern New York. But they are moving farther east, signing leases with landowners in Finger Lakes counties.
The Finger Lakes forest, which lies between Seneca and Cayuga Lakes, was patched together from farms the federal government bought in the 1930's. It was declared a national forest in 1986 at the urging of local residents, who fought a federal initiative to sell the land.
Yet as the dairy farms that supported Schuyler County for years now wither, many people are seeking new sources of income. "If you haven't noticed in your driving around here," said Louis Rosbaugh, a retiree who lives across a road from the forest and favors drilling, "this is Appalachia."
Opponents of drilling say the community, despite its poverty, lopsidedly favors preserving the forest. Most people who responded to the draft environmental impact statement were against drilling, said Chris Zimmer, a Forest Service ranger.
But conversations in offices and on farms, with people removed from the activism, suggest a more varied picture, marked by differences in class and origins. Jane Ike, the Schuyler County clerk, says she thinks many want drilling but are shy about speaking up, convinced that the government will do what it wishes. David Poyer, a Town Board member, says the discussion has been shaped by outsiders, like students and faculty members from nearby Cornell University in Ithaca and recent arrivals who rely on the growing tourism and wine businesses.
Of those opposed to drilling, Mr. Rosbaugh said, "their view is we don't want anything but a playground for the rich."
The difference may lie with the way people thought about the forest before drilling became an issue. For Mr. Rosbaugh, it is an unsightly wall of trees that obscure resources that could provide for his family.
For others, the forest is a dense weave of symbol and memory. One sunny afternoon, Mr. Compton stood at the edge of Teeter Pond and watched a blue heron rise from the water. Mr. Compton grew up by the forest, losing himself in it every day after school. He still explores the land restlessly and readily shares the small truths he gathers: that the lady-slipper, an antidote to itching, grows next to poison ivy and that cherry bark will always catch fire as kindling. And the forest's smallness, he said, makes it utterly fragile.
"The forest is only two miles wide," Mr. Compton said. "You can't come in here and do anything without a serious impact."
Yet drilling opponents have succeeded by arguing economics more than environment. Drilling advocates in the West assert that fossil fuel production on federal land creates revenues. But here, drilling opponents say, income to Schuyler County would be a pittance -- just 2 percent of the royalties -- and taxpayers would have to finance repairs to roads damaged by heavy trucks. Drilling proponents disagree but have apparently won few converts.
Businesses that could revive the local economy rely on the forest. Small vineyards unscroll downhill from the forest toward the edge of Seneca Lake. The spring water Richard Fiegel uses to make his chardonnay and pinot noir at the Silver Thread Winery is fed by the watershed of the national forest, and he is alarmed by the chemicals used in producing natural gas.
"Almost everybody acknowledges that drilling will happen on private land," Mr. Fiegel said, suggesting what many think is the best compromise. "And that way, more money will stay in the community."
The Forest Service and others argue that drilling in the northeastern part of the forest, which is mainly pasture, would be the best solution. But Mr. Zimmer conceded that under the Forest Service plan for limited drilling, the rest of the forest would still remain open to leasing and so, to drilling.
What drilling entails can be seen on Barney and Mary Broz's farm in Chemung County, about 20 miles southeast of the forest. On half an acre, there is a seven-foot-tall steel pipe that marks the gas well. A few yards away, the industrial jungle gym of the production unit, all tanks and pipes, heats the gas and separates it from fluid.
That fluid is siphoned away to a tank next to pits, lined with plastic and now covered with grass, holding the chemicals and shavings from drilling. From the production unit, the gas flows into a pipeline that vanishes downhill under a broad lawn between two copses. The trees scraped away to install the pipeline lie in a heap to the side.
Mr. Broz is pleased that long-fallow land might now bring income. But as he drives from his well to a neighbor's, looks at the crushed rocks on the ground and listens to the pipes clanging like an outsize radiator, he ponders what such changes would mean for the national forest.
"I don't know if the drilling would hurt the forest so much, but having swaths cut out of it would certainly mean it would be less beautiful," Mr. Broz said. "As we deplete the energy resources in the world, the question is, at what cost?"

HEADLINE: $25 Billion to Aid the Jobless Is Backed by House G.O.P. Leaders 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5 

 BODY:
House Republican leaders offered to spend about $25 billion to aid the unemployed today as the two main economic issues before Congress -- trade powers for the president and stimulating the domestic economy -- merged in furious end-of-session horse trading.
 Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Way and Means Committee, offered to support far more spending to aid jobless workers and help them pay for health care than Republicans favored as recently as October. Mr. Thomas also unveiled a separate measure, which he valued at over $2 billion, to aid workers who lose jobs because of imports or the attacks on Sept. 11. 
 The concessions, which were endorsed by House Republican leaders, were a late bid to lure crucial Democratic support for a bill to grant President Bush the authority to negotiate trade deals with minimal Congressional interference. The bill is scheduled to come before the full House on Thursday.
"If anyone didn't believe that we were ready to respond to those in need, this is clear evidence," Mr. Thomas said.
Whether or not the promise of increased welfare spending helps the chances of the trade bill, it may help bridge the gap between Republicans and Democrats on stimulating the slumping economy.
The Democratic-controlled Senate wants to spend far more money to help workers than the Republican-controlled House, but Mr. Thomas's proposals narrowed their differences considerably. Prospects for compromise on a stimulus plan also seemed to improve today when Senate Democrats edged closer to the Republican position on tax incentives for corporations.
Administration officials and top Republicans in the House have acknowledged that they lacked the votes to pass trade promotion authority, giving the president the right to negotiate trade agreements that Congress can approve or reject, but not amend.
But an administration official said today that supporters had come closer to "winning the war" after Mr. Thomas's proposals were unveiled and President Bush spent a second day lobbying Republicans and Democrats at the White House. 
The trade vote is shaping up as the biggest test of the Bush administration's economic priorities since Sept. 11. Mr. Bush and his top aides have argued that he must have enhanced trading powers to open markets around the world as an antidote to terrorism. The administration says America might not be able to participate in both global and regional negotiations to reduce trade barriers unless Congress cooperates.
Even some generally pro-trade Democrats, like Representative Adam Smith of Washington, say they are inclined to vote against granting trade powers to the president. They say Republicans have done too little to help workers who have lost their jobs because of the recession or increased competition from abroad.
Mr. Smith, who along with 25 other Democrats met with Mr. Thomas to discuss trade and worker welfare measures, said the "numbers were right" in Mr. Thomas's proposal today, but that he would not vote yes on the trade bill unless the House first passed more worker aid.
House leaders say they intend to vote on one aspect of worker aid, known as trade adjustment assistance, before the vote on trade authority on Thursday. But the bigger part of the stimulus spending measure is caught up in negotiations between the House and Senate.

HEADLINE: War on Terrorism Brings Plan To Cut Smithsonian Financing 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON with JAMES GLANZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5 

 BODY:
In a sign of its intention to pare spending to pay for the war on terrorism, the Bush administration has proposed substantial cuts in the Smithsonian Institution's budget, enraging scientists who said the reductions would effectively gut the institution's research capabilities.
 The White House Office of Management and Budget informed the Smithsonian last week that it wanted to hold the institution's budget next year to $470.2 million, a reduction of $27 million, or 5.4 percent. 
 Scientists within the Smithsonian and members of Congress said the budget plan would imperil three of the institution's crown jewels: its astrophysical observatory, its tropical research institute and its environmental research center. 
Under the plan, financing for all three research operations would be transferred to the National Science Foundation, which would decide how much, if any, money the institutes would receive. The proposed financing for the three agencies next year is $35.7 million. 
The White House budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., said last week that the administration would concentrate money on the war and domestic security in drawing up its next budget and would "make all the necessary adjustments in order to fund those new imperatives." 
The spending proposal for the Smithsonian -- and the likelihood that the administration will seek cuts in many other domestic programs -- is already drawing protests from Democrats. 
They said important programs are being squeezed because President Bush forced through a $1.35 trillion tax cut earlier this year. Democrats warned at the time that the tax cut passed that it would leave the government with no financial buffer should the economy deteriorate or the nation face an emergency.
"This would be pretty devastating for the Smithsonian," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California, who is a regent of the Smithsonian.
The administration proposal would provide $38.3 million in additional money to the Smithsonian for salaries and general expenses. But that increase would be more than offset by a $9.6 million cut in money for repairs and restorations, a $20 million cut in the construction budget and the plan to move financing for the three research institutes to the National Science Foundation.
A senior administration official said that aside from moving the scientific financing to another agency, the Smithsonian would actually receive a budget increase. The administration wanted to move financing for the scientific research to the National Science Foundation, the official said, because it has a strong reputation for allocating money to the most worthy projects. 
"The N.S.F. doesn't do museums," the official said, "and possibly the Smithsonian ought not to be dabbling in random research." 
Supporters of the Smithsonian on Capitol Hill said the cutbacks would force the Smithsonian to halt work on one of its most prominent projects, renovation of the old Patent Office Building in Washington, which is to be the new home of the museum's American art collection. 
David Umansky, the Smithsonian's director of communications, said the institution had appealed the administration's budget plan on Monday night. He declined to comment further.
The shift of research funds to the National Science Foundation would immediately affect about 250 scientists working at three Smithsonian scientific institutes.

HEADLINE: Private Security's Gain Is Public Safety's Loss, Police Say 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

 BODY:
It usually happens in the 14th-floor offices of the New York Police Department's second-highest-ranking official. Dozens of officers will stop by to say goodbye and "thank you," and to share a bit of news with the boss about life beyond the blue wall. 
 Joseph P. Dunne, the first deputy police commissioner and No. 2 official, said he was increasingly hearing officers of all ranks say they plan to trade in their badges for jobs in the security industry. In recent weeks, Mr. Dunne lost a detective, a lieutenant and a captain who work under him to security jobs. And he, too, after a storied, 32-year career, hopes to take his experience to a security-related job in a private business, one of the many that have been fervently courting him. 
 "I don't have numbers, but anecdotally, I have a sense there is a lot more recruiting from our ranks and a lot more people poaching into our agency, absolutely," Mr. Dunne said this week of some of the more than 2,000 officers who have retired so far this year. "I think they are being lured. I have spoken to many lieutenants and captains and people at those ranks who are being approached by people in the security business, and they are offering them jobs." 
In the Sept. 11 disaster that never seems to stop exacting its toll, one of the subtler but more serious losses is a consequence of the booming private security industry, which is draining the department of some of its most desirable workers: the serious, smart and experienced senior officers the city needs most in a crisis.
Michael R. Bloomberg, the mayor-elect, has been explicit about his concern over the latest threat to what he called the department's "best and brightest."
"I think the private sector is going to go after lots of members of the N.Y.P.D.," Mr. Bloomberg said shortly after his election. "Security is much more of a serious thing in the private sector. And one of my jobs is to try to retain as many as we possibly can."
Of course, the loss of senior police officials during a mayoral transition is typical, and the department has been hemorrhaging for months as scores of seasoned officers have left for a raft of reasons, including poor morale and the economic advantage of retiring after a year of unprecedented overtime.
But it appears clear that the heightened hunger for private protection in the aftermath of history's worst terrorist attacks is fueling the potentially destabilizing exodus.
Not all of the officers retiring en masse -- 30 a day on the darkest days -- are being extensively questioned about why they are leaving or where they are going. Thus no one can say for sure how many plan to take jobs with security companies or private enterprises that want to build up their security operations.
Nonetheless, some evidence is indisputable. A department supervisor who plays matchmaker between retired officers and security firms has been asked to provide hundreds of names to industry executives. Kroll Inc., a leading risk-consulting company with headquarters in New York that has always turned to the department for experienced help, has received hundreds of inquiries a week since Sept. 11 from companies suddenly nervous about security. 
And Richard (Bo) Dietl, who yesterday hired John F. Timoney, the former second in command of the New York police and current Philadelphia police commissioner, as his chief executive officer, has in the last two months hired more than 500 retired New York officers and detectives, at least 100 of whom put in retirement papers after Sept. 11, he said. So far this year, about 2,100 officers have retired, an 87 percent increase over retirements for the same period a year ago.
"The demand for the experienced, armed N.Y.P.D. officers and detectives is becoming more and more evident for corporate security, which is weaning away from the unarmed security guard," said Mr. Dietl, a retired New York detective perhaps best known for his 1988 autobiography, "One Tough Cop," who is chairman of Beau Dietl & Associates, a security investigation company on the East Side.
The list goes on. Michael Stapleton, who runs a specialized security firm in New York, has hired six officers from the elite bomb squad and the Emergency Service Unit since Sept. 11. And he is looking to hire more.
Lt. Stephen T. Collins, a Queens narcotics supervisor and 19-year veteran, formed Law Enforcement Second Careers Inc. in February to match officers with clients. He said that since Sept. 11, his phones had been ringing nonstop, both with security firms looking for experienced officers and with retiring officers looking for jobs.
"There is much more of a heightened awareness of the security field since Sept. 11," said Lieutenant Collins. "When the cops come in for their interviews with us they say, 'Well, there has to be more security jobs.' And the firms are looking for them because they have told us that."
Two security firms, Foreseeable Risk Analysis Center, with offices in New York, and EBS Consultants Ltd., based in Monroe, N.Y., recently asked Mr. Collins for the names of 300 officers willing to take security jobs at airports. Mr. Collins said the candidates would come from a database of 500 officers who attended a job fair he held in May. 
Also, Edward J. Bradley, the president of EBS, said he wanted Mr. Collins to provide up to 60 additional retired officers for jobs securing the electrical facilities owned by Orange and Rockland Utilities in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In the wake of Sept. 11, the utility has decided to use only retired officers and to pay them much higher entry-level salaries than a "low-bid contractor" would pay its guards, said Mr. Bradley, who is also a retired New York police officer.
"The utilities are high-profile targets if you think of it," Mr. Bradley said. "And you know what? You couldn't give a security guard the training a cop has in 20 years."
The path from law enforcement to private security is well worn. Demand has always been especially high for the top brass. Raymond W. Kelly, the police commissioner-designate, is himself leaving a job at Bear Stearns, where he is head of global security, to reclaim the job he left in January 1994.
But private security's reach seems to be going deeper into the ranks of the department's talent these days, many say.
Mr. Kelly, who cites the overtime earnings and their effect on retirement pensions as the main incentive for officers, has said he supports legislation that would allow police officers with at least 20 years of service to bank their annual benefit payments and stay on the job.
Part of the reason Mr. Timoney is leaving the public sector as of January, he said, is that there is a new level of importance for security directors in America. He said the pull of private security can be an alluring, if disruptive, factor for those in lower ranks as well.
"You don't mind bloodletting, that is fine, that is actually good," Mr. Timoney said of regular turnover at police departments. "But when you get hemorrhaging, it is not good. The issue is losing a lot of people all at the same time, really talented people, and the inability to replace them quickly enough. So it creates a major disruption within the organization."
Mr. Timoney then paused, took a breath and invoked the name of his friend Mr. Kelly.
"The good part is, you probably have the most qualified man in America to handle those things," he said. "If he can't handle them, nobody can."

HEADLINE: CHANGING THE GUARD: THE OVERVIEW; 
AOL TIME WARNER GETS A NEW CHIEF AS LEVIN DEPARTS

BYLINE:  By SETH SCHIESEL and GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
The chief executive of the world's biggest media company, AOL Time Warner, surprised his company and his industry yesterday by announcing that he would retire in May. The executive, Gerald M. Levin, will be replaced by his hand-picked successor, Richard D. Parsons, who will face the daunting job of making a merger conceived in the soaring Internet economy come of age during an economic slump for old-line and online media companies alike.
 News of the handoff comes less than a year after America Online acquired Time Warner in a $165 billion deal that was supposed to have created a behemoth capable of exploiting the growth of the Internet while remaining a powerhouse in film, television and magazines. 
 That strategy has had mixed results, as growth has slowed at the AOL online unit even as a recession in the advertising market has hit AOL Time Warner's magazines and television businesses. But yesterday's announcement was nonetheless a victory for Mr. Levin -- who had been chairman and chief executive of the former Time Warner -- to the extent that the change at the top answers the question of which company really took over which in the America Online-Time Warner merger. 
The takeover of Time Warner might not have even been possible if America Online's share price had not soared along with other Internet stocks in the late 90's. Only a few months after the deal was announced in January 2000 the Internet bubble popped, at which point it might have been Time Warner doing the acquiring. In any case, it is now Mr. Parsons, a former Time Warner executive, who will hold the top day-to-day job at the combined company.
Despite the implicit corporate politics, Mr. Levin said he had entirely personal reasons, at age 62, to turn over the company to his protege. "This is not some kind of corporate act," Mr. Levin said yesterday. "I must be destined to do additional things. So I pull the trigger and walk away from what is probably the best job in corporate America."
The executive who appeared to be Mr. Parsons's main rival for the chief executive job was Robert W. Pittman, who came from America Online. Mr. Pittman, who had been co-chief operating officer with Mr. Parsons, will now report to him as the company's sole chief operating officer.
Stephen M. Case, America Online's 43-year-old former chairman, will remain chairman of AOL Time Warner, where he primarily oversees the company's technology, policy and charitable operations, while leaving daily oversight of the company to the chief executive. Mr. Case said Mr. Parsons and Mr. Pittman had complementary skills that would "perfectly position the company for the next phase of growth."
At AOL Time Warner's far-flung divisions, which include the Warner Brothers film studio, the Time magazine empire, the CNN cable television operation and the AOL online service, executives and workers were generally positive about the planned transition.
Around the industry, competitors assessed the implications of Mr. Parsons's ascent. Mr. Parsons, 53, an African-American and a Republican with close ties to the White House who is known for his diplomatic skills inside and outside the business world, is considered well-equipped to handle the close political and regulatory scrutiny that his company attracts as the industry's dominant player.
The news of Mr. Parsons's appointment was perhaps not as surprising to many media executives and Wall Street professionals as the fact that Mr. Levin, at age 62, was voluntarily stepping aside -- or that the tough, driven Mr. Pittman, 47, was apparently willing to go along with the new pecking order.
Mr. Levin, a lawyer who had joined Time Inc. in 1972 and worked his way through a series of mergers and internal power struggles, is known as an obsessive worker, eager to spend hours toiling in his office on the 29th floor of the company's Manhattan headquarters. Few would have expected him to simply walk away now, and a company spokesman said there was no problem with Mr. Levin's health.
Mr. Levin said yesterday that the move had been months in the planning and was a decision he had actually been moving toward since 1997. 
That was the year his son Jonathan, a teacher at a high school in the Bronx, was murdered by a former student. At that point, Mr. Levin inserted a clause into his employment contract that allowed him to step down before his contract expired at the end of 2003, as long as he gave six months' notice.
Once the America Online-Time Warner deal was formally completed in January, Mr. Levin said, he turned in earnest to the task of preparing for his successor. Through last spring and summer, he said he discussed plans with the company's board to make Mr. Parsons chief executive and Mr. Pittman the chief operating officer overseeing all of the company's business units.
Mr. Levin said the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 had provided the final push to complete his retirement plans, which he did in a November meeting with the board's nominating committee. At that meeting, the committee, led by Fay Vincent, a former Major League Baseball commissioner, tentatively approved Mr. Levin's recommendations and his plan to step down at the company's annual meeting in May. The full board subsequently approved the plan. The six-month notification clause in his contract was the reason for announcing the decision yesterday.
"Sept. 11 I know has affected everybody," Mr. Levin said in an interview yesterday. "It's affected me very deeply because of the sudden violent death. It tears my heart out to see these widows and children. So it has affected me emotionally in ways that are quite profound.
"It's very hard to articulate, but these emotions have a lot to do with what I thought I was doing by having this provision," Mr. Levin said of his early retirement clause. "It's a sacred provision for me. I put it in because of my son."
Mr. Levin said that he planned to give speeches and perhaps write a novel after he retired. 
Many media executives said they had not expected Mr. Pittman to agree to report to his former corporate peer, Mr. Parsons. Mr. Pittman had been a highly visible and active executive at both America Online and AOL Time Warner, and he is widely viewed as exceedingly ambitious. Yesterday, several former Time Warner executives said that they could never believe that Mr. Pittman did not want to run AOL Time Warner himself. 
But in an interview yesterday, Mr. Pittman said that he had always kept his eye on the chief operating officer's job, a position that gives him considerable day-to-day influence and direct power over the company's divisions. The chief executive from each of the company's operating units will report to Mr. Pittman. Mr. Pittman, and so-called staff executives, like the chief financial officer, will report directly to Mr. Parsons.
"I definitely saw myself in the operating role," Mr. Pittman said. "It's the one I both like and think I'm most qualified for. Dick, I think, is probably more qualified for the C.E.O. role," he said, referring to Mr. Parsons.
Moreover, Mr. Pittman said that he had no interest in a job at another company or even in becoming chief executive of AOL Time Warner after Mr. Parsons.
"When Dick is ready to retire," he said, "I'll retire with Dick. I have no desire to be next at bat."
But it was not clear whether Mr. Pittman's preferences had any bearing on Mr. Levin's choosing Mr. Parsons. Yesterday, Mr. Levin said of Mr. Pittman, "He knew that I wanted them to work together." Mr. Pittman "could tell from my body language," what decision was coming, Mr. Levin added.
A financial industry executive who saw Mr. Pittman and Mr. Parsons walking down Fifth Avenue together earlier this week, before the moves were announced, said yesterday that he was struck by how well the two men seemed to get along.
If Mr. Parsons and Mr. Pittman are getting along, it may be because getting along is what Mr. Parsons is known for -- a man able to carefully pick his way through even the thorniest negotiations, using bonhomie and a shrewd sense of people.
"Dick has a people orientation, a political positioning, a way of his external presence," Mr. Levin said, adding that Mr. Pittman "is the best operating executive in the business. 
"The key for me in the last year and a half was to see if they could work together," Mr. Levin said.
Mr. Parsons, for his part, was self-deprecating in an interview yesterday.
"It sounds goofy and it sounds naive, but people want to be thought well of," he said. "If you give them the opportunity, their behavior will rise to their own expectation of self."
"Bob Pittman has insight into consumers, how they think, how they act, what they want, that for a company like ours that's focused on consumers, is invaluable," Mr. Parsons said. "And he's also a better operating guy than me by far. Bob likes to make the trains run on time."
One challenge facing Mr. Parsons and Mr. Pittman is that subscriber revenue growth at the AOL online unit has slowed in the recent quarter, raising the question of how aggressively that unit will continue to perform. 
According to the corporate strategy, the subscription businesses -- online service and cable television -- were to buffer the company from the vagaries of the advertising market on which magazines, for example, are dependent. Additionally the company is set to pay about $7 billion for the half of AOL Europe it does not own, and now Mr. Pittman must oversee that growth as well.
Moreover, AOL Time Warner, currently the nation's No. 2 cable company, is currently in the bidding to acquire all or part of AT&T Broadband, the biggest cable company in the land. If AOL Time Warner wins that contest, the company will have the challenge of selling the deal to regulators in Washington next year. If the company loses -- to Comcast, to Cox or to some variation of a partnership involving Microsoft -- it could find itself suddenly facing a much more formidable competitor in one of AOL Time Warner's core businesses.
But Mr. Levin expressed confidence in the team he will leave behind to grapple with such issues.
"It's not the fact that there was no HBO, no cable company, no Warner Communications, no AOL when I joined," he said. "For me, it's the people -- that we have these people in place. Why would I walk away from this job unless they were there?"

HEADLINE: U.S.-Canada Tomato War Heats Up 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON

DATELINE: TORONTO, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
Americans' appetite for tomatoes is turning out to be both a blessing and a curse for Jack van der Kooy. Five years ago, Mr. van der Kooy sold his family's dairy farm and used the proceeds to start growing tomatoes near Simcoe, Ontario, on the northern shore of Lake Erie. His company, SunChoice Produce, now has 3.5 acres of greenhouses producing more than 1.2 million pounds of tomatoes a year.
 SunChoice, and the Canadian tomato industry in general, have grown phenomenally since the mid-1990's, almost entirely because of burgeoning demand from the United States. And whenever flows of goods across the Canadian-American border begin to gather steam, it seems, trade disputes inevitably follow. 
 Responding to complaints from growers in Florida and Texas, the United States Commerce Department imposed heavy antidumping duties this fall on greenhouse tomatoes from Canada. One British Columbia grower must deal with a 34 percent tariff; most others face a 24 percent levy.
The tariff "is causing a lot of distress, to put it mildly," Mr. van der Kooy said.
Mention antidumping duties to any Canadian exporter, and you are likely to get an earful. Despite a bilateral free trade deal signed in 1988 and the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, which also includes Mexico, Canadian exporters say they are as troubled as ever by American protectionism in the form of antidumping actions.
"It's the soft underbelly of the Nafta," said Alan Alexandroff, a Toronto trade lawyer. "Notwithstanding efforts to bring about economic integration, it's galling that you still have these issues."
As Canadians see it, Washington uses antidumping and countervailing duties unfairly to hobble foreign goods that compete successfully against American products. In theory, antidumping duties are intended to penalize imports "dumped," or sold below the cost of production, while countervailing duties are supposed to offset subsidies provided by the exporter's government. But Canada and other nations say America often cries "dumping" on grounds that have more to do with politics than fair trade.
Not that Canada is above using antidumping measures itself. In fact, Canada has accused United States growers of dumping tomatoes -- field-grown ones this time -- in Canada. 
The United States-Canada trade relationship is the biggest in the world and rapidly growing. Canada now sends 85 percent of its exports to its southern neighbor. And its greenhouse tomatoes mirror the overall trend, with exports to the United States ballooning from 136 million pounds in 1998 to 224 million pounds last year, according to government figures. Canadian tomatoes have taken market share away from imports from Belgium, the Netherlands and elsewhere, and now command more than 43 percent of the market.
The Canadian government has argued for scrapping antidumping and countervailing duties in its trade deals, as they have been among members of the European Union. But Washington insists on retaining them, both within Nafta and in its trade dealings with the larger world through the World Trade Organization.
"Congress wouldn't stand for any watering down, and certainly not any elimination, of those protections," said William Ince, managing partner at Cameron & Hornbostel, a Washington law firm that has represented many Canadian exporters.
United States producers have filed dozens of complaints under Chapter 19 of the Nafta treaty, which spells out a procedure for adjudicating disputes over antidumping and countervailing duties. The complaints cover everything from raspberries to pork to steel.
One of the most intractable disputes involves softwood lumber, one of Canada's biggest exports to the United States. Twice this year, the Commerce Department has accused Canadian sawmills of unfair trade practices and imposed duties of 32 percent on their shipments. The Canadians say these actions have harmed an already weakening economy, forced mills to close and wiped out thousands of jobs, especially in British Columbia.
For their part, Canadian businesses have also filed numerous complaints against American imports.
As for Canadian tomatoes, the International Trade Commission, the United States body that rules on dumping complaints, concluded in May that "significant and increasing imports" were depressing prices in the United States and having "a significant adverse impact on the domestic industry." 
That hardly means they are guilty of dumping, the Canadians say. Rather, they say, they are being penalized for their success in improving efficiency and bringing down costs. "Fairness is just out of the window," said James Colasanti, a partner in Red Zoo Marketing, which has 50 acres under greenhouses in southwestern Ontario.
For example, Mr. Colasanti said, the cost of keeping tomato greenhouses cool in Texas and Florida is five times that of heating them in Ontario. And the market for greenhouse equipment is more competitive in Canada, saving growers money.
Mr. van der Kooy said that because almost his whole crop went to the United States, he could not survive for more than a few months if he sold there below his production costs, as his American rivals say he does.
Mr. Ince, the Washington lawyer, sees some good emerging from all the dumping disputes. Binational panels of experts set up to adjudicate them have generally been "more thorough and reasoned" than the International Trade Court, to which trade disputes are normally referred, he said. Furthermore, he said that growing cross-border investment might reduce the number of disputes in the future, as companies with interests in both countries "sort out their differences in some other way."
For the time being, though, Canada's tomato growers seem to see no alternative to an old-fashioned trade war. They have formed a Tomato Trade Alliance to defend themselves against the anti-dumping allegations in Washington, and to press their own complaints against low-priced American imports.
Bemoaning the expense of hiring a small army of lawyers, Denton Hoffman, general manager of Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Growers, an industry group based in Leamington, Ontario, said, "You get bigger, and all of a sudden people take shots at you."

HEADLINE: Guaranteed Profits: The Fiction of PensionAccounting 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
HERE'S one explanation for the rising stock market as 2001 nears an end: Some companies are locking in profits for next year by buying stocks this year.
If that sounds ridiculous, it is. Whether profits will be made on stocks bought now is unknowable. No reasonable accounting system would let you book profits just because you bought the stocks. 
 But we are not dealing with a reasonable accounting system. We are dealing with pension accounting, American style. The amount of expense, or profit, that companies report from their pension systems are not based on the actual profits earned by investments in the pension fund. Instead, companies report profits as if the pension investments earned what was assumed when the year began. 
 That's where the current buying comes from. Many companies assume they will make 9 percent or more on pension investments, with some forecasting more than 11 percent. With interest rates as low as they are now, they clearly can't make anything like that on investment-grade bonds, which make up a significant proportion of most pension portfolios. Adding more stocks is the only way to make such an optimistic number possibly believable. Otherwise, they would have to reduce the assumption -- and next year's reported profits.
Whether pension plans will earn those returns over the long term is debatable. They did better during the late 1990's bull market. Warren E. Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, says in the current issued of Fortune magazine that he would love to "make a large bet" that returns will be lower.
A survey by Bear Stearns shows that in 2000 the median company in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index assumed that its pension assets would earn 9.2 percent, with some much higher. In fact, the average return was 5 percent. 
That means corporate profits were overstated in 2000. If companies are assuming similar returns now, as Patricia McConnell, the Bear Stearns accounting guru, says is likely, there are more overstatements this year.
Over the long run, corporate books will show the reality of what the pension plans really earn. But with the various smoothing mechanisms built into the accounting rule, that can take decades. By then, the bosses making the current optimistic assumptions will have collected bonuses based on those assumptions and retired.
"It's a coming flash point in accounting," Thomas E. Jones, the vice chairman of the International Accounting Standards Board and a retired executive vice president of Citicorp, said this week. "We're kidding ourselves" by reporting results under the American rule, he added.
This is a case where accounting clearly does affect behavior. In Britain, a new accounting rule forces companies to show the actual results of their pension plan investments. Boots, a big drugstore chain, responded by selling all the stocks in its pension plans. 
A new international rule would probably require companies to show actual returns on their pension fund investments, although the returns would be reported on a different line from operating profits.
Opponents will say that would discourage stock market investments and therefore reduce long-term returns for the funds. But if companies believe that stocks are good investments, they should be willing to report the real results and to explain to investors why the risks are worth taking. There is no good reason to report fictional profits.

HEADLINE: Japanese Consumers Revel In Deflation's Silver Lining 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
In a country once better known for its $10 melons and $100 steaks, McDonald's now sells hamburgers here for 52 cents, a new discount chain offers eyeglasses for $40, and clothing stores compete to sell fleece jackets for $8, down from $25 two years ago. Meanwhile, men's suits, the sober uniform of the Japanese salary man, are the prize in a heated price war, putting imports from China and North Korea on store racks for as little as $72.
 With cheap prices Japan's new mantra, 5,000 people lined up recently outside a 15-story discount mall in Osaka, eagerly awaiting the grand opening. In Gotemba, 55 miles west of Tokyo, the 82-store Premium Outlets mall has proved so popular that the owners plan to open six to eight more soon across Japan. 
 For nearly three years, Japan has been in the grip of deflation, a broad and potentially devastating drop in the prices of goods and services that many economists see as the greatest threat to Japan's hopes for pulling out of recession. 
As long as prices keep falling, experts say, many Japanese will hoard their cash and postpone purchases on all but essentials, making the current recession even worse. Companies are reluctant to invest and debts are becoming harder to manage.
But the dirty little secret here is that Japanese consumers are reveling in their newfound spending power, welcoming the chance to buy goods at prices similar to those they once found only on overseas shopping trips. "The key thing about deflation is that it is popular," said Robert A. Feldman, chief economist for Morgan Stanley Japan.
Indeed, in a survey conducted in September by the Bank of Japan, 45 percent of the respondents said falling prices were desirable. Only 18 percent said they were undesirable; the rest were undecided.
As Japan's long-closed economy lowers some dikes to a flood of cheap imported goods, this increased competition is finally driving many prices here toward rest-of-the-world levels. The introduction of modern, highly efficient retailing is also helping to cut prices to the bone.
The cost of living in Tokyo, long one of the world's most expensive cites, is finally moving closer to other places. In 1993, it cost roughly 43 percent more to live as well in Tokyo as in New York; last year, Tokyo's premium had shrunk to 22 percent.
Many economists, who long twitted Japan for its sky-high costs and uncompetitive domestic economy, see some positive benefits in the deflation that consumers have enjoyed here since early 1999.
"Most of Japanese deflation is good rather than bad," Peter Morgan, senior economist for HSBC Securities Japan, argued in a report issued late last month.
"Good" deflation, he said, reflects increased economic efficiency in making and distributing consumer products. "Bad" deflation, he contended, comes from reduced demand pulling down housing and land prices.
This year's official deflation rate is running around 0.7 percent, although many economists say it is really at least twice as much. Last year, the government reported, food prices fell 2.5 percent, clothing prices dropped 5 percent and computers were 6.5 percent cheaper.
"Deflation is why Japanese consumption doesn't fall off the cliff," said Tetsufumi Yamakawa, chief economist for Goldman Sachs Japan. "Consumers are huge winners; they are not losers."
Leading the charge toward lower prices is the chain of 100 Yen Plaza stores, which has mushroomed to more than 2,000 outlets. As many as 40,000 items -- everything from plastic Santas to TV dinners to false eyelashes -- sell there for 100 yen, or 80 cents, each.
Started in 1990, the 100 Yen chain has boomed through Japan's decade-long stagnation, taking advantage of the new bargain-hunting mood to reach sales last year of $1.64 billion, the equivalent of 2 billion 100 yen coins. Negotiating directly with manufacturers, ordering in huge lots, controlling its own warehouses, and importing heavily from China, the chain manages to offer a wide variety of goods for one low price.
On the ground floor of one store here, Hideyuki Kimura, a Japanese chef living in Rome, was working his way down a list his girlfriend had prepared. "In Italy, they have 1,000 lira stores," he said, already having put a radish grater, a soup spoon and a towel rack in his shopping basket, "but the choice and quality is much better here."
The founder of 100 Yen stores is Hirotake Yano, a failed fish merchant, whose chain was recently ranked by one magazine as second in customer satisfaction, behind Tokyo Disneyland.
Mr. Yano is one of several heroes in a battle to give Japanese consumers access to goods at prices that Americans have long taken for granted. In contrast to the lifetime employment stereotype of Japanese executives, many of these entrepreneurs have fallen flat on their faces with early bankruptcies, only to pick themselves up and try again.
Teruhiro Ueno, for example, failed on his first try to bring discount eyewear to Japan but now owns Zoff, a chain that sells fashionable eyeglasses at three simple prices: $40, $56 and $73.
Best known here is probably Yanai Tadashi, president of Fast Retailing, who aggressively turned to China to supply his Uniqlo brand, transforming his father's clothing store into Japan's largest discount apparel chain, with about 500 stores.
When a business magazine asked him if he was hurting Japan by importing clothes, he retorted: "Consumers who previously spent 10,000 yen for clothes pay only 2,000 to 3,000 yen if they buy Uniqlo. Doesn't that make them better off?"
Largely fueled by imports, falling clothing and food prices are responsible for 70 percent of Japan's deflation in 2000, according to HSBC.
"I can buy my clothes cheaper in Tokyo now than in Toronto," said Paul Baylis, a Canadian journalist. 
Overseas travel originally exposed Japanese consumers to the forbidden fruit of low prices. Last year, 17 million, or roughly 15 percent of all Japanese adults, traveled overseas.
But with price deflation at home, fewer travelers are returning with bags stuffed with foreign goods. Last month, Kae Tokor, a Tokyo coffee shop worker, returned from a two-week vacation in the western United States. There, she limited her purchases to one fanny pack.
"Before Japanese tourists rushed to the U.S. to buy things at much cheaper prices," Ms. Tokor said at a Uniqlo in the Shibuya neighborhood. "Nowadays, I feel prices in Japan are going down and America is no longer cheaper."
Deflation's front lines are clearly evident in what newspapers here call the cheap suit battle.
In a back and forth between supermarket giants, men's suits have retailed for as little as $66. Currently, Daiei has fixed its price at $72, vowing to sell 300,000 this year, or one for every 200 Japanese men.
Other efficiencies are being gained through deregulation. After the government stopped stipulating minimum air fares, ticket prices drifted down to American levels. When the government dismantled gasoline import controls, prices fell, too. 
But most of the savings are occurring in bare-knuckle price competition long considered unseemly here. After McDonald's cut its weekday hamburger price in half, to 52 cents, sales surged from 250,000 a day to 1.25 million. Taking up the challenge, a local competitor, Yoishinoya, cut the price of its standard beef and rice bowl to $2.26, well below the prices it charges in its American outlets.
Yet as Japanese businesses battle to bring their domestic prices down, economists worry about deflation's downside. With interest rates near zero and Japan's central bank reluctant to pour more cash into the banking system, monetary policy appears powerless to jump-start growth. Many people simply store cash at home, depriving the economy of its lifeblood.
Deflation is also squeezing the government, depressing tax receipts even as its debt load becomes effectively heavier. Explaining its recent decision to downgrade Japan's domestic debt rating, Vincent Truglia, managing director of sovereign risk at Moody's Investors Service, said, "There is little reason to expect a major shift in deflationary pressure in Japan."
Rents and housing prices, which reached outlandish levels in the late 1980's, continue to fall in most of Japan.
In what may be deflation's cruelest toll, many Japanese now make payments on home mortgages that are far bigger than the diminished values of their houses.
And with prices still drifting downward, consumers may welcome the decline but they are also waiting for even better bargains, adding to Japan's economic woes.
"Deflation means that a lot of people stay out of the market," said Mark Fields, president of Mazda Motor, "because they think, "Next month, it's going to be cheaper.' "

HEADLINE: In Iran, an Angry Generation Longs for Jobs, More Freedom and Power 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN

DATELINE: ISFAHAN, Iran 

 BODY:
In the Garden of the Eight Paradises, Samaneh and Pirouz are browsing at a book fair and watching their backs. As girlfriend and boyfriend -- terms they sputter nervously -- they are subject to the zeal of the Komiteh, or morals police, for being together without being engaged. 
 "I want more freedom," said Samaneh, a student of English translation who wears thick makeup and a smart trench coat, with her hair partly exposed. She wants more money, too, but believes her economic prospects are as dim as her dreams are grand. "If I want to travel to the United States, I will need lots of money for expenses," she said. She can barely afford a restaurant meal in Iran. 
 Mohsen Sadrai, 20, is also browsing books, trying to satisfy his love of learning here because he could not attend university. He is a metal worker who considers himself lucky to have a job, and he is angry. He describes being harassed by the security forces simply for gathering with his friends, and the hatred inside him gathers steam. 
"I must say that if not all, at least 90 percent of young people are unhappy," he said. "We have no freedom, no opportunity for work." His friends have turned to drugs; he has turned to smoking. "If we had a healthy freedom," he said, "we wouldn't have to do these things." 
Iran's youth seem to be living in a perpetual season of discontent, pessimistic about their economic futures, resentful of the Islamic government that came to power before many of them were born. Even many youths who describe themselves as personally religious say they see religious government as an unworkable oxymoron. 
But while young people here would seem to have the power to effect change themselves -- about two-thirds of the population is 30 or under -- for now they seem unlikely to reform a system they chafe against, let alone bring forth a new revolution. 
They may have helped propel a reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, to consecutive landslide election victories, but many of his ambitions -- and theirs -- have since been thwarted by the conservative clerics who continue to hold sway. 
Given the chokehold a minority has over power -- not least economic power -- they see real political change as the only hope. The frequently echoed sentiment about the religious government: "We never voted for this regime." 
At the same time, they fear repeating the bloody past, and they have been cowed by 20 years of repression, so much so that many fear speaking honestly if their full names are used. 
Still, their discontent rises. In ever greater numbers, they have poured into the streets after soccer matches to celebrate -- and to protest -- suggesting a coiled anger that may take little to unleash. Even in this city of famous mosques, they have chanted "death to the mullahs" and torn up pictures of the country's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 
The fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan also seems to have deepened their frustration -- and their sense that freedom is possible, if only someone will bring it. 
"We need the U.S. Army," one young man went so far as to say. "The Afghan people are very lucky." 
But given the Gordian knot that conservative clerics have tied around Iran's political structure, young people feel powerless. They have no leader -- many student leaders have been imprisoned or co-opted over the last two years. They have no real ideology -- other than an abstract desire for more freedom. 
While they do not remember, in most cases, the 1979 revolution, they lived through an eight-year war with Iraq, and so abhor violence more than they want change. They sometimes fear their traditionalist parents, on whom many must depend for income, as much as they fear the government. 
That fear of the government is strong. Just ask Samaneh, who still has the marks on her legs from where state-backed vigilantes beat her with chains for joining the soccer protests. 
The beating soured her on the antigovernment expatriates who, via satellite television, had urged young people to take to the streets. "They don't care about what happens here," she said. "They are using the excitement of young people for their own purposes." 
But she has soured, too, on President Khatami, who promised the rule of law and freedom of expression. While some restrictions have been loosened, Sameneh and others said they still awaited the real change he promised. 
"All the university students voted for him, because they thought they would have a bright future," she said. "Now they think he's just a puppet moved by the other one." She meant Ayatollah Khamenei, who controls the most powerful institutions: the judiciary, the military, the security forces and thus, many young people believe, Mr. Khatami. 
Reformists, who saw the young as their natural constituency, now worry about their disillusionment. 
"The strategy we have adopted is to avoid clashes" with the government, said Abdullah Ramezaanzadeh, one of Mr. Khatami's cabinet secretaries, "but it is hard to pursue that strategy in a society that is so young, that wants speed in change." 
The changes they want are clear: better economic prospects, more political freedom, an easing of religious restrictions. 
Iranian young people see themselves as overeducated and underemployed in an economy that is wary of foreign investment and is struggling to create jobs. The official unemployment rate is 13.8 percent, the true rate probably 20 percent. Mr. Khatami said recently that 42 percent of those trying to enter the work force each year could not find jobs. 
Placing their hopes on more education, young people study obsessively for the university entrance exam. Only about 200,000 of about 1.5 million applicants are accepted, and many of those slots are reserved for children of war victims and other special categories. 
Even being accepted often means being steered to a field where there are no jobs. "I will spend four years going to university, then I will graduate and sit home," said Khatereh, a 20-year-old geology student. 
Young people speak of the "three P's" -- three Persian words starting with P that mean money, connections and support -- as the only way to get work. And even those who do find work say the jobs are not good. Muhammad, 23, said he was an educated person with a job who did not earn enough to move out of his parents' home and in with his young wife, adding, "God help those with no education and no job." 
As a result, many young people are leaving to work or study in Canada, the United States or elsewhere and not returning. The "brain drain" has become a matter of serious concern, as many of those leaving are the best and brightest. Those educated people who left last year number 220,000 by some counts. 
Ayatollah Khamenei recently called the problem an example of "forgetting the responsibility toward national development and honor." Mr. Ramezaanzadeh, the cabinet secretary, called the exodus understandable. "We cannot expect people to have a political commitment to stay here when they can live better elsewhere," he said. 
Young people complain that the government's inattention to their economic problems is matched by overattention to political and religious control. 
"The youth have no freedom, no political freedom," said Maryam Baghani, 20, as she sat outside at the Khavaran Cultural Center in Tehran. "If they try to protest, they are arrested, tortured, and beaten. I think this regime proved that religion and the state are not compatible, that they don't work together, and it's time for them to be separated." 
A malaise hung over the center's outdoor plaza, where males and females, forbidden to socialize, lounged on opposite sides. "We can't even walk to the girls' side," said Ali Ahamadi, 18, a reminder that sexual frustration may play its own role in undermining the government's ability to maintain its hold. 
Nearby two young men sat in a lazy stupor. One, Mehrdad Amiri, 22, said he had a high school education, and had not worked in two years; his friend had not worked in six months. They had turned to drugs, they said, like many jobless youths. As Mr. Amiri matter-of-factly put it, "When you have nothing to do, you do drugs." 
For some, hashish; for others, a prince. Searching for a savior, some young people have settled on the Shah's exiled son, Reza Pahlavi. Aziz Ayoub, 19, had heard Mr. Pahlavi talking about democracy via satellite television, and said he made "a lot of sense. We need a leader right now, and he's the only leader we have," Mr. Ayoub said. "People are fed up with this regime. They don't want a religious government anymore." 
A striking number of young people described religion as a tool of repression. Saideh Khoshkoo, a 19-year-old actress, said that when she applies for acting jobs, she is told to tone down her makeup, cover all her hair, wear a longer coat: "They make such interference into people's personal lives. It disgusts me." 
Religion should come from inside, she said: "If we are doing anything that makes God unhappy, we are responsible to God. I think Islam has become mixed with what people wear, and what people wear has become an instrument for some to rule others." 
At the shopping mall where Mohammedreza Jamshidi, 22, works, security forces come to make sure no neckties, a sign of Western influence, are put on the mannequins. No wonder, he said, that given a chance to break free, as with the soccer celebrations, young people did: "It's as though we are getting out of prison." 
But ask young people how the system will change, and the answer is a blank stare. They see neither their votes as power enough, nor any other hope. 
At a shopping mall in affluent North Tehran, two university students whispered their grievances, but pointed out that when their parents had overthrown the shah, the result had been far worse. 
Twenty years of Islamic rule, which had emboldened neighbors to comment on others' morality, also meant that people no longer trusted one other enough to unite.
And they were afraid. "The clerics don't have mercy on each other," said one, offering the example of Ayatollah Hosein-Ali Montazeri, a cleric who has been put under house arrest for criticizing the government. "Why would they have mercy on us?"

HEADLINE: The Big City; 
Warming Up To the Notion Of Warming

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
IF you've been enjoying 72-degree weather in December, you may appreciate Robert O. Mendelsohn's new analysis of global warming. He, too, concludes that it's not such a bad deal for New York.
 Global warming has been the most notorious environmental menace since the summer of 1988, which was so miserably hot in New York and Washington that the resident journalists looked for a villain. The greenhouse effect made front-page news and the cover of Newsweek. "Danger: More Hot Summers Ahead," warned the cover, which showed a family sweating profusely inside a glass dome amid a cracked, parched plain. 
 But there's another side to global warming, even if the recent weather hasn't inspired a cover story headlined, "Good News: More Pleasant Autumns Ahead." Warmer weather is not something that Americans dread -- to the contrary, people and businesses have been migrating south. They apparently see benefits to climate change, and so does Dr. Mendelsohn, an economist at the Yale University School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.
He is the editor of a new book, "Global Warming and the American Economy" (Edward Elgar Publishing), featuring detailed projections by economists and climate scientists. The bottom line is that the economic benefits of global warming seem likely to slightly outweigh the overall costs in America, and that Northerners will especially benefit. The best guess, which assumes a four-degrees-Fahrenheit rise in temperature and a one-foot rise in sea level over the next century, is that the net annual benefit will be $20 billion. 
"Scientists originally thought there were going to be horrific results from climate change, but we're not seeing that," Dr. Mendelsohn said. 
The biggest beneficiaries will be farmers, who will have longer growing seasons and crops that grow faster, thanks to the extra carbon in the air. "Crops will move north," Dr. Mendelsohn said. "It will be easier to grow food in Connecticut, and New Jersey will have fresh vegetables longer. You could have tree plantations of Southern pine in the mid-Atlantic region."
Some maple trees might leave southern New England, which would be a noticeable loss in foliage season. "There will be changes that offend people," Dr. Mendelsohn said. "But it appears that they will be more gentle than we thought. Scientists had feared that we'd go from some intact forests to moonscapes, but that's not likely to happen. We'll go from one type of ecosystem to another, which for most people will not be that dramatic."
For Northerners, the savings in heating bills will offset the higher air-conditioning bills in the summer, Dr. Mendelsohn said, but Southerners will see their energy costs increase. Southern coastal dwellers will be more affected by the sea-level rise because there's more low-lying land in the South. Northern skiers will have their own problems.
"SKIING in New York State will undoubtedly be worse," Dr. Mendelsohn said. "But in fact, most outdoor recreation happens in the summer, so there would be a large increase in outdoor recreation from global warming. More people would be hiking and playing golf all fall, as they did this year."
There's no way, of course, to put a dollar figure on some effects of global warming, like the loss of species or the pain people feel on being dislocated. Most Americans would probably prefer not to see any change in the climate, and Dr. Mendelsohn is sympathetic to their view.
"If it were cheap to do, I'd keep the climate constant," he said. "But it's not cheap. For every dollar we spend on mitigation, at most we would get 10 cents back, and it could only be 1 cent. To me, it looks like a very bad investment. I'd rather spend the money on programs today to cut pollution, improve public health and establish zones for protecting biodiversity. We'd get larger benefits, and we wouldn't have to wait 100 years for them."
In other work, Dr. Mendelsohn has found that the worldwide economic costs and benefits of climate change would roughly balance out. Again, most of the benefits would be in the North, while farmers in the tropics would suffer.
"There's a definite inequity," Dr. Mendelsohn said. "The losers are the poor tropical countries, not the rich industrialized countries that have done the most polluting. Even if it's not worth trying to stop this climate change, I think we have a responsibility to make things right for the tropical countries. We should be helping them right now to develop economically. The more developed they are, the better they can adapt."

HEADLINE: Bridging a Collegiate Gulf; 
Hugs and Pledges of Unity for Columbia and N.Y.U.

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
When Lee C. Bollinger, who is to be the next president of Columbia University, walked through the door of a private Manhattan club last week, John Sexton, the next president of New York University, was there to greet him. Mr. Sexton bounded over, knelt down and grabbed Mr. Bollinger's hand as a sign of respect. Then he gave Mr. Bollinger one of his trademark hugs. Mr. Bollinger, a more measured man, eyed his hugger warily, and then grinned. He was willing to be friends.
 Although the two universities are less than six miles apart, in some ways, the distance might as well be 600 miles. Their professors socialize. Their graduate students cross-register. But their top officials tend not to be buddies. Think of Macy's and Gimbels, or the Mets and the Yankees. 
 John Brademas, N.Y.U.'s president from 1981 to 1991, said that he and Michael I. Sovern, his counterpart at Columbia, met more often in Washington than in New York. Martin Lipton, chairman of N.Y.U.'s board of trustees, put the matter bluntly: "I think Columbia has essentially disdained N.Y.U. over the years," he said. 
That frost may be about to thaw. Last week, the incoming presidents of both universities pledged more cooperation. Although they were short on specifics -- neither takes office for six or seven months -- they said that closer collaboration could benefit New York City, society and themselves. 
"It would be sinful not to seize the opportunity to be cooperative rather than competitive," Mr. Sexton declared in a joint interview. 
He said that if both schools were competing for the same top professor and N.Y.U. lost out, he would rather have the professor at Columbia -- to add to the intellectual capital of New York and help attract other intellectuals -- than in Colorado or California. "It is not a zero sum game," he said.
Mr. Bollinger pointed to the Boston area, where Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology run joint programs in the health sciences and in real estate, and California, which has created a whole system of top-rated research universities, as examples of regions where having cooperative universities works for everyone. 
The timing for a stronger alliance may be auspicious. Historically, the two universities have operated on different tracks. Columbia was the elite, national Ivy League institution, N.Y.U. the local commuter school. 
But now N.Y.U. has built itself into a highly competitive university and is drawing closer to Columbia in its selectivity. Last year it received 30,750 applications for about 3,000 seats in its first-year class while Columbia received 16,559 applications for about 1,300 spots. The average SAT score for Columbia's admitted students was about 1,430, compared with 1,357 at N.Y.U. 
While Columbia and N.Y.U. do not compete significantly for undergraduates at this point, they do sometimes compete for faculty, as when they found themselves tussling over the historian Linda Gordon a while ago. (She went to N.Y.U.) Columbia has an engineering school, while N.Y.U. does not, but their law schools and medical schools are clear rivals. And while N.Y.U.'s Tisch School of the Arts is one of the most prestigious in the United States, Columbia's film program is also beginning to make a name for itself.
The weakening economy could give the universities a greater incentive to team up. Mr. Bollinger suggested two disparate opportunities: the acquisition of sophisticated research equipment and working with cultural groups like Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company.
"In the coming years, New York City will have many many questions that need answering," Mr. Bollinger said, suggesting that the universities might serve as clearinghouses, finding useful people and bringing them together for ideas on how to help.
The occasion for the unusual amity was a kind of coming out party for the two presidents-elect sponsored by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, an association of scholars, artists, business executives and others based in Cambridge, Mass. The meeting drew nearly 200 curious members of the academy and guests, eager for a chance to size up the two newcomers.
Professors at the gathering generally applauded the idea of togetherness, although some expressed doubts that it would continue once the two men took office. "I think there was general skepticism about how long this love fest will go on," said one professor. 
But a public university official who did not attend the meeting expressed concern that the two private universities might indeed team up to lobby for more state aid at the expense of the public universities. 
If closer ties are possible, Mr. Sexton and Mr. Bollinger would seem strong candidates; they have a surprising amount in common. Both graduated from Ivy League law schools -- Mr. Sexton from Harvard and Mr. Bollinger from Columbia. Both clerked at the Supreme Court for Chief Justice Warren E. Burger (and were noticeably to the left of him). Both were law school deans, Mr. Sexton at N.Y.U. and Mr. Bollinger at the University of Michigan, where he is now president. And both teach undergraduate courses.
Perhaps the most important similarity is their shared conviction about the importance of being open to outside views. It is the principle that drove Mr. Bollinger to be a foreign exchange student in Brazil during high school and to defend affirmative action at Michigan. And it is one of the principles behind Mr. Sexton's global law program, which has brought a constant flow of legal experts from around the world to be visiting professors.
Despite these commonalities, the two men differ sharply in style. Mr. Bollinger is smoother, both more polished and more reticent. Mr. Sexton is more pastoral, a genial salesman ready to embrace everyone and make them comfortable.
At the meeting last week, Mr. Sexton talked of how he admired Mr. Bollinger. He said that he had served on a peer review panel to assess the University of Michigan Law School when Mr. Bollinger was still dean there. Mr. Sexton said that after reading the school's self-study, he concluded that "my life will be worthless because what I want to create was already here."
"Of course, the idealized version wasn't there," he added, as the audience chuckled, "but the idealized dean was, in Lee Bollinger."
Mr. Bollinger, who discussed his legal battles in defense of affirmative action and other issues in higher education, returned Mr. Sexton's compliments. He assured the audience that Mr. Sexton was wonderful and irrepressible and that his modesty was overstated.
"Clearly it is a good thing to have competition, because it is very stimulating," Mr. Bollinger said. "On the other hand, we also have to find ways to work together, and that is the role of the university president and the deans."
Not everyone believes that the notion of greater cooperation is far-fetched. Thomas Bender, an N.Y.U. historian and author of "New York Intellect: A History of Intellectual Life in New York City, from 1750 to the Beginnings of Our Own Time" (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988), suggests that not only are there opportunities, but there are also precedents. 
Just look at Cambridge, Mass., he said. "M.I.T. and Harvard have cooperated for years."

HEADLINE: Newest Data Bolster Hopes For a Rebound 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
The number of workers filing new claims for state unemployment benefits fell for the fifth week in the last six and business equipment orders rose in October for the first time since January, signs the economy is beginning a rebound.
 First-time jobless claims fell to 475,000 in the week ended Saturday from 493,000 the previous week, the Labor Department said. 
Claims have fallen since surging to a nine-year high in the last week of September, when the terrorist attacks caused job cuts. Factory orders rose 7.1 percent in October, reflecting a jump in bookings for computers, automobiles and weapons, the Commerce Department said. 
 The reports reinforce other evidence of a rebound. Business at service companies expanded in November, consumer spending surged a record 2.9 percent in October, and construction spending unexpectedly increased that month, government and industry figures show.
Still, the level of claims suggests unemployment will keep rising in coming months. The government is expected to report on Friday that the jobless rate rose in November to 5.6 percent, a five-and-a-half-year high.
In a separate report, the Labor Department revised down the gain in worker productivity for the third quarter. The measure of how much an employee produces for each hour worked rose at a 1.5 percent annual rate from July to September, compared with 2.7 percent reported last month. Productivity grew at a 2.1 percent pace in the second quarter.
Factory orders are rebounding from the disruptions of the September terrorist attacks and after a decline in inventories encouraged some automakers and aircraft manufacturers to restock.

HEADLINE: Newark Airport Innovations Receive a Public Unveiling 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
In muted ceremonies, Newark International Airport today showcased two new features that had been scheduled for a grander unveiling until the terror attacks provoked a greater concern for airport security.
 One is a new rail-link station that connects New Jersey Transit commuter lines and Amtrak trains with a one-mile-long monorail spur leading into the airport's passenger terminals. Opened with no fanfare on Oct. 22 by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the connection is the first train-to-plane service at any of the region's three major airports. 
 The other new feature is a terminal expansion at Continental Airlines' Terminal C, a three-level glass and plexiglass expanse that increases gate space at the airline's hub here by nearly 50 percent. Service started today at the new section.
"The rail link, along with Continental Airlines' improvements at their terminal, will change the way people think about Newark Airport, which is the most significant and busiest airport in the entire region," said Ronald Shiftan, the acting executive director of the Port Authority, which manages all three of the region's major airports.
But that optimism was clouded by the shocks that the region and the airline industry have felt from the Sept. 11 attacks and the economic downturn. Gordon M. Bethune, the chairman of Continental, said that the lucrative business travel segment was down 15 percent and overall passenger loads were between 70 and 80 percent of what they were last year.
Despite that, he said, the investment in the expanded terminal was an indication of the company's confidence in the future.
"We're like the canary in the mine shaft," Mr. Bethune said, speaking from a platform at the new Gate 123, where Flight 23 for Los Angeles was waiting to take off. "We get sick first. We're going to have a behavioral shift among air travelers, but we see some restoration of passenger levels."
Ceremonies marking the opening of the terminal expansion had been scheduled for late September, and were to have been a star-studded affair with Broadway figures like Nathan Lane and Bebe Neuwirth. But John E. Walker, Continental's senior vice president for communications, said those plans were dropped because of the terror attacks, and because construction work stalled when workers left to help with the cleanup in Lower Manhattan.
At $1.4 billion, the expansion cost about the same as the new American Airlines terminal that is nearly completed at Kennedy International Airport.
There was no publicity last month for the opening of the rail-link terminal and the start of service that can bring train passengers from New York City and South Jersey directly to the airport. 
But in the month since, Mr. Shiftan said, the rail link has carried more than 60,000 passengers, or 1,500 a day. Most of those riders have found out about the service from the airlines or from New Jersey Transit.
Among the riders today were Dave and Colleen Patzer, a couple from Milwaukee who arrived at Newark and were headed for Manhattan. They had planned to spend $40 to $50 on a taxicab into Manhattan, until they talked with a Continental ticket agent.
"He told us that there were three alternatives: bus, cab and train," Ms. Patzer said. "But then he said that he would take the train if he were us because it has been getting pretty good reviews."
Two tickets for the 20-minute trip to New York's Pennsylvania Station cost them $22.30.

HEADLINE: Retailers Post Dismal Sales For November 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN and STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
The holiday shopping season started with a whimper and then got worse. 
 It was clear several months ago that the economic downturn would make this a difficult Christmas, but temperatures in the Northeast and Rocky Mountain states that have been more like the South Seas than the North Pole have layered insult upon injury for retailers. 
 Yesterday, the nation's merchants reported sales growth for November that was below already low expectations, as not even desperate pre-holiday price slashing enticed consumers to pick up one more wool turtleneck or leather blazer. 
The numbers that indicated continued softness in consumer spending contrasted with news -- a drop in jobless claims, strong auto sales and a bottoming in manufacturing activity -- that seemed to promise an early end to the economic downturn. 
"It is a mixed bag," said Carl Steidtmann, chief economist at Deloitte Research. "I think we've hit the bottom and we are bouncing up, but it is coming way too late for retailers this season."
Sales at stores opened at least a year, a closely watched measure of industry health, grew 2 percent in November, according to the Goldman, Sachs retail index. Even that tepid number was inflated by a quirk in the calendar that moved a week of the selling season to November from December. While many stores did adjust their numbers to compensate for this quirk, a handful of large stores including Federated Department Stores, May Department Stores, Kohl's and Target did not, and most of them expect that to depress sales growth for December. When the retailers report December numbers, the average of two months will give a clearer picture of the success of the season.
Even with the early start to the holiday season, many companies reported lower-than-expected sales. "Certainly retailers weren't expecting anything great," said Jeff Feiner, a stock analyst with Lehman Brothers, who lowered his annual profit expectations for a half dozen chains, "but for many it was even worse than was expected."
One of the most dismal reports came from Gap Inc., which posted a 25 percent year-to-year sales decline for November, below Wall Street's expectations. The apparel chain, which has been struggling because of overly aggressive expansion and fashion missteps, showed serious strain across all divisions. Sales at Banana Republic were down 11 to 13 percent, and Old Navy sales were off 31 to 33 percent.
Gap said it was forced to put more on sale than it had expected and predicted that losses would continue throughout the year. "It is reasonable to expect that the current negative trends in comparable-store sales and gross margins could continue," said Heidi Kunz, the chief financial officer, in a statement.
Although it was the most remarked upon, Gap was hardly the the only chain to miss its November sales targets. At May Department Stores, which owns Lord & Taylor's, sales declined 0.6 percent as opposed to an expected increase of 3 percent. Sales increases at J. C. Penney stores, which had been showing signs of a bit of a turnaround, failed to reach management's target of at least 1 percent. Specialty retailers like American Eagle Outfitters, down 9.6 percent; Limited Inc., down 7 percent; and Abercrombie & Fitch, down 5 percent, all took it on the chin as mall traffic remained thin across the country.
Even the giant discounters, which have been roaring past the department stores and apparel chain stores, had sales that came in on the low end of Wall Street's expectations. Wal-Mart Stores, which had a record $1.25 billion in sales the day after Thanksgiving, had year-to-year sales growth for November of 4.3 percent, compared with expected growth of 4 to 6 percent.
The one exception to the dismal environment was the ever-glowing Kohl's. The department store and discount store hybrid proved that it was possible to grow by selling apparel, racking up a nearly 26 percent sales gain for the month. That was substantially better than the 18 percent growth it had predicted because of the extra week of sales.
Although there was no shortage of reasons for bad sales, unusually balmy temperatures were widely blamed for depressing consumer interest further than had been anticipated. "It ruins the atmosphere," said George Strachan, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs. "It is hard to get excited about hanging Christmas lights and present shopping when it is 72 degrees."
Bad weather is a perennial excuse when retailers miss sales targets, but given the magnitude of the swing in temperatures this year, there may be some justification. On average, the weather across the nation was 8.51 degrees higher in November than it was last year and 4.88 degrees higher than normal, according to the National Climatic Data Center.
In New York, where temperatures hit a record high yesterday, November temperatures were 5.2 degrees higher this year than in 2000, and in Denver, an important market for coat and outerwear makers, they were 16.8 degrees higher than last year and 8.1 degrees higher than normal.
"The weather has been a real demon this year," said Richard N. Baum, senior retail analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston.
Mr. Baum and others say stores like American Eagle Outfitters, Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch, Lands' End, L. L. Bean and other retail companies that feature a wide selection of coats, scarves, mittens and hats will have a hard time if the weather does not change soon.
"The weather definitely had an impact on our business in November, which was flat when we had expected an increase compared to last year," said Michael Collins, a spokesman for Recreational Equipment Inc., which makes and sells a variety of outdoor wear.
Eventually, it will get colder, but analysts doubt that a reversal of fortune for sellers of apparel, like department stores and specialty chains is anywhere on the horizon. "We will see a continuation of the trends into 2002," Mr. Strachan said. "The consumer will spend, just not in the malls."

HEADLINE: Japan Is in Recession Again, With U.S.,as Germany Slips 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
The economy of Japan, the world's second largest, officially entered a recession today as figures showed the gross domestic product contracting for a second consecutive quarter.
 In the third quarter, which ended in September, the government said, the economy dropped 0.5 percent, or an annualized decline of 2.2 percent -- worse than the most recent decline in the United States. 
 Darkening the nation's outlook, the government also sharply shifted downward the second-quarter drop to 1.2 percent, from 0.7 percent, making for an annualized rate of 4.8. It also said personal consumption in the third quarter fell 1.7 percent. 
With the figures released today, the world's two largest economies -- the United States and Japan -- are in recession. And Germany, the third largest, is expected to follow.
The data follow a procession of statistics that point to a hard winter in Japan. In the first half of this year, the flow of foreign direct investment into Japan contracted by 19 percent and corporate earnings slid by a third. And the trade surplus is forecast to drop 40 percent this fiscal year, which ends in March.
"The current economic downturn could end up being Japan's worst ever," Mikihiro Matsuoka, an economist at Deutsche Securities in Tokyo, warned recently.
That assessment was echoed in New York by the Economic Cycle Research Institute, a private research group that studies 26 economic indicators for Japan, many dating back to the 1950's.
"They are set up to have their worst recession on record," Laksman Achuthan, managing director of the institute, said in an interview on Thursday. "This one will beat the mid-1970's recession, and that one was related to the oil shock."
Richard Katz, senior editor of The Oriental Economist newsletter, said here: "Japan never really recovered from the 1997-1998 recession. My fear is a constant economic corrosion."
Economic shrinkage or stagnation will bedevil Japan through early 2004, according to a forecast released this week by Japan's Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, a government group headed by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.
Only four years ago, Japanese government bonds enjoyed the world's highest ratings. But in the last two weeks, the three major ratings agencies have downgraded Japan's government bonds to the lowest levels of the major industrialized countries.
Japan is largely immune to foreign investor nervousness about its bonds because it is a net creditor and because about 95 percent of the bonds are held by Japanese investors. But the downgradings expose a serious weakness of the Japanese economy.
In the 1990's, Japan's national debt more than doubled, but lowered interest rates have allowed debt service payments to hover around 10.4 trillion yen (now $8.5 billion) for the last 15 years. Today, however, tax receipts are shrinking, making borrowing increasingly costly.
Japanese government bond prices "are a ticking time bomb," David Roche, a London-based investment adviser, wrote recently, predicting that interest rates will rise and bond prices will fall, further eroding the weak assets of Japan's troubled banks.
If poor credit ratings cause interest rates to rise from their rock-bottom levels, Japan could start feeling the cost of a decade of heavy borrowing.
"If ratings go on skidding, it might trigger plunges in government bond prices, thus inducing a state of the economy similar to a depression," Hiroshi Okuda, chairman of the Japan Federation of Employers Associations, said on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Giambi Deal Is Expected, But No One Says When

BYLINE:  By JACK CURRY 

 BODY:
The courtship of Jason Giambi, which had been whispered about hopefully around the Yankees for more than a year and blossomed into to a feverish recruitment as soon as it became legal for George Steinbrenner to pursue him, continued gradually yesterday. Giambi is eventually expected to sign a seven-year contract that will pay him around $17 million a year, but Yankees officials and Arn Tellem, Giambi's agent, stressed that the agreement was still not completed.
 Both sides expressed optimism that Giambi, a free-agent first baseman, would sign with the Yankees, a deal that has been anticipated for several days, yet they were still cautious about the elements that needed to be completed. 
 One of Giambi's friends would not specify what obstacles remained, but said they involved contract issues and more than Giambi's simply undergoing a physical examination. "From what I call tell you from our end," one Yankee official said, "it's not done yet." 
Some baseball officials suggested that the Yankees had tempered their negotiations with Giambi in deference to Commissioner Bud Selig, who spoke before Congress yesterday about Major League Baseball's economic situation. It could be awkward for Selig if the Yankees signed Giambi to a huge contract while he was trying to convince legislators that 25 of the 30 teams are losing money.
Two people with knowledge of the discussions said it might be several days before the Giambi deal was officially completed.
While the Yankees moved toward signing the 30-year-old Giambi away from the Oakland Athletics, they have agreed to a four-year contract for about $22 million with Steve Karsay, they are having serious discussions with Sterling Hitchcock and they are interested in David Wells. Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, is scheduled to have lunch with Wells in the Tampa area on Monday, which could be a precursor to Wells's return. They were supposed to meet yesterday, but Steinbrenner postponed it because of a family illness. 
The right-handed Karsay, a reliever for the Cleveland Indians and the Atlanta Braves last season, passed a physical on Wednesday, and his signing will most likely be announced today.
In effect, Karsay is a late replacement for Jeff Nelson. The Yankees did not adequately replace Nelson, a right-handed setup man, once he signed as a free agent with Seattle after the 2000 season. The Yankees stood firm on a three-year, $9 million offer and lost Nelson to the Mariners for $1.5 million more. The Yankees tried Jay Witasick and Mark Wohlers in the setup role, and both failed last season.
Nelson was amused that the Yankees were paying the 29-year-old Karsay more than twice what it would have cost to retain him.
"I don't know how established he is," Nelson said in a phone interview. "He did a good job for Cleveland in 2000, but that's a lot of money. It is funny that the Yankees played hardball with me and I'd been there five years. Now they're giving the money to a guy whose never played in New York. Well, he's from New York, but he's never had to deal with the everyday situations of being in New York. It's great for him if he can get it."
Hitchcock, one of the players the Yankees traded to Seattle to get Nelson and Tino Martinez before the 1996 season, is eager to pitch for the Yankees. The Yankees have spoken to Tommy Tanzer, Hitchock's agent, about a two-year deal and will surely offer the left-handed Hitchcock arbitration today to give them more time to negotiate.
If Hitchcock signs with the Yankees, it is logical to believe that he signed with them only after he was guaranteed a spot in the rotation. If Hitchcock returns, it will increase the likelihood that Orlando Hernandez, who is also expected to be offered arbitration by the Yankees, will be traded. Wells and Ted Lilly would then be the candidates for the fifth spot in the rotation.
"There are other clubs interested, but I think he really wants to pitch for the Yankees," Tanzer said, referring to Hitchcock. "Not that the Yankees have to blow him away. Even if the Yankees aren't the highest, he'd probably want to pitch for them."
Gregg Clifton, Wells's agent, said the Braves, the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Texas Rangers had contacted him about his client, whose season was cut short by a back injury. But Wells has insisted that he wants to return to the Yankees, something he will undoubtedly tell Steinbrenner before the waitress takes drink orders at their Monday lunch meeting.
"He's not going to pitch for nothing, but he's willing to show people that's he's ready to do what he has to do to earn his money," Clifton said. "He wants a deal where he'll earn his money if he pitches his usual 220 innings."
Moments before the Yankees returned to the clubhouse after losing Game 7 of the World Series to the Diamondbacks, Steinbrenner barked, "There will be changes." None of the players heard his vow, but it was obvious that the Yankees needed offense and it was just as obvious that signing Giambi would be their main priority.
There has been some question about whether the A's would add a seventh year to their six-year, $91 million offer to Giambi and if that could sway him to remain with the only team he has played for. But the A's have apparently not budged from their longstanding offer, and Giambi will soon officially replace Martinez as the Yankees' first baseman.
The Yankees are understandably antsy about their negotiations with Giambi, with some in the organization still concerned that Oakland could make a late bid.
Three years ago, the Yankees pursued a slugging free agent and reached an oral agreement. Fifteen minutes later, the player changed his mind. Who was it? Albert Belle, who signed with Baltimore. That is another reason the Yankees will wait until every aspect of a contract with Giambi has been completed before publicizing it.

Hamas and Fatah in Truce After Clashes Kill Militant
Yasir Arafat's Fatah faction and the extremist group Hamas appeared to reach a fragile truce after overnight clashes left a Hamas activist dead. Officials of Mr. Arafat's Palestinian Authority, which governs Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, said they would arrest anyone who violated the cease-fire with Israel. Hamas has taken responsibility for three suicide bombings last weekend that killed 25 Israelis and provoked a severe Israeli military response. A16

Daoud Abu Sway, a 46-year-old father of eight, who managed to kill only himself in a suicide bombing in Jerusalem on Wednesday, was praised as a hero by his wife and children in his village, near Bethlehem. The militant group Islamic Jihad said Mr. Abu Sway had been acting in its name. A16

Russians Foil Uranium Sellers
Russian television said the police had arrested seven men accused of trying to sell more than two pounds of weapons-grade uranium for $30,000 at a roadside cafe in the town of Balashikha, just southeast of Moscow. If confirmed, the seizure would be Russia's first acknowledged case of stolen weapons-grade material. A6

HEADLINE: The Meaning of an 'A' at Harvard 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Richard Rothstein (Lessons column, Dec. 5) is right. Grade inflation at Harvard and other colleges would not be a problem if it indicated that students were learning more. 
The problem is that we can't be sure that it does.
 That's because of the way college classrooms are managed. They are virtually the only places in America where the person producing a product is the sole judge of its quality. 
 Few businesses would allow that. Good managers assign independent inspectors to assure the public of the quality of their product. Why can't colleges do that?
If they used independent inspectors to determine what students had learned and to assign grades, both learning and teaching would probably improve. And we could finally believe those reports that tell us that all our children are above yesterday's average.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE INVESTIGATION; 
Mail at Federal Reserve Tests Positive for Anthrax, but Cause Is Still Unclear

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and DAVID JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
A batch of mail delivered to the Federal Reserve on Wednesday tested positive for anthrax today, the central bank said, raising further concern about cross-contamination among letters in the postal system or the possibility of new anthrax letters.
 The discovery became public as law enforcement officials said that the anthrax-contaminated letter sent to Senator Patrick J. Leahy was identical in its language to the anthrax letter mailed to Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader. 
 Federal Reserve officials said a small bin containing 100 to 150 letters had tested positive when it was subjected to routine screening in a trailer that was set up outside the central bank's headquarters to handle mail after the first reports of anthrax-laden letters this fall.
The officials said the mail was delivered to the Fed on Wednesday. They said they did not know which letter in the bin might contain anthrax or whether any letters were similar to those received by other government officials, including Senators Daschle and Leahy. 
In a news release, the Fed described the test as preliminary and said further tests would be conducted to confirm the finding. In a conference call with reporters tonight, a representative of the company hired by the Fed to screen its mail said the test sometimes gave a false positive reading for anthrax but that this result did not appear to be in error.
The representative, Mark Brown, an industrial hygienist for Applied Environmental of Reston, Va., said the test had been conducted several times and been positive each time.
One postal official cautioned tonight against rushing to a conclusion on whether the mail contained anthrax, saying there had been several cases in which mail that at first tested positive turned out to be not contaminated. 
"We've been down this road quite a few times with the preliminary test," said the official, Daniel Mihalko, a spokesman for the Postal Inspection Service. "Let's hope this is a false alarm." 
Federal Reserve officials said the batch of mail that had tested positive had been handled by three employees at the Fed and by three outside contractors, all of whom were wearing protective suits for the routine screening. 
Michelle Smith, a spokeswoman for the Fed, said the employees were meeting with their doctors to decide whether testing or antibiotics were necessary.
Ms. Smith said that Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and other agency officials had been informed of the test late this afternoon. She said that because the mail had never entered the Fed's headquarters, no one there was being tested or given antibiotics.
She said the Fed had decided to cancel a public board meeting scheduled for Friday. But Fed officials said the central bank would otherwise be open for business as usual, and they planned to proceed with a Tuesday meeting of the panel that sets short-term interest rates.
Fed officials said they had notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation after the positive test. They said the agency had asked the Fed and Applied Environmental to continue testing the suspicious mail and, if the tests continued to be positive, to set aside any letters found to contain anthrax. F.B.I. officials would not comment tonight.
There has not been a confirmed case of a new anthrax-contaminated letter since Nov. 16, when officials discovered the letter to Mr. Leahy postmarked Oct. 9. But officials have traced at least one letter that appeared to have been cross-contaminated at the mail-sorting operation in Trenton, N.J.
Mr. Brown of Applied Environmental said the preliminary testing of the mail at the Fed did not give any indication of whether anthrax was present in trace amounts or larger quantities. He said no powder was visible in the bin holding the letters.
Earlier today, investigators provided an update on the anthrax-contaminated letter to Mr. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, which was removed on Wednesday from its envelope by forensic scientists at an Army biomedical research laboratory in Fort Detrick, Md.
Scientists are expected to conduct a series of tests on the envelope and letter to Mr. Leahy and on the powder found inside, which officials said appeared to be the same lethal form of anthrax sent to Mr. Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota.
"Investigators are hopeful that the results of those tests -- expected in the coming days and weeks -- will yield clues which will bring us closer to identifying who is responsible for the anthrax attacks," the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement posted on its Web site.
The Leahy and Daschle letters appeared to be photocopies of the same letter. They contained the same phrases, like "You die now," "We have this anthrax" and "You can not stop us," and conclude with "Allah is great."
The Leahy letter was addressed in the same handwritten block lettering found on three other anthrax letters, the one to Mr. Daschle and ones to NBC News and The New York Post. Each of the four was postmarked at the Trenton postal center. Investigators said they were certain that the same person wrote all four.
