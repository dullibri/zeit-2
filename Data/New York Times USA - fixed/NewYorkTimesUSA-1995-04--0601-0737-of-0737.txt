HEADLINE: Three Women vs. a Broker;
Olde Is Accused of Blatant Job Discrimination

BYLINE: By SUSAN ANTILLA 

 BODY:
Less than a year ago, Mary Graff was at the top of her professional game. Of the more than 1,000 brokers at the Olde Discount Corporation, Ms. Graff, who had been with the company for 11 years, led the list of big bond sellers in the latest company newsletter. She also managed the office in Glenview, Ill., which was among the top 5 producers of the 200 Olde offices around the nation.
So imagine Ms. Graff's surprise when her boss told her last June that she was to be stripped of her manager's title, knocked back down to being an ordinary broker, moved to a different office and forced to give up most of her customer accounts. 
 "He said, 'You need to be closer to home to spend more time with your daughter,' " remembered Ms. Graff, who quit her job at Olde last September and has since been unemployed. "The 25-year-old guys have goals," she recalled him saying. "They want to drive fancy sports cars so they can pick up the girls and get out of mommy and daddy's house and get married."
Ms. Graff's story, which emerged in a formal complaint filed yesterday with the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, is but one tale among many about discrimination at Olde (pronounced OL-dee), the third-largest discount brokerage firm in the country. Current and former employees describe an atmosphere in which women have been publicly demeaned for having menstrual cycles. Managers have openly referred to blacks by such racial epithets as "monkeys," former employees say.
Young white men fresh out of college are the employees of choice, according to several dozen people interviewed for this article. It is rare, they say, to see any member of a minority group or someone older than 40 working there.
Amid all the disputes these days over the rights and wrongs of affirmative action in the workplace, such blatant racism and sexism sound bizarrely out of place. But even in this era when most corporate managements are extremely sensitive to issues of race, gender and age, a number of current and former employees say that old-style discrimination appears to be alive and well at Olde.
Moreover, according to lawyers for the complainants, the ease with which Olde has managed to demote women who rose through merit and to exclude blacks almost completely from its work force is testimony to what can still happen in the 1990's when a number of circumstances conspire to prevent exposure.
Olde, based in Detroit, strongly denies that it discriminates against women and blacks, said Frank Ortiz, outside counsel to Olde. And he said it was not true, as reported by former employees, that the company employs no blacks and fewer than a dozen women as brokers. He declined to provide specific figures.
Yesterday, three women -- including Ms. Graff -- filed a discrimination claim against Olde with the E.E.O.C. Later this week, they will file the same claim with securities industry arbitrators, said Mary Stowell of Leng Stowell Friedman & Vernon, the Chicago law firm that is representing the women. A copy was made available to The New York Times.
As a brokerage firm, Olde normally enjoys a cloak of secrecy about its employee disputes. When brokers get their licenses, they must agree to submit to an industry-run arbitration panel that handles all grievances in private. Such complaints, including the one filed yesterday, are usually kept hidden from the public.
"You can sue a corporation and go to court and get a jury that finds in your favor and the company has to change," said Linda D. Friedman, a lawyer at Leng Stowell. "But that's not the way it is in the securities industry. The records are all secret, so nothing changes."
And, as a private company, Olde faces no legal requirements to disclose lawsuits or arbitrations that affect its finances. Olde does not have Federal contracts, so it is not required to file employment data with the Government.
By all accounts, the policies at Olde stem from the top. The company, one of several nationwide firms that provide low-cost brokerage services, was started in 1970. The founder, Ernest Olde, now lives in the Cayman Islands and is still chairman. Mr. Ortiz said Mr. Olde and several other senior managers declined to be interviewed.
At a managers' meeting last year, the women's complaint contends, Mr. Olde "told the all-male audience words to the effect that they should not fall in love with a stock because 'it is like falling in love with a woman. It falls and falls and all you're left with is a big yeast infection.' " The complaint also says, "Finally, Ernest Olde directed the attendees to recruit 'young, good-looking, studly males' from college fairs and not to hire 'broads.' "
Susan Bell, who joined Olde in 1989 as a broker at one of its Phoenix offices, said in a complaint filed with the National Association of Securities Dealers in February that Mr. Olde had harassed her publicly at meetings of brokers. "He asked her what sexual overtures or sexual activities she would engage in to close a sale with a reluctant securities purchaser," stated the complaint, a copy of which was obtained by The Times.
According to the complaint, Ms. Bell was selected to attend a conference of top Olde brokers in August 1992 in Detroit. Once there, however, she was told to look for a new job, the complaint said. She was transferred in May 1993 to the Scottsdale, Ariz., office, where her salary was cut by 25 percent and she was left with $3 million of the $20 million in client assets she previously managed, the complaint said. Ms. Bell quit in September 1993.
"Olde feels omnipotent and above the law," said Julie Quintero, another former Olde manager. She joined Ms. Graff in filing the discrimination grievance with a third woman, who is still employed at Olde and declined to be interviewed. "We had a nonsmoking policy," Ms. Quintero said, "but he would walk around the office and pull out a cigarette and light it up. He'd say, 'It's my company and I can fire you all if I want.' "
Mr. Ortiz, the Olde lawyer, said that as a matter of policy, he would not comment on details of any pending arbitration complaint. But he denied that Mr. Olde had made the statements attributed to him in the latest complaint, and said the three women were not treated any differently from men. More broadly, he said, "I'm not going to comment on the perceived personality traits of Mr. Olde."
In demoting the women, Olde lost some of its top performers. All three plaintiffs in the discrimination case were on the list of the top 25 bond brokers that Ms. Graff led last May. Indeed, 5 of the 25 were women at a time when only 7 percent of Olde's brokers were women.
Apart from its treatment of women employees, the company went to extraordinary lengths to exclude blacks from its sales ranks, according to several former senior managers who spoke on condition of anonymity. An officer of the firm "would close the door with each regional manager and say, 'Don't hire blacks or women,' " one of the former managers recalled. "And he'd add: 'How do you do that? Give me 15 minutes and I can find something not to like about anyone.' "
To make the task easier, this former manager said, there was a sheet of questions to ask a job candidate over the telephone, some of which were quite difficult to answer. While young white male employees would frequently be hired despite their inability to get all the answers right, those who turned out to be either black or too old when they showed up for an interview could be given the excuse that they were being turned down because they had "flunked" the test, the manager said.
In past years, Olde also screened applicants by asking some to send photographs with their resumes, according to a woman hired in 1990.
The E.E.O.C. is "reviewing the employment practices of Olde," according to a letter from the agency that was sent to a former Olde employee. The E.E.O.C. would not comment on the investigation. Ms. Friedman, the lawyer, said that an investigator at the agency told her that Olde's hiring practices, particularly regarding blacks and older employees, were under scrutiny as a result of an unusual number of complaints by former employees.
The firm has made efforts in recent months to hire women and blacks as the heat has turned up from the investigation, Ms. Friedman said.
Mr. Ortiz acknowledged the E.E.O.C. investigation but said it was not aimed at Olde in particular.
In response to specific accusations, Mr. Ortiz said the company indeed asks applicants a list of questions. "But they're not used to rationalize hiring decisions," he said. "They are used merely to gain information and to evaluate the applicant." Asked whether the company ever relied on photographs of applicants, Mr. Ortiz said: "As a matter of policy, we don't ask for photographs. We've never asked."
In its early days, Olde had a higher percentage of women brokers than it does today. At that time, most brokers were little more than order takers who, by industry standards, were paid relatively small sums. In 1983, when salaries were approximately $12,000 a year, half of the Olde brokers in Illinois were women, according to the complaint filed this week.
But in 1993, to be more like a full-service firm, Olde started compensating brokers with handsome commissions. Last year, when the average salary had risen to $100,000, fewer than 1 percent of the Illinois brokers were women, the complaint said.
As recently as 1990, women filled nearly 15 percent of Olde's nationwide sales jobs, according to a company list of brokers. By 1993, that had dropped to 7.5 percent. In the brokerage industry over all, 28 percent of brokers were women in 1993, according to Census data, and 4.1 percent were black.
As Olde made the transformation to a fancier service outfit with higher broker pay, those women who managed to rise in the ranks faced constant harassment, critics of the company say. "The regional manager looked down at my wedding ring and said, "Do you really need to work?' " recalled Ms. Quintero, who was a branch manager in Olympia Fields, Ill.
A year ago, Ms. Quintero said she was told to distribute most of her accounts among her male colleagues, giving up earnings that averaged about $9,000 a month. She quit shortly after she was transferred to a new town, where her earnings were closer to $1,500 a month. "Just before this happened I bought a Mitsubishi 3000 GT," she said. "Now I think I should trade it in for a Chevette."
While the securities business has long been considered a bastion of white men, Olde stands out to Ms. Friedman, the lawyer, as an unusually hostile place for women and blacks. "We haven't seen this type of discrimination in the '90's," she said. "Most companies kind of get it by now."

HEADLINE: Wood Products Company Helps Write a Law to Derail an E.P.A. Inquiry

SERIES: Special Pleaders -- A periodic look at lobbying

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
A few weeks ago, some of Washington's top lawyer-lobbyists were closeted in a Senate office building with Republican staff members, reworking a bill by the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, to limit the powers of Government regulators.
After the lobbyists nipped and tucked at the wording, several key phrases drafted by Georgia-Pacific, the nation's largest wood products company, made it into the measure nearly verbatim. 
 Company officials will not say exactly what they did to shape the legislation, which is scheduled to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a vote this week. But they freely acknowledge their aim was to derail an ongoing Environmental Protection Agency inquiry into possible violations of the Clean Air Act at 26 of the company's operations. Millions of dollars in fines are at stake.
The provision would bar Federal officials from suing or prosecuting a company for actions taken on the advice of a responsible state or Federal official. That is what Georgia-Pacific says it did in not applying for permits at the plant sites, and company officials assert the environmental agency is using present-day rules to judge 15-year-old facts.
"We've been wronged in this whole thing," said Sheila Weidman, a company spokesman. "Like any American citizen, we're working through the legislative process to right that wrong.'
The Georgia-Pacific story is a tale of how one firm's pitched battle with one agency turned into legislation that could profoundly reshape the relationship between companies and all Government agencies on a myriad of issues.
Clinton Administration officials say it also illustrates how much Federal authority and practices can be changed by a few words in the right place.
The Justice Department said in a recent letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee that the proposed provision and related sections "creates enormous opportunities for abuse, and could immunize egregious violations that cost taxpayers millions of dollars and result in serious harm to the public."
Lois J. Schiffer, the Assistant Attorney General for the environment and natural resources division, said today that if the provision became law "we would have a very difficult time protecting public health and safety." She added: "This would not in any way satisfy the President's goal of regulatory reform that would give us fair, effective, and enforceable laws."
Georgia-Pacific, which is based in Atlanta, had some influential allies in the room the day the 97-page draft of the bill was hammered out.
Among those working on the bill's wording with Republican staffers were Henry Nickel and Turner T. Smith Jr., two partners in the Richmond law firm of Hunton & Williams. The firm has an extensive Washington-based environmental practice, and Senator Dole's chief counsel on regulatory issues, Kyle McSlarrow, is an alumni of the firm.
Court papers show that the firm is representing Hoechst Celanese, a chemical company locked in legal combat with the E.P.A. in three civil lawsuits. In defending Hoechst Celanese, a subsidary of the German company Hoechst A.G., the law firm has argued in a Texas court that the firm had the approval of state officials for everything it did. Roger J. Marzulla, another lawyer representing the company, said the legislation, if passed, would bolster the company's defenses against the environmental agency.
But the company, and several other officials from other industries, insist that this provision is not just another instance of lobbyists getting their way in Washington. The treatment of Georgia-Pacific, Hoechst Celanese and mining companies, they contend, has made clear some fundamental injustices in how Federal agencies enforce environmental laws.
Mr. Marzulla, a lawyer at the Washington firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, said: "This is not, as some have characterized it, just trying to fix a specific lawsuit or two. This is an important and challenging question."
Akin, Gump separately represents Hoechst Celanese in settlement negotiations with E.P.A. over the three civil suits and was recently hired by the company to lobby the Senate on the Dole bill. He said he did not draft the language, and does not know how it got into the bill.
Mr. Marzulla and other proponents of the measure said it is not unusual for companies to get permission from a state to do something, and then, years later, find themselves battling Federal agencies who have interpreted the law differently.
Over the years, courts have held that the Federal Government could not be bound by the word of a mis-informed or mistaken official. Taxpayers who rely on incorrect advice from the Internal Revenue Service are still obligated to pay everything they owe.
Environmental laws pose a more complicated problem. Although Congress has set national standards for air, water and land, much of the enforcement is delegated to states, which pass their own laws and oversee local programs. E.P.A. reserves the right to file Federal cases in instances in which, because of local political pressures or misinterpretations of the complex statutes, states have failed to take action against major polluters.
Steven A. Herman, the E.P.A.'s top enforcement official, said the agency seldom used that power. But the possibility that it might prevents states desperate to attract industry from cutting separate deals with companies. If the agency loses its authority to overrule state decisions, he said, the United States would no longer have a national environmental policy.
The provision backed by Georgia-Pacific, Hoeschst Celanese and mining concerns "allows a local company to really turn the screws on a state that is vulnerable economically," Mr. Herman asserted, adding, "It creates the threat of pollution havens -- states with a weak economies that are willing to sacrifice their health and safety to attract new industry."
The conflict between the wood products industry and E.P.A. arose in the late 1980's, when the agency began investigating Louisiana-Pacific of Portland, Ore., for violations of the Clean Air Act.
Federal officials charged that the company had systematically underestimated its emissions of volatile organic chemicals, a type of pollution that can cause smog. Under the 1977 statute, companies operating in regions with the cleanest air must undergo a stringent review, and apply for permits from state or Federal agencies if they build new plants that emit more than 250 tons of volatile organic chemicals a year. Permits are also required for significant modifications of a plant that increases emissions of these chemicals by more than 40 tons a year.
This is important because under the regulations, companies applying for permits can be required to install expensive pollution control technologies, the best available to the industry. In 1993, Louisiana-Pacific settled its case by paying an $11 million fine. Soon afterward, the E.P.A. and state agencies began scrutinizing other wood products companies, including Georgia-Pacific and Weyerhauser for similar violations.
Georgia-Pacific officials vehemently contested the E.P.A.'s view that the company should have applied for permits at its plants. They said the company had calculated its projected emissions of volatile chemicals using a method developed by the environmental agency.
Moreover, the company said it had relied on advice from state officials and regional E.P.A. officials in deciding whether to apply for the permits. After the E.P.A. served notice last August of possible violations at the Georgia-Pacific plants, environmental officials in several states, including Alabama, Virginia and Georgia took the company's side.
Mr. Herman of the E.P.A. declined to discuss the Georgia-Pacific or Hoechst Celanese cases, saying only: "We take our responsibilities seriously. We wouldn't be bringing these cases if we didn't think they were valid cases. They're a tremendous expense for us."
Soon after, company officials said, they decided to take their case to Congress. They drafted an amendment and gave it to Senator David Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas. Senator Pryor declined at the last minute to offer the measure.
A few weeks later, virtually the same language turned up in a draft of Senator Dole's bill as retooled by Senators Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. In a later draft, it was modestly rewritten by committee staffers in the face of objections from the Administration and Senate Democrats.
Jeanne Lopatto, the Judiciary Committee's spokesman, termed the provision a matter of "basic fairness." She said the committee had consulted with Democrats, "the regulated community," and Administration officials and "then we drafted our bill."
Gordon Alphonso, senior counsel at the company, said: "For Georgia-Pacific to spend a significant amount of time and money addressing these issues when legislation would be an easier and quicker cheaper remedy, I think you would want to chose the easier, quicker, and cheaper remedy. You never know how long it will take for a court to reach a decision."
But David Hawkins, senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that is where the case belongs. "They're trying an end-run around the justice system," he said. "It doesn't surprise me that some states are taking Georgia-Pacific's side. One of the reasons we have a Federal statute is that we have a sorry history of states taking polluters sides."

HEADLINE: BOMBING IN SACRAMENTO: THE INVESTIGATION;
Bomb Meant for Predecessor Of Victim, Officials Say

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 25

 BODY:
Federal officials said today that a mail bomb that killed the chief lobbyist for a forest-products trade group in Sacramento, Calif., was apparently intended for a retired executive who had headed the group until a year ago.
The package was addressed to William N. Dennison, who served as president and chief executive officer of the California Forestry Association from 1980 to 1994 and was a highly visible figure in a number of contentious environmental issues. 
 Mr. Dennison was replaced by Gilbert B. Murray, who was killed on Monday as he was opening a small, heavy package wrapped in brown paper and mailed to the trade group's one-story brick building.
The explosion in the assocation's reception area knocked doors off their hinges, blew out ceiling tiles and shattered glass partitions inside the 7,500-square-foot office. Five other employees who were present at the time of the blast escaped unharmed.
Mr. Dennison, who lives in Rancho Cordova, a town about 15 miles east of Sacramento, could not be reached for comment. His telephone has been disconnected, and several friends and former colleagues said they did not know his whereabouts. In an interview in today's Sacramento Bee, Mr. Dennison said the bomb could only be the work of "a sick person."
"I can't imagine that what we do could be a threat to give the least reason to bomb an office," Mr. Dennison told The Bee, which first identified him as the intended target. He added: "If trying to manage natural resources is a threat, I don't know what isn't. There can't be any rationale for this." The newspaper did not indicate the circumstances of the interview or from where Mr. Dennison spoke.
Jean Wilhoit, the public affairs director for the P.&M. Cedar Products Company in Stockton, Calif., and a board member of the forestry association, said: "I know Bill is completely devastated by what has happened. He has probably cloistered himself until he can collect his thoughts and emotions."
In the years leading up to his retirement, Mr. Dennison was a prominent voice in what was widely known in the Pacific Northwest as "the timber wars," a struggle that pitted ranchers, loggers and the timber industry against environmentalists over the development of public and private lands.
"Bill Dennison was there during a time of fairly contentious issues in California," said Jay Watson, regional director of The Wilderness Society, adding that he was an especially vocal opponent of the Government's 1990 decision to declare the northern spotted owl, which makes its home in the old forests of the Northwest, a threatened species.
While environmentalists celebrated this expansive use of the Endangered Species Act to protect a nearly extinct animal, the timber industry mounted an intensive effort through the courts to overturn the Government's action.
"Through all that period, he was the No. 1 person for the timber industry," Mr. Watson said.
Betty Ball, a spokeswoman for the Mendocino Environmental Center, called Mr. Dennison "a key player for the timber industry." Noting, however, that he had recently retired, she added, "Whoever did this horrible thing in Sacramento was acting on old information."
A legislative aide in Sacramento who has worked extensively on forestry issues and who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said: "Bill Dennison is far more contentious than Gil Murray ever was. Mr. Murray was more circumspect, less inflammatory. But Mr. Dennison could be as inflammatory as you can get without being irresponsible."
He added: "If you were fixating on wood, Mr. Dennison is someone whose name you might well have run across. He has been very visible."
In September 1993, for example, Mr. Dennison was among several dozen ranchers, loggers and timber industry leaders who attended a public hearing in Redding, Calif., to discuss President Clinton's plan to limit logging in old forests on Federal land. The policy would let the timber industry cut as much as one billion board feet of lumber each year in the forests of Washington, Oregon and northern California -- less than a fifth of the harvest during the 1980's.
At the Redding hearing Mr. Dennison said the plan "would be detrimental to the forests, and it would be devastating to Northern California families and businesses."
Earlier the same year, Mr. Dennison spoke at a two-day conference, called the Sierra Economic Summit, which was also called to discuss proposals to limit logging on public and private lands. Mr. Dennison said he was alarmed by any proposal that would call for the expansion of park land, a move that he said would result in losses of jobs, industry and a way of life in the Sierra for people who have lived there for generations.

HEADLINE: Soviet Archives: Half-Open, Dirty Window on Past

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

 BODY:
In early August 1930, Stalin wrote a routine note to his most loyal comrade in the Soviet leadership, Vyacheslav M. Molotov, with 10 directives. The second one dealt with the hoarding of coins, a problem the Kremlin was trying to deal with.
After venting his rage at the State Bank and the Finance Ministry, Stalin wrote, "Definitely shoot two or three dozen wreckers from these apparats, including several dozen common cashiers." 
 The note is one of 86 letters from Stalin to Molotov recently published by Yale University Press, and one of thousands of documents that have come fluttering from behind the long-impenetrable walls of Soviet archives since the Communist state collapsed in 1991.
The flow has produced its share of sensations and revelations, big and small, but also its frustrations. First among these is that the most important files remain solidly off-limits. And after the first wave of openness, American scholars say access is being steadily curtailed, especially for records of the post-Stalin period. More ominously, they report that secret-police agents have recently reappeared at top archives and major research institutes.
That does not mean the flow has stopped. Far from it; the revelations that have emerged, and are still emerging, are often dramatic.
The Stalin-Molotov letters give a tantalizing glimpse of the despot, ordering political executions in writing long before the terror got under way in the mid-1930's, delving into the smallest details of politics and the economy, neatly organizing his directives and thoughts in numbered paragraphs and concise orders.
Some other dramatic documents that have emerged include these:
*Proof of a direct order from the Soviet leadership to massacre Polish officers at Katyn Forest in Russia in 1941.
*The Russian-language version of the secret protocol to the Nazi-Soviet pact in 1939.
*Evidence that the Russians were undecided about invading Poland during the Solidarity years in the early 1980's.
*Proof that the Soviets had extensive information about the ill-fated Korean Air Lines Flight 007, including the black box of the passenger jetliner shot down by Soviet fighters in 1983.
*Evidence that Stalin ordered the North Korean invasion of South Korea in 1950.
Extensive transcripts of Politburo sessions and meetings of Warsaw Pact leaders have come out, detailing their thoughts and strategies through the cold war.
They demonstrate, for instance, how wary the Soviets were of committing forces to Afghanistan. A special Politburo report in April 1979, eight months before Soviet forces swept into the country, declared, "It is clear that due to the internal nature of the anti-governmental opposition, the use of Soviet troops in repressing the Afghan counterrevolution would seriously damage the international authority of the U.S.S.R. and would set back the process of disarmament."
But like many other archival discoveries, such findings often lead to more questions. Are there other letters from Stalin, revealing far greater crimes and plots, that Molotov withheld when he turned his files over to the archives in 1969? Are there documents that prove or disprove whether Stalin ordered the 1934 assassination of Sergei M. Kirov, the Leningrad party chief? That Alger Hiss was a spy? That there was a Soviet hand in the assassination of John F. Kennedy? Or in the shooting of Pope John Paul II in 1981?
 
The Output
Despite Volume, Much Is Sealed
 In the West, the archives have spawned something of a new industry.
The Cold War International History Project in Washington, headed by James G. Hershberg, has organized two major conferences and has published several bulletins of archival findings. The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford is microfilming huge volumes of Communist Party records. Crown Publishers has reportedly signed a contract to publish materials from the K.G.B. archives. Various joint projects have been set up to prepare guides to Russian archival holdings.
Yale University Press recently issued the first two volumes of an ambitious, 18-book "Annals of Communism" series of archival documents. The first two were a collection of Stalin's letters to Molotov, which includes the 1930 note about the hoarding of coins, and "The Secret World of American Communism," which details links between Moscow and the American Communist Party from the 1920's to 1945.
Russians, too, have burrowed into the cache. Gen. Dmitri Volkogonov, a military historian who has already drawn on newly available materials for biographies of Stalin and Lenin, now plans a two-volume history of the Soviet Union seen through the eyes of seven Soviet leaders, from Lenin to Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
The Progress Publishing Group, once part of the Soviet propaganda machine, plans to release a laser disk with documents, photos and documentary film about Hitler, including a 1970 order from Yuri V. Andropov, who was then K.G.B. chief, ordering that the remains of the Nazi dictator be burned.
Yet for all the output, the most intriguing Soviet documents remain sealed in the Presidential Archive, which was set up by Mr. Gorbachev, the last Soviet President, to safeguard important information from the disintegrating Communist Party, and was taken over after Mr. Gorbachev's fall by President Boris N. Yeltsin.
Almost all the most dramatic disclosures have come from this file, but usually only when Mr. Yeltsin has chosen to release them for political reasons. Many were made public in the case against the Communist Party before the Constitutional Court, others as gifts to foreign governments, others to embarrass Mr. Gorbachev. Researchers have had no independent access.
Similarly, K.G.B. and military files have been made public only at the discretion of their masters. The Foreign Ministry has granted many requests for material, but still keeps its catalogues classified, leaving it to archivists to determine what material a researcher might need.
"Over all, I don't think things have improved," said Mark Kramer, a history professor at Brown and Harvard who has been one of the most active American users of Soviet archives. "In fact, they've deteriorated."
Mr. Kramer said that on his last trip to Russia he was shown an internal directive dated Dec. 10, 1993, that set out a list of areas of Communist Party activities whose records were being put off-limits.
They include the party Secretariat, which ran the party; the departments dealing with international affairs and administrative organs, which included the K.G.B. and the military; medium machine-building, which handled nuclear weapons; all intelligence agencies, and documents on technological and scientific research.
When Mr. Kramer tried to get documents on these subjects on a recent visit, he was refused. "I was even not allowed to see documents I translated in 1992," he said. "I get the sense that a fair amount does pertain to the security services, the K.G.B. and foreign intelligence, and they just don't like to have any of their documents released."
Mr. Kramer and other researchers say the tightening of access correlates in part with a broader revival in Russia of a sense of continuity with the Soviet Union.
 
Tightened Access
After Initial Burst, Files Start to Close
 In the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Communist Party in 1991, the prevailing mood in Russia was to distance the new system from the old. It was then that archives were opened, and that many of the most revealing documents emerged. But the initial euphoria soon waned under economic and political turmoil, while Russia's foreign policy recovered from the early infatuation with the West.
The turning point, researchers agree, was the publication in The New York Times on April 12, 1993, of a document culled from the Soviet archives by an Australian researcher, Stephen J. Morris, which purported to be the Russian translation of a Vietnamese report saying the real number of American prisoners in North Vietnam was three times the number publicly acknowledged by Hanoi.
Though the document was not particularly embarrassing to Moscow, it was used as a pretext to dismiss the director of the contemporary Communist archive, Rem Usikov, and to tighten access greatly. Mr. Usikov's successor, Anatoly Prokopenko, is reported to have told a researcher, "Yes, these documents have been declassified, but that doesn't mean people should be allowed to look at them."
More recently, the Hoover Institution project to microfilm 25 million pages from the Communist archives has come under fire as a pilfering of Russia's national heritage. Yuri Afanaseyev, a historian with solid democratic credentials, asserted that the state archive committee was "selling out Russia's past."
The entire idea of archives as public domain is novel to a nation that has always regarded them as a tool for officials and bureaucrats. Many archives are still considered the property of agencies like the intelligence service or the Foreign Ministry, and Russian archivists still believe that they are doing researchers a great favor by letting them in.
Another problem is the sheer volume of material and the big decrease in Government financing. A joint task force of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies and the American Historical Association reported that the 17 state archives of the Russian Federation alone include 65.3 million files on more than 300 miles of shelves, not to mention 2,200 republic, regional and local depositories controlled by the Russian State Committee on Archival Affairs.
Most are in dire need of money. The Russian State Historical Archive in St. Petersburg, housed in the 18th-century buildings of the Holy Synod and the Imperial Senate, have been declared in major danger of destruction by Western experts.
And just when researchers have come flooding in, those archivists who can have been leaving for other jobs because of low pay. In a recent conversation in Moscow, Sergei V. Mironenko, the director of the Russian State Archive, pointed to his secretary and whispered that her salary was not enough to buy food.
Like many other archivists, Mr. Mironenko has tried to line up outside publishing or cooperative agreements to make ends meet. That, however, has raised charges of commercialization. Many Western researchers have complained about what they view as exorbitant copying or "access" fees, and scholars have criticized some of the exclusive arrangements between archives and publishers.
The Crown arrangement to publish K.G.B. materials has come under special fire because it would essentially allow the political police to decide what to publish about itself without independent scrutiny, and without declassifying its holdings.
 
Distorted History
Picture of the Past Not Always True
 Apart from all the problems of logistics, cost and access, scholars have reaffirmed what they always knew, that files are only a partial image of the past, and not always an accurate one. A current example is a book by a Stalinist K.G.B. operative named Pavel Sudoplatov, who asserted in his memoir, "Special Tasks," that the K.G.B. received secret atomic information from several eminent Western scientists, including Niels Bohr.
Files found later have exonerated Mr. Bohr, but the book has dramatized the danger of releasing partial information or publishing isolated witnesses, especially former K.G.B. agents. The danger is particularly large because the K.G.B. files, like the secret police files in East Germany and other political files, name countless people, not all of them necessarily collaborators.
The Yale University collection of documents on the American Communist Party, for instance, has two 1942 documents about Edmund W. Stevens, an American journalist who spent most of his life in Moscow. Nobody doubted that he sympathized with the Soviet Union, but nobody knew what he did.
The Yale book carries a request from Gen. Pavel M. Fitin asking urgent information about Mr. Stevens, "a former leader of the American Komsomol." The reply says that Mr. Stevens, who died in 1992, was a member in good standing of the American Communist Party, and that he "could be useful in Moscow." No more.
One problem is that in a police state like the Soviet Union, many of the most damaging directives were probably never committed to paper, while many documents that did get circulated were intended to bolster the standing of a particular official, and so did not necessarily reflect the truth. Many sensitive documents have also been destroyed -- by Lavrenti P. Beria, the secret police chief, or in World War II, or during de-Stalinization.
Yet a remarkable volume of incriminating documents do survive, testament to a system that believed its secrets would never become public. Long lists of mass executions and tortures ordered by Stalin have survived, as well as letters by Lenin ordering a secret terror campaign in Latvia and Estonia as early as 1917, the year of the Bolshevik Revolution.
So Western scholars have learned to treat the archives more soberly. "The first wave in the archives was a search for revelations," Mr. Hershberg said. "The second wave has been more a re-evaluation of what is known and the integration of new material into history."
For scholars trained in assessing the partial evidence available during the cold war, the problem has often been not too little, but too much. William Taubman, professor at Amherst College, had to repeatedly delay publication of his biography of Nikita S. Khrushchev while he waded through the many new witnesses and documents that were constantly becoming available.
Like many other scholars who have worked with the new evidence, Mr. Taubman said his fundamental image of the man and the period proved accurate. What he gained was a wealth of detail.
"I think I've learned a ton of stuff," he said. "Not so much a kind of smoking gun -- like 'Khrushchev plotted the Kennedy assassination' -- but tons of details about the man, anecdotes, incidents, which enable me, I hope, to depict a living, breathing human being, rather than a caricature."

HEADLINE: Market Pauses After 3 Straight Highs; Blue Chips Slightly Down

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks ended slightly lower yesterday as the market paused after setting three straight closing records in the last three sessions.
The Dow Jones industrial average was off 3.81 points at 4,300.17. On Monday the index closed at a new high of 4,303.98. 
 In the broader market, declining issues led advances 1,160 to 1,070 on active trading of more than 352 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts said the market was nervous about possible action on the sagging dollar from the Washington meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers.
"Right now what's scaring people is the G-7 meeting," said Trude Latimer of Ferguson, Andrews & Associates. "They're afraid of what the U.S. may be forced to do."
 But some analysts were betting that the Group of Seven nations -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada -- would do little more than pay lip service to increased cooperation to help lift the dollar.
Among the session's winners, Motorola rose 1 5/8 a share to 55 7/8 in active trading. Goldman, Sachs added the stock to its priority list.
Compaq Computer, which last week reported earnings in line with expectations, rose 1 5/8 a share to 39 1/8 in volume of more than 8.2 million shares, making it the most active Big Board issue. Among other technology stocks, I.B.M., which recently reported strong earnings, was up 1/8 to 93 5/8, and Autodesk fell 2 1/2 to 34 3/4. Dean Witter downgraded the stock to neutral from buy.
Cordis Corporation fell 3 3/4 a share to 75 after reporting third quarter earnings.
Kmart fell 1/2 to 14 7/8 in heavy Big Board volume after it cut its quarterly dividend in half and said it expected to report a first-quarter loss.
RJR Nabisco was down 3/4 to 26 5/8 in heavy volume after it reported lower-than-expected earnings.
UAL, the parent of United Airlines, rose 2 7/8 to 117 1/2 after reporting a $3 million profit, its first profitable first quarter since 1989.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 0.74 point to 512.15. However, the Nasdaq index rose 2.37 to 831.28, and the American Stock Exchange index was up 0.02 point to 473.59.
The New York Stock Exchange Composite index of all listed common stocks fell 0.45 point to 276.39. The average share was down 5 cents.
The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of New York, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 5,008.385, down 5.584 points or 0.11 percent.
Analysts said that one reason for the market's pause was that traders were puzzled by the latest data that showed the economy was stronger than previously indicated.
The Conference Board, a private business group, reported that consumer confidence in its survey rose to 105.5 in April from a revised 100.2 in March. Economists had forecast a reading of 99.9 for April.
"People begin to wonder if the economy is in fact slowing down," said Tony Dwyer of Josephthal Lyon & Ross.
He said that if people were confident about their jobs and the future they would be more willing to spend, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to push up interest rates to slow the economy's growth.
Investors were also wondering about where the economy is headed.
"There is a debate in the market about what happens after the soft landing in the economy," said Hugh Johnson at the First Albany Company.
Some economists foresee a reacceleration of the economy, but others expect further slowing, he said, adding that some even expect a significant slowdown in 1996.
"Nobody knows who you should line up behind right now; it's an issue which is just not getting answered," he said.
He said the confusion has kept a brake on the broader market, which has lagged behind the record-setting run of the blue-chip market.

HEADLINE: Rio Verde Journal;
Americans Home on the Booming Range, in Brazil

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: RIO VERDE, Brazil

 BODY:
Out here in Brazil's big sky country, where the cows outnumber people and the billboards tout weed killers, Douglas Ferrell looks through the window of his air-conditioned tractor cab and sees dollar signs stretching to the horizon.
"I buy new land every year -- you can make 40 percent on your investment out here," said the 40-year-old soy and cotton farmer from Pennsylvania. Starting with a 1,200-acre farm a little over a decade ago, Mr. Ferrell has increased his holdings fivefold, bought 1,100 head of cattle and the latest in tractors and combines, and started construction on the tallest farmhouse -- two stories -- and the biggest grain silos ever seen in these parts. 
 One of his Mennonite neighbors recently cautioned that Mr. Ferrell was getting a "big head." But his success is part of an agricultural boom that is thrusting Brazil into the world's top ranks of food exporters.
Often overshadowed by Brazil's coastal industries, farming has been the country's fastest-growing sector since 1980. Over the last 15 years, farm production increased by 47 percent, while industrial production increased by just 11 percent.
This farming boom has made Brazil one of the world's top five "food powers" despite the fact that since 1980, the acreage under cultivation in Brazil has remained the same, and Government subsidies have been cut in half.
The productivity increases are a result of heavy investment in mechanization, typified by the brand new tractor and combines on Mr. Ferrell's farm.
Critics note that Brazilian agribusiness grows food for export while a large portion of the country's 154 million people go hungry at home.
"How can it be that, in one of the largest grain-exporting nations in the world, we have 32 million people going hungry and 8 million rural workers without land?" asked the Rev. Ricardo Rezende, a Roman Catholic priest who promotes the distribution of land to small Amazon homesteaders.
The World Bank estimates that about 7 percent of Brazilian children under the age of 5 suffer from malnutrition.
Big farmers respond that their efficiency keeps domestic food prices low and that their exports earn Brazil needed foreign exchange.
Brazilian farmers are so successful that they trample national borders in search of cheap land. Today, Brazilian colonists plant and harvest one-third of the soy planted in Bolivia and Paraguay, and own 4 percent of Uruguay's land.
But the region's "Green Revolution" is most visible here in the table-flat lands of the country's midwestern savannah, or cerrado.
"In 20 years, Brazil will be exporting throughout the world food produced in the cerrado," predicted Norman Borlaug, 81, the American agricultural scientist who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for research that helped bring about Asia's "Green Revolution."
Over the last 25 years, grain production in the cerrado has quadrupled to 20 million tons. And farmers only till 15 percent of the arable land in a region with an area equal to that of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain combined.
"I could never have done this back in the States," said Mr. Ferrell, a straightforward man who monitors truck weights from a gauge in his farmhouse kitchen. "Last year, I bought a grain dryer. This year, I'm putting in the two storage bins."
As a North American pioneer in a South American wilderness, Mr. Ferrell played it safe by buying a farm next door to 100 American Mennonite farmers in Rio Verde.
"People used to be kind of rough around here," he recalled of his first visit to Goias state in the 1970's. "You know -- if you don't like 'em, shoot 'em -- that kind of thing."
Posting a farm sign, a plow disk inscribed "Filadelphia Ranch," Mr. Ferrell started farming surrounded by peace-loving neighbors with names like Koehn, Hibner, Mininger and Warkentin. He has seen his land values increase fivefold from the $100 an acre he and his father paid for their initial stake in 1981.
"I have been planting for 13 years, and I have never had a crop failure," Mr. Ferrell said. "Some of the Mennonites have been here almost 30 years and they have never had a crop failure."
With land fertile and cheap, and dependable rains, soy is grown more cheaply in Brazil's midwest than in the American Midwest. But there are considerable obstacles.
"We have a lot of trouble with transportation -- we are awful far from the ports," Mr. Ferrell said, referring to the Atlantic port of Santos, 600 miles southeast of here. Because of poorly maintained highways, a ton of Brazilian soy arrives at Santos costing more than a ton of American soy costs in New Orleans.
Like farmers everywhere, Mr. Ferrell has little use for the flash of big cities. For their annual trip to the States, his family drives five hours to Brasilia, to catch a flight north.
"I went to Rio once, on my honeymoon," he said, referring to Rio de Janeiro, a beach metropolis viewed by many rural Brazilians as their country's sin city. "They stole my pickup truck."

HEADLINE: Income Gap For Sexes Is Seen Wider In Retirement

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
While women usually earn less than men and are more likely to live in poverty, the economic gap between women and men widens in retirement, according to a new study by the Older Women's League.
Although many more women have entered the work force in recent decades, the study found, the gap between the average Social Security benefits paid to women and those paid to men is growing. 
 This year, the average monthly Social Security benefit women received is only 76 percent of the average benefit received by men. In 1970 women received, on average, 78 percent of the men's benefit. Among retired workers receiving Social Security benefits based on their own work records, women's average monthly benefits this year are $538, compared with an average of $858 for men.
The sex gap shows up in other measures, too: In 1993, women over 65 had a median annual income of $8,499 -- 57 percent of the $14,983 median income of older men.
Just 13 percent of women over 65 have private pensions, compared to 33 percent of older men. And the mean private pension for women is $3,940 annually, compared with $7,468 for men, based on a 1994 census report.
Social Security benefits and most private pensions are based on the number of years that a person is employed and the yearly earnings.
The survey by the league, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Washington, confirmed findings from earlier studies that the wage gap between men and women widens with age. While women age 25 to 34 earned 83 percent as much as men their age in 1994, women age 55 to 64 earned only 66 percent as much as their male counterparts.
"This is all a reflection of women having lower wages than men, and that's not changing," said Deborah Briceland-Betts, executive director of the league. "Today's working women seem to be destined to the same poor old age their mothers are having right now."
Because so many women now spend decades building a career, the number of women entitled to Social Security based both on their own work records and those of their husbands has skyrocketed -- from 5 percent of female recipients in 1960 to 25 percent in 1993.
But because women still earn less than men, and are far more likely to work part-time or to take several years off to care for children, their Social Security benefits remain low. Indeed, for most women who get Social Security through their husbands, that benefit, equal to half their husbands' monthly check, is more than the amount they would get based on their own work record.
In fact, the percentage of women drawing Social Security benefits based on their own work records has dropped, from 42 percent in 1970 to about 36 percent in 1993. So most women who work and contribute to Social Security for years receive the same benefits as they would have if they had never held a job.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Help Sought For World Loan Unit

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
Representatives of the world's poorest countries stepped into the growing congressional debate about foreign aid today by issuing a strong appeal to the United States and other donor countries to continue supporting the International Development Agency.
The appeal was made after a meeting of finance ministers from 24 developing countries, known as the Group of 24, which sets the third world's economic agenda just as the Group of Seven sets the industrial world's. The International Development Agency is the unit of the World Bank that tries to encourage development in poor nations by giving them very low-cost loans. 
 N'Goran Niamien, the Finance Minister of the Ivory Coast, headed the Group of 24 meeting and said a need to finance the agency had been "heavily emphasized" in the group's discussions. "We appeal to donors to replenish I.D.A.," he said.
He described the agency as well-managed and said it had "demonstrated its effectiveness." But he acknowledged that the political debate over its future had reached "a crucial point of particular concern" and said it would "be a tragedy if donors do not contribute."
Unlike the World Bank, which borrows its funds on private markets against the credit of its member governments, the International Development Agency receives infusions of government aid, called replenishments, every three years. The agency then offers loans for up to 40 years at a nominal interest rate to countries with average per-capita income of less than $835 a year.
The agency's 10th replenishment, worth $18 billion, is approaching its final year. And while Congress has authorized payment of most of the United States' first two annual contributions of $1.25 billion each, it is preparing to debate the payment for the final year amid growing signs of dissent from Republican leaders.
Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, has proposed phasing out United States contributions to the agency. In the Senate, such contributions must be approved by the Foreign Relations Committee, which is headed by Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is a staunch opponent of foreign aid.
Meanwhile, Representative Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat who is a member of the House Appropriations Committee, wants to block funds for the agency unless it stops lending to China.
Congress is also withholding $60 million from last year's United States contribution for budgetary reasons. And negotiations have just opened among the United States, Japan and other donors on the 11th refunding for the agency, though no agreement has been reached on its size.

HEADLINE: Only a Scant Increase in Employee-Benefit Costs

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
After years of absorbing hefty increases in what they pay for health care and other fringe benefits, the nation's employers seem to have regained control of this prominent business expense.
Benefit costs edged up only two-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter of 1995, the Labor Department reported today, the smallest rise in eight years. 
 Economists said the report was another sign that inflation was likely to remain tame. That is because employee compensation costs rose overall just 2.9 percent in the 12 months through March, the narrowest year-to-year increase for civilian workers since the Government began publishing such figures in 1981.
"This confirms that there's no inflation push from wages," Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich said in an interview. The slight rise in benefits costs reflected employer scale-backs in coverage and greater reliance on health maintenance organizations, as well as requirements that employees shoulder a greater proportion of health costs.
But although growth in pay and benefits was being held to no more than the inflation rate -- retail prices also climbed 2.9 percent over the last 12 months -- bond traders found something else to worry about in indications that the economy might not be as weak as some of them had thought.
The price of long-term Treasury bonds ebbed after the Conference Board, a business-oriented research group, reported that that consumer confidence had jumped in April after a marginal March rise.
"The latest confidence readings show a strong increase in expectations for the next six months," Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's Consumer Research Center, said today in announcing the latest findings. "Over the years, this component of the index has proven to be a reliable forecaster of economic trends."
Based on a survey of 5,000 households, the consumer confidence index rose to 105.5 in April, its highest point in nearly five years, from 100.2 in March. Expectations for the next six month jumped to 97.8 from 90.1 after three straight declines. Assessment of the current situation edged up to 117 after the initial March figure of 117.1 was revised down to 115.3.
Confidence ebbed, however, in four of the nation's nine regions, including the Middle Atlantic states.
Another expansionary sign, at a time when many believe economic growth to be sharply slowing, was a report by the National Association of Realtors showing that sales of existing homes climbed 5.8 percent in March to an annual rate of 3.62 million, as milder weather encouraged buyers.
"The consumer still has some vigor," said Daniel Laufenberg, chief domestic economist at American Express Financial in Minneapolis. "Maybe he hasn't landed yet," Mr. Laufenberg added, alluding to the so-called soft landing that policy makers are seeking to produce in the economy at large after more than a year of rapid growth.
For many economists, though, the surprisingly tame Employment Cost Index warranted the most attention.
Although wages and salaries rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter, slightly more than the December quarter's six-tenths of 1 percent, this was more than offset by the sharp slowdown in benefits costs -- to two-tenths of 1 percent from seven-tenths of 1 percent the previous quarter.
Ed Yardeni of C. J. Lawrence/ Deutsche Bank was particularly impressed by American business' increasing ability to keep its costs under control. Not only did overall compensation costs show the skimpiest increase on record last quarter, he said, but "the benefits-inflation rate has been more than cut in half since 1990." Pay and benefits account for more than two-thirds of total business costs.
According to Albert Schwenk, economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, somewhat more than half the benefits deceleration in the January-March period reflected lower costs for health care. In industries producing goods, benefits fell three-tenths of 1 percent, primarily because workers were paying a larger share out of their own pockets. Often, this takes the form of extra premiums or higher deductibles before insurance kicks in.
Another way that companies save money is by inducing more of their employees to use the less expensive health maintenance organizations, rather than remaining in medical plans with no cost deterrent on which doctors they visit.
In addition, companies saved money was through lower payments to funds that provide for workers injured on the job, Mr. Schwenk said.
The other main benefits area is pension plans, where employers have been rapidly switching from traditional plans providing specific regular benefits for retirees to defined-contribution plans, like 401(k)'s, in which companies often make matching contributions to employee accounts and leave the responsibility for investment decisions to the employee.
Joseph Liro, an economist at S. G. Warburg, called the latest reading of the Employment Cost Index "extraordinarily reassuring" evidence that inflation was likely to remain subdued through the rest of the current business cycle. He suggested that the past pattern of rapidly rising costs in fringe benefits had perhaps been "permanently broken."

HEADLINE: Clinton Pledges to Defend Farm Subsidies

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: AMES, Iowa, April 25

 BODY:
President Clinton came to corn country today to do a little spring planting: he promised to defend Federal farm subsidies from Republican budget cuts as a way of sowing good will in an important political state where he hopes to stave off any challenge to his renomination.
"I don't believe that we ought to destroy the farm support program if we want to keep the family farm" and preserve gains made in recent international trade agreements, the President declared at a daylong conference on rural America sponsored by the Department of Agriculture and Iowa State University here, and broadcast live on public television around the state and nationwide on C-SPAN. 
 "We have a $20 billion surplus in agricultural trade," Mr. Clinton told the gathering of farmers, academics and community groups that also included Vice President Al Gore and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman. "We've got a big trade deficit in everything else. I don't think we ought to give it up.
"Should we modify it, can we improve it?" he asked of the subsidy program. "I'm sure we can. Should we emphasize other things? Of course we should. But our first rule should be: do no harm."
The Republican-controlled Congress has threatened deep cuts in the more than $10 billion in annual Federal farm income and price support programs in its drive to produce a balanced Federal budget, and Mr. Clinton repeated today that deficit reduction remained a necessity. The Administration's own five-year farm plan, now being drafted, is expected to limit crop subsidies to moderate-size farms.
But speaking at this old land-grant college in the middle of a state whose Presidential caucuses will begin the 1996 campaign next winter, Mr. Clinton vowed to hold the line against deep cuts. He also called for more Federal investment in agricultural research, and "a much more serious national effort to focus on what our responsibilities are in the area of rural development in general."
"Washington tends to be much more ideological and partisan than Main Street America," Mr. Clinton said, noting that farm policy faced new challenges because political power had shifted unequivocally to the suburbs. "And we need more of Main Street up there, not more of what's up there down here."
The conference, which parallels a series of economic conferences the White House is holding around the country, was scheduled for last fall but was postponed pending ratification of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The official purpose was governmental, and Mr. Clinton did no fund raising during his 30-hour stay in the state, and his schedule called for him to address the State Legislature. But the White House entourage made a huge impression (The Des Moines Register alone ran six articles about the visit in this morning's edition), the President rallied a cheering field house of Iowa State students this afternoon and politics hung over the trip.
Mr. Clinton's 43 percent victory in the 1992 general election here just equaled his nationwide margin of victory, and he must do well here next year. He did not really contest the Democratic caucuses in 1992, ceding victory to Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, the favorite son, so he did not have the familiarity with voters in a state that values retail politicking that he does in other states, like New Hampshire, where early primaries are held.
Mr. Clinton faces no declared opponent in his renomination effort, and his trip here, as well as others planned to important states in the weeks ahead, is aimed at insuring that he will not. Mark D. Gearan, the White House communications director, who is helping organize the President's political operation, said he hoped to have a coordinator in place here in a few weeks.
Half glasses perched on his nose, the President led 30 panelists through three round-table discussions on topics from mental health to economic development. Mr. Clinton was at his most garrulous, comparing notes with participants like Olive Valdez, a cattle breeder from Colorado who is hoping to start a low-fat, kosher beef packing cooperative. He fielded a question on campaign finance reform from Stephen Garst, who farms 6,000 acres of corn and soybeans in Coon Rapids, Iowa, and whose father, Roswell, played host to Nikita S. Khrushchev in a celebrated visit at the height of the cold war.
"I thought the fact that he came out here means they're at least trying to do something," Mr. Garst said after the conference. "We're not getting rich, and Newt and the boys say, 'Wipe them out, get rid of those terrible subsidies.' It's not that simple."
Mr. Clinton recalled his own youthful experiences on a farm in Arkansas, and here in the land where the tall corn grows, he apparently let hyperbole get the better of him, telling editors of The Register in an interview published today, "I am the only President who knew something about agriculture when I got there." That ignored Presidential agrarians from George Washington to Mr. Clinton's idol, Harry S. Truman, whose ability to plow straight furrows was famous.

HEADLINE: W. L. Eisenberg, 74, A Labor Mediator In 2,000 Disputes

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Dr. Walter L. Eisenberg, an economics professor emeritus at Hunter College who helped settle many labor disputes at the city, state and Federal levels, died on Saturday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 74.
The cause was a heart attack, said Beatrice Kaufman Eisenberg, his wife of 49 years. 
 Over more than three decades, Dr. Eisenberg was engaged as a mediator, arbitrator or fact-finder in some 2,000 labor-management confrontations. At his death, he was a member of the New York State Public Employment Relations Board, which he joined 10 years ago.
He was formerly associated with the city's Board of Collective Bargaining and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Board. He served as chairman and public member of panels and commissions at all levels, dealing with minimum wages, pensions and employment, among other things.
The disputes at hand affected occupations of great diversity, including doctors, nurses and teachers, production and maintenance personnel, airline pilots and iron workers, to name a few.
Walter Eisenberg grew up in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn and graduated in economics from City College in 1941. He held master's and Ph.D. degrees in economics from Columbia University.
He began his career at Hunter College of the City University of New York in 1949 as a lecturer in economics. He was elected department chairman in 1965 and became dean of graduate studies at Hunter in 1972. He retired from the college in 1979, after which he made labor disputes his principal occupation.
He was a former board chairman of Group Health Insurance Inc. He retired from G.H.I. last year after more than 20 years on the board, but at his death was a member of the G.H.I. Home Care Board of Governors.
In addition to his wife, Dr. Eisenberg is survived by a daughter, Debbie Eisenberg Levene of Kitchener, Ont., a son, David, of Leawood, Kan., and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Met Life in Merger Talks With New England Mutual

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and the New England Mutual Insurance Company said yesterday that they are discussing a possible merger.
Both insurers could gain something from a combination. Met Life's insurance sales to middle-income individuals declined last year and the company, which is based in New York, is eager to expand into the more rapidly growing segment of higher-income households that are New England Mutual's forte. New England Mutual, which is based in Boston, could benefit from the financial strength of Met Life, which is eight times its size. 
 The companies have been in talks for a few months, and Met Life executives have already conducted a detailed review of the commercial mortgages and real estate holdings that have bedeviled New England Mutual the last few years.
Problems with those investments are surmountable, the Met Life executives have concluded, and are more than offset by the appeal of New England Mutual's sales force and asset management business. Met Life is also attracted to New England Mutual's computer and back office systems, the handiwork of its chairman, Robert A. Shafto, a former executive at the Electronic Data Systems Corporation.
The talks were first reported yesterday in an article in The Wall Street Journal.
If any agreement is reached, Peter Harrington, a vice president at New England Mutual, said "it would only be on the basis that we retain our separate identity" with the New England Mutual name and Boston headquarters. New England's 3,000 sales agents are contractors who work for general agencies, while Met Life's more than 11,000 agents are its employees, so the companies would keep their sales forces separate.
Another insurance executive involved in the deal who spoke on condition of anonymity said New England could keep its name and identity, but that its policies, would, in effect, be backed by Met Life.
"The merger isn't really about job cuts or economies of scale, it is about Met Life being attracted to the glitter of the high-end market at a time when demographics and competition make it tough to grow in its traditional middle-income market," the executive said.
New England, he said, "wants a partner who is strong enough to take on the real estate without too big a hit to its own ratings."
While executives at the two companies were eager to play down the idea that the merger could result in cost savings as a result of job cuts, some analysts at rating firms said both Met Life and New England needed to pare expenses, with or without a merger. "Both companies need cost savings that they will not get if they adopt a hands-off strategy," said Larry Mayewski, head of life insurance ratings at the A. M. Best Company of Oldwick, N.J.
New England's ratings still qualify as strong, but they have dropped a bit in recent years as bad real estate investments have hurt its profits. The insurer is currently rated A by A. M. Best, the agency's third-highest level, and A+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, its fifth-highest rating. Met Life is rated A+ by A.M. Best and AA+ by S.& P.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Off on Fear Of Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dropped yesterday after a higher-than-expected consumer confidence report, which suggested that inflation could accelerate.
The Conference Board's confidence index in April rose to 105.5 from a revised 100.2 in March. Economists had expected the confidence index to slip to 99.9. 
 A weaker dollar also contributed to the slide, and bonds were under pressure from dealers jockeying for position ahead of yesterday's two-year note auction. When-issued yields as a result gained two to three basis points in early trading, only to break even in the afternoon. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The 30-year bond fell 6/32 to a price of 10321/32 for a yield of 7.32 percent, up from 7.31 percent on Monday.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist of the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said, "Based on Monday's 7.31 percent bond yield close, market participants have come to realize that the combination of a nine-month high in the bond market and a consumer confidence reading that hit a five-year high could not justify yields moving lower."
Mr. Chan called it interesting that the proportional increase in the Conference Board's confidence index (105.5 vs. 100.2) was much greater than the increase in the Michigan sentiment index (93.8 vs. 90.3), "given that the former index was completed with data that covered only the early part of the month."
He agreed that the report certainly increased investor fears about future inflation, but added that some of the components within the index offset that notion.
"Some of the collective bargaining agreement data showed virtually no inflation," Mr. Chan said. "The Labor Department said first-quarter wage increases averaged 1.9 percent for the first year of the contract, lower than the 2.5 in the fourth quarter of last year. Remember, wages account for two-thirds of the cost of producing a product."
Existing-home sales rose 5.8 percent to a 3.62 million annualized rate in March, reversing the 5.3 percent decline in February and a 4 percent drop in January. According to the National Association of Realtors, the increase was the highest since December's 3.76 million yearly rate.
"The 101-basis-point decline in average 30-year mortgage rates, as measured by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation weekly survey, since the middle of December is finally beginning to show up in the economy's most interest-rate- sensitive sector, mainly housing," Mr. Chan said. "It will be just a matter of time before we also see a small bounce-back in other interest sensitive sectors, such as autos."
Robert Perry, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, told reporters after a presentation to the Bankers Association for Foreign Trade in Phoenix yesterday, that despite recent signs of strength in the economy, the outlook for a "soft landing" remained good.
At yesterday's Treasury auction of new two-year notes, the high yield was quoted at 6.524 percent, down from 6.717 percent last month. Ahead of today's auction, the five-year notes were offered at a price to yield 6.78 percent.
In the municipal market, bond prices were steady. Investors eagerly awaited high-income-producing bonds on expectations that the nearly six-month run in municipals may be slowing.
Municipalities sold about $720 million in new securities, up from $180 million on Monday. Many of the offerings yesterday got a mixed reception from investors with yields rising in the government bond market.
Yields on a $150 million California Housing Finance Agency issue, the week's largest offering, were raised as much as 5 basis points to increase demand after initial pricing. A bond due in 2026 was priced to yield 6.45 percent. For an investor in the 36 percent tax bracket, that would be equivalent to a taxable yield of 10.08 percent.
The single-family mortgage revenue bonds were comprised of $100 million in tax-exempt and $50 million in taxable bonds. Underwriters said for some investors the bonds were subject to the Federal alternative minimum tax.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new two-year notes:

Forecasts of Freezing Weather Help Push Wheat Prices Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wheat prices rose strongly yesterday, helped by forecasts for freezing temperatures in the Great Plains.
On other commodity markets, copper extended its losses while crude oil advanced. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities slipped 0.05 point, to 236.63. 
 Wheat for July delivery, the contract that represents this year's crop, jumped 7 cents, to $3.54 a bushel, on the Chicago Board of Trade.
"The crop is so vulnerable and the market's so sensitive to additional damage and potential damage," said Susan Leighty, an analyst with Prudential Securities.
Temperatures will fall to the mid-20's early Thursday in Nebraska and northeastern Colorado, according to the National Weather Service. Temperatures below 24 degrees can damage winter wheat.
Some private meteorologists predicted another bout of freezing temperatures in the Great Plains for early next week.
"A weather market reacts as much to long-range forecasts as to short-range forecasts," Ms. Leighty said.
Nebraska and Colorado wheat was spared by a hard freeze on April 11 that struck southwestern Kansas and the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles. New damage assessments tend to support preliminary estimates that losses from the April 11 freeze could reach 100 million to 150 million bushels, or 4 to 6 percent of the crop in the United States. The Agriculture Department previously estimated the American crop at 2.32 billion bushels.
But it still may be too early to get a handle on the damage, said Joe Victor, director of marketing for Allendale Inc., a futures brokerage firm in Crystal Lake, Ill.
"The bottom line is that we may have to wait until harvest before we get a better damage estimate," he said. "Wheat has done stranger things. It's just like a weed -- once you think you've got it down, it's going to come back."
Copper prices fell sharply for the second consecutive day on the Commodity Exchange of New York on signs of rising supplies and expectations for declining demand as the economy cools.
Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold Inc. reported a 14 percent increase in copper production in the first quarter. The Cyprus Amax Minerals Company reported a 5 percent increase in production of the metal for the first quarter.
The May copper contract fell 2.15 cents, to $1.261 a pound, the lowest daily settlement for near-term deliveries since Nov. 11. Copper prices have dropped 6.6 percent in the last week.
Crude oil rebounded modestly on the New York Mercantile Exchange after an early dip below $20 a barrel prompted fresh buying. June crude oil rose 17 cents, to $20.29 a barrel.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops as Outlook Dims For Action by the Group of 7

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar ended lower against most leading currencies yesterday as expectations faded that the United States and its economic allies would take steps to bolster the value of the dollar.
Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven industrial nations began a meeting in Washington yesterday. On Monday, the dollar gained after dealers bought the currency to hedge their positions on the chance that the nations -- the United States, Germany, Japan, Canada, Britain, France and Italy -- might take some action. 
 But in New York trading late yesterday, dealers sold dollars in anticipation that the meeting would end without any concrete step taken.
"People are anticipating nothing from the G-7 and are positioning themselves accordingly" by selling dollars, said Kevin Weir, currency salesman for ABN-Amro Bank in Chicago.
John McCarthy, foreign exchange manager at ING Capital Markets in New York, said, "They can talk about global issues, but the work will really have to be done in each individual country."
In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 81.82 Japanese yen from 83.10 yen on Monday. The dollar declined to 1.3691 German marks from 1.3762 marks. The British pound rose to $1.6130 from $1.6053.
The decline in the dollar came amid recent signs of discord among the Group of Seven nations concerning monetary policy. While Japanese officials have called for a concerted effort by the group to support the dollar, German and American officials have expressed skepticism that the group can do much to help the beleaguered currency.
"The level of acrimony among G-7 finance ministers has probably never been higher," said Todd Buchholz, an economic official in the Bush Administration who is now president of the G7 Group, a consulting firm.
In an interview with The Des Moines Register on Monday, President Clinton said the only steps that the United States could take to support the dollar were raising interest rates, which he sees as unwise, or cutting the budget deficit further, which he pledged to do.
Japan's trade surplus is partly responsible for the dollar's weakness, and dollar purchases by central banks can do little to halt the dollar's slide, he said.

HEADLINE: The Nobel Laureates on Life

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, April 25

 BODY:
In an event its moderator, Ted Koppel, said was quintessentially American because it was "planned within an inch of its life," eight Nobel laureates in literature gathered here for discussions that covered subjects that seemed anything but planned. Indeed, if there was a theme to the two days of discussions that ended today, it revolved around the virtues of uncertainty and the unpredictable, which many of these noted writers extolled, as they did the power of myth in both life and art.
"Articulation is about precision, and once you get precise you are uncertain," said the ever-enigmatic and epigrammatic Joseph Brodsky, the Russian-born poet, who now lives in the United States and was the Nobel winner in 1987 and this country's poet laureate in 1991. 
 Wole Soyinka, the alternately mystical and didactic exiled Nigerian writer who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1986, said, "Literature eschews absolutes and opens the human mind to the possibility of error."
Toni Morrison, the 1993 Nobelist, described herself as "enchanted by enchantment."
But perhaps it was the Japanese novelist Kenzaburo Oe, the Nobel winner last year, who summed up the interplay of myth and uncertainty in literature.
"It is the second job of literature to create myth," he said through an interpreter. "But its first job is to destroy that myth."
More than 1,000 people attended these freewheeling conversations on a stage at the Carter Presidential Center here. This was the last event of a multiyear Cultural Olympiad sponsored by The Georgia Review and the Atlanta Committee on the Olympic Games as part of the run up to the 1996 Summer Olympics, to be held in Atlanta. Its organizers said this was the largest gathering of Nobel literature laureates in the 94-year history of the prize.
Jeffrey Babcock, the director of the Olympic committee's cultural programs, noted that in recent years the cultural programs held by the host cities had centered on the performing arts. But Atlanta sought to create a four-year, multidisciplinary arts, entertainment and literature program to culminate with the Olympic Arts Festival, which is to coincide with the Summer Games.
Historically, culture was no stranger to the Olympic Games, said Rita Dove, the 1993 and 1994 American poet laureate who helped to organize this event, which, in addition to the panel discussions, included afternoon and evening readings by the laureates. During the Games in ancient Greece, she noted, there were music and literary competitions as well as appearances by writers looking for new and broader audiences for their work.
The gathering also included Czeslaw Milosz, the 83-year-old Polish-Lithuanian poet and 1980 Nobel Prize winner, who has lived in the United States for 35 years; the French novelist Claude Simon, 81, who won in 1985; the Mexican poet, essayist and diplomat Octavio Paz, 81, who won in 1990, and the poet and playwright Derek Walcott, 65, of Trinidad, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1992.
Mr. Koppel was right as far as advance preparations were concerned. The rigid planning of the event could be seen in the squadrons of Cadillacs that chauffeured the laureates from place to place and the small army of Olympic committee staff members with walkie-talkies, who reported the movements of the writers minute by minute. The air at the conference crackled with radio static as well as the artful and finely tuned words of the participants.
The event was also suffused with a cordiality and conviviality among the famous participants. On Saturday night, after their arrival, the laureates spent their time together watching the heavyweight title fight between George Foreman and Axel Schulz on television. On Monday, they lingered over a private luncheon at which they staged a mock "revolt of the laureates" on Mr. Brodsky's behalf to win this taciturn chain smoker the right to smoke in the usually nonsmoking Carter Center dining room.
There were small kindnesses and evident pleasures in their encounters. Sitting on a panel discussion next to Mr. Brodsky, Ms. Morrison poured him a glass a water while he spoke. Mr. Milosz openly expressed an almost childlike joy at finally meeting Mr. Soyinka, whom he said he had long admired.
Pulling together such a group, whose members crave their solitude, was a formidable task, said Stanley W. Lindberg, the editor of The Georgia Review, who thought of this in the first place.
"Our biggest problem was getting their attention," he said. "Derek is so casual about answering his mail and Toni Morrison has so many invitations. We promised Derek that he could carry the Olympic torch to get him here, and Rita Dove helped us get Ms. Morrison's attention."
The original concept, he said, was to get all 16 of the living Nobel laureates in literature, from the oldest, the 94-year-old Halldor Laxness, who lives in a nursing home in Reykjavik, Iceland, to the youngest, Mr. Brodsky, 54. But that proved impossible.
Through the two days of discussions, the laureates touched on subjects ranging from the role of the writer in society to the impact of the Nobel Prize on their lives. They talked of the lessons for the world in the Oklahoma City bombing, the Rwandan massacres and the fighting in Bosnia. They spoke of multiculturalism and political correctness and the opposing forces of universalism and particularism that are at the heart of so many conflicts.
Most scoffed at a specific role for artists. As Ms. Morrison said, "It is painful having agendas cut out for writers."
As for prizes, they were all accidents, said Mr. Paz. And multiculturalism and political correctness were imprecise terms most said they would like to see banished from the language, any language.
Mr. Koppel, who took to calling the laureates "G.W.'s" -- for Great Writers -- said he saw the bombing in Oklahoma City partly as a result of a society grown inarticulate and unused to expressing itself with language. The media aftermath, particularly television coverage, was seen as adding insult to this injury. Mr. Oe called it "pseudo-communication."
Mr. Soyinka said he was "concerned about preserving a special level of communications, a level very different from Oprah Winfrey." "There is a danger when we make a fetish out of communication," he added.
The curmudgeon of the gathering was Mr. Simon, the urbane Frenchman who seemed to reject all analysis of things current. In response to a question about what role literature could play along with economics, science and technology in improving society, he responded ambiguously through an interpreter, the poet Richard Howard, that "literature is of no use for anything at all, like Mozart."
There were lighter moments, of course. On Monday, the Cultural Olympiad organizers received a message from Sharon Stone, the actress who is filming in Savannah, Ga. She offered to send a chartered plane to pick up Mr. Paz so he could have lunch with her. She said she was a big fan of this writer, adding that she was also fluent in Spanish.
But his schedule did not allow Mr. Paz, who said he was unfamiliar with Ms. Stone's work, to make the trip. His longtime translator, Eliot Weinberger, a New York writer and essayist, volunteered to be Mr. Paz's stand-in. Sadly though, Mr. Weinberger said, he was informed that Ms. Stone's stand-in was not available to join him.

HEADLINE: With Budget Due, Giuliani Faces Gap Of Over $3 Billion

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
As Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani prepares to present his second city budget tomorrow, administration officials said yesterday that New York City's budget gap now exceeds $3 billion, forcing the Mayor to propose still deeper cuts in spending by the city's agencies.
The gap is now nearly $400 million above the $2.7 billion shortfall the Mayor projected just two months ago. At $3.1 billion, the gap represents about 10 percent of the budget for the fiscal year that starts in July. 
 City officials said the budget gap has widened largely because Medicaid costs have been higher than projected and because other spending in areas like overtime for city workers has exceeded projections as well.
To make up most of the projected shortfall, the Mayor will propose slashing spending by city agencies by nearly $400 million more than he proposed in February, for a total of about $1 billion, the officials said. He is also hoping that the state budget, when it is passed, will include changes that will save the city about $700 million in welfare and Medicaid payments. Other strategies for closing the gap will include seeking pay and benefit concessions from unions representing city workers.
The latest fiscal problems emerged on a day when hundreds of demonstrators, protesting planned budget cuts by the city and the state, blocked two bridges and two tunnels in Manhattan during the height of the rush hour. [Page B3.]
The Mayor is to present his executive budget to the City Council tomorrow. The budget, officials said, would largely reflect the outlines of the preliminary budget he unveiled in February but would include significant changes as well.
Among them, Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that he had backed away from two proposals in his preliminary budget plan last February. The first was to eliminate the sales tax on clothing that costs less than $100. The other was to reduce property taxes on co-ops and condominiums.
In a meeting yesterday with the editorial board of The New York Times, the Mayor said he would instead propose equivalent reductions in the commercial rent tax for small businesses throughout the city, eliminating that tax altogether on small businesses other than those below 96th Street in Manhattan, which fall under a different classification under this city tax regulation.
The Mayor's decision would, in effect, shift the benefits of his $185 million in proposed tax cuts away from shoppers and co-op owners and give them instead to a far smaller pool of people -- small-business owners.
Under the Mayor's plan, a typical small business in Brooklyn, whose rent totaled $50,000 a year, would no longer have to pay $3,000 in taxes. By contrast, a shopper buying a $100 shirt would save $4 if the city exempted clothing under $100 from its sales tax, which totals 4 percent.
The Council may oppose these tax cuts. Last month, Council leaders said the city should scale back Mr. Giuliani's cuts -- unless he could find a way to offer them without drastically reducing city services.
Aides to Mr. Giuliani said the Mayor decided to delay the tax cuts for clothing and co-ops and condos for at least a year because he was not sure that the State Legislature would approve the changes.
But the city can reduce the commercial rent tax on its own.
"We can't control what happens in Albany," one official said.
In fact, Albany figures prominently in the Mayor's efforts to close the budget gap. In his executive budget, the Mayor will scale back the savings he had hoped to receive from the state's cuts in Medicaid and welfare. The scope of those changes are still under debate by Gov. George E. Pataki and legislative leaders.
The city budget, officials said, would anticipate $700 million in savings from Medicaid and welfare. The city and the state would share those costs. The Mayor's initial plan had called for $1.2 billion, but it has been clear for some time that neither the Governor nor the Legislature would make cuts that deep.
The Mayor's new figure, the officials said, generally reflected the amount the city would save under the agreement reached between Mr. Pataki and the Republicans in the State Senate. But if the Democratic-led Assembly's position prevails, the city's savings would be even less.
The officials said the Mayor would also propose $250 million in new aid from the state, in areas like school busing, nursing home care, prison costs and general aid for local governments. It remains far from certain that the city will receive all of that, which means the budget gap could turn out to be even larger.
The city's budget gap has grown steadily since the Mayor and the Council adopted the budget for the current year last June.
Budget gaps reflect the difference between projected revenues and projected spending in years ahead; they are notoriously variable, rising and falling depending on a variety of economic and political assumptions.
The latest projected gap reflected estimates by the city's fiscal monitors, including the City and State Comptrollers, who have held that the Mayor's office had made overly optimistic assumptions of state aid and had underestimated costs.
The new gap began the fiscal year at $900 million and has since grown step by step, largely because of a $500 million decline in city tax revenues, a drop in anticipated Federal and state aid, and $300 million in added pension costs.
The latest increase, officials said, reflected unexpected increases in spending that will carry from this fiscal year into the next. Those include overtime and increased costs for city Medicaid payments because the Health and Hospitals Corporation has been more effective at seeking Medicaid reimbursements, of which the city pays a quarter share.
In February, the Mayor proposed a $30.5 billion budget, which represented a cut of $1.3 billion, or 4 percent, in total city spending from the current year, the largest percentage cut since the Depression.
The leadership of the City Council yesterday briefed its members on its own draft recommendations for cuts in Medicaid and welfare, which would save the city $150 million less than the Mayor's new position. The Mayor's office had sought to persuade the Council to join with it in lobbying Albany to accept the Mayor's proposals.


GRAPHIC: City officials have again revised the projected budget gap for the next fiscal year, which begins in July. Below, with the dates and projections, are the administration's previous projections and their explanations.
 
October '94
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani says cuts will begin to reduce the city's recurring $2 billion deficits.
 
December '94
Officials attribute the increase to a revised estimate of city pension payments, and to the recognition that the Republican victories in November will probably mean that no additional state or Federal aid is likely.
 
February '95
As the Mayor releases a preliminary budget plan, officials attribute the change to sagging tax collections and rising social-service costs and declining estimates of state and Federal aid.
 
Yesterday
As the Mayor prepares to release his full budget proposal, officials attribute the change to increased Medicaid costs and other new expenses like unexpected overtime payments for city workers. (pg. B3)

U.S. AND 6 ALLIES VOW NEW EFFORTS TO REVIVE DOLLAR

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
The United States and six other leading industrial nations declared today that the dollar's decline had gone "beyond the levels justified by underlying economic conditions in the major countries," and they made a vague promise to strengthen both short-term tactics and long-term strategy to reverse its fall.
After days of recriminations among the economic powers over who is responsible for the turmoil in world currency markets, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin hailed the statement -- issued after a meeting of finance ministers and central bank chiefs of the Group of Seven -- as a strong signal of mutual resolve to reverse the dollar's decline. 
 "It was really a very constructive set of meetings in a constructive atmosphere," Mr. Rubin said at a news conference tonight at the Treasury Department. "Among those people, the people with real responsibility, there was a real spirit of cooperative enterprise."
But the most specific wording in the declaration was that the nations "agreed that orderly reversal of those movements is desirable," and it was unclear whether that by itself would be sufficient to reverse the dollar's slide.
As the ministers met today, the dollar, which has lost almost 17 percent of its value against the Japanese yen in three months, fell again, to 81.82 yen in late New York trading, down from 83.10 yen on Monday. [In afternoon trading in Tokyo on Wednesday, the dollar regained some ground, rising to 82.38 yen, up 0.55 yen.]
Part of the recent decline may have been precipitated by President Clinton's opposition to a rise in American interest rates to attract more investment and stimulate demand for dollars.
The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, has repeatedly called for such an increase.
"We aren't going to do ourselves any good to spark a recession here at home by raising interest rates further," Mr. Clinton said in an interview that was published today in The Des Moines Register, before a daylong visit to Iowa. The President plays no direct role in setting rates, but his comments appeared part of a broader effort by Administration officials recently to pressure the Federal Reserve Board, for fear that another rise could send the economy into a downturn as the early 1996 primaries approach.
Mr. Clinton insisted that investors around the world had failed to appreciate his commitment to cutting the budget deficit. Some foreign critics cite the growing deficit as the main reason for the dollar's slide.
"Once the financial markets see that I am serious, that we're not about to have a $200 billion tax cut, and we're certainly not about to have a tax cut of any size -- not one red cent -- that is basically an add-on to this deficit, then they will stabilize and go forward," he said.
All day today the markets were jittery, with traders betting that the finance ministers and central bankers would issue a vague, soothing statement and that it would have little effect. Yet no one wanted to be caught out of the markets on the off-chance that the economic powers would decide that their discord was worsening the situation.
The officials ended up with something in between. It is somewhat unusual for the finance ministers to issue a communique after a meeting, but American and Japanese officials said today that a consensus had quickly emerged at the meeting in favor of making a statement.
However, it was short on specifics about how the countries would cooperate -- by joint intervention in the markets or by a rededication to economic fundamentals -- and it may not convince investors that bickering over the currency turmoil has been resolved.
France's Finance Minister, Edmond Alphandery, made clear tonight that he did not believe the statement went far enough. "If it had been drafted by us -- and this goes even more so for the Japanese -- it would have been much more specific," he said.
Asked if the ministers failed to go far enough, Mr. Rubin said of the statement, "I don't think it is bland. I think if you read it with some care, it's a very interesting statement." His aides said it marked the first time that the nations had agreed on a direction of action, if not the action.
Japanese officials acknowledged the absence of a concrete plan to rescue the dollar but still sought to portray the meeting as successful. Masayoshi Takemura, Japan's Finance Minister, emphasized at a news conference tonight that the communique spoke of reversing the dollar's downward movement, rather than simply halting it.
"This movement goes beyond the economic fundamentals," said Mr. Takemura, who became Finance Minister last year in a political deal that brought Japan's current coalition Government to power.
Germany's Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, said that the countries did not seriously consider resurrecting agreements to manage global currencies as they had in the 1980's.
All the Group of Seven members -- the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, Britain and Italy -- hope their statement will squeeze speculators out of the market by raising fear that a worldwide consensus is building that the dollar has fallen too far.
"The major currencies are out of step with the fundamentals," Mr. Rubin said today. But private capital flows so dwarf the resources that governments can commit to stabilizing currencies that the ministers' chief power is persuasion.
Asked today why the group did not commit to joint action, Mr. Rubin, a former currency trader, said, "I don't think you can arrange anything in a currency market."
The question now is whether the persuasive force will be sufficient. "I think everyone has the sense that empty commentary is only going to send things lower," said David De Rosa, who directs foreign exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York.
The Administration is also trying to deflect calls for an interest-rate rise out of fear that it could kill off a soft landing for the economy.
For their part, Fed officials have played down the possibility of inflation's rising even as the falling dollar make imports more expensive for Americans.
Asked this morning if there was a risk of more inflation from the weak dollar, Alan S. Blinder, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, replied, "There is a little bit." He quickly modified his answer to "some" risk when a reporter suggested that his initial comment indicated a lack of concern about the possibility.
In the weeks leading to today's meeting, it seemed likely that the other economic powers were preparing criticism of the United States for its tactics in orchestrating the Mexican bailout, which included pressuring countries to back a larger emergency commitment for Mexico from the International Monetary Fund.
At the time, several nations complained that they had not been consulted. And in recent days, German officials have repeatedly said that a bailout of such magnitude must be "exceptional," and that the industrial nations could not regularly save emerging economies.
The criticisms were muted, however, by a surprising turn of events: Evidence is emerging that the Mexican bailout is working to some degree. The peso has strengthened in recent days, and Mexican officials say that their economy and finances have turned the corner.

Pretax Profits at Hoechst Surge in Quarter

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

 BODY:
The German chemicals company Hoechst A.G. said yesterday that its first-quarter pretax profit had nearly doubled. It cited improving business environments in Europe, Japan and the United States. In the first three months of the year, the company reported pretax profit of 984 million marks, or $720.6 million, up from 506 million marks in the corresponding period last year. 
 Hoechst attributed the 94 percent rise in earnings to economic recovery in Western Europe, reviving industrial production in Japan and economic growth in the United States and in emerging economies. Sales rose 8 percent to 13 billion marks, or $9.52 billion, from 12 billion marks.

HEADLINE: Mr. Rubin Says No

 BODY:
The dollar has fallen about 10 percent against the German mark and 20 percent against the Japanese yen, frightening German and Japanese exporters who fear their products will be priced out of the huge American market. It is no surprise, then, that the German and Japanese Finance Ministers -- meeting this week in Washington with their counterparts from five other industrialized powers -- insist that the United States correct the problem by raising interest rates.
It is no surprise, either, that Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin rejects the plea out of hand since raising rates would threaten to end the nation's economic recovery. The non-specific declaration issued yesterday by the ministers does little to resolve this dispute. 
 The best policy America can pursue for its allies is one that keeps inflation low and employment high. Low inflation will eventually keep the value of the dollar from fluctuating wildly and thereby destabilizing trade. High employment will keep demand for foreign-made goods high. What Mr. Rubin correctly points out is that America has already done what it should; employment growth is higher here than in Europe or Japan and inflation remains low, less than 3 percent per year.
The Germans say the United States should cut back Federal borrowing in order to take pressure off the dollar, but Mr. Rubin rightly points out that the Federal deficit, measured against the size of the economy, is smaller here than in Europe.
The Federal Reserve Board, which bears responsibility for keeping the economy on an even keel, has jacked up interest rates for a year because it feared inflation was about to kick higher. It postponed further hikes last month out of fear it might go too far and tip the economy into a downturn. Perhaps the Fed exaggerates the threat, but its judgment over the past few years has been sound. For the Fed now to push rates higher against its best judgment is to risk something far worse than dollar weakness: it risks triggering a recession here, which could drag Europe and Japan closely behind.
The country whose policies ought to change is Japan. Its economy is stagnant, inflation nonexistent and trade balance in surplus. For the sake of the Japanese people, as well as its trade partners, Japan ought to undertake monetary and fiscal easing. Instead it calls on the United States to adopt a self-defeating policy that threatens to wound itself and others.

HEADLINE: McNamara Took a Long Step to Heal Our Vietnam Wound

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Mr. McNamara's War" (editorial, April 12) you savagely attack Robert S. McNamara's acknowledgment of error in Vietnam as "prime-time apology and stale tears," declaring that he "must not escape the lasting moral condemnation of his countrymen." 
 No mea culpa deserves such contempt. It is true that his comes late -- very late -- but it should be saluted, not scorned. This country can never be truly reunited until the Vietnam wound is closed. Mr. McNamara, by his admission, has taken a long step toward the healing. What he needs now is company. The Presidents of those years are dead, but most of the other warlords are still among us. Let's hear from them.
You state: "Fifty-eight thousand Americans got to come home in body bags. Mr. McNamara, while tormented by his role in the war, got a sinecure at the World Bank and summers at the Vineyard."
These are the facts. Robert S. McNamara became Secretary of Defense on Jan. 21, 1961, and resigned on Nov. 29, 1967. On Jan. 19, 1968 -- nearly two months later -- the United States high command reported the total number of Americans killed in Vietnam as 16,459.
Our bloodiest years in Vietnam lay ahead. By the end of 1969 there would be 39,893 dead. Your final figure is correct: 58,135. But that was more than six years after Mr. McNamara left the Pentagon. So if it was Mr. McNamara's war, was it not also Mr. Rusk's? Mr. Bundy's? Mr. Clifford's? Mr. Rostow's? Mr. Laird's? And -- last, but certainly not least -- Mr. Kissinger's?
As writers we have always taken a solemn view of our responsibilities as Americans. Fifty years ago we served in the United States Marine Corps. We vigorously denounced the war in Vietnam -- though never the brave men who fought there -- and we openly, often bitterly, disagreed with all who were prosecuting it, including Robert McNamara.
We welcome his acknowledgment that the United States was wrong then, believing that America can never be damaged by an act of contrition, and we invite all those who stood with him to join him now on his knees.

HEADLINE: Private Chefs for Busy People Who Like Their Meatloaf

BYLINE: By ANNE S. LEWIS 

 BODY:
WHEN Stephanie Hersh got her first job as a private chef for a family of four in Milton, Mass., in 1989, she did what she thought private chefs do: she spent each day preparing haute cuisine for dinner. At the end of the first week, her employer sat her down and said they needed to talk about menus.
As Ms. Hersh recalled it, her employer was reassuring but firm, telling her: "Not that this hasn't been wonderful -- it's just not the way we eat. We like foods like macaroni and cheese and meatloaf and lasagna." And so, Ms. Hersh promptly switched gears and began making simpler meals. 
 There was a time when private chefs provided five-course meals for the leisure class. Now, both the clientele and the cuisine are changing. Because of time-crunched, nutritionally conscious, two-career families, a new breed of private chef has been spawned: one who goes into a home and cooks affordable meals that are meant to appeal to those who are tired of restaurant and takeout food.
Now, there is even a business-support association for those wishing to start a personal chef service: the United States Personal Chef Association, which has 650 members in 46 states. It was founded in 1991 by David MacKay and his wife, Susan Titcomb, who is a personal chef in Albuquerque, N.M.
Work as a personal chef usually offers an easier life than restaurants. Four days a week, Nancy Davis, a former restaurant chef who runs a personal chef service in Austin, Tex., called Chef on the Run, dons her chef fatigues, loads her car with cooking equipment and groceries, and spends the day cooking in clients' kitchens -- a venue she says she vastly prefers to a restaurant kitchen, with its high stress level and nighttime hours, which make social life difficult.
Ms. Davis leaves 10 individually packaged entrees and side dishes for two in the refrigerators of those clients who are on an every-other-week schedule. Her portions are large, and clients sometimes stretch two meals from one. Although she makes things like lemon-grass chicken and crayfish enchiladas, she will also accommodate blander palates. Her charge is $260 for 10 meals for two people.
For nine years, Susan Goldstein of Personally Prepared by Susan, in Brighton, Mass., has been shopping and cooking for up to 15 clients. Three days a week, she cooks in the kitchens of her biweekly clients, spending five to seven hours shopping for food and cooking up to 10 meals. The other days, she serves her monthly clients, leaving them food for up to 30 meals in the freezer as well as heating and serving instructions.
Ms. Goldstein, 35, offers her clients menus with salads; vegetables; fish, meat and poultry entrees; pasta sauces and marinades; pizzas, and lasagnas. She will also cook anything on request; her service is tailored to each family's needs. Some clients ask her to prepare recipes from magazines or cookbooks. Her typical client, she said, is a dual-income professional couple with two to three children. For her services, Ms. Goldstein charges $25 an hour plus food costs.
It often happens that clients who are initially skeptical about the prospect of a stranger in their kitchen cooking what they fear could turn out to be no more than expensive Lean Cuisine quickly become converts to the luxury of sitting down to professionally prepared meals within minutes of arriving home from work.
Cindy Dade, an insurance agent, and her husband, Ronald Dade, an investment adviser, have been clients of Ms. Goldstein for five years. "We work long hours," Ms. Dade said, "and the last thing I want to do when I get home is have a bowl of cereal and go to bed. We want real meals, but I don't enjoy cooking when there's no time." She added that low-fat, healthy meals were a high priority.
For the Dades, who live in Amherst, Mass., having a private chef is a luxury without drawbacks. But, she admitted, "when it's time to choose menus and I say to myself, 'O.K., you can have anything in the world you want to eat, so what is it?' -- sometimes it's hard to say."
Steven Shavell, a law professor, and Catherine Shavell, a lawyer, enjoy the additional family time they gain from hiring Ms. Goldstein to cook meals every two weeks in their Cambridge, Mass., home.
"When you look at the economics, it's a bargain compared to going out to eat three times a week," Mr. Shavell said. "Even so, most people regard us as somewhat extravagant, and the notion of having someone come to your home to cook is considered a bit much." Still, he said he and his wife would prefer to eliminate other household services, like gardening and snow removal, rather than the chef service.
Members of the United States Personal Chef Association are not required to be trained chefs -- though some are -- and they range from retired jewelers to hairdressers and former military personnel. Business memberships cost $99 a year, and the association sells training systems ($595 to $895 a year), software packages ($49.95) and packages of tested recipes ($249).
"All that's required is a passion for cooking," Mr. MacKay said.
Members charge $8 to $13 a person for each meal. The names of personal chefs in given areas can be obtained by calling the association at (800) 995-2138.

HEADLINE: HIGH COURT KILLS LAW BANNING GUNS IN A SCHOOL ZONE

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
The Supreme Court today dealt a stinging blow to the Federal Government's ability to move into the realm of local law enforcement, ruling in a bitterly divided 5-to-4 decision that Congress acted beyond its constitutional authority five years ago when it made possession of a gun within 1,000 feet of a school a Federal crime.
The decision, with a majority opinion by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, was based on the Court's interpretation of the authority of Congress to regulate interstate commerce. While not overturning any precedents, the decision marked a sharp departure from the modern Supreme Court's expansive view of Congressional power to regulate commerce. 
 Justice Stephen G. Breyer, in a dissenting opinion, said the decision "threatens legal uncertainty in an area of law that, until this case, seemed reasonably well settled."
The Constitution's grant of authority to Congress to regulate interstate commerce has been the basis for the development of the Federal Government in many of its most familiar aspects, particularly since the Supreme Court reversed course in 1937 and began to uphold the regulatory laws at the heart of the New Deal.
The last time the Court overturned a Federal law on the ground that it exceeded the Congressional commerce authority was 1936, when it struck down minimum-wage and maximum-hour requirements in the coal industry.
The ruling today, declaring unconstitutional the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, cast doubt on the ability of Congress to exercise jurisdiction over a range of activities it has recently defined as Federal crimes, including car jacking, drive-by shootings and violent demonstrations at abortion clinics.
Unlike the law the Court struck down today, which made it a crime simply to have a gun in a particular place, most Federal gun laws regulate activities like buying, selling or importing guns, activities that fall within the classic definition of interstate commerce and that the ruling today did not disturb.
But at the least, the decision is likely to encourage a new round of legal challenges to other gun control laws. "Everything will be tested now," one Congressional aide said.
For example, one recently enacted Federal law, the ban on assault weapons, which is already the subject of a Federal court challenge by the National Rifle Association, makes it a crime to possess the weapons as well as to manufacture or import them. Possession of machine guns, undetectable handguns and "cop-killer" bullets are also crimes under various Federal laws that may now be open to legal attack.
The Brady law, which imposes a five-day waiting period for gun purchases and requires state officials to conduct background checks of purchasers, has already been declared unconstitutional in a half-dozen Federal district courts. The basis for those decisions, which the Clinton Administration is appealing, was not the Congressional commerce power but state autonomy under the 10th Amendment, which reserves to the states the powers not explicitly delegated to the Federal Government by the Constitution.
While that is a different rationale than the one the Court employed today, the 10th Amendment and the commerce clause are closely related elements of an ongoing constitutional debate over state power within the Federal system.
The language of federalism rang strongly through Chief Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion, as well as in a concurring opinion filed by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor. Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who filed his own concurring opinion, were the other members of the majority.
Joining Justice Breyer in dissenting were Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Breyer took the unusual step of reading from the bench this morning a portion of the dissenting opinion he wrote for himself and the three others. Justices Stevens and Souter filed their own dissenting opinions as well. Justice Stevens called the majority ruling "extraordinary."
In his majority opinion, Chief Justice Rehnquist said the Administration's arguments for upholding the Gun-Free School Zones Act "would bid fair to convert Congressional authority under the commerce clause to a general police power of the sort retained by the states."
The Chief Justice said the law was "a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with 'commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms." He rejected the Administration's argument that guns and violence in schools hurt the economy by undermining the educational process and making children less productive workers and citizens.
"If we were to accept the Government's arguments, we are hard-pressed to posit any activity by an individual that Congress is without power to regulate," Chief Justice Rehnquist said. By the same logic, he added, school curriculums and state laws governing divorce and child custody would also come under Federal control.
In his dissenting opinion, Justice Souter accused the majority of having abandoned the principles of judicial restraint. He urged his colleagues to remember the "painful lesson" of the New Deal era, when the Court's activism in striking down Federal laws under the commerce clause brought the Court into disrepute and under sustained political attack.
"It seems fair to ask whether the step taken by the Court today does anything but portend a return to the untenable jurisprudence from which the Court extricated itself almost 60 years ago," Justice Souter said.
One lesson from that period, he said, was that "nothing about the judiciary as an institution made it a superior source of policy on the subject Congress dealt with."
In the dissenting opinion that Justices Souter, Stevens and Ginsburg also joined, Justice Breyer said the decision "threatens legal uncertainty" in legal matters that until now "seemed reasonably well settled." His opinion included a 17-page appendix listing studies and reference works on violence in the schools and on the connection between education and the economy.
"Why could Congress, for commerce clause purposes, not consider schools as roughly analogous to commercial investments from which the nation derives the benefit of an educated work force?" Justice Breyer asked.
One question the majority left unresolved was whether the Gun-Free School Zones Act might have been upheld had Congress, in passing the legislation, included the references and detailed argument that the dissenting Justices provided.
Some passages in Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion could be read as indicating that a more detailed rationale for the legislation -- not by Government lawyers defending it in Court but by those sponsoring and voting for it at the time -- could have bolstered the case that education was sufficiently connected with the national economy to come within Congressional authority.
But other part of the opinion appeared to look the other way, both with respect to the question at hand and to the broader issue of structural limits on Federal power over the states. The outer limits of Congressional authority under the commerce clause "always will engender legal uncertainty," he said, adding, "The Constitution mandates this uncertainty by withholding from Congress a plenary police power that would authorize enactment of every type of legislation."
Federal actions like caps on medical malpractice awards, which have been approved by the House of Representatives and are being debated in the Senate, will be open to challenge under today's ruling if they ever become law because this area of law is historically a state preserve with a limited connection to interstate commerce. The pending legislation also includes limits on damage awards for defective products, which would be likely to survive a challenge because products move in interstate commerce.
The decision, United States v. Lopez, No. 93-1260, upheld a 1993 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans. That court overturned the conviction of a San Antonio high school student, Alfonso Lopez Jr., for violating the Gun-Free School Zones Act by carrying a concealed .38-caliber pistol and five bullets to school. The appellate court invalidated the law, calling it "a singular incursion by the Federal Government into territory long occupied by the states."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Adds To List of Cuts For Spending

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Raising the specter of harsh new spending cuts for New York City's schools, hospitals, libraries and museums, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has identified more than $400 million in additional cuts he says he would make, should the city fail to receive enough help from the state to close its yawning budget gap, officials said yesterday.
The contingency cuts, the officials said, were intended to put pressure on Gov. George E. Pataki and legislative leaders, particularly Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, to include $950 million in savings and aid in the state budget that Mr. Giuliani has proposed to balance the city's budget. 
 But even before the Mayor could formally unveil the contingency list as part of his budget proposal today, there were indications that he might be turned down in Albany.
Asked specifically about the Mayor's request for additional aid yesterday, Mr. Pataki said: "The state is obviously facing a $5 billion deficit. It's very difficult for us to increase spending beyond what is already proposed, but we're certainly willing to look at it."
At the same time, a budget bill was passed last night in the Assembly that its Democratic leaders said would give the city $655 million in the new fiscal year -- far short of the Mayor's requests.
The Assembly's bill would reduce the city's savings from Medicaid and welfare cuts, but give the city new aid in areas like schools and transportation. Some of the new aid, however, would be earmarked for specific programs and thus could not be used to close the city's budget shortfall.
Even as the Assembly passed its version of the state budget in Albany, the Mayor and Mr. Silver continued their feud over aid for the city.
Mr. Giuliani said the Speaker's resistance to state cuts in entitlement spending would force still deeper reductions in city services.
"For every dollar that Shelly Silver puts back in entitlement spending, that's a dollar we have to take out of city services," Mr. Giuliani said. "There aren't many trade-offs left in the budget."
The Speaker's spokeswoman, Patricia Lynch, responded: "The Mayor should refrain from his partisan shots and concentrate on governing instead. He's participating in nothing more than Republican campaign rhetoric."
The exchange and the contingency cuts underscored the extent to which the Mayor's ability to balance the city budget for the fiscal year that begins in July will rely on actions taken in Albany.
The Mayor's Budget Director, Marc V. Shaw, declined to specify the contingency cuts. But other officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said they would hack away at highly visible services used by thousands of New Yorkers.
The reductions, the officials said, included a $60 million cut in the city's contribution to the Health and Hospitals Corporation. Spending for libraries would be reduced, forcing branches to lower the number of days they are open from six to five. The Cultural Affairs Department, which allocates funds to museums and arts groups, would face a 40 percent reduction in its proposed $80 million budget. That number already represents an 18 percent cut from this year.
Mr. Shaw insisted that this was not a false, doomsday list of the sort Mr. Giuliani has criticized in the past. When the trustees of the City University of New York warned that city and state budget cuts would have dire effects, the Mayor called their tactic the "Washington Monument" strategy: floating the worst-case scenario that was unlikely ever to be enacted as a scare tactic.
But Mr. Shaw said the Mayor would have no other choice but to follow through with these cuts if the city failed to receive the aid being sought from Albany.
"What this is all about is making relative choices," he said.
For his part, Mr. Giuliani said his new budget, the second for his administration, would set the city on a course toward lasting balance. It would be the first, he said, to detail plans to close the recurring budget gaps that have dogged the city since the late 1980's. In fact, he said, his multiyear plan will leave the city with budget surpluses in the years ahead.
"The plan that we put out for tomorrow will for the first time in some time produce structural balance for the city," Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference on Staten Island.
Raymond D. Horton, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private group financed by businesses, said it was premature to predict victory over the city's budget woes until the reductions in expenses proved to be recurring -- not simply temporary squeezing that could allow spending simply to rise again.
Ending the city's yearly budget gaps "is highly unlikely," he said, "unless the local economy improves much better than anyone sees right now and the Mayor and the Council become adverse to using one shots." The term "one shot" refers to budget-reduction strategies that are short-term fixes and have little positive effect on the underlying problem.
The Mayor also said yesterday that his budget would eliminate capital financing to build a new Police Academy in the South Bronx. The new academy, first proposed by Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1989 to replace the current building on 20th Street in Manhattan, has been fiercely debated, and an effort to kill the project seems certain to meet resistance in the Council, particularly from the Bronx delegation.
Mr. Giuliani said the city "had no choice" but to cut some large projects as part of his effort to cut capital spending by 22 percent because of a state limit on the amount of debt the city can carry.

HEADLINE: Excerpts of Opinions on Gun Ban Near Schools

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's decision today in United States v. Lopez, declaring unconstitutional a Federal law banning the possession of guns near schools. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion and was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. Dissenting were John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. 

 
 
FROM THE DECISION
By Chief Justice Rehnquist
 In the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, Congress made it a Federal offense "for any individual knowingly to possess a firearm at a place that the individual knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone." 18 U.S.C. s922(q)(1)(A). The Act neither regulates a commercial activity nor contains a requirement that the possession be connected in any way to interstate commerce. We hold that the Act exceeds the authority of Congress "(t)o regulate Commerce . . . among the several States. . . ." U. S. Const., Art. I, s8, cl. 3. . . .
We start with first principles. The Constitution creates a Federal Government of enumerated powers. . . . The Constitution delegates to Congress the power "(t)o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes." U. S. Const., Art. I, s8, cl. 3. . . .
We have identified three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power. First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce. Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities. Finally, Congress's commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce and those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.
We now turn to consider the power of Congress, in the light of this framework, to enact s922(q). The first two categories of authority may be quickly disposed of: s922(q) is not a regulation of the use of the channels of interstate commerce, nor is it an attempt to prohibit the interstate transportation of a commodity through the channels of commerce; nor can s922(q) be justified as a regulation by which Congress has sought to protect an instrumentality of interstate commerce or a thing in interstate commerce. Thus, if s922(q) is to be sustained, it must be under the third category as a regulation of an activity that substantially affects interstate commerce. . . .
Section 922(q) is a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with "commerce" or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms. Section 922(q) is not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated. It cannot, therefore, be sustained under our cases upholding regulations of activities that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction, which, viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce. . . .
The Government's essential contention, in fine, is that we may determine here that s922(q) is valid because possession of a firearm in a local school zone does indeed substantially affect interstate commerce. The Government argues that possession of a firearm in a school zone may result in violent crime and that violent crime can be expected to affect the functioning of the national economy in two ways. First, the costs of violent crime are substantial, and, through the mechanism of insurance, those costs are spread throughout the population. Second, violent crime reduces the willingness of individuals to travel to areas within the country that are perceived to be unsafe. The Government also argues that the presence of guns in schools poses a substantial threat to the educational process by threatening the learning environment. A handicapped educational process, in turn, will result in a less productive citizenry. That, in turn, would have an adverse effect on the Nation's economic well-being. As a result, the Government argues that Congress could rationally have concluded that s922(q) substantially affects interstate commerce.
We pause to consider the implications. . . . The Government admits, under its "costs of crime" reasoning, that Congress could regulate not only all violent crime, but all activities that might lead to violent crime, regardless of how tenuously they relate to interstate commerce. Similarly, under the Government's "national productivity" reasoning, Congress could regulate any activity that it found was related to the economic productivity of individual citizens: family law (including marriage, divorce, and child custody), for example. Under the theories that the Government presents in support of s922(q), it is difficult to perceive any limitation on Federal power, even in areas such as criminal law enforcement or education where States historically have been sovereign. Thus, if we were to accept the Government's arguments, we are hard-pressed to posit any activity by an individual that Congress is without power to regulate.
For instance, if Congress can, pursuant to its Commerce Clause power, regulate activities that adversely affect the learning environment, then, a fortiori, it also can regulate the educational process directly. Congress could determine that a school's curriculum has a "significant" effect on the extent of classroom learning. As a result, Congress could mandate a Federal curriculum for local elementary and secondary schools because what is taught in local schools has a significant "effect on classroom learning," cf. post, at 9, and that, in turn, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. . . .
We do not doubt that Congress has authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate numerous commercial activities that substantially affect interstate commerce and also affect the educational process. That authority, though broad, does not include the authority to regulate each and every aspect of local schools. . . .
 
BY JUSTICE THOMAS,
Concurring

The Court today properly concludes that the Commerce Clause does not grant Congress the authority to prohibit gun possession within 1,000 feet of a school, as it attempted to do in the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101-647, 104 Stat. 4844. Although I join the majority, I write separately to observe that our case law has drifted far from the original understanding of the Commerce Clause. In a future case, we ought to temper our Commerce Clause jurisprudence in a manner that both makes sense of our more recent case law and is more faithful to the original understanding of that Clause.
 
FROM THE DISSENT
By Justice Breyer
 The issue in this case is whether the Commerce Clause authorizes Congress to enact a statute that makes it a crime to possess a gun in, or near, a school. In my view, the statute falls well within the scope of the commerce power as this Court has understood that power over the last half-century. . . .
The Constitution requires us to judge the connection between a regulated activity and interstate commerce, not directly, but at one remove. Courts must give Congress a degree of leeway in determining the existence of a significant factual connection between the regulated activity and interstate commerce both because the Constitution delegates the commerce power directly to Congress and because the determination requires an empirical judgment of a kind that a legislature is more likely than a court to make with accuracy. The traditional words "rational basis" capture this leeway. Thus, the specific question before us, as the Court recognizes, is not whether the "regulated activity sufficiently affected interstate commerce," but, rather, whether Congress could have had "a rational basis" for so concluding. . . .
Applying these principles to the case at hand, we must ask whether Congress could have had a rational basis for finding a significant (or substantial) connection between gun-related school violence and interstate commerce. Or, to put the question in the language of the explicit finding that Congress made when it amended this law in 1994: Could Congress rationally have found that "violent crime in school zones," through its effect on the "quality of education," significantly (or substantially) affects "interstate" or "foreign commerce"? As long as one views the commerce connection not as a "technical legal conception" but as "a practical one," Swift & Co. v. United States, the answer to this question must be yes. Numerous reports and studies generated both inside and outside government make clear that Congress could reasonably have found the empirical connection that its law, implicitly or explicitly, asserts.
Having found that guns in schools significantly undermine the quality of education in our Nation's classrooms, Congress could also have found, given the effect of education upon interstate and foreign commerce, that gun-related violence in and around schools is a commercial, as well as a human, problem. Education, although far more than a matter of economics, has long been inextricably intertwined with the Nation's economy. . . .
Specifically, Congress could have found that gun-related violence near the classroom poses a serious economic threat (1) to consequently inadequately educated workers who must endure low paying jobs, see, and (2) to communities and businesses that might (in today's "information society") otherwise gain, from a well-educated work force, an important commercial advantage, of a kind that location near a railhead or harbor provided in the past. Congress might also have found these threats to be no different in kind from other threats that this Court has found within the commerce power, such as the threat that loan sharking poses to the "funds" of "numerous localities," Perez v. United States, and that unfair labor practices pose to instrumentalities of commerce, see Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB.
To hold this statute constitutional is not to "obliterate" the "distinction of what is national and what is local," ante; nor is it to hold that the Commerce Clause permits the Federal Government to "regulate any activity that it found was related to the economic productivity of individual citizens," to regulate "marriage, divorce, and child custody," or to regulate any and all aspects of education. Ante.
In sum, a holding that the particular statute before us falls within the commerce power would not expand the scope of that Clause. Rather, it simply would apply pre-existing law to changing economic circumstances.
 
BY JUSTICE SOUTER,
Dissenting
 The practice of deferring to rationally based legislative judgments "is a paradigm of judicial restraint." In judicial review under the Commerce Clause, it reflects our respect for the institutional competence of the Congress on a subject expressly assigned to it by the Constitution and our appreciation of the legitimacy that comes from Congress's political accountability in dealing with matters open to a wide range of possible choices. . . .
The modern respect for the competence and primacy of Congress in matters affecting commerce developed only after one of this Court's most chastening experiences, when it perforce repudiated an earlier and untenably expansive conception of judicial review in derogation of Congressional commerce power. A look at history's sequence will serve to show how today's decision tugs the Court off course, leading it to suggest opportunities for further developments that would be at odds with the rule of restraint to which the Court still wisely states adherence. . . .
Thus, it seems fair to ask whether the step taken by the Court today does anything but portend a return to the untenable jurisprudence from which the Court extricated itself almost 60 years ago. The answer is not reassuring. . . .
The question for the courts, as all agree, is not whether as a predicate to legislation Congress in fact found that a particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce. The legislation implies such a finding, and there is no reason to entertain claims that Congress acted ultra vires intentionally. Nor is the question whether Congress was correct in so finding. The only question is whether the legislative judgment is within the realm of reason. . . .
Because JUSTICE BREYER'S opinion demonstrates beyond any doubt that the Act in question passes the rationality review that the Court continues to espouse, today's decision may be seen as only a misstep, its reasoning and its suggestions not quite in gear with the prevailing standard, but hardly an epochal case. I would not argue otherwise, but I would raise a caveat. Not every epochal case has come in epochal trappings.

HEADLINE: Mystery Bomber Sent Taunting Letter to Victim at Yale, F.B.I. Says

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 26

 BODY:
Federal officials today released the text of a letter in which the mysterious serial bomber in the Unabom case ridicules one of his victims for opening the package that exploded and maimed him.
The letter was sent to David J. Gelernter, a prominent computer science professor at Yale University who was injured when a bomb went off in his hands in June 1993. The package-bomb blinded Dr. Gelernter in one eye, tore off part of his right hand, deafened him in one ear and wounded him in the chest. 
 "People with advanced degrees aren't as smart as they think they are," taunted the writer, who is also a suspect in a fatal package-bomb explosion in Sacramento on Monday. "If you'd had any brains you would have realized that there are a lot of people out there who resent bitterly the way techno-nerds like you are changing the world and you wouldn't have been dumb enough to open an unexpected package from an unknown source."
The rambling three-paragraph letter, which was postmarked Oakland, Calif., April 20, went on to criticize Dr. Gelernter's 1991 book, "Mirror Worlds" for asserting that the advance of computerization is inevitable. The letter used the Federal Bureau of Investigation's headquarters in Washington as its return address.
"In the epilog of your book," the letter said, "you tried to justify your research by claiming that the developments you describe are inevitable, and that any college person can learn enough about computers to compete in a computer-dominated world.
"Apparently people without a college degree don't count," the letter continued. "In any case, being informed about computers won't enable anyone to prevent invasion of privacy (through computers), genetic engineering (to which computers make an important contribution), environmental degradation through excessive economic growth (computers make an important contribution to economic growth) and so forth."
Law-enforcement officials have long believed that the bomber, whose targets over the last 17 years have mostly been involved with computer science, was violently opposed to changes in society brought about by computer technology. But until now, their intuition about motives were based almost wholly on circumstantial evidence.
In a letter to The New York Times this week, the bomber said that he was "out to get" scientists in the computer and genetics fields and that his immediate goal was the "destruction of the worldwide industrial system."
The letter sent to Dr. Gelernter makes a similar point. "If the developments you describe are inevitable, they are not inevitable in the way that old age or bad weather are inevitable," the letter said. "They are inevitable only because techno-nerds like you make them inevitable. If there were no computer scientists there would be no progress in computer science."
The F.B.I. said today that in addition to the letters received by The Times and Dr. Gelernter, two other letters had been sent, but it refused to reveal their recipients or contents.
The F.B.I. said all four letters were mailed on April 20 from the Oakland, Calif., area.
Although the writer used the first person plural in his letter to The Times, Special Agent Jim R. Freeman, head of the F.B.I. office here, said, "We don't have a shred of evidence that he is connected with other people in the placing of the bombs."
Dr. Gelernter's book, "Mirror Worlds. Or the Day Software Puts the Universe in a Shoebox. How it Will Happen and What It Will Mean." (Oxford University Press), describes a vision of the future in which interconnected computers will permit people to model and simulate the physical and social world extensively irrespective of whether some people dread becoming too dependent on their computers.
Dr. Gelernter has been a seminal thinker in a field known as parallel, or distributed, computer processing. which employs tens, hundreds or even thousands of processors or separate computers simultaneously to greatly speed computing times.
On Monday, a package that the F.B.I. says was mailed by the mysterious bomber killed Gilbert B. Murray, president and chief lobbyist of the California Forestry Association, a timber industry trade group. It was the second Unabom fatality in five months and the third since the bombings began in 1978. Twenty-two others have been wounded.
Authorities have been concerned because with each attack, "the devices have become more destructive, without increasing in size," Mr. Freeman said.

HEADLINE: Women's Work: What's New, What Isn't

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
Yesterday was National Secretaries Day. Today is Take Our Daughters to Work Day. Many women are celebrating both.
Fully one in five of all working women holds a secretarial or clerical job, a proportion that has remained largely unchanged since 1950. At the same time, women now constitute a majority of workers in a wide range of occupations long male-dominated, including psychologist, accountant, journalist, bus driver, bartender, and insurance or real estate agent. 
 They also make up the majority of public officials and administrators. One of them, Karen Nussbaum, director of the Women's Bureau of Labor at the United States Labor Department, recalls that after graduating from college she began her working career as a secretary at Harvard University and as a waitress.
"In my generation," the 45-year-old Ms. Nussbaum said, "there wasn't a woman who did not start as a secretary or a waitress, and I did both. If you wanted to sell insurance, you went in as a secretary. There was no other point of entry.
"Ten years ago two younger women, right out of college, were in front of me on a plane talking about sales. And I realized, this is different, mostly due to affirmative action and the women's movement and a difference in large part, too, by education and family income. So that a whole group found themselves not starting out as clerical workers."
But, she noted, "you still find a very large group of women in clerical and low-wage service work, and 75 percent of working women still earn less than $25,000" a year.
Even within those job categories in which women now outnumber men, they generally still lag in wages.
A computer analysis of census results conducted for The New York Times by Dr. Andrew A. Beveridge, director of the Program for Applied Research at Queens College, found profound and, in some cases, surprising shifts in the work force during the last 50 years.
In 1940, when fewer than 1 in 4 workers was a woman, about 1 in 6 working women was employed in a manufacturing job, usually as a machine operator. One in 8 was a domestic worker then, a proportion that by 1950 had plunged to about 1 in 15. Now, according to the census figures, fewer than 1 in 100 working women is employed as private household help.
Not until 1980, though, did manufacturing slip to second place as an employer of women, behind secretarial and clerking work, which each accounted for more than 1 in 10 female workers. By 1990, when women constituted more than half the work force, manufacturing had dropped to fourth, behind clerks, secretaries, and the combined category of managerial and office workers.
About 1 in 20 female workers is a schoolteacher, a proportion that has remained fairly constant since 1940.
Given the numbers, some jobs seem still very much women's work. Women account for 98 percent of secretaries, more than 9 of 10 professional nurses, bookkeepers, bank tellers and housekeepers, and more than 8 of 10 waiters, librarians, cashiers and telephone operators, but fewer than 1 of 50 carpenters or automobile mechanics.
The most dramatic changes in the work force during the last half-century coincided with pronounced educational gains by women and the shifts that the women's movement helped produce in employers' hiring goals and policies.
By 1990, women accounted for 44 percent of all economists, up from 14 percent 20 years earlier; for 27 percent of lawyers and judges, from 6 percent; for 38 percent of pharmacists, from 16 percent; for 22 percent of doctors, from 11 percent, and for 30 percent of stockbrokers, from 13 percent.
During that same two-decade period, women roughly doubled their proportion among public officials and administrators, bartenders, designers and advertising or insurance agents.
But for a variety of reasons -- including tenure that is generally shorter than that of their male counterparts, their tendency to do more part-time work, and discrimination -- women generally still earn less than men within a given job category.
Among psychologists, for example, the median salary income recorded in 1990 was $31,000 for men and $22,000 for women. Even among psychologists under the age of 35 -- a group in which men and women are more likely to have comparable experience -- the median for men ($19,000) surpassed that for women ($17,000). Among young economists, the median for men was $30,000, for women $24,000. Among young telephone operators, men's median was $11,000, women's $10,000.
When all men and women are compared, regardless of age, the disparities are much greater.
"There've been breakthroughs in non-traditional areas," said Marie C. Wilson, president of the Ms. Foundation for Women, which sponsors the annual Take Our Daughters to Work Day. "But historically, when women start to dominate the field, the pay goes down and the prestige will go down" -- in particular, she said, where many of those women are nonwhite.
Women in 1990 earned more than men -- and just slightly -- in only a few job categories, including bank tellers, secretaries and assistant librarians.
In a number of categories within the under-35 group, though, women account for a higher proportion of workers than they do among the all-age work force. This suggests that in the 1990's they will continue to make inroads in many male-dominated fields and that some jobs may become less subject to stereotyping by sex.
Among workers under age 35, women now account for fully 1 in 3 doctors, 4 in 10 mail carriers and a majority of purchasing agents. Further, nearly 1 in 10 nurses and nearly 2 in 10 telephone operators among this younger group are now men.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Mexico Eager to Celebrate End to Crisis Despite Hardships

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, April 26

 BODY:
It may be too early to celebrate, but Mexican officials lately have turned optimistic when they talk about an end to the country's current economic crisis, even as the hardships of the Mexican people are increasing sharply.
A beefed-up peso and a stock exchange that has come back from the dead are just two of the signs officials cite to show that the Government's austere economic recovery plan is working. 
 But it is clear that as Mexico's economic picture brightens, the level of misery for individual Mexicans increases almost in step. Unemployment and inflation are both exceeding the Government's projections, and interest rates on loans have remained punishingly high. Now, most investors and financial analysts, already burned by overly optimistic Government projections, say it is far too early to tell whether the worst is over.
"There are two faces to this crisis," said Luis Pazos, a Mexican economist who is often critical of the Government. "The fact that the Government has implemented the recovery program has brought back the confidence of many international investors. But the first impact of the program here has been to impoverish the people."
The chief spokesman for the Government's recovery program, Alejandro Valenzuela, said today that there was no escaping the pain caused by the attempt to undo Mexico's worst economic crisis in a decade. But, he said, "the indicators speak for themselves."
Since March 9, when the Government's latest austerity plan was announced, the peso has regained slightly more than one-quarter of its value, and it was expected to become stronger after the Chicago Mercantile Exchange began offering peso futures contracts on Tuesday. Today the peso-dollar exchange rate was 5.795, down from 7.45 pesos to the dollar in early March.
The Mexican stock market has risen more than 65 percent since March 9 to surpass the 2,000 level, closing at 2,006.98 today. The recovery was at first driven by local investors. Later some adventurous foreign investors jumped in. Some first-quarter earnings, like those of Banamex and Bancomer, two of the largest banks in Mexico, have been surprisingly strong, in part because they were better than what had been expected.
Last month Mexico's nonpetroleum exports grew by nearly 29 percent, while imports -- most used to come from the United States -- declined by 3.4 percent. The Mexican Congress is considering bills to encourage private investment by allowing competition in long-distance telephone service, communication satellites, natural gas distribution and Mexico's outdated railroad system.
"Things seem to have taken a turn for the better far more quickly than anyone thought on March 9," said Ricardo Peon, head of research at Barings Securities in Mexico City. "Mexico is on the right track, but it's not there yet."
What concerns investors are unresolved issues like the stability of Mexico's banking system, the depth of the recession that the Government deliberately caused with its recovery plan and the danger that if the peso strengthens too much too soon, it will make products more costly and pull the rug out from under Mexico's export-driven recovery.
Shadowing the signs of recovery are the rising social costs of the Government's economic plan and the tremendous hardships that the Mexican people are forced to bear.
In January and February 750,000 people lost their jobs because of the crisis, according to Government figures, equaling what officials had expected to see by the end of June. Many private economists say the real figure is far higher. Interest rates for mortgages, car loans and credit cards remain higher than 80 percent.
In addition, the increase in the national value-added sales tax on April 1 to 15 percent, from 10 percent, is already pushing up inflation, which the central bank reported to be 5 percent in the first two weeks of this month. The figures indicate that inflation will exceed the Government's official annual estimate of 42 percent.
So far, Mexicans have taken the hardship in stride. Even when the officially established price of tortillas increased by about 25 percent earlier this month, there was no street violence.
"President Zedillo made a calculated bet that the Mexican populace will remain docile as it has for decades," said Lawrence D. Krohn, senior economist for Latin America at UBS Securities Inc. in New York. "But just because the country hasn't come apart at this point certainly doesn't mean that it won't six months from now."

HEADLINE: Dow Edges Lower, but Nasdaq Climbs to Record

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks edged lower yesterday as Wall Street worried about the dollar, but gains in technology stocks lifted the Nasdaq index to a record.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.34 of a point, to 4,299.83, on renewed concerns about the dollar after finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized nations gave only verbal support for the ailing currency. 
 In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 1,160 to 1,075 in active trading of more than 350 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Nasdaq index climbed to a record on the strength of technology stocks. It rose 5.63 points, to 836.91, eclipsing the old high of 832.64, set April 13.
"There were big upticks in some of the big institutional names, and the weighting they have took the average to a new high on big volume," said Bob Antolini at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette.
The Toshiba Corporation of Japan said it was negotiating with customers to raise the prices of memory chips, and that gave impetus to the technology issues. Intel shares climbed 1 3/8, to 99 5/8, a closing high, on optimism over demand for its Pentium chip; Apple Computer gained 1/2, to 38 1/4, and Sun Microsystems gained 1 7/8, closing at 39 1/2.
I.B.M., which reported last week that its first-quarter earnings had nearly quadrupled, led the Dow industrials, gaining 1 5/8, to 95 1/4. Other blue-chips, however, treaded water for the second straight session after surging 34 points Monday, to a record high of 4,303.98.
"We don't really have any motivation for either the bulls or the bears to get crazy at this point," said David Holt, director of technical research at Wedbush Morgan.
Analysts said the focus was again on the dollar after G-7 ministers threw their verbal support behind the battered currency but failed to come up with concrete measures at their Washington meeting.
The ministers said the dollar's recent slide to a record low of less than 80 Japanese yen was not justified by the performance of their economies and called for an "orderly reversal" of the decline.
The dollar was mixed in American trading yesterday, rising against the yen but losing ground against the German mark.
Philip Orlando, senior vice president at First Capital Advisers, said the dollar could be the key to the next movement of stocks. If it again slides below the 80-yen level in coming weeks, the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates at its May 23 policy-making meeting, he said. "The catalyst initiating a consolidation of some magnitude is going to be currency," he added.
A rate increase would revive concerns of an economic slowdown and lower corporate profits and could lead to a correction of up to 400 points in the Dow index, he said.
Chrysler's stock fell 2 1/2, to 41 5/8, on speculation that Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire investor, would not be able to raise the financing necessary for his $22.8 billion takeover bid.
Reader's Digest tumbled 7 7/8, to 39 7/8, after it warned Wall Street of a slowdown in earnings growth in fiscal 1995 and 1996, citing increased paper costs.
Glenayre Technologies shot up 6 1/2, to 57, after its quarterly earnings came in well ahead of analysts' expectations.
U.S. Robotics rallied 10 1/4, to 79, after its strong quarterly earnings prompted analysts to raise their profit forecasts.
American Mobile Systems gained 311/16 to 87/16 on news it was being bought by Nextel Communications in a stock swap valued at $65 million. Nextel slipped 1/8, to 15 1/2.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 0.51, to 512.66. The American Stock Exchange index edged up 0.27, to 473.86.
The N.Y.S.E. Composite index of all listed common stocks rose 0.10 to 276.49. The average share was up 1 cent.
The Wilshire Associates equity index -- the market value of N.Y.S.E., American and Nasdaq issues -- was at a new high of 5,015.271 up 6.886 or 0.14 percent.

HEADLINE: Bias Hits Hispanic Workers

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

 BODY:
Efrain Castillo, a 43-year-old truck driver, was forced to quit his job in mid-March after Mexico's economic crisis hit border-area businesses and left him idle two or three days each week. "There's just no work," he lamented, looking up from job-search forms at the state's cavernous downtown unemployment office on Front Street.
But Mr. Castillo, who came to the United States from Mexico in the early 1970's, is not just one American citizen whose livelihood happened to depend on the Mexican economy. He is a member of a growing Hispanic labor force that is losing ground in this country's increasingly competitive job market. 
 Many Hispanic workers are held back by outmoded skills, job inexperience and weaker education credentials. But these days they are also finding themselves increasingly subject to intense suspicion, resentment and, in many cases, outright discrimination.
"They ask you for your Social Security number, your alien card," Mr. Castillo said, and added that he was never previously aware of such scrutiny. And his wife, who is undocumented, can no longer work at all. "A few years ago she could, but not now," Mr. Castillo said. "It's almost impossible."
Here, in the city with the nation's highest unemployment rate among Hispanic people, almost any conversation highlights how job prospects for Hispanic people -- particularly lower-income entry-level workers -- are shrinking. But Government statistics make it clear that this is a nationwide phenomenon as well. During the last few years, even as the overall unemployment rate has shrunk substantially, joblessness among the 12 million Hispanic workers in the civilian labor force has barely budged. In particular, it has worsened relative to that of blacks, a group often in competition for lower-echelon jobs. In January, the Hispanic unemployment rate briefly jumped to 10.2 percent, matching the black jobless rate for the first time in the two decades for which detailed records about ethnic groups have been kept.
In California, home to about one-third of the country's Hispanic population, the Hispanic unemployment rate actually exceeded that of blacks, 11.2 percent to 11 percent, for the three-month period through January.
Hispanic workers have also lost ground compared with non-Hispanic whites. Until about five years ago, joblessness among Hispanic workers typically averaged about one and a half times the rate for whites. But today Hispanic people are nearly twice as likely as whites to be unemployed.
"We are quite concerned about this," said Charles Kamasaki, senior vice president of the National Council of La Raza, the largest Hispanic advocacy group. "This could be some sort of sea change."
Despite the great prominence given recently to stepped-up efforts to police the nation's borders, illegal immigrants appear to be an insignificant factor in the widening gap between Hispanic joblessness and that of other Americans, according to various experts. They say that undocumented workers, often toiling desperately in private or "off the books" jobs, generally avoid being tallied by the Government.
Rather, the official job-market distress is concentrated among native-born Hispanic people and legal immigrants, involving dispiriting economic and social forces that are not likely to be quickly reversed. The figures also point to a rise in anti-Hispanic discrimination in hiring that is perhaps best exemplified by Proposition 187, the contentious but highly popular measure approved by California voters in November. Among other things, that initiative is aimed at denying welfare and other government benefits to immigrants lacking proper credentials.
"There's no doubt that discrimination has increased against Latinos," said Juan Vargas, Deputy Mayor of San Diego and the first Hispanic member of its City Council. "Proposition 187 has created almost a crisis in the Latino community. It has employers panicked."
Some elements of Proposition 187 have been challenged as unconstitutional but its passage, according to Mr. Vargas and others, has helped chill public opinion toward Hispanic people and made employers even more wary of hiring them.
Other forces are at work as well. Mexican-Americans, for example, had been quite successful in obtaining industrial and military-related jobs in the Midwest and Southern California. But under the common pattern of "last hired, first fired," they have made up a disproportionate number of the casualties in recent years as these businesses slimmed down to cut labor costs or in response to military cutbacks.
"When you downsize these labor markets, Hispanics get hit very hard," said Rodolfo de la Garza, a professor of government at the University of Texas and vice president of the Tomas Rivera Center, a Hispanic research organization. This reflects relatively low seniority and a lack of job alternatives because of obsolescent skills.
Traditionally, Mexican mechanics learned to fix fenders, hammering them back in shape with ball peen hammers, Professor de la Garza said. "But you don't fix fenders any more, you replace fenders," he said.
Idled military-plant workers have sometimes displaced Hispanic workers on the lower rungs of the economic ladder, taking work as waiters, cab drivers or on construction jobs.
And while the educational attainment of Hispanic people has improved, their schooling still lags well behind that of blacks and whites and is improving at a slower pace than that of blacks, according to La Raza, the advocacy group.
Yet another factor is what Irma Castro, former executive director of the Chicano Federation, calls the "younging" of the Hispanic community. That includes Mexican-Americans in the Southwest, Puerto Ricans in New York and a newer wave of arrivals from Central and South America who have spread themselves more or less equally to various regions of the country, with a concentration in Washington. Cubans, mainly in Florida, tend to be older, better educated and more prosperous than other Hispanic people.
"As our numbers grow, the average age drops," with the median age for Hispanics now barely over 26, almost eight years younger than for non-Hispanics, Ms. Castro said. "Traditionally, the Hispanic worker has been underemployed and underutilized," she added. "And now these younger workers are coming into the labor force with very little skills" and, especially among children of immigrants, often with a lesser work ethic as well. Across all ethnic groups, unemployment among younger workers tends to be much higher than the rate among older adults.
Another factor that is difficult to measure is the impact of the late 1980's amnesty for many undocumented workers who were long resident in the United States. That brought many Hispanic people out of the underground economy into the official work force. And because the Hispanic population tends to be concentrated in places like California and New York, which were particularly hard hit by the economic downturn of the early 1990's, the vulnerability to job losses now shows up more prominently in Government figures.
For all that, it is clear that joblessness rose more sharply for Hispanic people than for non-Hispanic people during the 1990-91 recession and, particularly related to blacks, has worsened since. Puerto Ricans suffered most from the recession because of their concentration in the hard-hit Northeast, according to Peter Cattan, an economist with the the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Even backbreaking field work, often the first stop for recent immigrants and disdained by many non-Hispanic people, is proving increasingly trying, according to Claudia E. Smith of California Rural Legal Assistance. "During peak season, what I'm seeing is underemployment," she said. "And the jobs go to the younger, more strapping ones -- it's become that kind of a meat market."
Still, after allowing for the various economic and social forces, many Hispanic people and others have reluctantly concluded that discrimination may be the biggest single reason for the deterioration of Hispanic work life.
In this they concur with findings of the General Accounting Office, the Congressional research organization, which studied the consequences of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which barred employers from knowingly hiring ineligible workers.
The G.A.O., in a 1990 report, found "widespread discrimination," with 19 percent of employers acknowledging one or more illegal practices as a result of the 1986 law.
"We don't like to talk about it because we don't like to look like we're complaining," Ms. Castro said, lamenting what she said was widespread discrimination reflected in the vote in Proposition 187. "But I think it's just rampant."
And the current economic crisis in Mexico can only make things worse, specialists say, with a sharp rise in immigration -- much of it illegal -- expected to begin in coming months.
"What may well be happening," Mr. Kamasaki contended, "is increased labor market discrimination because people think all Latino applicants are immigrants."

HEADLINE: State's Hospital Bill Surcharges Upheld

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 26

 BODY:
The United States Supreme Court today upheld New York State's practice of raising revenues by tacking surcharges onto hospital bills, saving the state's health financing system from potential collapse.
Several states use similar surcharges or taxes to help pay for indigent health care, to boost hospital revenues and even to close state budget gaps, as New York did in 1992. The primary principle behind the practice -- subsidizing health care for the indigent by taxing hospital payments by the insured -- was at the center of the debate over Federal health care legislation in 1993 and 1994. 
 The precedent provided by today's unanimous ruling, which reversed a series of lower court decisions, would seem to give states broad powers to set hospital rates and maintain the status quo. In the near term, that is likely to allow governors to save hundreds of millions of dollars and avoid some tax increases.
In Connecticut, for instance, Gov. John G. Rowland expects to gain $150 million that he had not anticipated receiving if the surcharge system had been struck down. He may also now avoid a divisive debate over an alternative tax on hospital revenues that he had proposed to compensate for any lost income.
In New York, an adverse ruling would not have cost the state anything this year because the state won a temporary reprieve from Congress last month in the form of a special waiver. But it would have cost the state's hospitals $200 million this year and the state $60 million next year, according to the State Health Commissioner, Barbara A. DeBuono.
More significantly, a different ruling could have cost the state more than $1 billion a year if the ruling were later applied to a surcharge that is used to compensate New York hospitals for care provided to indigent patients. That surcharge, which averages 5.5 percent, was not directly at issue in the case decided by the Supreme Court.
Aides to Gov. George E. Pataki said Mr. Pataki may ultimately support deregulation of health care rates. But they rejoiced today that the courts would not force him to do so on a timetable that could cost the state huge sums when it could least afford it.
With the fiscal year now 26 days old, Mr. Pataki is still negotiating with the Legislature over his plan to close a budget gap of more than $4 billion and to provide $720 million in tax cuts.
The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit, known originally as Travelers vs. Cuomo, in which insurance companies maintained that the surcharges violated the Federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The plaintiffs argued that the 1974 E.R.I.S.A. prohibits states from passing laws that affect employee benefit plans, including health insurance plans that are made more costly by hospital surcharges.
But Justice David Souter wrote that the surcharges, because they affect all commercial insurance plans in the same way, did not have a direct effect on the way those plans operate or compete against each other.
"Any conclusion other than the one drawn here would have the unsettling result of barring any state regulation of hospital costs on the theory that all laws with indirect economic effects on E.R.I.S.A. plans are pre-empted," Justice Souter wrote.
Pataki administration officials said the ruling will give them breathing room to determine how they want to redesign New York's huge and highly regulated medical system.
Dr. DeBuono said she wants to study the possibility of reducing the state's power to set hospital rates, although she said she has not yet decided that she favors such deregulation. The looming loss of billions of dollars in health care revenues would have made a comprehensive study impossible, she said.
"I am pleased that this landmark Supreme Court decision will avoid disruption to the health care community and allow New York the time to undertake an orderly evaluation of the state's current hospital financing system," Dr. DeBuono said. "The decision also maintains New York State's flexibility in redesigning a reimbursement system to achieve our objectives of expanding access to high quality medical services at an affordable cost."
Hospital industry officials said a different ruling would have been catastrophic.
"If they had ruled against us, the system probably would have collapsed," said Daniel Sisto, president of the Healthcare Association of New York State, which represents hospitals and nursing homes.
Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said, "It would have been either meltdown of the health care system or an enormous amount of debt absorbed by the state overnight."
The ruling also maintains New York's policy of providing a competitive pricing advantage to Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurance plans by exempting their policyholders from the surcharges.
The state provides that advantage because the not-for-profit Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans accept all paying applicants for health insurance; they provide coverage for many New Yorkers who might not be accepted by for-profit commercial insurers.
Health insurance executives said today the decision would harm patients by allowing states to continue to impose higher hospital rates on commercial health insurers. Those increases typically are then passed along to policyholders through higher premiums.
"What this decision really means is that New York's consumers and employers who purchase insurance are going to pay more," said Bill Gradison, president of the Health Insurance Association of America. "In effect, they are being asked to subsidize the Blues."
The Travelers lawsuit challenged three separate surcharges on health care payments that New York has imposed over the years.
The largest, enacted in 1988, is a 13 percent surcharge on hospital bills that is paid only by commercial insurers and self-insurance plans. The surcharge provides a competitive advantage for Blue Cross plans, and hospitals keep the $200 million generated each year.
In 1992, the state added another 11 percent to the surcharge on hospitals for one year. The hospitals were required to pass the revenues along to the state, producing about $60 million to help close a budget gap.
Also in 1992, the state imposed a 9 percent surcharge on health maintenance organizations, which was designed both to close the state budget gap and to encourage the H.M.O.'s to enroll Medicaid recipients. By meeting targets for enrolling Medicaid recipients, health maintenance organizations could avoid the charges.

HEADLINE: East Harlem Pathmark Plan Appears Headed for Defeat

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

 BODY:
A plan to build a big supermarket in one of Manhattan's most economically depressed communities appeared headed for defeat yesterday as members of the Manhattan Borough Board prepared to vote this morning on the $12 million project.
Opponents of the 53,000-square-foot Pathmark supermarket planned for East Harlem, who fear that the store will hurt local bodega owners, said they had the necessary votes to block the sale of a vacant, city-owned lot on 125th Street where the store would be built. And telephone calls to the board's members confirmed that unless 11th-hour negotiations were successful, the plan would be killed. 
 "The votes are cast," said City Councilman Antonio Pagan, who opposes the project. "Pathmark will not be built."
Yesterday afternoon, in a last-minute effort to change the outcome of the vote, Pathmark officials said they would contribute additional economic development money to community groups in East Harlem, and the project's developers offered to provide technical assistance to minority businesses and entrepreneurs in the neighborhood.
But opponents said the offer was too little and too late.
The project, which is planned for 125th Street and Third Avenue, has evolved in recent weeks into a clash of politics, race and business.
Opponents -- many of them Hispanic residents and merchants of East Harlem -- have argued that the giant store will endanger the more than 200 bodegas and small grocery stores that already operate in the area.
Black residents of Harlem have been more supportive, arguing that the project will bring 200 jobs and finally give minority residents of upper Manhattan the wider selection and lower prices that giant supermarkets have long offered in wealthier neighborhoods.
Because the project's developers, a consortium of nonprofit groups known as the East Harlem Abyssinian Triangle, will receive $1.1 million in Federal and state grants, a low-interest mortgage loan, as well as tax abatements, opponents also charge that Pathmark is receiving an unfair competitive advantage.
"We are opposed to the size of it and to all of the government subsidies given to it," said Councilman Adam Clayton Powell 4th, who collected 5,000 signatures from East Harlem residents who don't want the supermarket. "We would not oppose it if they came in with their own money."
Members of the Manhattan Borough Board, which consists of Manhattan's 10 City Council members, Borough President Ruth W. Messinger, and the chairman of the affected community board, are scheduled to vote this morning on whether to approve the sale of the land to the developers.
In addition to Mr. Pagan and Mr. Powell, Councilman Charles Millard said yesterday that he would vote against the store. Other council members said that Kathryn E. Freed, Andrew Eristoff, and Guillermo Linares had stated their intent to vote against the project, but the three did not return calls seeking comment. Councilman Thomas K. Duane said he would not make a decision until this morning.
C. Virginia Fields and Ronnie M. Eldridge said they would vote in favor of the plan. In addition, Councilman Stanley Michaels and the chairman of Community Board 11, Eddie Baca, are expected to vote in favor. Ms. Messinger would vote only in the event of a tie.
Under the plan, the city would sell the land to the consortium for $1.5 million and provide the developers with a mortgage at one percent interest. The consortium would then apply to Chemical Bank for $8 million to build the store, and Pathmark would take out a 25-year lease on the property, paying the developers $1.06 million a year in rent. An additional $1.5 million is to come from a private investor group.
"This represents a perfect partnership between the public sector, the private sector, and a nonprofit group," said Joan McCleod, a project manager from Abyssinian Development Corporation, a member of the consortium.
To placate the opposition, Pathmark last night said it would contribute $25,000 per year, for a minimum of five years, to create an economic development fund for East Harlem. The Woodbridge, N.J.-based company said the funds would be held in escrow in an East Harlem bank and administered by a community-based organization. Also, Pathmark and the developers said they would "use their best efforts" to place East Harlem-based minority businesses in the additional 8,000 square feet of retail space planned for the site.
But the opponents were unmoved by the offer. "Some bread crumbs are being thrown at this community at the 11th hour," Mr. Powell said. "It's a desperate attempt to save something that's already dead."
For Ms. Messinger, who supports the supermarket, the outcome of the vote could have lingering political implications. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, whom Ms. Messinger might eventually challenge in a mayoral race, has uncharacteristically chosen to stay out of the argument over the supermarket.
In a news conference earlier this week, the Mayor said he wanted to let other political leaders "work it out, debate it, and come to a decision."
Both sides have asked the Mayor to intervene, but he said any decision he makes would anger one side or the other. "This is a sort of sucker invitation," Mr. Giuliani said. "I generally don't get involved in sucker invitations."
If the plan passes the borough board, however, Mr. Giuliani would have to rule later on proposed tax abatements for the project.
While opponents of the current plan said they would approve a smaller store built without Federal grants, officials of Pathmark said the grocery store chain would not renegotiate the terms of the project. "It's not going to change," Stan Sorkin, a company spokesman, said.
Mr. Sorkin said that after four years of negotiating with city officials to develop the East Harlem site, the company was "getting blindsided at the last minute. We're going to have to rethink where we want to spend our resources," he said.

HEADLINE: Cold Comfort From the Mayor

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani boasted last week that new screening procedures and work requirements had wrung thousands of fraudulent applicants out of Home Relief, the New York State program of cash assistance for poor residents who do not qualify for Federal welfare. One day later the Mayor proposed to eliminate the program entirely. But why abandon the truly needy, the only recipients who would presumably be left once fraud is vanquished?
The Mayor's answer is that the able-bodied poor need only assistance in finding jobs, not cash. As proof, the mayor's office points to three months' experience under the new program, during which the number of Home Relief applicants in New York City who found jobs soared almost 400 percent. But three months prove nothing. States that have already done what Mr. Giuliani proposes have seen quite different results. 
 Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio have recently cut back or eliminated their versions of Home Relief. Former recipients did not fare well. In Pennsylvania, less than 3 percent of recipients were steadily employed the year after benefits were cut back. In Michigan only about 20 percent were working two years after benefits were terminated. The results in Ohio were similar.
These cutbacks in Home Relief did not produce large increases in the homeless population. But the outcomes give little support to the cheerful notion that Home Relief recipients will easily find work. Most manage only to scrape by in the underground or illegal economy at the margins of civil existence. Mayor Giuliani is right to point out that Home Relief in New York is far more generous than anywhere else. Even so, a Home Relief recipient in New York City receives only about $350 a month -- not enough to cover a typical rent check.
A policy of requiring recipients to work, if need be at community service at minimum wages, could be a sensible way to help put dysfunctional adults back on their feet. But to threaten to cut off people who, through no fault of their own, cannot find work demeans New York's proud history of helping the destitute.

HEADLINE: Did Yale Impostor Really Earn B Grades?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The well-publicized story of Yale's expulsion of Lon Grammer, a transfer student who gained admission to Yale by allegedly falsifying documents, would by now have been forgotten were it not for this twist: Mr. Grammer is said to have achieved a 3.0 grade point average at Yale, as compared with the 2.1 he earned at little-known Cuesta College. Prof. Paul J. Korshin (letter, April 23) sees this as but another indication of declining standards in higher education. 
 Grade inflation is a serious matter, but what evidence exists to show Mr. Grammer had a B average at Yale? No Yale official is at liberty to make transcript information public. As far as I can tell, reports of Mr. Grammer's B average stem from assertions by Mr. Grammer or his legal representatives. None of the half-dozen reporters with whom I have spoken saw any official documentation.
I would urge Mr. Grammer to produce his Yale transcript for the press. If for some reason he should be unable to locate this document, my office will gladly furnish him a copy.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasuries Mixed On Data for Durable Goods

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, after a Government report of an unexpected rise in durable goods orders for March led to some weakness in bond prices.
At the same time securities dealers were setting up for the Treasury's $11.5 billion five-year note auction yesterday, a normal preoccupation that often lowers prices because inventories are lightened to make room for new securities. 
 The price of the 30-year bond rose 2/32 , to 10323/32 , for a yield of 7.32 percent, unchanged from Tuesday, but shorter maturities were mixed.
The market's concern about the report on durable goods was that it showed the industrial sector was not slowing as much as had been suggested by other data, including the national purchasing managers' index last month. Some economists, however, discounted the durables report as an aberration.
The Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods rose six-tenths of 1 percent, against forecasts for a decline of half a percent. Without transportation, the orders rose 1 percent, and gained four-tenths of 1 percent excluding military orders.
Analysts said the report jolted the long maturities, lowering prices from morning highs, which could make securities more attractive going into an auction.
Jack McIntyre, senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said the market "also used the five-year note auction as an excuse to sell intermediate maturities ahead of the auction."
Mr. McIntyre said the five-year Treasury note auction yesterday went well, with good demand from dealers and noncompetitive bids by small investors of about half the 12-month average of $830 million.
The high yield at the auction was 6.815 percent, down from 6.994 percent last month and the lowest yield since June 1994, when it was 6.77 percent. Today the Treasury plans to sell $17.75 billion of new 52-week bills, which were carrying a rate of 5.82 percent by late in the day.
Market participants said the rebound of the dollar after the meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations gave bonds only brief support, while short-covering by dealers helped to lift bonds more, particularly in the longer maturities. The easing of the prices of oil, gold and silver added relief to the bond market.
In the municipal bond market, prices fell as the prospect of changes in the Federal income tax code made some investors take a hard look at the benefits of tax-exempt securities.
On Tuesday Senator Pete Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, and Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, introduced the Unlimited Savings Allowance Tax Act, proposing that all personal savings be exempt from taxes and providing an 11 percent flat-rate business tax that permits a deduction for capital investments.
Analysts said a key feature of the Nunn-Domenici plan would allow an investor to deduct capital gains income from taxes if the gain was rolled into other stocks, bonds and savings accounts. The change would put other investments on nearly equal ground with municipal bonds if the proceeds were reinvested.
The average yield to first call for the Bond Buyer's index of 40 municipal issues rose 2 basis points, to 6.27 percent.
In the corporate bond market, in which the lack of new issues has sent some investors into the asset-backed securities market, Sears, Roebuck & Company sold $522 million of fixed-rate credit-card-backed securities yesterday in two parts through underwriters led by CS First Boston.
Sears sold the securities through a special trust formed for that particular offering, the Sears Credit Account Master Trust II 95-3. For $500 million of the securities, the average life is 5.06 years, with the interest rate set at 7 percent and priced at 9923/32 , to yield 7.171 percent.
The following are the results of the Treasury auction of new five-year notes yesterday:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up Sharply Against Yen In Biggest Rally in 20 Months

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar staged its biggest one-day rally in 20 months against the Japanese yen yesterday, surging more than 2 percent after the United States and other leading industrial nations said the dollar's slide was not justified. It also stabilized against other currencies.
Finance ministers from the Group of Seven nations said late Tuesday that recent movements in the currency markets "have gone beyond levels justified by underlying economic conditions." 
 The group's statement called for an "orderly reversal" of the dollar's 16 percent slide against the yen so far this year and its nearly 12 percent drop against the German mark. Some traders said the statement hinted that more aggressive action might be coming in an effort to bolster the dollar.
"All the euphoria after the G-7 rhetoric has popped the dollar up," said Kevin Lawrie, foreign exchange manager at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. The Group of Seven consists of the United States, Germany, Japan, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.
The dollar rose as high as 84.40 yen in New York trading before retreating somewhat. It was quoted late yesterday at 83.80 yen, compared with 81.82 yen on Tuesday.
The dollar also traded as high as 1.3863 marks before settling at 1.3670 marks, little changed from 1.3699 marks on Tuesday.
The dollar's early gains against the mark were erased when investors bought marks and sold yen, traders said. To accomplish that, traders often buy dollars for yen, then sell those dollars for marks.
The British pound was also little changed at $1.62152, up from $1.6130.
The chorus of voices declaring that the dollar's fall has been overdone threw an element of caution into betting on further dollar declines. Adding to the caution, traders said, was a bout of dollar-buying by Japan's central bank in Asian trading.
"It makes you hesitate before hitting the sell button," said Joe Francomano, a foreign exchange trader at the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in New York.
Still, the Group of Seven announced no concrete steps to help the dollar, leaving many traders wondering what further action, if any, the central banks would actually take.
"It's rhetoric, and not backed by action," Mr. Lawrie of Mellon said. "The market wants to see more before we really attack the upside on the dollar."
To bolster the dollar, the Group of Seven's central banks could make coordinated dollar purchases, which have served only to stabilize the dollar this year.
They could also adjust their interest rates, with further cuts by the Germans and Japanese being offset by an increase in American rates. But so far, the United States has shown little interest in raising rates to halt the rise of the yen and the mark.

HEADLINE: March Durable-Goods Orders Had an Unexpected Rebound

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
Led by the demand for computers and electronic equipment, orders to factories in the United States for interest-sensitive durable goods rebounded in March from their first decline in four months.
The Commerce Department said today that orders for expensive items expected to last at least three years climbed six-tenths of 1 percent last month, after falling a revised seven-tenths of 1 percent in February. The original report put that decline at eight-tenths of 1 percent. 
 Analysts had forecast a drop of half a percent in March and said the surprising recovery was a sign of business confidence and solid growth, despite other indications of weakness in the economy. They said they saw little cause to fear an inflationary boom.
"It's healthy growth, even better than expected," said Robert Eggert, who heads Eggert Economic Enterprises, a forecasting firm in Sedona, Ariz. "The personal computer market is hot as a pistol."
Financial markets, concerned that a surge in economic growth would lead to inflation and another round of increases in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, fell after the Government's report but then recovered.
Analysts said most signs pointed to a slowdown from the booming growth that closed out 1994 and predicted moderate economic expansion this year.
On Friday the Commerce Department is scheduled to provide its first broad look at the economy for the first quarter of 1995, when it announces the preliminary figures for gross domestic product.
"While interest rates have gone up, they have to be balanced against business prospects," said Charles Renfro, an economist at Alphametrics, a forecasting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. "If prospects are good and the rates are only up moderately, there's no reason to cut back on investment. And, of course, the world economy is expanding."
He predicted that the gross domestic product for the first quarter this year would show a solid annual growth rate of 3.2 percent, compared with 5.1 percent for the last three months of 1994.
The Federal Reserve has raised a key short-term interest rate seven times since February 1994. Analysts had expected the orders for durable goods to decline in March, because the orders are usually affected by rising interest rates that make buying on credit more expensive.
The Commerce Department said the increase in orders was led by a rise of 6.1 percent in electronic and other electrical equipment. Industrial machinery and equipment rose 2.7 percent, after climbing 1.4 percent during the previous month and soaring 9.1 percent in January.
The orders for all durable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $164.3 billion, up $1 billion from February. New orders for the first three months of this year were 3.4 percent higher than those in the fourth quarter of last year.

Disneyland and the old U.S.S.R.: Sharing something in common.

BYLINE: Peter Passell 

DATELINE: ANAHEIM, Calif.,

 BODY:
IT'S 3 o'clock on a sunny April afternoon, and tens of thousands of parents know exactly where their children are. Here at Disneyland, the line for Pirates of the Caribbean is an hour long. But that's nothing: Splash Mountain will set you back 90 minutes. And somewhere, deep in the bowels of Adventureland, 10-year-olds are hunkering down for the two and a half hour trial-by-boredom that precedes entry to Indiana Jones's Temple of the Forbidden Eye.
Nothing so graphically illustrates the organizational triumph of Disney as its ability to make people stand in line and like it. But wait. Didn't lines symbolize the bankruptcy of the Soviet system? Maybe Disneyomics has more in common with Soviet rationing than is first apparent. 
 Every veteran of Econ 101 understands the pitfalls of running an economy without the help of prices that reflect cost and value. In the Soviet Union, bread was cheap and easy to get. It was so cheap and easy that it was occasionally fed to pigs in lieu of grain.
By contrast, most consumer goods were deliberately rationed by waiting time. Thus everyone but party bigwigs and assorted heroes of socialism was forced into waiting lines for cars, apartments, video recorders, even good shoes. Nobody knew how many items to produce because nobody had a clue about their relative value.
So, why the comparison with Disney, that jewel in American capitalism's crown? Entry to Disneyland is by flat fee: $45 for adults, $35 for children plus $6 for parking. Thereafter, all rides are "free." The only attempt to use prices to match demand to supply is at the gate, where southern Californians and vacationers on package tours obtain discounts on off-peak days.
But Mickey and Donald are gentle commissars, specialists in minimizing the pain of waiting.
Waiting times are generally posted. Crowd control is friendly but firm, eliminating anxiety that the race will be won by the aggressive. If V.I.P.'s do manage to talk their way past the crowds, the proletariat never notices. And the really long queues are hidden inside buildings. "We try to create a total guest experience," explains John Dreyer, a spokesman for the Walt Disney Company.
But that still leaves a puzzle: Why doesn't Disney charge for individual rides according to their popularity, thereby reducing the waste inherent in queuing? Why, for that matter, asks Gary Becker, a Nobel laureate in economics at the University of Chicago, doesn't Disney price like museums and cable television systems? After all, they manage to charge a flat fee for access to the standard fare and then add on additional charges for premium entertainment.
Alternatively, why doesn't Disney offer its version of business class along with coach, charging, say, $100 to wait in separate (and presumably shorter) lines? Ski resorts manage this very discreetly, notes Walter Oi, an economist at the University of Rochester, by allowing skiers who buy lessons to cut into the lift lines.
One possibility is that theme park visitors are mostly one-time visitors, and thus Disney can afford to fool them by charging modestly and then delivering less access to rides than expected. But Robert H. Frank, an economist at Cornell University, dismisses the idea. "Disney," he explains, "lives on good will and word-of-mouth."
A more plausible explanation is the appeal of the salad bar: Americans don't like to think about budgets and find the experience particularly unpalatable when they are vacationing. It is no accident that cruise ships, ski resorts, rental car companies -- and most other theme parks -- use similar one-price-buys-everything plans.
Lawrence White, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University, offers yet another hypothesis. "Waiting in line is part of the fun," he suggests. What's more, there is safety in numbers: the lines validate consumers' decisions to go to Disneyland, much the way the difficulty of reserving a table at a trendy restaurant confirms the patrons' choice.
Perhaps the most intriguing explanation comes from Mr. Frank. If rides like Indiana Jones were priced high enough to eliminate the lines, he argues, it would be possible for visitors to spend hundreds of dollars a day on not-so-cheap thrills. Hence flat-rate pricing, he argues, "may be a way of rationing kids' demands without ever forcing their parents to say no."
What, then, does Disney pricing have to do with Soviet pricing? Both assume efficiency isn't everything, that rationing with time instead of money allows people to avoid confronting the unwelcome realities of inequity and limited income.
Like the Disney Company, the Soviets were in the business of packaging fantasy. Needless to say, Mickey does it much better. But the fact that it works for Disney suggests it just might work in more situations than economists like to admit.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold Takes a Severe Tumble As Most Commodities Decline

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
A rebound in the dollar and talk of gold sales by the International Monetary Fund prompted speculators to bail out of the precious metals markets yesterday, sending gold sharply lower.
Other commodities like orange juice also fell, and the Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities dropped 2.43 points, to 234.20. 
 At the Commodity Exchange, gold for June delivery fell $4.30 an ounce, to $388, barely above a four-week low of $387.50 reached near the close. July silver dropped 14.9 cents, to $5.634 an ounce. Trading volume in both markets was heavy.
William O'Neill, a Merrill Lynch analyst, said precious metals were shaken by the currency market's positive reaction to Tuesday's meeting of the finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial nations, even though the meeting produced no immediate measures to support the dollar.
The dollar jumped 1.98 Japanese yen in New York trading yesterday, ending at 83.80 yen.
Gold was also undermined by comments late Tuesday by Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, that there was "quite a lot of support" among the finance ministers for selling up to 6 percent of the gold held by the I.M.F. to help heavily indebted countries.
Such I.M.F. gold sales were endorsed in principle late yesterday by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and the Finance Minister of Canada, Paul Martin.
Elsewhere, frozen concentrated orange juice futures settled at five-week lows after tumbling the 5-cent daily limit. July juice ended down the limit at 106.40 cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange.
"There was exaggerated fund buying on the upside and now it's been exaggerated selling on the downside," a trader said.
The market's fundamental outlook remains healthy, traders said, in part because Florida is supplying a greater portion of the nation's needs as Brazil reduces shipments.
At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, lumber futures fell as cash markets turned soft. Reports that wholesalers are still discounting wood helped push prices to two-week lows. May lumber fell $6.60, to close at $260.70 for a thousand board feet.
Soybeans closed near yesterday's lows despite a bullish industry report released ahead of the opening. Even amid lower supplies, United States exports face growing competition from South America. May soybeans closed down 3.25 cents, at $5.65 a bushel, on the Chicago Board of Trade.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Moves to Bolster Ability to Handle Crises

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
Finance Ministers from rich and poor countries took a first step today toward strengthening the International Monetary Fund's capacity to head off future Mexican-style financial crises and giving the institution more resources to cope with those it fails to prevent.
At the first meeting of the I.M.F.'s policy-setting Interim Committee since the Washington-based institution contributed $17.5 billion to the Mexican rescue package, the ministers agreed to study ways to tighten I.M.F. surveillance over members' economies, creating a new financial safety net to help countries hit by sudden capital outflows and increasing the fund's lendable capital. 
 The reform proposals closely follow those put forward earlier this week by the United States Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, and Michel Camdessus, the I.M.F's Managing Director.
Agreement appeared strongest on the need for the I.M.F. to monitor members' economies more closely to see if they are in danger.
"There was real progress on surveillance," the Belgian Finance Minister, Philippe Maystadt, chairman of the meeting, said.
Regarding aid to Mexico, that nation's Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, told bankers attending a meeting of the International Institute of Finance here today that his country would run a small trade surplus in the first quarter of 1995 -- compared with a deficit of $ 4.5 billion in the comparable period of 1994 -- as a result of the austerity measures he has taken.
He said the money lent by the United States and the I.M.F. would be sufficient to meet Mexico's debt repayment needs this year, and Mexico would probably not need to draw on some $ 10 billion of credits promised by the Bank for international Settlements in Basel, Switzerland.
Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, said the I.M.F. should concentrate its surveillance on "the world's key economies -- perhaps 30 to 40 countries, where events could have a global impact."

HEADLINE: A New World Bank: Consultant to Third World Investors

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
If James D. Wolfensohn has his way, the finance ministers gathering for a World Bank-sponsored meeting Thursday on third world development strategies will soon be dealing with a radically different international lending institution.
Mr. Wolfensohn, the 61-year-old investment banker and arts patron, becomes the World Bank's ninth president in June, and what he has in mind is nothing less than a revamping of the bank's role. 
 Instead of financing dams and other big development projects in the third world, he says, the bank will focus far more on private investments. And instead of doing what it has done for the last 50 years -- putting more money into more projects in developing nations than any other institution -- it will function more as a consultant or adviser.
"We must create the conditions for private capital to flow into all these countries," Mr. Wolfensohn said in an interview. "That means insuring they develop a healthy, skilled work force, encouraging good governance and a favorable regulatory environment for business. The World Bank must use its skills and expertise in these fields to show them how to attract private investment. The World Bank is now a minor source of capital."
According to Lyn Squire, the World Bank's research director, "the bank will become more of a knowledge-based institution, advising countries on developing their private sector." He says the bank has considerable expertise in teaching people how to form a society based on the rule of law, how to develop stock and bond markets, and how to institute regulations that will help, not hinder, business.
The proposed changes come at a critical time in the bank's history. It is under attack by environmentalists and others, who charge that its huge development projects help neither the environment nor the poor. And in Washington, a Republican Congress is reluctant to allocate money for third world development.
Mr. Wolfensohn's emphasis on an advisory role and on private investment could be just the antidote. "There is need for change and I intend to be an instrument of change," he insists. He is giving himself until January to decide on a plan of action.
His approach is not just a response to critics. The enthusiasm for private investment reflects a recent turnabout in development financing, with private investment replacing aid as the primary engine of economic development.
As recently as 1990, World Bank loans and other official development aid -- $57.9 billion -- exceeded private investment in third world countries -- which totaled $45.5 billion. By last year, that had been sharply reversed, with private investment reaching $179.9 billion and official assistance coming to $54.5 billion.
But private investment is largely confined to certain countries, with 87 percent going to 20 nations, led by China. Sub-Saharan Africa got less than 1.5 percent, and more than a billion people worldwide still live on less than $1 a day.
Mr. Wolfensohn will be pushing for third world investment at a time when such private risk-taking is slowing down. With higher interest rates, there is less money for foreign investment, and the Mexican crisis has scared away potential investors from countries beyond Mexico.
"Mr. Wolfensohn's challenge now is to convince more developing countries to become attractive to investors," persuading those investors that they are a good risk," said Richard Frank, one of three managing directors sharing control until Mr. Wolfensohn arrives.
Mr. Wolfensohn acknowledges that the World Bank must do more to encourage private investment in countries that have yet to attract private investors. To underscore this commitment, soon after he joins the bank he will make his first field trip to Africa, where poverty and instability is so great that the bank is only able to operate in half the 48 countries. "We are in the poverty-reduction business," he said, "so I'm starting in the market where the need for our services is greatest."
Under Mr. Wolfensohn's predecessor, Lewis T. Preston, who has cancer and is retiring early, the World Bank has been doing more to help countries attract investment.
Poverty reduction has been declared the World Bank's "overarching goal," and social lending for health and education has tripled, to $3.1 billion since 1990, and will reach $5 billion by the end of the century. This has twin aims: protecting basic social programs against austerity measures while encouraging the creation of the skilled, healthy work force investors want.
Mr. Preston has also moderated the World Bank's enthusiasm for ever-higher lending. His emphasis on quality of lending over quantity has meant a drop in new loans, to $14.2 billion last year from $16.9 billion in 1993. Only 18 percent of projects performed poorly last year -- by the bank's standard, that means producing less than 10 percent annual return -- compared with 37.5 percent below standard in 1992.
The bank has also become more accountable, creating an appeals panel to adjudicate complaints about its projects from citizens of borrowing countries. Still, difficulties abound. While the bank lends only to governments, its private-sector arm, the International Finance Corporation, encourages private investment in developing countries by taking stakes in their projects, offering a measure of protection against abuses by local officials.
A recent report by the Overseas Development Council in Washington, a pro-aid lobby, urges the International Finance Corporation to do more. Its top management is reluctant. "With a $10 billion portfolio set to grow 15 to 20 percent a year until the year 2002, we are doing all we dare," said Daniel F. Adams, vice president for operations. Come June, this could lead to friction with Mr. Wolfensohn if the new bank president opts for the development council's recommendations.
Mr. Frank, one of the interim managing directors, thinks the answer for the World Bank is to promote more private investment in basic facilities projects by guaranteeing them against risks like government interference with pricing. He also wants the bank to lend more for restructuring and recapitalizing third world banking systems.
In June, the World Bank will lend Mexico $1 billion to reform its banking system, its largest loan ever, with big loans also planned for Argentina and Morocco.

HEADLINE: Justices Step In as Federalism's Referee

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
Unlike President Clinton, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist does not hold news conferences. But if he did, it would not occur to anyone to ask him whether he was still relevant.
The Supreme Court's stunning decision of Wednesday that Congress lacked the authority to bar gun possession in or near schools was a forceful reminder not only of the Court's raw power -- nine people, divided 5 to 4, invalidated a law that two houses of Congress and the President of the United States approved five years ago -- but also of its inevitable role in shaping the country's ongoing political dialogue. 
 Had Chief Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion in United States v. Lopez landed in a vacuum, it would have been an important constitutional development but scarcely one to provoke statements on the Senate floor or the kind of urgent scrutiny the decision received all over Washington.
But this is a season in which questions of federalism are unusually high on the agenda -- not only the efforts of state officials to shed unwanted Federal mandates, a prominent topic during the opening weeks of the new Congress, but also the new interest, prompted by the Oklahoma City bombing and the Clinton Administration's proposed responses, in the appropriate division of law-enforcement authority between the Federal and state governments.
The Court's rediscovery of limits on Federal power under a constitutional provision, the commerce clause, that it had not interpreted in such a way in nearly 60 years is bound to affect the federalism debate in ways that may not be apparent until the full dimensions of the ruling itself become clear, perhaps years from now as its principles are tested in other contexts.
One indication of how far the new majority intends to go could come quickly. The Justices heard arguments two months ago in a case that has received much less attention but that poses a closely related question about the Federal Government's law-enforcement authority under its constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce. A decision could come any week.
This second case, United States v. Robertson, raises the question whether the Federal racketeering law can be applied to a business-related crime that occurs essentially within the borders of a single state.
The Federal law, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, makes it a crime to invest racketeering proceeds in a business "the activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce." A Federal appeals court, ruling that the operations of a small Alaska gold mine did not affect interstate commerce, overturned the conviction of a former Federal prosecutor for investing narcotics proceeds in the mine.
By the same token, the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that the Gun-Free School Zones Act was not within the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce because the possession of guns near schools was not sufficiently related to commerce. If the Justices agree with the lower court in the Alaska case, they will be taking that analysis a considerable step further, because the gold mine was self-evidently a commercial operation in a way that schools are not.
Furthermore, Miguel A. Estrada, an assistant solicitor general, argued to the Court in the Government's appeal, people and supplies moved into and out of Alaska as part of the gold mine's operations.
"Is there any business enterprise in America that wouldn't be covered" by the Government's broad theory of the commerce power, a skeptical Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked Mr. Estrada. No, he replied: "In our economy in this day and age, I can't think of anything that is likely to happen in the real world" that would not be related to interstate commerce.
It was just such a broad interpretation of interstate commerce that the Court's majority, including Justice O'Connor, rejected on Wednesday in the Lopez decision. If the Justices also reject the broad definition when it concerns an actual business, and not only a nonprofit customary function of state government like public education, it will be clear that the Lopez case applies beyond a rather anomalous Federal law.
The Court would then be repudiating one of the fundamental principles underlying the modern understanding of the commerce clause: that the power of the Federal Government grows necessarily, almost organically, as the increasingly complex and interrelated national economy makes the concept of local boundaries essentially obsolete.
In place of that longstanding view, the Court would be reinserting itself into a role it explicitly renounced in a landmark decision 10 years ago: that of guardian of the Federal-state balance.
In that 1985 decision, Garcia v. San Antonio Transit, the Court said restrictions on the scope of Congressional authority to regulate interstate commerce must come not from "judicially created limitations" but from the political process itself. Because states themselves participate in Federal decision-making through their representation in Congress, the Court said, "the political process ensures that laws that unduly burden the States will not be promulgated."
Like the Lopez ruling 10 years later, the Garcia decision left a deeply divided Court. Justices O'Connor and Rehnquist, two of the four dissenters, pledged in their opinion in the Garcia case that "this Court will in time again assume its constitutional responsibility."
Developments not only within the Court but also outside it may have strengthened the Garcia dissenters' hand. To the alarm of much of the Federal judiciary, Congress has demonstrated a nearly insatiable appetite for showing its concern about various problems, from household violence to drive-by shootings, by adding them to the growing list of Federal crimes and, in the process, placing them on the dockets of Federal judges.
The Judicial Conference of the United States, the Federal judiciary's policy-making arm, which Chief Justice Rehnquist heads, has opposed several of these bills and urged Congress to reconsider its approach.
Judge Maryanne Trump Barry of the Federal District Court in Newark, head of the Judicial Conference's criminal law committee, told the House Judiciary Committee last year that the Federal courts were not equipped to take over proceedings for what have historically been state and local offenses. Noting that there were more trial judges on the California state courts than in all the Federal district courts combined, Judge Barry said that "scarce judicial resources needed by the Federal courts to try major crimes" would be "diluted" if various proposals then under consideration in the 1994 crime bill became law. Many did.
While Congressional Republicans generally applauded the Court's solicitude toward the states in Wednesday's decision, they may find that a Supreme Court that re-assumes a role as activist policeman of the Federal-state boundary is not always to their liking. The Federal limits on state-court damage awards, now being debated in the Senate as part of the Republican-sponsored civil justice measure, may well not match the Court's view of appropriate Federal action even if the states welcome them. Relevance, in other words, may be a double-edged sword.

HEADLINE: Ex-Official Pleads Guilty in Orange County's Fall

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 27

 BODY:
In the first criminal action since Orange County was forced into bankruptcy late last year, the county's former treasurer, Robert L. Citron, pleaded guilty late today to six felony counts, including misappropriating hundreds of millions of dollars and misleading investors in the county's bonds.
Mr. Citron, whose investment strategies with high-powered securities caused $1.7 billion in losses and created the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history, was subdued and wan as he entered his plea late today before Judge David Carter of the Orange County Superior Court. 
 The plea agreement marked an about-face for Mr. Citron. Previously, he had insisted that he was not the architect of his own investment schemes and that he had broken no laws in his efforts to manage the county's funds. In a state Legislature hearing earlier this year, he had blamed his principal broker, Merrill Lynch & Company, for pushing him into the ultimately disastrous investment practices.
Although Mr. Citron is essentially accused of bankrupting one of the nation's most prosperous counties with his reckless investment schemes, the District Attorney's office said he did not benefit personally from the illegal acts. They appear to have been undertaken in an effort to rescue a financial house of cards once his losses began to grow.
Assistant District Attorney Jan Nolan read the felony counts in the televised court appearance, then asked, "Is it true?" Mr. Citron, a slender, bespectacled, 70-year-old man who just a few months ago was juggling billions of dollars daily, answered, "It is."
The Orange County District Attorney said the maximum sentence Mr. Citron could receive would be 14 years in prison.
Mr. Citron has agreed to cooperate with the continuing criminal investigation. Today's plea agreement thus appears unlikely to be the last legal action in this case, which has become a landmark not only for municipal government but also for the financial markets.
Mr. Citron suffered many of his losses because of strategies involving highly complex investments known as derivatives -- investments that are tied to, or derived from, the performance of an underlying asset, like a currency, or the performance of a financial market, like interest rates. Derivatives were involved in the collapse earlier this year of Barings P.L.C. and caused hundreds of millions of dollars of losses for companies including Gibson Greetings Inc. and Procter & Gamble.
The losses at those two companies, and at several others, were caused by a sharp and unexpected rise in interest rates, which forced the prices of bonds and a number of other securities to decline sharply. But the magnitude of the losses was magnified by the fact that in each case derivatives were being used, leading to much faster swings in prices.
Orange County has already sued the broker with whom Mr. Citron had done most of his trading, Merrill Lynch, for $2 billion. Because today's plea agreement clearly suggests that there was fraud in the sale of some of Orange County's bonds, it raised the prospect that Merrill, the underwriter of some of those bonds, might also face charges. The Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating the case for possible violations of the securities laws.
William Popejoy, Orange County's chief executive, said at a news conference this evening that he hoped the plea agreement would persuade the Wall Street firm to settle with the county.
Timothy Gilles, a Merrill spokesman, said that securities firm had no comment.
Mr. Citron was released on $25,000 bond. His sentencing was set for Aug. 4.
Mr. Citron was always something of an anomaly. He was a Democrat elected repeatedly for the job of treasurer of one of the most conservative and heavily Republican counties in America. He was personally a simple man who attended the University of Southern California, spent his career with the county government, earned $104,353 a year and ate lunch three times a week at a local Elks Club lodge.
But as part of his job he managed a huge $7.4 billion fund that made him one of the more prominent government investors in the country. The money came not just from Orange County, but a variety of other local governments and government agencies. He had attracted the funds because of his surprisingly good investment returns in previous years.
Despite their powerful resistance to taxes, these governments were happy to invest their money in a fund that seemed to earn them something for nothing. In fact, the pain of the losses Mr. Citron ultimately suffered was exacerbated by the fact that Orange County and some of these other government agencies borrowed huge sums of money to invest even more in Mr. Citron's fund.
When the fund began to suffer losses, particularly after interest rates began to rise sharply early last year, Mr. Citron took a number of steps that ultimately added to depth of the problems. That is when he is believed to have committed most of his crimes.
In the plea agreement, he was charged with making false statements to sell Orange County securities, making false bookkeeping entries, misappropriating hundreds of millions of dollars of funds by shuffling money between different accounts. The only specific losses with which he was charged was causing $2.5 million in damages.
Mr. Citron resigned from his job on Dec. 4 and the county filed for bankruptcy two days later. Since then, the county has cut 1,500 jobs, slashed services and is on the brink of defaulting on about $1 billion in bonds that come due this summer.
"I hope this allows the county to get some part of its anger behind them," Mr. Popejoy said tonight.

HEADLINE: 20 Years After War, 3 in Hanoi on Healing Mission

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, April 25

 BODY:
They are all survivors of the war, these three Americans whose lives tell the history of their country's ordeal in Vietnam.
They gathered in a newly whitewashed ward of an otherwise decrepit children's hospital: a decorated veteran whose leg was blown off in a Vietnamese rice paddy in 1968; a doctor who in 1971 announced that he would refuse to fight in Vietnam, a declaration that could have landed him in prison, and a Vietnamese-born engineer, who was only a boy of 7 on that fateful night 20 years ago this week when American evacuation helicopters carried the rest of his family away from Saigon, and left him behind. 
 All three were here -- on the 20th anniversary of the fall of Saigon and the end of the war -- to try to make peace with Vietnam by healing its children.
"When the Army sent me to Vietnam, they told me I was fighting for the people of Vietnam," said Jeffrey Fredrick, 45, the veteran from Tallahassee, Fla., who lost his right leg to a Vietcong booby trap in Cu Chi Province. "Now, at last, it's true. Now I really am fighting for these people."
With $1.3 million from the United States Government through the Agency for International Development and $300,000 from the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, Mr. Fredrick and an American team are opening a clinic to supply state-of-the-art plastic braces to help handicapped Vietnamese children to walk.
The opening ceremony at the clinic will be held Saturday, the eve of the anniversary of the end of the war.
It was Mr. Fredrick who recruited the others: Dr. Jeffrey H. Garrison, 51, a rehabilitative-medicine specialist from St. Petersburg, Fla., who during the war declared himself a conscientious objector and refused to fight, and Quan Pham, the 27-year-old Vietnamese-American technician who was abandoned by his family in Saigon on April 29, 1975.
Mr. Pham was left behind when his father, a pilot with the South Vietnamese Air Force, fled with his wife and his three other children aboard one of the last American evacuation helicopters fleeing Tan Son Nhut Air Base, on the outskirts of Saigon.
Mr. Pham, who was then staying with his grandmother elsewhere in the city, spent the next six years as a child laborer in Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City. "I hauled ice, I hauled coal, I chopped wood," he recalled.
"When my family was evacuated, I was so young then that I didn't understand what was happening," he said. "I just remember that I was very confused."
He did not see his parents again until 1981, when he was allowed by the Vietnamese Government to leave Vietnam to join them in Florida, where today they own a dry-cleaning business.
"Coming back to Vietnam was my idea," said Mr. Pham, who had worked with Mr. Fredrick in his orthopedic clinic in Tallahassee. While his father remains a staunch anti-Communist and was wary of his son returning to the former enemy capital, Hanoi, "my parents still wanted me to come back and do something for Vietnam," he said.
Mr. Pham interrupted the conversation to help a group of hospital workers tear off the packing material from some of the newly imported equipment for the clinic, including an infrared oven that will be used to bake flesh-colored plastic into leg braces.
The braces will be molded individually from the legs of Vietnamese children who cannot walk, or cannot walk normally, because of birth defects and disease. The clinic is expected to care for at least 1,000 children a year who, until now, could have hoped only for crude leg braces made of bamboo.
Dr. Garrison, the team's physician, felt that the time was finally right for him to come to Vietnam, 24 years after he informed his draft board in Peekskill, N.Y., that he would refuse to fight in the war.
Dr. Garrison, a Quaker, said his religious principles barred him from fighting in any war -- an explanation that was eventually accepted by the draft board.
"And even if you believed that war was a justifiable behavior -- and I don't -- the Vietnam War really seemed to be trumped up," Dr. Garrison, 51, said. "Now I believe that there is a moral obligation to help the recovery of this country."
Meeting for the first time with his patients this week, Dr. Garrison saw what had become of Vietnam two decades after the war. In one of the poorest countries on earth, his tiny patients entered the examination room wearing little but soiled rags, their misshaped bodies often a testament to poor nutrition and to diseases, including polio, that have been eradicated from the developed world.
Other children, he said, suffer from birth defects that could be a result of their mothers' poor nutrition during pregnancy.
One young mother carried a year-old boy who suffered from cerebral palsy, his ears misshapen and his back so extended that it seemed the muscles might tear. "He cannot even recognize me," the frightened mother told Dr. Garrison, asking for some sort of help that might allow the boy just to crawl.
Dr. Garrison tried to comfort the woman, saying that eventually the clinic might be able to help the boy with braces for his deformed legs. But privately he told visitors, "I don't know that this boy will live."
It is difficult to tell that Mr. Fredrick, the clinic director, is an amputee. He walks with only the slightest hitch in his stride.
"The idea of having all these kids walk with a brace and play in a playground is unrealistic," said Mr. Fredrick, who turned the lessons learned from his affliction into a life's career -- he now runs clinics for the manufacture of orthopedic devices. "But we want to do everything that it takes to rehabilitate as many as we can."
Mr. Fredrick said that he felt no bitterness toward the Vietnamese over the loss of his leg, insisting that he was in fact lucky.
"It's amazing that I didn't lose both legs," he said of the searing blast from the booby trap in 1968. "A whole lot of other people have reason to be bitter about the war -- and they're the people of Vietnam."
He said he resented the American veterans who use the war "as an excuse," adding, "Vietnam has become an across-the-board excuse for a whole generation of guys who messed up their lives."
"Compare our trauma to the trauma of these little kids," he said, nodding to a dank hallway filled with anxious Vietnamese parents cradling their handicapped children. "Now that -- that's trauma."

HEADLINE: At an Israeli Checkpoint, Food Rots, Tempers Boil

BYLINE: By JOEL GREENBERG 

DATELINE: EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip, April 27

 BODY:
After waiting four days at checkpoints earlier this month to drive his vegetables out of the Gaza Strip, Suleiman Qdeih moved to the head of a line of trucks with a load of spoiling produce and simmering resentment.
The delay had ruined his cargo. 
 "It has all turned into garbage in the sun and heat," he said shortly before Israeli soldiers began a security check of his truck, which was packed with tomatoes, eggplants and cucumbers. "If I don't get through now, I'm going to dump it all."
Transport restrictions imposed after a Gaza truck carrying explosives was found in southern Israel last month have dealt another heavy blow to Gaza's crippled economy.
Shipment of goods in and out of the area has been severely curbed for weeks, adding to losses caused by a border closing that prevents tens of thousands of Palestinian laborers from reaching jobs in Israel. The restictions were imposed by Israel to block suicide attacks by Palestinian militants; such attacks have killed more than 65 people in the past year.
The damage to the Palestinian economy caused by the ban on workers, estimated by United Nations officials at $2 million a day, has brought pressure on Israel from the United States and other countries, which the losses are wiping out the benefits of their financial assistance.
At a meeting in Paris today, the donors agreed to provide $60 million to help cover the authority's $136 million budget deficit for the rest of this year. Israel pledged to ease the flow of goods to and from Gaza, but asserted that the key to free movement was improved security.
In the past, hundreds of Palestinian trucks passed daily through this fortified, Israeli-controlled crossing on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip, carrying vegetables, fruits and flowers to the West Bank and Israel and for export overseas, and bringing back Israeli goods.
Now only several dozen trucks are allowed each day, and their loads must be transferred to Israeli trailers and checked by soldiers. Even fewer trucks actually enter Israel, and they must travel in convoys escorted by the police.
At the checkpoints, whether they are controlled by the Israelis or by the Palestinian police, long security checks leave scores of trucks stranded for days. Ship departures from Israeli ports have been missed, and dozens of tons of spoiled produce have had to be dumped.
The curbs on shipments from Israel have caused more damage. Gaza industries lack raw materials, flour is in shorter supply and a shortage of cement has hampered building projects. These problems have driven up prices of basic goods.
Critics say the restrictions have brought new security risks by driving an entire population dangerously close to despair.
"This is destroying people, agriculture and the economy," said Juma Thum, a truck driver who arrived at Erez after a three-day wait. "A person who can't find money in his pocket to feed his children will want to blow himself up."
Frustrated drivers have already held angry protests at roadblocks, dumping spoiled goods. The Palestinian Authority initially hit back by barring Israeli goods from the Gaza Strip, but Gazans depend on those products and so the authority loosened its restrictions.
"Israel wants to suffocate the Palestinian Authority," asserted Nabil Abu Irdeina, an authority spokesman. "This is collective punishment, which is endangering the whole peace process."
Some truck drivers doubt Israeli assertions that the issue is security, saying Israel's true aim is to turn embittered Gazans against their own government.
"It would be better if they closed off the border entirely," said Raji Taha, a truck driver. "We won't take from them, they won't take from us, and we'll live on tomatoes and cucumbers. This is no way to live."
Ramiz Abu Taha, a cigarette distributor from Rafah, in southern Gaza, said he had been cut off from his Israeli suppliers. Like many Gazans, he seemed torn between continuing dependence on Israel and a desire to separate from it.
"Israel is responsible for us," he said, but he added: "If they don't want to deal with us, fine. Let them close the border. But they have to open other borders, to Egypt, so we can be self-reliant. Now we are surrounded. We are in a big jail."

HEADLINE: Clinton and Yeltsin Seeking Common Ground for Talks

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin struggled today to find common ground in anticipation of their summit meeting next month in Moscow, papering over some disputes, ignoring others, and resolving none of them.
Their 30-minute telephone conversation was cordial but vague, underscoring strains between the United States and Russia that American officials made no effort to hide. Senior American officials acknowledged that Mr. Clinton did not even raise the most serious issue dividing Washington and Moscow: Russia's $1 billion deal to build two nuclear energy reactors for Iran, which the United States wants canceled. 
 Shortly before the conversation, Mr. Clinton met for 10 minutes with Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, who spent much of the afternoon lobbying leading lawmakers in Congress not to punish Russia for its deal with Iran and its war in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
"We all unanimously took the view that Russia should not be making the sale and asked him simply to not do it," said Senator Richard C. Lugar, Republican of Indiana.
Mr. Kozyrev countered by saying that Russia was doing nothing more than what the United States was doing with its deal to provide North Korea with nuclear energy, Mr. Lugar said. The Russian added that the technology involved was not dangerous, the money involved was important for Russia's economy and the United States should seek to encourage Russia's ties to Iran.
Although the Administration's official line is that Mr. Yeltsin must be supported because he is the elected President, Administration officials admit that relations are based more on mutual suspicion than on trust.
In fact, the main reason Mr. Clinton will be in Moscow 13 days from now is that the relationship would only get worse if he is not. Russian officials have made clear that they would be highly insulted if the President of the United States did not attend ceremonies commemorating the 50th anniversary of the victory over Germany in World War II.
But there are no illusions inside the Administration that Mr. Clinton will move Mr. Yeltsin from his fixed positions on Bosnia, Iran, the eastward expansion of NATO or the rebellion in Chechnya. Since no policy breakthroughs are expected, the two sides are preparing modest joint statements reaffirming support for the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and a willingness to work together on European security issues.
The absence of progress in the conversation between the two Presidents was best captured in an exchange with Coit Blacker, the chief Russia specialist in the National Security Council, who took notes on the conversation and later briefed reporters.
Asked if there was any progress on the Iran nuclear reactor, Chechnya or NATO, he replied:
"The President took advantage of his time on the phone with President Yeltsin to raise a number of issues and to underscore, as far as we're concerned, the importance of working these through in ways that are consistent with what we think is in the long-term interest not only of our own security but international security more broadly."
Asked then if there had been no progress, Mr. Blacker said, "You can characterize it as you choose."
Addressing Mr. Yeltsin as "Boris," Mr. Clinton emphasized the need to protect the good part of the relationship between their countries rather than dwell on the bad, one senior Administration official said.
In particular, Mr. Clinton stressed the need to find a formula for European security that would include Russia's signing on to a program of military cooperation with NATO.
Russia had taken preliminary steps to join the arrangement but Mr. Yeltsin later balked, convinced that the program was an effort to expand NATO and isolate Russia.
In his conversation with Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Clinton only briefly mentioned the need for a permanent Russian cease-fire in Chechnya and to resolve various arms control disputes, officials said.
He did not remind Mr. Yeltsin that he still had not turned over a complete list of pending arms sales to Iran, something he had promised Mr. Clinton last fall at a summit meeting in Washington, they said.
Most surprising, they said that Mr. Clinton did not express specific concern over Russia's nuclear deal with Iran. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has charged that Iran is on a "crash course" to develop nuclear weapons and presented Mr. Kozyrev with extensive classified intelligence information to make the Administration's case.
Although Mr. Clinton intends to raise the Iran nuclear deal when he meets with Mr. Yeltsin, the Russians have made clear they do not share Washington's concerns and that they plan to go ahead with it.
Mr. Clinton also asked Mr. Yeltsin for his help in trying to find Frederick C. Cuny, an American disaster relief expert, and five Russian aid workers who disappeared on a mission to Chechnya this month.
The American Embassy in Moscow is sending four officials to the North Caucasus to hunt for Mr. Cuny following the failure of an earlier mission, the State Department said.

Fighting In Chechnya
 MOSCOW, April 28 (AP) -- Russian troops shelled a battered Chechen village and fought rebel guerrillas today, hours before a cease-fire by Russia was to begin.
President Boris N. Yeltsin ordered the unilateral cease-fire to coincide with a visit to Moscow by world leaders, but there were few signs the fighting in the secessionist republic would stop. The cease-fire is to take effect at 12:01 A.M. Friday and last until May 12.
Even before Mr. Yeltsin could sign the cease-fire, the Defense Minister, Pavel S. Grachev, warned that Russian troops would retaliate heavily for any attack by Chechen rebels.

HEADLINE: In U.N.'s Future, a Leaner Budget

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 27

 BODY:
For the first time in years, the United Nations, an organization not celebrated for penny-pinching, will find its new budget significantly reduced -- 4.2 percent less than the current one.
The leaner budget, which needs the General Assembly's approval before it takes effect in January, was devised by Joseph E. Connor, a retired American business executive with 38 years' experience in public accounting and auditing. In the year since he was hired as the new Under Secretary General for Administration and Management, Mr. Connor has moved quietly to tighten up an organization with a sometimes cavalier disregard for thrift. 
 "Governments are downsizing, outsourcing, innovating, and we have to be the same way," Mr. Connor said in an interview in his pin-tidy office on the 27th floor of the United Nations Secretariat. "It's imperative that all international organizations realize that they don't work for themselves, they represent the member states. They've got to justify what they produce."
In a note sent Wednesday to diplomatic missions of the 185 member states, he outlined the first details of a budget of $2.51 billion for 1996-97 that is $109 million less than the current budget of nearly $2.62 billion for 1994-95.
The saving in the proposed budget is being achieved by dropping $92 million worth of obsolete missions and programs, like a longstanding anti-apartheid campaign, and by shaving $36 million more through efficiency. Spending will increase $19 million in areas like human rights and drug control. Of this, $2.8 million will go to strengthen internal oversight of the staff and spending.
The frugalities are proposed at a time when Congress has threatened to cut back contributions to the United Nations. The United States provides a quarter of the United Nations' regular budget and 31.7 percent of peacekeeping costs. Congress has moved to trim Washington's share of peacekeeping costs to 25 percent as well. The United States and other nations forced the United Nations to trim its staff in the late 1980's in return for bailing it out of a financial crisis.
Mr. Connor, who is 63, worked for Price Waterhouse for 36 years, retiring in 1992 as its chief executive. He taught accounting and business management at Georgetown University's Graduate School of Business, until Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali brought him to the United Nations last May 2.
He joined an organization that is long on bureaucracy and short on professional management. The member nations call the shots, and the Secretary General does not even directly control some United Nations agencies.
"It's not designed for management," Mr. Connor said of the system. "It defies oversight because there is no person who is the chief executive of the organization."
In a culture where virtually no one gets laid off, Mr. Connor has picked 201 jobs for elimination from a Secretariat staff of about 10,115. Some 66 jobs will be created in new areas, and 26 will be transferred to the regular budget from peacekeeping operations. The new budget is based on a projection that the United Nations can run with 10 percent fewer people. He has already eliminated 45 employees through retirement, buy-outs and what he calls talk-outs.
Mr. Connor said he wanted supervisors to stop feeling helpless in the face of incompetence and union resistance. At the United Nations, work is almost uniformly rated good or excellent because employees can appeal anything less than enthusiastic appraisals of their performance.
"When a supervisor knows he may have to spend two or three years defending an evaluation," Mr. Connor said, "he's not likely to make a critical evaluation."
Some of Mr. Connor's proposals would strike American businessmen as common sense, though he said, "It's a revolution over here."
He wants the budget to reflect a meaningful strategic plan, not merely requests from departments and agencies as happens now. Such a plan would include evaluations, he said, with "financial consequences" for activities that fail to measure up. He said the $36 million to be saved in the new budget by "focusing on how to work better" is more than double the $15 million that the Secretary General asked for.
But Mr. Connor observed that the United Nations output was not as quantifiable as, for instance, automobiles produced on an assembly line. And unlike a business, the United Nations has no income beyond what it gets from its members. It cannot borrow money or issue bonds.
"We have no net worth, we have no assets, we have no capital," Mr. Connor said. Tardy payments of assessments by many member nations -- the United States was more than $1.2 billion in arrears as of April 15 -- have forced the United Nations to shuffle income to cover its expenses.
Mr. Connor said he was calling a halt to new ideas to give the organization a chance to catch up. He conceded that he can only go so far to rein in the system.
"It's the Secretariat's job to put on the table where the least effective spending is," he said, adding: "It's up to members to decide what the member states want the organization to do. We would like to do that with the cooperation and participation of member states."

HEADLINE: 'Isolationism' Strongly Attacked By Top Clinton Security Adviser

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
The President's national security adviser today attacked what he called a rising wave of isolationism in the nation.
The national security adviser, Anthony Lake, made one of the Administration's fiercest attacks against isolationism at a time when many Republicans in Congress are seeking to slash foreign aid and restrict President Clinton's ability to commit United States troops to United Nations peacekeeping operations. 
 "Our policy of engagement in world affairs is under siege, and American leadership is in peril," he said in a speech to the Woodrow Wilson Center, a research group specializing in foreign affairs.
Mr. Lake argued that isolationists were seeking to undo a successful post-World War II system built on military might, foreign assistance and leadership in the world economy. He leveled his harshest criticisms at "back-door isolationists," a group that he said denies that it is isolationist even as it supports scaling back the United States role in world affairs.
"These back-door isolationists and unilateralists cast themselves as the true guardians of American power," he said. "But through their actions they could become the agents of American retreat. They champion American leadership but they want it the one way you can't have it: on the cheap."
He argued that if the United States turned isolationist, problems like international terrorism and aggression by countries like Iraq would only grow worse.
"Defeating these threats requires persistent engagement and hands-on policies," he said. "Defeating them demands resources. Throwing money at problems won't make them go away -- but we also cannot solve problems without money. The measure of American leadership is not only the strength and attraction of our values, but what we bring to the table to solve the hard issues."
Mr. Lake defended United States cooperation with other countries in providing money and troops for United Nations peacekeeping missions. He said such operations have been successful in Cyprus, Haiti, Cambodia, Namibia and along the Iraq-Kuwait border.
"We would pay much more if we performed even a small number of these missions unilaterally," he said.

HEADLINE: Governors' Draft Plan Rejects Parts of House Welfare Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
The bipartisan leadership of the National Governors' Association has drafted a new proposal to overhaul the nation's welfare system, urging the Senate to reject stringent work requirements and many other provisions of a welfare bill passed last month by the House.
A sweeping critique of the House bill, prepared by the staff of the association, says "most states do not believe they can achieve" the goals of the House bill, which would require half of all adult welfare recipients to work by 2003. 
 A letter drafted by the governors' association asks the Senate "to avoid prescribing narrow Federal work standards for the cash assistance block grant," which under the House bill would replace the main welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children.
Republican governors, including Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and George V. Voinovich of Ohio, voiced some of these objections two weeks ago. But the new letter drafted by the governors' association would put the imprimatur of that bipartisan organization on a much broader critique of the House bill.
The governors' statement could be very influential, since the Senate Finance Committee will soon begin drafting a welfare bill, and few members have expressed strong convictions about how to proceed. In addition, Republicans may need Democratic votes to overcome a filibuster on the Senate floor.
In their draft statement, the governors urge the Senate not to impose "rigid work standards" on the states, saying that such requirements could impede efforts by the states to devise innovative work programs. The governors also say they "oppose the wholesale elimination of Federal services to legal noncitizens," which they say would result from the House bill. And they urge the Senate to reject provisions of the House bill that would deny aid to hundreds of thousands of disabled children now receiving cash assistance under the Supplemental Security Income program.
The governors also oppose provisions of the House bill that would prohibit Federal welfare payments to unmarried teen-age mothers and additional children born to women already receiving welfare. Likewise, they say the question of whether to impose a time limit on welfare, like the five-year limit in the House bill, should be left to the states.
Under the House bill, welfare recipients would be counted as working only if they engaged in "work activities" for a specific number of hours: 20 hours a week from 1996 through 1998, rising to 35 hours a week in 2002.
The governors expressed misgivings about these requirements. "If the Senate decides to impose a standard for hours of work," they said, "we urge you to recognize that in our society mothers with young children typically work only part time. We believe that any standard for hours of work should not ask more of low-income single parents with young children than is demanded of other mothers with young children. In particular, the governors do not think it is reasonable to mandate 35 hours of work a week."
In a letter to the governors, Raymond C. Scheppach, executive director of the governors' association, said, "I believe that we need to begin discussing options for a bipartisan Senate welfare reform package that N.G.A. could support." Moreover, Mr. Scheppach said, if the governors make a bipartisan recommendation to the Senate Finance Committee, "it is likely to be taken quite seriously."
The chairman of the committee, Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, has said he supports a block grant for the main cash assistance program. The governors' association recommends three separate block grants, for cash assistance to poor families, for child care and for the protection of children who have been abused or neglected.
The association has no policy on whether Federal payments for foster care and adoption assistance should be incorporated in a block grant, as the House bill would require. But Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, and the National Association of Counties say the Federal Government should continue to guarantee such payments for anyone who meets the eligibility criteria.
The governors said the House bill did not provide enough protection against recessions. They urged the Senate to create a contingency fund to help states that experience economic problems or faced sudden increases in the numbers of abused and neglected children referred to state agencies by local courts.

HEADLINE: TERROR IN OKLAHOMA: COURT CASE;
Bomb Delays Man's Trial On Gun Charge in Virginia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
A judge in Roanoke, Va., has delayed the trial of a member of an anti-government paramilitary group in Virginia on gun charges, saying it would be difficult to find an impartial jury.
The judge, Jackson L. Kiser of Federal District Court, said speculation about links between the Oklahoma City bombing and paramilitary groups in other states had tainted prospective jurors. 
 The trial was scheduled to start on Wednesday.
Judge Kiser said the trial of William Stump 2d, a 35-year-old unemployed machinist accused of conspiracy to violate Federal gun laws, would be delayed at least six weeks.
Donald R. Wolthuis, the Assistant United States Attorney who is prosecuting the case, said Judge Kiser's "concerns about public sentiment over Oklahoma City were well-taken."
Mr. Stump is one of five members of the Blue Ridge Hunt Club, a tiny, now-defunct citizens' paramilitary group, who were charged last summer after the police infiltrated the group. He is accused of possessing illegal firearms and silencers.
Two men, including the club's president, James Roy Mullins, pleaded guilty to charges against them last February, and the trial of the other two men was scheduled to start next Monday in the same court.
Mr. Wolthuis said he expected Judge Kiser to postpone that proceeding, too.
Mr. Stump, who is representing himself in the case, did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
The club was formed in April 1993 after the Federal raid on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex.
The club's 15 members had met three times before the arrests, and then disbanded, the police said.

HEADLINE: Mr. Clinton Bows to Farmers

 BODY:
President Clinton's pledge to Iowa farmers this week that he would defend Federal farm subsidies was pointless pandering to special interests.
Farmers are the nation's richest welfare recipients; full-time farmers typically earn four times as much as non-farm families. The Federal Government pays farmers and huge agribusinesses not to grow crops or send food abroad. Mr. Clinton says that is a nifty way to boost exports. But taxpayers who foot the bill might take exception. 
 The Federal program stifles food production, which jacks up prices and hurts both consumers and the economy. The farm program costs taxpayers about $10 billion a year and adds an equal amount to food bills, driving up the price of milk, fruit, sugar and many other necessities by about 10 percent.
The Government has no obligation to preserve agribusiness or family farms if the consequence is to take money from poor consumers in order to pump up the bank accounts of multinational companies and often-wealthy farmers. At a moment when the Republicans are on the verge of wiping out spending programs for the poor, Mr. Clinton has no business preserving subsidies that go overwhelmingly to middle- and upper-class families.
Senator Richard Lugar, from the farm state of Indiana, has courageously called for reducing farm subsidies. That offers a model for a fellow Presidential candidate sitting in the White House.

HEADLINE: Cities Also Need Limits on Lawsuits

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The fight for tort reform has moved to the Senate floor. The House of Representatives began the process of correcting the abuses that plague our system of civil justice by approving limitations on joint and several liability and placing a cap of $250,000 on pain and suffering damages (health care suits only) and a similar cap on punitive damages. 
 The reforms approved by the Senate Commerce Committee, however, are limited to product liability, and do not include the delivery of services, which is the fastest growing segment of our economy. The committee's bill needs to be strengthened significantly.
In the past seven years, municipal litigation costs have more than doubled, and the number continues to rise. Last year, New York city paid out over $260 million in damages and settlements, in contrast to the $108 million a mere eight years earlier.
Every New Yorker pays the price of these judgments. Think of the crimes that could have been stopped, the children who could have been taught or the taxes that could have been cut if this litigation lottery had not been giving away city money.
The Senate should broaden the Commerce bill to preserve the reforms in the House common sense legal standards reform bill. It should also pass another amendment, modeled on a 1984 Moore-Gephardt bill. Under the amendment, defendants that agree promptly to assume liability for economic losses would not be responsible for noneconomic damages like "pain and suffering," absent intentional misconduct. This "early offer" concept would encourage early settlements, limit windfall payments and put money into the hands of plaintiffs shortly after their injury.

HEADLINE: A U.N. Success Story

BYLINE: By Elizabeth Becker; ELizabeth Becker, senior foreign editor of National Public Radio, is author of "When the War Was Over," a history of modern Cambodia.

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia

 BODY:
For years, it was called the Broken Bridge. Blown up by Communist sappers in 1972, it left a silhouette that ended halfway across the Tonle Sap River, at the edge of this city. A few months ago, it reopened, repaired by the Japanese, who originally built it. The American Friendship Highway, which connects the city to its only seaport, is being repaired by the United States.
Nearly two years after the United Nations peacekeeping force left Cambodia, these countries and other guarantors of the 1991 Paris Peace Agreement are still committed to insuring that one of the U.N.'s most ambitious and expensive peace plans protects and rebuilds Cambodia. 
 But as Cambodia marks the 20th anniversary of the Khmer Rouge takeover, the successes of this peacekeeping mission have been overlooked. When experts discuss the U.N., the debate centers on whether Bosnia or Somalia was the biggest failure. The Cambodian peace mission is dismissed as too costly and ineffective because the Khmer Rouge still exist, the peasants are still poor and the Government is corrupt. What's forgotten is what moved the U.N. to mount the plan: two decades of war; destruction of the society by the Khmer Rouge, who caused one million deaths and massacred intellectuals, creating one of the world's lowest literacy rates; economic decay reflected in annual per capita income under $200.
 The Paris plan has worked, however imperfectly. It ended the war, brought 350,000 refugees home and set up democratic elections, in which 90 percent of the population voted. Today, the lives of the people are improving and the national mood favors work, not rebellion. A small middle class is growing. The gross national product is up 5.2 percent, to about $2.2 million. The currency is stable. The budget is balanced.
And the Khmer Rouge are being cornered. Their soldiers are defecting by the hundreds. The dwindling force of 5,000 Khmer Rouge has been pushed back to barred redoubts in northwestern Cambodia.
The National Assembly created one of Asia's most democratic constitutions. Cambodia has a thriving human rights community. Indeed, the hard-won individual rights are among the U.N.'s greatest achievements, showing Cambodians what a normal life can be, with the freedom to see friends, say what they want and do as they please.
Cambodia's return to democracy has been rocky. Freedoms are under constant attack by leaders who liked the old ways. Corruption is everywhere: Ninety percent of the country's high school seniors failed final exams when they were prevented from cheating. The Government openly colludes with Asian lumber companies, both making millions of dollars from cutting down the country's forests. But a foreign official said: "I've seen this stage in other countries' climb out of poverty. It will take another 20 years, but Cambodia is on its way."
To end the war, 15 countries spent five years negotiating an agreement with the Cambodians. More than 30 countries donated money and troops to the mission. Cambodia was a long-term project devised by countries that did not cut and run. Should these countries doubt their success, they might consider the career of Prince Norodom Sirivudh. He was recently squeezed out of the Government in a dispute. In the old days, someone like him would have joined a rival army or fled to Paris. Instead, he is opening Cambodia's first think-tank, from which to espouse his dissenting opinions. Would that Bosnia, Somalia or Haiti were at that stage of political life two years after the U.N.'s blue helmets left.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Back to the Future

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In 1933, with farmers bankrupt and desperate in the Great Depression, Congress passed the Agricultural Adjustment Act to regulate farm production. Three years later the Supreme Court held it unconstitutional: beyond the power of the Federal Government.
The A.A.A. decision and others of the time paralyzed Government efforts to bring the country out of the Depression. And they brought on a crisis for the Court itself: a crisis of public confidence. 
 In 1937 the Supreme Court abandoned its pinched view of Federal power and began sustaining new economic and social legislation. That was the end of the crisis. So we of later generations were taught in constitutional law classes. But was it really the end?
The question has to be asked after the Court's astonishing decision this week that a 1990 Federal law making it a crime to have a gun within 1,000 feet of a school was unconstitutional. A 5-to-4 majority held that the law was not within Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce: the first such decision by the Supreme Court since 1936.
The way Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote the opinion of the Court opened the possibility that all kinds of modern legislation could now be upset: laws on machine-gun sales, attacks on abortion clinics and many other subjects. That is because the opinion relied on abstract categories to decide whether something is within or outside the commerce power.
Chief Justice Rehnquist said, for example, that education was not "commercial." But the Court in 1971 upheld a law against loansharking in purely local circumstances because it might affect commerce. And it upheld a law against racial discrimination in motels that might serve interstate travelers.
Again, the majority opinion said that something could be regulated by Congress only if it had a "substantial" effect on commerce. That sounded like a throwback to the opinions of the early 1930's that tried to draw a line between "direct" and "indirect" effects on commerce: a distinction that foundered on its own confusion.
Justice Stephen Breyer, in a dissent for himself and Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, noted that schools cost the country $230 billion in 1990 and that education was crucial to American prosperity in a world economy. It was rational for Congress to decide, he said, that the menace of guns in schools did the country economic harm.
Rational is the key word. For decades now the Supreme Court has given Congress leeway to legislate under its commerce power so long as it had a rational basis for its action. The Court has declined to substitute its judgment for the legislators'.
Justice Souter, in a separate dissent, reminded the majority of what happened in the 1930's when willful judges decided that mining and manufacturing were not "commerce." He warned against "ignoring the painful lesson learned in 1937."
In the A.A.A. case in 1936 Justice Harlan F. Stone, dissenting, said the decision reflected the notion "that it is the business of courts to sit in judgment on the wisdom of legislative action." Justice Souter, echoing that theme, said it was not for the Supreme Court to say "whether Congress was correct" in passing the school gun law. "The only question is whether the legislative judgment is within the realm of reason."
When it comes to individual rights such as freedom of speech, the courts have a special duty to scrutinize what legislators do. For minorities by definition are not likely to be protected in legislatures. But the claims of states' rights have ample influence in Congress.
There is a wonderful irony in the Supreme Court stepping forward today -- or more accurately stepping backward -- to limit the legislative power of the Federal Government. States' rights used to be a rallying cry for conservatives, but today they are demanding Federal action in all kinds of areas traditionally left to the states.
Federalization of tort law is an example. Conservatives are even demanding a Federal medical malpractice law. The Wall Street Journal editorial page, voice of the right, is all for Federal tort reform -- but it cheered the Supreme Court decision on the school gun law. It depends whose ox is gored.

Progress Seen In Auto Talks With Japan

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 27

 BODY:
Negotiators from the United States and Japan reported some progress in trade talks on automobiles and auto parts today, raising the possibility that an agreement could be reached next month and avert American sanctions on Japan.
Officials from both sides said, however, that wide differences still remained between the countries following talks here among technical experts on Wednesday and today. 
 "I don't think we're near an agreement," one American official said today. "But we both have a better understanding of what the U.S. side is looking for and what is possible on the Japanese side."
But a Japanese official was a little more positive. "The gap is narrowing," he said, adding that the talks this week were far more "constructive" than ones last week in Washington, when no progress was made. On some issues, he said, "I think the positions of the two countries are not very far apart."
The Clinton Administration, frustrated that nearly two years of negotiations have proved fruitless, has threatened to impose sanctions on Japan if there is no accord soon. A list of Japanese products on which 100 percent tariffs might be levied may be published as early as next month.
If Washington does take that step, Japan has threatened to break off the negotiations and file a complaint with the World Trade Organization.
Some United States officials had been hoping for an agreement by late next week, when the top trade officials of the United States, Japan, Canada and the European Union will be meeting near Vancouver, British Columbia. At that time, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, is expected to meet Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Minister of International Trade and Industry of Japan.
Officials from both sides said today that it might be difficult to reach an accord in Vancouver. But one American official said that the chance of at least a conceptual agreement "is a lot higher than some of the skeptics would give it."
The automotive sector, which accounts for a large chunk of America's trade deficit with Japan, is the only priority area under the 1993 trade "framework" between the two nations for which an agreement has not been reached.
Washington has three goals in the talks: increasing the number of Japanese car dealers that carry American vehicles; relaxing regulations on automobile inspections and repairs in Japan so that more American spare parts can be used, and increasing purchases of American parts by Japanese automobile manufacturers.
The Japanese official, who like the American officials spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, "We understand that somehow an agreement can be reached" on the first two issues.
Japan is likely to agree, for instance, to remove restrictions on certain replacement auto parts.
But the issue of parts purchases remains a big obstacle. Washington has said it cannot envision an agreement that does not include voluntary plans by Japan's auto manufacturers to increase their purchases of American parts. But Japan has said such purchase plans are a matter for the private sector and has refused to talk about them in the discussions between the two governments.
American officials have directly approached Japan's automobile manufacturers, but those companies have said they will not increase the size of the purchase plans they announced last year.
"I don't think it's reasonable that we private Japanese companies are compelled by the United States Government to draft a voluntary program," said Hiroshi Okuda, executive vice president of the Toyota Motor Corporation. "I think there's something wrong there."
Japanese Government officials and auto executives argue that the Japanese industry is no position to increase purchases of foreign parts. Production of cars in Japan has fallen for four consecutive years. And Japanese auto companies, some of which are suffering heavy losses, have been trying desperately to cut costs, partly by reducing their expenditures on parts and materials by up to 30 percent in the next two to three years.
But Japanese companies also insisted last year they would not issue such plans only to suddenly announce them. One factor that could make them change their minds this time is that the sharp rise of the Japanese yen against the dollar makes it more attractive to buy American parts, which are becoming cheaper in Japan, and to shift more auto production to the United States.

HEADLINE: Justice Department Views Microsoft From Both Sides

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
On Monday, Justice Department officials were in Federal court defending Microsoft against allegations of monopolistic practices. Today, Justice Department officials went to another Federal court to file suit against Microsoft, contending it would violate antitrust laws with a planned merger.
That peculiar combination gave the Justice Department the appearance of having reversed itself with dizzying speed. But antitrust law is less a matter of broad philosophy than of individual cases, and the Justice Department argued today that there was no inconsistency in pursuing such apparently different outcomes in different cases. 
 Antitrust lawyers and economists -- even Microsoft's top lawyer -- generally agreed. But some lawyers watching the case also noted that legal and political factors might have added to the department's motivation for today's action.
At a purely legal level, today's lawsuit was brought under a different antitrust law from the battle fought during the last year. "I don't see that there's any inconsistency," said James F. Rill, a former Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust in the Bush Administration. "You've got two different statutes, a merger law and a monopolistic" practices law, he said.
At the level of economic theory, the two battles are also different.
One old dispute is whether the aggressive marketing practices that led to Microsoft's dominance in the field of operating systems -- programs like DOS and Windows that control how computers organize and process information -- was anti-competitive. By contrast, the struggle that began today concerns whether Microsoft would exert monopoly power if it were allowed to merge its software empire with that of Intuit Inc., the leading producer of personal finance software. (Intuit produces Quicken, the highly popular program for managing accounts and budgets, and two income tax preparation programs.)
In other words, a company seeking to maintain a large market share through possibly anti-competitive business practices poses one set of economic issues. A company with a large market share that tries to merge with another major company in a similar market poses a different set of issues.
In the first legal battle, the Justice Department sought last year to prevent Microsoft from using what were seen as anti-competitive marketing tactics to maintain its overwhelming share of the market for operating systems software. The Justice Department put little emphasis on the sheer size of Microsoft's 70 percent to 80 percent market share.
When Microsoft agreed last summer to abandon the contested marketing practices, the Justice Department accepted the arrangement. It even joined Microsoft's side before the United States Court of Appeals on Monday to defend the deal.
The Justice Department came under heavy criticism last summer for settling the case. That led some lawyers to suggest today that the department was being tough on Microsoft in the Intuit case to placate its critics and to show the Court of Appeals that it was keeping a close eye on Microsoft.
Steven C. Sunshine, the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for mergers who handled the Intuit and Microsoft merger case today, said there were no such motives. He argued that the the timing of the two cases was coincidental. "The facts are completely separate," he said.
He said that since he joined the Justice Department in the summer of 1993, it has expressed concern about 35 mergers, either by filing lawsuits or by warning the companies of anti-competition problems. In 25 to 30 of these mergers, the companies reached a settlement with the Justice Department and the merger was concluded, he said.
The Justice Department has reached settlements in other mergers by requiring that legal barriers be erected between business units to prevent employees in different divisions from working together in anti-competitive ways. But Mr. Sunshine ruled out such a settlement in the Microsoft case.
"The problems here are fundamental and the remedy is to stop the merger, and that's what we asked the court to do," Mr. Sunshine said.
And William H. Neukom, the senior vice president for law and corporate affairs at Microsoft, was skeptical that his company would accept any such arrangement. "We don't like fire walls very much between technical communities," he said, "and we don't think there's any basis for that in this case."

Treasury Prices Are Lower Ahead of Report on Growth

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were lower yesterday, weighed down by concern that the economy has not slowed enough to ward off fears of inflation.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 5/32 , to 10318/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7.33 percent, from 7.32 percent on Wednesday. 
 Some of yesterday's softness in prices was attributed to profit taking ahead of today's preliminary report on the gross domestic product for the first quarter.
The data are expected to show a 3.1 percent growth rate, which is not as strong as the 5.1 percent in the fourth quarter of last year but strong enough to keep inflation fears in the forefront of market worries. Indeed, traders were so focused on today's report that yesterday they shrugged off data showing more Americans than expected filed claims for jobless benefits the previous week.
Traders say that if today's number is stronger than expected, it will revive expectations of an increase in interest rates. But data showing faster growth could also support the dollar. A stronger dollar would in the long run bolster bond prices.
The dollar weighed on the market throughout the day. While it edged up against the German mark yesterday, it slipped against the Japanese yen. Ray Worseck, chief economist and manager at A. G. Edwards & Sons, said the dollar's recent plight would turn around some day "and the market will use it as an excuse to buy."
The Chicago Purchasing Managers' index for April, which is also scheduled to be released today, is expected to slip to 50.3 from 55. The University of Michigan confidence index is also due and is seen as slipping to 93.2 from 93.8.
Yesterday the market continued to grapple with supply as the Treasury held its fourth auction of the week, including the regular weekly bill auction on Monday, with the sale of $17.75 billion in new 52-week bills. It brought the week's total of Treasury securities auctioned to $70.2 billion.
The average rate at auction yesterday was 5.90 percent in what was described by some analysts as an average auction. It was 12 basis points lower than the last auction and the lowest average since Oct. 13, 1994, when it was 5.72 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Otherwise the market resorted to it general pattern of the last three days, showing weakness early and then some improvement later in the day, said James W. Schroeder, a Treasury-bond analyst with MMS International in Chicago.
Although the long maturities did not break out in either direction yesterday, Mr. Schroeder said, "I think the potential is there for tomorrow because we have been so tightly confined."
Elsewhere, the Standard & Poor's Corporation said yesterday that it had affirmed the long-term BBB rating and A-2 commercial paper on the debt of the Nissan Motor Company and its subsidiaries. But S.& P. changed its outlook on the company to "negative," suggesting a possible rating cut in the future. The rating agency cited the potential negative effects of the appreciation of the Japanese yen.
While Nissan's current long-term debt rating is BBB, the fourth-highest grade S.&. P. awards, and its lowest investment-quality rating. A rating of BB or lower would be considered speculative, or junk. Total rated debt is about $3.6 billion.
Nissan relies heavily on Japanese exports, which are made more expensive by a strong yen. A downgraded debt rating would make it more expensive for Nissan to borrow money.

Dow Chemical and Grace Post Profits Above Expectations

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: MIDLAND, Mich., April 27

 BODY:
Two large chemical companies, the Dow Chemical Company and W. R. Grace & Company, reported better-than-expected earnings today, reflecting a chemical industry boom in which other companies have shared.
Higher prices and increased shipments, especially from surging overseas economies, have helped companies restore profit margins that were anemic last year. 
 "The chemical industry is benefiting from global supply and demand," said Paul Raman, a chemicals analyst at S. G. Warburg & Company. "It will continue very strongly through 1995 into 1996."
Profit margin improvement was particularly noticeable at Dow Chemical. It's after-tax profit margin, excluding nonrecurring items, rose to 10.6 percent in the first quarter, from 3.9 percent a year ago.
The company, based here, said it had net income of $584 million, or $2.10 a share, after a charge of $49 million, or 13 cents a share, for an acquisition made by its 71 percent-owned Marion Merrell Dow subsidiary. In the quarter a year ago, a charge of $8 million, or 3 cents, related to losses from short-term investments made by Marion Merrell Dow resulted in net income of $173 million, or 62 cents.
On an operating basis, profit was equal to $2.23 a share, well above analysts' expectations of $1.78 a share, and the 1994 quarter's 65 cents. Revenue rose 33.3 percent, to $5.96 billion from $4.54 billion.
Shares rose 50 cents, to $70.375, on trading of 1.00 million shares, exceeding its three-month daily average of 967,900.
W. R. Grace, based in Boca Raton, Fla., said first-quarter net earnings rose 24.3 percent, to $47.5 million, or 50 cents a share, from $38.2 million, or 41 cents, a year earlier.
On an operating basis, the earnings were up 57 percent, excluding a $12.5 million charge, equal to 14 cents a share, related to its management turmoil. The specialty chemicals and health care company took the charge to settle the contract of its former chief executive, J. P. Bolduc, who was forced out in March, for legal, pension and other corporate expenses.
Without the charge, profit from operations was $60.0 million, or 64 cents a share, well ahead of analysts' expectations of 46 cents a share.
Revenue rose 25 percent, to $1.35 billion from $1.08 billion.
Shares in Grace rose 75 cents to close at $53.625 today on trading of 729,100 shares, surpassing its three-month daily average of 643,100.
"All of the company's six core businesses and every geographic region contributed to the excellent results in the quarter," said Thomas Holmes, acting chief executive.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims in Unexpected Climb

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment benefits climbed unexpectedly last week to the highest level since the start of the year, the Government said today.
New claims for unemployment pay rose by 8,000 in the week that ended last Saturday, to 349,000, from a revised 341,000 the week before. The total was the highest since 356,000 in the week that ended on Jan. 7, the Labor Department said. 
 The weekly total exceeded Wall Street economists' forecasts of 342,000 initial claims.
The closely watched four-week moving average of new jobless claims, which smooths out weekly fluctuations and is considered a more accurate barometer of the job market, climbed to the highest level since last July.
The average was up by 2,750, to 344,000 applications, from a revised 341,250 the prior week and the highest since 347,750 in the week ended July 30 last year.
The department said a total of 2,472,000 people were receiving state benefits in the week ended April 15, up from a revised 2,466,000 the week before.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Weakens Against Yen But Gains Ground vs. the Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar changed course against the yen yesterday, weakening on speculation that automotive trade talks between the United States and Japan would collapse and on fears of further slowing in the American economy.
But the dollar strengthened against the German mark, which currency dealers called the indirect result of a rebounding Italian lira. Many dealers were selling marks and buying lire on optimism that the Italian Government could work out a pension plan that would lessen its borrowing needs. 
 Dealers described the trading volume as light, which exaggerated moves in the market and left the dollar mostly higher against other currencies. They attributed the sluggish trading to a typical end-of-month decline and the coming May Day holiday in Europe, with many traders taking off early.
"The market doesn't know which direction it wants to turn in," said Elena Shperling, chief dealer at the New York branch of the Banco di Sicilia.
After its biggest one-day gain against the yen in 20 months on Wednesday, the dollar retreated yesterday in late New York trading to 83.68 yen from 83.80 yen. The dollar edged up to 1.3785 marks, from 1.3700 marks on Wednesday. The British pound rose to $1.6173 from $1.6152.
Part of the dollar's decline against the yen came from traders who sold to lock in profits from the rally Wednesday, when the market reacted to a pledge by the Group of Seven industrial nations to work toward a stronger dollar.
But uncertainty over the trade talks between the United States and Japan also emerged as a reason for some of the selling.
"There were some rumors going through the market that the auto talks broke down," said Charles Spence, director of treasury sales at the New York branch of the Standard Chartered Bank of Britain.
Negotiators from the United States and Japan said yesterday that there had been some progress in the talks but that wide differences remained.
If the talks fail, the United States is expected to tolerate a lower dollar, since that would make Japanese cars more expensive in the United States and hurt Japan's exporting strength.
Others attributed the dollar's weakness against the yen to expectations that today's report on the United State gross domestic product for the first quarter would show more evidence of a slowdown. A slowing economy diminishes the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates, which tend to bolster the dollar.

HEADLINE: TV WEEKEND;
Saigon in the Final Hours Before the Surrender

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
"The Fall of Saigon" is a vivid, exciting, painful account of the final hours before the unconditional surrender of South Vietnam, 20 years ago this weekend. Meshing newsreel clips with first-person accounts, the two-hour documentary brings back the desperate efforts to save the Vietnamese who had worked with the United States and still trusted their allies not to desert them. The overriding feeling is one of shame over the many who were left behind to the mercies of the triumphant Communists. A former Central Intelligence Agency man says, "I couldn't look into their eyes."
Most of these two hours is focused on the American Embassy, into which South Vietnamese flocked in hopes of refuge and escape as North Vietnamese troops converged on their city. What one official calls "a daisy chain of helicopters" carried thousands from the embassy rooftop to waiting aircraft carriers. As depicted tonight, it was a heroic achievement. But errors were made and time ran out; hundreds had to be left behind. Many more Vietnamese remained in the city, waiting for promised pick-ups that never came. 
 Scenes of panic on the streets -- looting, South Vietnamese soldiers shedding their uniforms and throwing away their weapons, people running every which way to escape the inevitable -- are effectively juxtaposed with the high-pressure orderliness of the exodus by helicopter.
No comment is made here on the larger issue of responsibility for the war itself, lately reawakened by Robert S. McNamara's apologia. Gerald R. Ford, the President at the time, and Henry A. Kissinger, who was both Secretary of State and National Security Adviser, express their regrets. "For me a great emptiness, a great sadness," says Mr. Kissinger. But far more affecting are the words of one of the last few exhausted marines to be carried off in the last helicopter: "Most of us were crying."
 
'Martin's Lament'
'Religion and Race
in America'
PBS, tonight at 10
(Channel 13 in New York)
Can America's black and white Christians worship together, as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. envisioned? That is the significant question addressed with more earnestness than inspiration by "Martin's Lament: Religion and Race in America." In visits to two churches in Indianapolis, one mostly black, one mostly white, pastors and congregants talk about the difficulty of meeting the needs of people with different traditions.
The burden, all agree, is on whites not just to allow blacks to sit alongside them of a Sunday morning, but also to change church practices to make minorities truly welcome. Members of a small interracial Roman Catholic congregation tell of the satisfactions of mixing cultural traditions. Full Sunday morning integration, a few of those interviewed say, means moving away from the images of Jesus as a white male (a professor at the Howard University School of Divinity announces that Jesus was definitely black) and joining in efforts toward economic and political equality.
Now and then the program comes to life, but the slow motion, the relentless church music and the repetition of fairly simple ideas can act as a soporific. Just like some Sunday services.
 
'Newt Gingrich and the Republican Revolution'
A&E, tonight at 9
 Politics, not policy, is the subject of this brisk two-hour review of the first 100 days of the Republican-controlled Congress. It is a mostly familiar but tidily packaged account of how Newt Gingrich got to be the first Republican Speaker of the House in 40 years and about what he has been up to since. The energetic and combative Mr. Gingrich is described as combining a distaste for the spirit of the 1960's with a hankering after some Newt-age future.
The program does a little score-keeping, but offers no evaluation of the famous Contract With America as bills reach the Senate and White House. Among the many Capitol players on camera in brief snatches are Mr. Gingrich himself and such allies as Representative Henry J. Hyde, now head of the House Judiciary Committee, and adversaries like Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Minority leader. You can also hear from Mr. Gingrich's biographer, Jeff Kamen, who seems to be under the impression that his subject is a mixture of the better parts of St. Paul and Paul Bunyan.

HEADLINE: Where the 45's Keep Spinning

BYLINE: By NEIL STRAUSS 

 BODY:
THE singles' bar is dying in Manhattan. Some say this is because of economics; others say it's because of changing times. But there is no denying that it's getting harder and harder to find a good single in New York City. It's all CD's nowadays.
We are talking about jukeboxes, of course, those hulking machines that stand ostentatiously against the wall in most bars night after night, sucking up quarters and dollar bills and giving back a mood. It can be a rock-and-roll, hip-hop, oldies, jazz, disco, Latin or opera mood. Jukeboxes offer interactive entertainment in its rawest form, giving patrons the power of ambiance control, something few other public places allow for. 
 But exactly 10 years ago, the jukebox experienced the most profound innovation in its 106-year history: the birth of the CD jukebox. Originally, jukeboxes played wax cylinders. Then they switched to 78-rpm singles, to 33-rpm singles and, eventually, to 45's. Despite all these changes, jukeboxes were always oriented toward the purity of a single song, usually a popular hit or a novelty. That is, until the compact disk came along and the age of album jukebox began.
In addition to reviving an ailing jukebox industry, the CD changed the faces of bars everywhere. On the plus side, customers are now able to choose from more than 1,000 songs on the average 100-CD jukebox, instead of from the 200 songs on the average 100-single vinyl jukebox. But on the other hand, each song on a CD jukebox costs 50 cents instead of a quarter, and jukebox junkies can subject the patrons of a bar to a 75-minute marathon of music by a single artist by playing one CD from beginning to end. Also, 45's are made for songs that are no more than three and a half minutes (longer singles cost extra to make). With CD's, a popular song like Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven" can last eight minutes, which can be grueling for a bar patron who's not a classic-rock fan or who's just plain sick of the song.
Nonetheless, Manhattan bars have been trading in their vinyl jukeboxes for CD ones at an alarming rate. The remaining vinyl machines are starting to look like museum pieces. At P. J. Clarke's on the Upper East Side, for example, a CD jukebox sits against the southern wall of the bar, filled with everything from cartoon music to opera to Broadway show tunes; immortalized above it is a picture of the bar's former 1950's Seeburg vinyl jukebox, lovingly photographed and framed like a dear, departed ancestor.
Finding a New York bar that has kept its vinyl jukebox can be hard. Even the seediest of dives, where cockroaches roam the walls and glasses are decorated with traces of lipstick from customers past, have gone digital. But a few bar owners have stuck with vinyl, and almost all of them are proud of their decision, carefully stocking their machines with an interesting array of singles.
"To me, selecting music for a jukebox is like scoring a film," said Philip Hartman, a screenwriter who is an owner of the Two Boots pizza chain, which has an early-1970's Rowe/AMi jukebox in its East Village restaurant. "When you choose the music, you have to be sensitive to your audience and give them songs that are appropriate to their mood and background."
The singles on the Two Boots jukebox, culled in part from Mr. Hartman's collection of nearly 5,000 singles, range from African music by Fela to bubble-gum pop by the Ohio Express to music by New York bands like Helmet, White Zombie and Sammy, all of which have at least one member who used to work at Two Boots or at Mr. Hartman's other East Village restaurant, the Levee, which recently burned down.
Mr. Hartman takes such good care of his jukebox that he even writes out the label for each song himself. "Everything has to be in my handwriting," he said. "And it has to be done with a certain brand of pen and in certain colors. The jukebox is as much a part of the place as the menu is."
 
San Francisco Native
 The world's first jukebox, experts say, ate its initial nickel on Nov. 23, 1889, at the Palais Royale Saloon in San Francisco. It contained only one song on a wax cylinder, and customers had to listen to it through a tube held to the ear. In 1906, freedom of choice prevailed and John Gabel's hand-cranked Automatic Entertainer replaced listening tubes with a giant amplifying horn, supplanted cylinders with flat records and offered several selections. Thus, the modern jukebox was born, replacing player pianos everywhere, from social clubs to brothels. In the late 1930's, the word jukebox was coined, most likely derived from the Southern black slang word "jook," to dance.
According to the Amusement and Music Operators Association, there are currently 250,000 jukeboxes in the country. Of those, 40 percent play CD's and 60 percent play vinyl. In New York City, which is always trying to be one step ahead of the rest of the country, the number of CD jukeboxes has far surpassed that of vinyl jukeboxes. Elsewhere in the country, CD jukeboxes are taking over more slowly.
"In the next few years, you're going to see the percentage of vinyl jukeboxes keep dropping," said Fred Newton, a spokesman for the Amusement and Music Operators Association. "It usually takes a generation for a new technology to sink in. That's what happened when jukeboxes switched from playing 78's to 33-rpm records. So we're about midstream in the whole changeover from 45's to CD's."
At places like Showman's Cafe, a Harlem bar with an old-timey feel, it's easy to understand the circumstances leading to the disappearance of jukeboxes that play older formats. Standing in the back of the bar is a 1970's Seeburg Super Disco jukebox, all flashy colors and lights, which stands out from the bar's more basic 40's-style jazz decor. The Super Disco machine is stocked with singles that range from rare jazz songs by Art Blakey, Horace Silver and Jazz at the Philharmonic to contemporary soul by Whitney Houston and Luther Vandross. But the jukebox is on its last legs and most of the singles it plays wobble and warble.
"They've been asking us to get a CD jukebox because this one has been dying slowly," said Mona Lopez, the bar's manager, referring to the jukebox owner who rents the machine to them. "We'll probably get the CD jukebox because it's getting too hard to find the vinyl 45's that we want, especially since we cater to an older crowd."
 
The Atmosphere Factor
 Another argument in favor of the CD jukebox, some people say, is that compact disks offer better sound quality than vinyl. Michael Roscishewsky, the manager of the Blue and Gold Tavern in the East Village, thinks so. But that doesn't mean he's going to trade in his analog jukebox for a digital one. "We've always had a vinyl jukebox here, ever since my grandfather owned the place," he said. "CD sound quality may be better, but people can go home and listen to their CD's. Vinyl has its own feeling that suits our atmosphere."
William Bunch, whose quest to find America's best jukebox is documented in his recent book, "Jukebox America" (St. Martin's Press), said he felt the sound of vinyl jukeboxes was warmer and more intimate. "There's a whole sensation to vinyl jukeboxes that you don't get with CD ones," he said. "A good jukebox has been played so much you get to hear the scratch and fuzz of the needle dropping on the record. You will find some obscurities on CD jukeboxes, but by and large I think the great jukebox songs are one-shots or oddities or neat, alternative songs that you tend to find only on vinyl."
Jeremy Tepper, who publishes the magazine Street Beat, a glossy guide to coin-operated amusement in bars, said that vinyl also had a hipness factor. With the television series "Happy Days" in mind, he said: "When a record starts skipping, you can just kick the jukebox to fix it. But that doesn't work with CD's. And with vinyl, I always liked the idea that it was cooler to choose the B-side of a single than the A-side."
Mr. Tepper is probably New York's foremost jukebox expert. In addition to founding Street Beat, he runs his own record label, Diesel Only, which puts out mostly vinyl 45's by new bands and distributes them to jukeboxes nationwide. Street Beat's list of the most-requested singles on America's jukeboxes reads like a guide to a specific genre of music that could be lost if vinyl disappears from bars. These jukebox tunes illuminate a male world of drinking, bad pick-up lines and general chest-thumping, and include Clarence Carter's "Strokin'," Confederate Railroad's "Trashy Women," Showdown's "Rodeo Song" and, the song that results when men follow the advice in these songs too literally, George Thorogood's "I Drink Alone."
"I think there's a subset of hits that are pretty much resigned to jukebox play," Mr. Tepper said. "Unlike the current low-fi, indie-rock singles that are coming out, these records are not for collectors. They're designed to be heard in jukeboxes and bars. Some of them are too risque for radio, anyway."
Mr. Bunch credits the vinyl jukebox with helping to kick-start rock-and-roll. "Jukeboxes were a watermark in the creation of the music we love today," he said. "If you go back to the 30's, the record industry was dominated by a few New York companies that were putting out Mantovani kind of things. But if you went out to a town in Illinois or Mississippi, the local people were cutting records for $20 and getting it on the local jukebox. So people out in the heartland were listening to their own music, instead of letting record labels dictate it to them. And that helped Robert Johnson, Louis Jordan and everything that became rock-and-roll."
 
Hot Off the Press
 This process is still occurring. In general, young bands will press their own vinyl single before making a costlier CD. Nightingale, a bar in the East Village, supports local bands with its worn-out Rowe/AMi jukebox, which stocks almost exclusively singles by New York rockers past and present, like the Wives, Jono Manson and the Mighty Sweetones and Simon and the Bar Sinisters. The jukebox even includes eight or so singles released on Mr. Tepper's Diesel Only label, including one by the band he plays in, the World Famous Bluejays.
One problem with many singles that bands release themselves or on small labels, Tom Hosier, the manager of Nightingale, said, is that the records have small holes in the center, so that they can fit directly onto a record player but not a jukebox. But this isn't a problem for those who know where to go: two record stores, Bleecker Bob's in Greenwich Village and Downstairs Records in midtown Manhattan, will for a nominal fee widen the holes in these 45's so that they can fit on a jukebox.
Two of Manhattan's best vinyl jukeboxes are at two East Village restaurant-bars -- Great Jones Cafe and Baby Jake's -- the former because of the selection and the latter because of the jukebox itself. Great Jones's Rowe/AMi, built in the early 1980's shortly before the introduction of the CD jukebox, functions the same way a good radio station should. It plays songs most people have never heard but should. Its wide selection of roots music includes Slim Gaillard's "Yip Roc Heresy," Bill Doggett's "Gumbo," Lowell Fulson's "Make a Little Love" and Edgar Blanchard's "Lonesome Guitar."
"That jukebox is there for every 10th customer," Bill Judkins, who manages Great Jones, said. "Nine people walk in there and say, 'I don't know any of these records.' Then the 10th person walks in and can't believe that this obscure song he knows can be found on a jukebox anywhere. I'm always happy when someone walks in there with a note pad and writes down a couple of titles that he wants to go find."
At Baby Jake's, the jukebox is a testament to the pre-rock era. Dividing different sections of songs on the 1950's Seeburg Select-O-Matic 100 are title cards for "Hawaiian Music," "Blues and Novelties," "Hillbilly" and "Hymns and Spirituals." Unfortunately, the songs on the jukebox, a mix of classic oldies and new hits, aren't faithful to the title cards; but they can still be heard for 1950's prices: three songs for a quarter.
Anyone wishing to take a tour of Manhattan's jukeboxes would do well to stop at the Grassroots Tavern in the East Village. There, one can see what happens when an industry can't make up its mind. The bar's Rowe/AMi jukebox can play more than 80 singles, in addition to six CD's. It's what is known as a combo jukebox, and there aren't many left now that jukebox manufacturers have decided on the CD as their format of choice.
"I love this jukebox," said John Schrader, a 21-year-old student, as he selected one song from the soundtrack to "Pulp Fiction" and a Bob Dylan single. "I love the sound of vinyl, but I like being able to choose whatever I want off a CD. So you get the best of both worlds."

BYLINE: By Donald G. McNeil Jr. 

 BODY:

Hard-Nosed Mysticism
The premise of the show now in previews at the American Jewish Theater is catchier than that of most new musicals. The show is set in the Ottoman Empire in 1665 and follows a little-known chapter in Jewish history: Shabbatai Sevi -- a mystic fixated on a Talmudic saying that the Messiah will arrive when all men are holy or all are sinners, and sure that holiness was impossible -- attracted hundreds of thousands of converts to his doctrine of universal sin. He married a Christian prostitute at his delayed bar mitzvah and tried to find a way through evil to perform "the great tikkun," or rectification, that would repair a shattered God. 
 "Shabbatai," by Michael Schubert and Michael Edwin, has no more information about the movement than would fit in one encyclopedia paragraph, and it keeps slipping its 17th-century mooring by using rapping rabbis and Neil Diamond jokes. But it does fit right into the American Jewish Theater's tradition of spoiling for a fight.
While other theaters have lobby photos of past productions, Stanley Brechner, the artistic director, has posted an Anti-Semitism Hall of Fame. Another clipping right near the box office is about his 1993 battle with the Roundabout Theater over his cramped basement space. Last year, the theater's window was smashed by black youngsters who were upset over racial taunts in "The Day the Bronx Died."
In the fall, Mr. Brechner was eager to describe how his own subscribers flung their tickets in his face after "Have You Spoken to Any Jews Lately?," which set a "Twilight Zone"-version of the Holocaust in an American resort town. Others were upset by "Hey, Buddy," because the young Jew's response to anti-Semitism is murder.
Now "Shabbatai" walks the line. In one scene, a Torah is torn in half; in another, one is walked on. The song "Not Another False Messiah" manages to equate David Koresh, Jimmy Swaggart, Jim Jones and Sun Myung Moon with Rabbi Menachem Schneerson, the late Lubavitcher spiritual leader, and to toss off a similar crack about the Pope. Can protests be far behind?
"Yes, I do want to pick a fight," Mr. Brechner said this week. "You reach a point where you've done the revivals and the cute plays, and you've catered to your audience and to the critics. But if you're going to do Jewish theater, there has to be a reason for it. It should have an edge."
 
When Life Was Simpler
 It never fails. Let a production claim a record -- as "Love! Valour! Compassion!" claimed this week to have paid back its investors in an unprecedented six weeks -- and phone calls come in saying, "But you forgot. . . ."
One of those calls mentioned Bernard Slade's "Tribute," starring Jack Lemmon as a joker forced to look back at his life when he discovers he has leukemia. In 1978, it made Broadway history when the producer, Morton Gottlieb, paid his investors back at the opening night party.
Admittedly, the parallels aren't exact. With Mr. Lemmon's star power, "Tribute" did huge grosses during its tryouts in Boston and Toronto; that's where the money came from. Many producers who choose to do pre-Broadway tours, like Fran and Barry Weissler, are able to earn enough to arrive in Times Square essentially paid for.
In an interview this week, Mr. Gottlieb said many of his hits, which included "Sleuth" and "Same Time Next Year," paid back quickly.
"But life was simpler then," he said. "I'd take a theater that hadn't been used for a long time and make deals with the owners and the unions. Costs weren't as high. And you could get people to give you things for just a mention in the program. Tavern on the Green did our opening-night party for 'Tribute' for free."
Mr. Gottlieb is still known for making a cult of thrift. He carries food home from theater party buffets; the highest compliment he once paid his general manager on "Coco" was that "he made Hepburn fly economy."
At 73, he travels by bicycle instead of splurging on subways or taxis. In 1968, he did "Lovers," with Art Carney, and there was a bike in the show and an extra in case it broke. "I'm still riding that understudy," he said.
 
Musical Chairs
 Besides dollars, twofers and TDF vouchers, the theater has another currency, one redeemable for charitable deductions: previously owned seats.
The Atlantic, Classic Stage and the Vineyard Theaters all have matching gray chairs this year, courtesy of the Nederlander chain, which donated them after the Minskoff Theater was refurbished with cushiony red ones for "Sunset Boulevard" in the fall. The small theaters ended up with far more comfortable houses than they could have afforded.
And up in Connecticut, the Sharon Playhouse, which is reopening this summer as the Sharon Stage with Estelle Parsons and Carol Kane in "Twice Removed," a comedy about a Presidential race, will have 388 blue seats donated by the Jujamcyn chain from its refurbishing of the Virginia Theater. The rest of the Virginia's chairs went back to the chair company for freshening up.
 
Footlights
 *"Buddy: The Buddy Holly Story," which had no success on Broadway but has played for six years in the West End, showed that the English have a taste for musical biographies of popular American singers. Now its producers are trying a variant. This week, they announced "Jolson," which is to open in London in the fall with a multimillion-dollar budget and a cast of 40, and is to star Brian Conley, who has his own television comedy show.
*Having outlasted, by its own reckoning, eight Presidents, three "My Fair Lady" revivals and an actors' strike, "The Fantasticks" will turn 35 on Wednesday. That will be its 14,488th performance at the Sullivan Street Playhouse in Greenwich Village, so that the longest-running musical of all time has gone on longer than "A Chorus Line," "Les Miserables" and "42d Street" -- combined.
*Anyone who arrives by the normal 8 P.M. curtain time for "Smokey Joe's Cafe" tonight will see a pregame show put on by the understudies that everyone (except the understudies) hopes will last only half an hour. The Broadway cast will be at Shea Stadium singing "The Star-Spangled Banner" for the Mets' first home game. Then it will get a police escort back to Manhattan trying for an 8:30 curtain.

HEADLINE: OPERA REVIEW;
Nicolai's 'Wives' as a Welcome Cutting-to-Size

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
One of the pleasures of Shakespeare's "Merry Wives of Windsor" is Falstaff's deflation: this gargantuan figure of great appetites and greater pretense is finally reduced to human size. One of the pleasures provided by Otto Nicolai's 1845 version of "Merry Wives" is seeing the same thing happen to the opera form: desire, adultery, jealousy and retribution -- all the ponderous, grand themes of operatic plots -- are turned into comic divertissements, deflated into songful farce.
And one of the great pleasures of the student production of the Nicolai classic at the Manhattan School of Music is that the spirit of that deflation so often comes through. Not all of the singing is first-rate; there are times when Rosalind Elias's production strains too much for farce, and the dancing fairies that bring Falstaff to his senses are too often unintentionally campy. But even the Shakespeare play has its flaws, and on Wednesday night, a viewer was more than willing to look beyond such details for the deftly performed score (conducted by Glen Cortese) and the appealing charms of the best members of the cast. 
 A highlight was the Falstaff, who is not a student but a faculty member and veteran singer, Spiro Malas, who enjoyed much success a few years ago as Tony in the Broadway revival of "The Most Happy Fella." His drinking song, "Als Bublein klein," was intoxicating, a well-phrased, broad-gestured celebration. And when joining in the dueling duet with Mr. Ford (sung by the young baritone Maxim Zhdanovsky), Mr. Malas somehow managed to seem both self-important and deferential to his student colleague.
The other main vocal pleasure was in Madeline Bender's rendition of Mrs. Ford (she will sing again tonight, and is to be replaced in the final performance, on Sunday afternoon, by Meredith Kitchin). Ms. Bender is a graduate student of Joan Caplan and her singing was lovely, lithe and accurate and charmingly Rossinian. Heather Sarris was accomplished and forthright as her compatriot, Mrs. Page. Soo Hee An produced some fine upper-register phrases as Anne, and the rest of the cast -- Philip Torre as Mr. Page, David Blackburn as Slender, Shon Sims as Dr. Caius and Todd Horman as Fenton -- clearly enjoyed themselves as they provided pleasures to the audience.
One of Ms. Elias's innovations in this otherwise traditional staging was to add English dialogue, adapting the Shakespeare characters Quickly, Bardolph and Pistol to amplify the frivolity. The idea worked fine and would have been still more effective had the opera itself been sung in English rather than in German as "Die Lustigen Weiber von Windsor." Nicolai's music would hardly have minded. This is a cosmopolitan score, full of Italianate turns and lighthearted satire. Genre pieces -- the drinking song, the hunting song, the love duet, the Rossinian finale -- are turned into comic backdrops. Even Falstaff can seem to float. This work tapped a strain of innocent pleasure in the often solemn heritage of German Romanticism, and innocent pleasure is just what this performance provided.

HEADLINE: East Harlem Supermarket Is Approved

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

 BODY:
After what he described as a sleepless night, City Councilman Guillermo Linares switched sides yesterday and cast the decisive vote as the Manhattan Borough Board approved a plan for a 53,000-square-foot Pathmark supermarket in East Harlem.
The $12 million project, which has been in the planning stages for more than four years, became the source of political, ethnic and corporate struggles in recent weeks. Opponents insisted that the huge store would drive small neighborhood shops out of business, and they criticized the government subsidies called for in the plan. But proponents said the new store would benefit customers and create jobs in the economically depressed area. 
 By Wednesday evening, opponents thought they had enough votes to block the plan, which required board approval for the sale of the city-owned lot on which the market is to be built. At 1 A.M. on Thursday, Mr. Linares telephoned one of his supporters, Alfredo Rodriguez, the owner of Associated Food Stores in East Harlem. As the two discussed the hotly contested project, Mr. Rodriguez said Mr. Linares assured him: "Alfred, I'm with you. I'm going to vote no."
But the dawn brought a change of heart for Mr. Linares, who said he switched sides only a couple of hours before the vote out of concern that the project's defeat might intensify racial polarization in the community. Many of the development's opponents are Hispanic; many supporters are black.
"The killing of this project had the potential of causing major confrontation between the African-American community and the Latino community," Mr. Linares said. Noting that he remained concerned about the impact the development will have on grocery stores in the area, Mr. Linares said, "It's time to recognize the value of change."
The sale of the land must now clear a review by the city's Economic Development Corporation and then must have final approval from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. The Mayor, in a terse statement yesterday, said, "I will review the borough board's decision."
The proposal presents a delicate political problem for the Mayor, since Hispanic small-business owners have formed an important element of his support. Local bodega owners have led opposition to the plan. But Council members on both sides of the issue said they did not expect the Mayor to halt the project at this juncture.
Mr. Linares's announcement that he would vote in favor of the project led to applause and jeers from a contentious standing-room-only crowd in the Manhattan Borough President's office.
As the final 7-to-5 vote was tallied, Mr. Rodriguez sprang from his seat. Leaning across the boardroom table and angrily pointing his finger at Mr. Linares, he shouted, "You sold out!" Councilman Adam Clayton Powell 4th, who represents the district where the store will be built and has led the opposition to it, accused Mr. Linares of succumbing to "pressure or deals."
One Harlem couple at the meeting, Pauline Morris, 30, and her husband, Gregory, 47, said that the new supermarket and pharmacy to be built at 125th Street and Third Avenue would be a boon to neighborhood residents. Because Mr. Morris uses a wheelchair, his wife said that "we can't get around inside the small grocery stores in our area, and the selection is bad. We're happy about this."
Surveys have suggested that a majority of residents, both black and Hispanic, want the large selection, the convenience and the 200 jobs that the supermarket is expected to provide. But a feverish lobbying campaign by mostly Hispanic East Harlem merchants had produced significant opposition in the community and on the borough board. In addition to the threat to existing businesses, opponents had criticized the Federal and state grants that the project's nonprofit development consortium is receiving.
For Mr. Linares, who had been working with the opposition, his reversal was an exercise of political independence that some of his colleagues suggested might undermine his future trustworthiness. As the city's only elected Dominican-American official, Mr. Linares represents Washington Heights, Inwood and Marble Hill, communities heavily studded with Dominican-owned stores.
"Yesterday in the afternoon when it became apparent that the project was virtually killed," Mr. Linares said yesterday, "I began searching in my mind and conscience for what would be in the best interest of the community." Looking shaken after the vote, he added, "I never thought it would be this difficult."
The borough board -- which consists of Manhattan's 10 Council members, Borough President Ruth Messinger and the chairman of the affected community board (in this case Eddie Baca from Community Board 11) -- was required to vote on the sale of the city-owned property to the developers, the East Harlem Abyssinian Triangle Corporation.
Ms. Messinger, who supported the project from the beginning, and the developers said they were disappointed that Mayor Giuliani had not publicly supported the proposal.
The Rev. Calvin O. Butts, pastor of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church, which has a community development arm that is part of the consortium developing the project, said: "I'm very surprised by the Mayor. He said to me on two occasions, face to face, that he supported us."
The borough board's two Republican members, Charles Millard and Andrew Eristoff, who voted against the project, said they had not discussed their votes with the Mayor. Mr. Millard said he knew the Mayor had "certainly stopped pushing" for the project. In addition to the Federal subsidies, Mr. Millard said he felt the project had political flaws.
"This is a Hispanic community and many of the community leaders there felt left out," he said.
Ms. Messinger surprised some board members when she told them that although she usually did not vote on board matters except in case of a tie, she was going to vote in this case. "I usually don't vote since I chair the meetings," Ms. Messinger said. "But this is the largest private dollar investment in Harlem in 20 years."
Pathmark, based in Woodbridge, N.J., has 142 supermarkets and 34 drug stores. The company, which last year had $4.3 billion in sales, operates 17 supermarkets and 24 drugstores in New York City, employing 5,000 people.
Under the plan, the city will sell the land to the East Harlem group for $1.5 million and provide the developers with a mortgage at one percent interest. The developers will also receive $1.1 million in Federal and state grants and a city tax exemption. Chemical Bank is providing an $8 million market-rate loan for construction, and Pathmark will take out a 25-year lease on the property, paying the developers $1.06 million a year in rent. An additional $1.5 million in investor equity is being provided by The Retail Initiative Inc., an affiliate of Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a community development group started by the Ford Foundation.
"Profits derived by the development team will be reinvested into the Harlem community for much-needed housing, health care facilities, day care, jobs and education," said Councilwoman C. Virginia Fields, who voted for the project. She said the project's results would determine whether economic development in Harlem "will go forward now, or will it take another 25 years."
The board members who voted in favor of the project were Ms. Messinger, Mr. Baca, Mr. Linares, Ms. Fields, Ronnie M. Eldridge, Thomas K. Duane and Stanley E. Michaels, who was absent from the meeting but had an assistant cast his vote. Those opposed were Mr. Powell, Mr. Millard, Mr. Eristoff, Kathryn E. Freed and Antonio Pagan.

HEADLINE: Cemetery Watchdog Goes and Debate on Regulation Begins

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
For eight months, Ralph Perfetto investigated stolen bones, backyard burials, embezzled cemetery trust funds and tales of graves dug in heaps of construction debris and refrigerator parts.
The rights of the dead are inalienable, the director of the State Division of Cemeteries liked to say. And so Mr. Perfetto, who was appointed to a six-year term last August, held public hearings, listening to complaints of twice-sold graves and price gouging, and promised prosecutions. 
 "He's a sincere man, a breath of fresh air, and we've not seen anything like him," Rabbi Elchonon Zohn, an official with a Jewish burial society in Queens, said of Mr. Perfetto when he met him at a public hearing last January. "But the cemeteries in this state have had a free run for years. I wonder if Mr. Perfetto is strong enough to last?"
Mr. Perfetto, who considered himself a kind of advocate for the dead, didn't last long. He was dismissed earlier this month by officials with Gov. George E. Pataki's administration who told him his position had been eliminated. Under a provision contained in the Governor's proposed budget, the State Division of Cemeteries is to be abolished, and the regulation of the 1,908 nonprofit cemeteries in New York is to be turned over to the Attorney General's office.
The debate over who should regulate the state's nonprofit cemeteries -- the cemeteries hold more than $1 billion in trust funds -- has opened a window into a lucrative, but often ignored industry.
Some religious and political leaders, who considered Mr. Perfetto to be the first truly zealous watchdog of the cemetery industry in years, see his firing and the elimination of his department as the Pataki administration's concession to cemetery directors who do not wish to be scrutinized. Mr. Perfetto filed suit in Manhattan earlier this month seeking to be reinstated.
But Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki, said Mr. Perfetto's dismissal amounted to nothing more than replacing a member of a former administration with someone "who shares our views." There is an interim cemeteries director until the post is eliminated. And she said the proposal to abolish the Division of Cemeteries was in keeping with the Governor's plan to "downsize state regulatory agencies."
For the last four decades, the financial operations of the state's nearly 2,000 nonprofit cemeteries -- there are 6,000 cemeteries in New York, counting municipal, private and religious ones -- have been overseen by the Division of Cemeteries. Annual audits of the cemeteries were conducted, and requests for price increases were reviewed. But even the cemetery owners did not consider the oversight rigorous enough.
Mr. Perfetto, a former United States Customs investigator, said that when he took over last summer, only about 250 of the nonprofit cemeteries were "on more or less solid ground." More than a half a dozen in the metropolitan area had to be taken over by receivers acting on behalf of the state.
Mr. Perfetto found that for years, some cemetery officials appeared to be embezzling money from trust funds, taking illegal loans, even paying personal mortgages with cemetery funds. He listed his findings, which included scores of examples, in a memo drawn up shortly before he was dismissed, he said.
At a series of unprecedented public hearings on cemeteries held across the city last January, dozens of people testified about being insulted and overcharged at cemeteries, of having cemetery officials lose track of who had been buried where and of having paid for the perpetual care of a relative's grave only to learn that in 1995, perpetual care is good for about eight years.
The firing of Mr. Perfetto and the proposed abolition of the Division of Cemeteries pits cemetery directors against some political and religious leaders, particularly Jewish leaders, in a sharp debate over how best to regulate the cemeteries.
Jules Polonetsky, a Democratic assemblyman from Brooklyn, calls the Pataki's administration's move "a pure and simple giveaway to the cemeteries."
"There was limited oversight of them to begin with, and now there could be less," Mr. Polonetsky said. "The people who run these cemeteries are drooling over the proposal."
One cemetery president, Dan Austin, who parts company with the others, believes that Mr. Pataki is making a mistake.
"To do away with the Division of Cemeteries would give the cemetery people the license to do what they want, and the atrocities would go on," Mr. Austin said. "The firing of Mr. Perfetto was purely political, and it basically says: the public be damned."
It is Jewish leaders who say they most fear the dismantling of the Division of Cemeteries. Because Jewish law requires speedy burials, Jewish leaders have long complained that the nonprofit cemeteries charge exorbitant fees for burial on weekends or holidays. Lobbyists for the cemeteries say they have introduced separate legislation establishing fines for price gouging to address such concerns.
Critics of Mr. Pataki's plan believe the Attorney General's office will not be willing or able to devote staff and resources to closely monitor the cemeteries.
They are further troubled that the proposal allows individual cemeteries to set their own prices for burials without prior approval by the Attorney General's office. Those concerns are not eased by the fact that one Pataki administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said earlier this year that Attorney General Dennis Vacco preferred not to take on the added role of overseeing the state's cemeteries.
And in a recent letter to the Governor, Rabbi Maurice D. Simokes, president of the Long Island Board of Rabbis, charged that the proposal "was virtually drafted by the cemeterians who would seem to have a direct line to the ear of the Governor."
The wife of Nick Barrella, a lobbyist for cemetery owners, is the sister-in-law of Michael Finnegan, chief counsel to Mr. Pataki. As well, the wife of Lawrence F. Sloane, another lobbyist involved in trying to abolish the Division of Cemeteries was an aide to Mr. Pataki when he was a state senator and currently holds a position in the administration.
Ms. Mucha, the Governor's spokeswoman, dismissed the claim of improper influence as "ridiculous."
And Mr. Barrella, who has played a central role in pushing for the abolition of the Division of Cemeteries, insisted that the proposal to charge the Attorney General's office with oversight responsibility would lead to a more meaningful regulation of the cemeteries. He contended that the Division of Cemeteries has been ineptly run for years and that the proposal would eliminate the division's $600,000 budget.
"No sleight of hand is being pulled here," said Mr. Barrella, the chief lobbyist for the New York State Cemeteries Association. "We are a legitimate organization, not a criminal organization."
Mr. Barrella's clients argue that their proposal would result in "more intelligent regulation" that would not burden the hundreds of small cemeteries in the state run by volunteers. They say the proposal would require cemeteries to register their officers with the Attorney General and submit certified annual reports. It would also increase the required annual contributions made by each cemetery to its perpetual care and general maintenance funds.
These officials say the proposal is essential to sustaining an industry that they admit has been plagued by mismanagement and whose fortunes have been hurt by changing demographics, increased labor costs and diminishing available space in graveyards. They believe that the many cases of malfeasance at cemeteries in the state in recent years only underscore the division's inability to adequately monitor their financial operations.
"There's no doubt cemeteries in New York are troubled," said Mr. Sloane, a consultant whose management firm has advised and represented cemeteries in New York State for years. "But I think the supervision of the troubled cemeteries would be better under the Attorney General."
A handful of prominent officials in the State Assembly predict the proposal will be eliminated before the budget is passed, and say negotiations on a resolution to the question of oversight will be lengthy.
Meanwhile, Mr. Perfetto waits to have his day in court. He has said that while "not all the people in charge of cemeteries are crooks," people trying to bury their dead with dignity and economy should not be reduced to "captive consumers who can be treated like dirt."

HEADLINE: GIULIANI'S SPENDING PLAN: THE STRATEGY;
Giuliani Frames Budget Choice: Cut Welfare, or Cut Middle-Class Services

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
Unveiling his second budget yesterday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani sought to frame the fiscal debate in both New York City and Albany as a stark choice between cuts in health and welfare programs for the poor or reductions in services cherished by the middle class.
He did so by putting a contingency plan in his budget for vast cuts in libraries, schools, the city university, sanitation, and the arts that he said would have to take place unless Assembly Democrats go along with Medicaid and welfare cuts that would allow the city to stop spending $750 million on those poverty programs. 
 Tactically, that move put immediate pressure on the Democrats by casting the budget debate in class terms, with the Democrats portrayed as the advocates of what Mr. Giuliani called "wildly out of control entitlement spending at levels that are excessive compared to any other place in America."
Mr. Giuliani may also have been laying the groundwork to blame the Democrats two years from now if the city's wrenching deficits mean he has to explain to voters in an election year why there was an erosion in city services and the quality of life despite his assurances as a candidate that the city could curb spending, reduce taxes and at the same time "improve services for all New Yorkers."
For as he proposes his second budget, Mr. Giuliani faces the fiscal and political dilemma that the city's budgetary problems have not diminished under his stewardship. After a year in which Mr. Giuliani slashed $2 billion in spending and won union consent to lure 15,000 workers off the municipal payroll through buyouts, the city's deficit has only grown. Where Mr. Giuliani faced a $2.3 billion deficit coming into office, now the Mayor has to deal with a $3.1 billion deficit.
Part of the reason for the growing deficit is Mr. Giuliani's own budget policies. Almost $2 billion of the savings Mr. Giuliani achieved in his first year in office were one-time cash infusions brought about by selling assets, settling outstanding legal claims or refinancing debt, fiscal monitors say. The result is that the savings provided no long-term reduction in city spending patterns.
But the deficit has also been worsened by the sluggishness of the city's economy, which has proved far more responsive to the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve than to the fiscal policies of the Giuliani administration.
New York City continues to lag behind the nation in economic growth. The robust job growth that occured in the first half of last year slowed in the second half so that the city saw only a net increase of 22,500 jobs. So far this year, the increase in private sector employment has been more than offset by the drop in government jobs, resulting in a net loss of 2,200 jobs.
Wall Street, which accounts for 17 percent of city tax revenues and which had been the engine leading the metropolitan region out of recession, went into a sharp slump last year as it was buffeted by the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies. As a result, the city saw a drop in tax collections that officials say is steeper than any in recent years, even those during the depths of the recession of the early 90's. And the welfare rolls rose for another year.
What all of this means is that Mr. Giuliani was faced once again with an enormous problem in his second budget. And saying that city services could not bear the brunt alone, Mr. Giuliani crafted a deficit reduction strategy that relied heavily on cutting Medicaid and welfare entitlement programs.
Originally, he had hoped to get Albany's approval to reduce Medicaid and welfare spending in the city by $1.2 billion. Now, with even Republican Gov. George E. Pataki and the Republican Senate loath to go that far, he has scaled back to $700 million the savings he expects the city to receive automatically by piggybacking on state welfare and Medicaid cuts. (The city and state poverty programs work in close tandem under state law.)
Mr. Giuliani seeks to close the rest of the deficit by asking labor to come up with $600 million in savings, by cutting agencies by $1 billion, by seeking $250 million in additional state aid, $50 million in Federal aid, selling assets and a host of smaller actions.
But the risk inherent in this strategy is that a third or more of the savings the Mayor needs is hostage to the State Legislature, which is locked in a fiercely partisan stalemate over Governor Pataki's own budget priorities and the welfare and Medicaid cuts. Just this week, the Assembly passed its own budget bills that scale back the depth of the Medicaid and welfare cuts and leave the Mayor far short of the $900 million in fiscal relief he is seeking from the state.
It remains to be seen whether Mr. Giuliani's posture of pitting welfare and Medicaid cuts against deeper cuts in services will put the pressure he desires on Assembly Democrats.
Recent polls have shown both the Governor and the Mayor's popularity ratings damaged by their budget policies, and there were signs yesterday that Democrats were not simply going to allow Mr. Giuliani to frame the debate over the budget.
"Driving an economic wedge between the people of New York will not help us reclaim our fiscal health," said Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President and a possible challenger to Mr. Giuliani in 1997. "Nor will a narrow definition of entitlements that fails to include the more than $700 million in tax relief given to businesses and property owners each year. All entitlements -- not just those for the poor -- must be on the table."
Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker, left open the possibility that the Council might contest some of Mr. Giuliani's plans to move ahead with $185 million in tax cuts even as he seeks to slash spending on government and entitlements.

HEADLINE: Senator, in Fury, Advances Regulatory Bill

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
With a furious bang of his gavel, the chairman of a bitterly divided Senate Judiciary Committee today turned back the committee's Democrats and moved ahead on the most ambitious version so far of Republican legislation to roll back environmental and other regulations.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, his voice rising in anger, abruptly ordered the legislation approved without a formal vote this morning. The chairman, a Republican from Utah, said Democrats on the committee had exhausted his patience by continuing to argue for changes in the bill. 
 The committee session, short as a thunderstorm, highlighted the increasingly fractious politics surrounding Republican proposals to roll back regulations. The legislation, similar to provisions of the Republicans' Contract With America that have already been approved by the House, would reopen a generation of environmental, health and safety rules to potential review in an effort to reduce regulatory costs on businesses.
The bill is not scheduled for floor debate until after Memorial Day, allowing ample time for some kind of compromise to emerge from the Senate's back rooms and head off a prolonged and highly partisan debate.
But that would take the cooperation of the majority leader, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, who is the prime sponsor of the bill that passed the Judiciary Committee today. So far, he has shown no interest in a more moderate version that was unanimously approved by a different Senate committee last month.
Senator Dole's preferred version, as refined by Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, contains provisions repealing the existing prohibition against cancer-causing chemical residues in processed foods, providing new defenses for companies accused of breaking pollution laws, and nullifying existing statutory and court-ordered deadlines for enforcing environmental laws.
At its heart are elaborate requirements to assess the costs and benefits of regulations, giving far more weight to economic factors than is common under existing laws.
Another feature of the proposal, and the reason for its consideration by the Judiciary Committee, is its broad new grounds for regulated businesses to challenge Federal rules in court.
The legislation approved today by the Judiciary Committee would repeal the law, known as the Delaney Clause, which prohibits residues of certain cancer-causing chemicals in processed foods. That provision was inserted in the bill at the behest of the farm, food processing and grocery industries. They have long argued that the clause is outdated and that the public can be adequately protected against cancer without flatly banning these substances.
But the Dole bill is far broader than that, potentially reopening thousands of regulations issued to enforce a generation of laws ranging from the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act to those requiring toxic waste dumps to be cleaned up and laborers to be protected from hazards at work.
The Clinton Administration and many Democrats, joined by labor, consumer and environmental groups, strongly oppose the Judiciary Committee's bill.
Committee members who oppose the bill, although a minority, succeeded two weeks ago in delaying the panel's action until after the Congressional recess by promising Mr. Hatch that the committee could finish as soon as the Senate returned to work this week.
To Senator Hatch, that deal guaranteed that the Democrats would not try to prolong the debate. But when the committee convened early this morning, Senators Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts suggested that more time might be needed because the committee had scheduled a hearing on terrorism this afternoon. Under their goading, Mr. Hatch first bristled and finally erupted.
"It is clear that some of my colleagues on the committee wish to filibuster this measure," the chairman said, his composure draining away. "But the dilatory efforts of a few members to further delay committee action on this measure will not prevail."
"Then it's over!" Senator Hatch suddenly declared, cracking his gavel down on the wooden table. He slammed down a notebook, turned on his heel and stalked out of the room.
Because he had previously won the committee's unanimous consent to complete action without delay, he ruled, no vote was necessary.
"There's a lot of pressure on all the Republican chairmen to move things through," Senator Biden said later. "Are the trains running on time?"
The opponents are counting on Senate rules, which allow extended debate, to slow any bill like this one, which President Clinton will probably veto if it passes unchanged.
"Mr. Dole has managed to go even further than the House in providing relief for the special interests, the polluters and their lawyers," said Carol M. Browner, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. "This does not represent rational reform or refinement; this is a continuation of the frontal assault of our ability to do our job."
Senator Dole's role in pressing for a far-reaching bill could bolster his fund-raising efforts among industry groups, which have been lobbying hard for the bill, while cementing his support in the conservative wing of his party as he sets out on his quest for the 1996 Republican Presidential nomination.

HEADLINE: Without Welfare, Giuliani Suggests, Many Might Move

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's plan to cut welfare benefits, combined with similar proposals in Albany, could prompt many welfare recipients to move out of New York State, the Mayor said yesterday.
If welfare recipients were able to break free from their dependency on government benefits, enabling them to move freely around the country, the Mayor said, "that would be a good thing" for them. He did not directly answer a question of whether the city would be better off if many welfare recipients left town. 
 "A natural consequence of a reduction in benefits might very well be that that would happen," said Mr. Giuliani, who on Thursday released a city budget calling for reductions of $700 million in welfare and Medicaid benefits. "There was a contention back 10 years ago that's precisely what happened when Pennsylvania did away with the equivalent of Home Relief, that people moved to New York and other states. But I've never seen proof that that was the case."
The Mayor denied a report broadcast on WNYC radio yesterday quoting him as saying on Thursday that a population shift of welfare recipients out of New York would be a "good thing" for the city. Speaking to reporters at an impromptu news conference called because of the broadcast report, he said that the intention of his welfare cutbacks was to balance the budget and remove those who are not entitled to benefits from the rolls -- not to force people to move.
The Mayor's statement came a day after he unveiled a $31.1 billion city budget containing tough new eligibility requirements for providing benefits to parents with dependent children, beginning in July. The requirements, already in effect for the far smaller Home Relief program for childless, able-bodied adults, would reduce the number of applicants with children by 30 percent, city budget officials told reporters on Thursday.
The administration, however, spent much of the day backpedaling from Thursday's assertions about the new rules for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Mr. Giuliani retreated from the 30 percent reduction figure, saying he had no idea what the effect of the new requirements would be.
"I have no idea whether they're right or wrong or what they're basing it on," he said. He was referring to the budget officials who first predicted the 30 percent reductions. "I would not state a percentage because I don't know what it is. They're making that determination. It may turn out to be right; it may turn out to be wrong."
In addition, a top mayoral aide backed away from the position of the budget office that the Mayor's new program would base eligibility for the A.F.D.C. program on the rules that now apply to Home Relief. Richard Schwartz, one of the architects of the Mayor's plans to restructure welfare, said that the issue needs to be studied further before the city decides what kind of restrictions to implement.
In January, the city began intense reviews of all applicants for Home Relief. Workers visit their homes unannounced to see if they live at their stated addresses, and use computer checks of their Social Security numbers to see if they have any income that they have not reported. The Mayor announced earlier this month that the process had reduced the number of applicants by more than 60 percent over the same period last year, and the new budget is built on the assumption that the number of A.F.D.C. applicants would decline by 30 percent, according to budget officials.
But using the same rules for both Home Relief, which is paid for by the city and state, and A.F.D.C., which is paid for primarily by the Federal Government, could bring legal difficulties. Federal courts have ruled that while home visits to A.F.D.C. recipients are legal, they must be announced in advance and must be for the purpose of protecting the child -- not investigating welfare fraud.
Mr. Schwartz said that it was premature to discuss the precise nature of the eligibility rules because they are still being studied by city officials. Asked if, under the new rules, a mother would have to take her children to the same office in downtown Brooklyn where all Home Relief applicants are now interviewed, Mr. Schwartz said that that had not been determined.
"We still need some time to analyze the issue," he said.
Welfare advocates said yesterday that the proposed cutbacks could have a devastating effect on many poor people, but they questioned the Mayor's assertion that many recipients might be tempted to leave town. Liz Krueger, executive director of the Community Food Resource Center, said that relocating is often very expensive, requiring cash for apartment security deposits and moving costs.
"Where does he think they're going to go?" she asked. "Is he offering train tickets, or large sums of resettlement money? We aren't talking about people who moved here. These are New Yorkers, and most of them have no interest in picking up and leaving town."
Henry Freedman, executive director of the Center on Social Welfare Policy and Law, based in Manhattan, said that many states, including New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts, have implemented or have proposed sharp cutbacks in their own welfare benefits, making it less likely that New York welfare recipients will flee the state for higher benefits.
He said that census data on migration showed that poor people move in the same directions as those who are not poor, usually toward states with jobs and booming economies rather than those offering higher welfare benefits.
"If people become very desperate as a result of these cuts, it's likely they'll try to move in with their extended families," he said. "That may mean moving to another state, but it would not be for the welfare benefits."

U.S. Economy Slowed In First Quarter of '95
The economy slowed to a 2.8 percent growth pace in the first three months of 1995 as consumers paused after a year-end spending spree, the Government reported. As a result of the slowdown in consumer spending, inventories of unsold goods swelled by the biggest amount in a decade.
 At the same time, American businesses increased their breakneck rate of investment in equipment and buildings, which analysts said should keep the economy moving satisfactorily ahead until shoppers revive in the next few months. Page 1.
 
Appeals Court Overturns E.P.A.'s Ethanol Standard
A Federal appeals court said the Government could not require corn-based ethanol as an additive in a cleaner-burning gasoline now sold in 17 states. The three-judge panel concluded that while the Environmental Protection Agency had "the authority to set a standard" for cleaner gasoline, it could not "mandate the manner of compliance or the precise formula" for the fuel. The ruling was in response to a lawsuit filed by the petroleum industry; the E.P.A. said it had not decided whether to appeal. 9.
 
More Records for Stocks
Recovering from a morning drop, the major stock market indexes rose to highs for the third day this week. The Dow Jones industrial average ended at 4,321.27, up 6.57 for the day and 51.18 for the week. The New York Stock Exchange composite index and the S.& P. 500 also broke records. 39.

HEADLINE: G.M. Will Shed Some Models, Stressing Brand

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 28

 BODY:
Ronald L. Zarrella, the outsider hired by General Motors to impart distinct and vivid personalities to its muddled divisions and models, emerged from four months of studying the company today to announce that he agreed with the basic marketing strategy G.M. already had in place.
 But he is clearly fine-tuning the strategy. While General Motors has no plans to kill or merge any of its seven divisions, it will do away with some car or truck models, Mr. Zarrella said in a speech today to the Automotive Press Association here. 
 General Motors, the largest auto maker, has too many car and truck models -- up to 77, all told, he said, adding that "the challenge of the future is to increase total sales volume with fewer vehicle-line brands." He declined to say what lines might be eliminated.
 Mr. Zarella also provided a glimpse into the sorts of technology he is hoping to harness in better differentiating G.M.'s brands. He offered visions of lasers in Pontiac showrooms to captivate young people, and of Buick showrooms that resemble country clubs to put its older customers at ease.
 Shares of General Motors rose $1.625 today, to $45.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 Mr. Zarrella, who is vice president and group executive for sales, service and marketing in G.M.'s core North American operations, said he hoped to hire 20 to 30 "brand managers" by the end of the year -- perhaps turning to companies like Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble for some of them -- to nurture an image for each car and truck.
 He also said that sales were slower than expected in April, and that G.M. now expected a mild downturn in the car and truck market in 1997. Previously, G.M. economists had projected continued slow growth in sales, without specifying a time sequence.
 Mr. Zarrella, who was hired away from Bausch & Lomb in November, said he would pursue some marketing methods that are not universally popular with G.M. division chiefs, such as "value pricing," which is selling cars at firm, predetermined prices, reducing haggling in showrooms. "We know it works," he said.
 Mr. Zarrella also said that customers were already showing they were happier with General Motors. In the fourth quarter of 1994, he said, G.M. passed Toyota for the first time in a G.M. survey that determines how satisfied customers are with vehicles they purchased in the last six months. G.M. started collecting such data in the late 1980's, he said.
 When G.M. controlled almost half the American market, its divisions could afford to compete with one another because there were enough customers to go around. But G.M. now controls less than a third of the market, and its divisions are stealing one another's buyers, in addition to wasting money by duplicating efforts. By contrast, the Ford Motor Company has just three divisions, and the Toyota Motor Corporation, two.
 Yet Mr. Zarrella -- echoing the view of other top G.M. executives -- argued that a multiplicity of divisions could help the company. "If we can carve out the right role in each of the market segments and target our products to more differentiated segments," he said, "it's a distinct advantage for General Motors."
 Mr. Zarrella sketched personalities for each division that accord with G.M.'s long-established aims, with Oldsmobile aiming for import buyers and Pontiac for driving enthusiasts. He is creating a new system in hopes of disciplining G.M.'s bureaucracy to let those personalities develop.
 He said brand managers would have responsibility for nourishing each model's image by avoiding three industry pitfalls: monomaniacal focus on price, inconsistent advertising themes, and a "model-year syndrome" that has auto makers promoting vehicles on introduction and ignoring them later.
 The brand manager will be responsible for the profitability of the model, and will decide its price and content, among other things.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Seeks Fish Sellers For Market

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
Turning up the heat in negotiations for new leases and rent increases at the Fulton Fish Market, New York City officials have begun soliciting merchants who might replace some fish wholesalers now at the market.
 Randy M. Mastro, chief of staff for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, said yesterday that several hundred letters were sent this week to wholesale seafood dealers who had either expressed interest in moving to the market or who the administration believed might be considering doing so. 
 Mr. Mastro would not identify the dealers, but said the letters were sent to dealers in the New York region as well as in other cities and countries.
 The letters marked the latest salvo in a struggle between the city and the fish market, which the Mayor has characterized as being rife with corruption and mob influence. Two weeks ago, representatives of many of the market's 40 dealers threatened to move out of the market if the city raised rents substantially.
 And on Wednesday, representatives of the market's three merchants associations inspected sites in Yonkers, and the vendors have said they would also consider moving to Brooklyn or New Jersey.
 "In light of the public comments by certain wholesalers that they would consider leaving the market," Mr. Mastro said, "it is only prudent on the city's part to have discussions with parties who have an interest in doing business at the market."
 The city is the landlord for most of the three-block section on South Street in Lower Manhattan where the market has been situated for more than 150 years. Many of the businesses date back decades.
 Late last month, the Giuliani administration proposed a bill to the City Council to crack down on the market by licensing and regulating all businesses there. The administration also began negotiations to raise rents for 40 dealers who pay a total of about $270,000 a year. Their rents have not been raised since 1982.
 Two days after the administration's proposals, a fire that investigators classified as arson caused severe damage in one of the market's two main buildings. No arrests have been made.
 The letters to potential tenants were sent under Mr. Mastro's name and state that the city is "implementing a comprehensive plan to improve business operations" at the market to make it "a better, safer, and more desirable place in which to do business."
 In letters sent specifically to dealers who had already contacted City Hall, Mr. Mastro added, "We appreciate the interest that you have recently expressed in obtaining such a lease and stand ready to meet with you to discuss this matter further."
 Mr. Mastro, in all of the letters, said that the city was meeting with prospective tenants and that the dealers should get in touch with Daniel Kurtz, the senior vice president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, the agency handling the lease negotiations.
 The market is the nation's largest wholesale fish center, with about 1,000 employees, and generates annual sales and wages of $800 million to $1 billion.
 According to the merchants associations, the city is demanding increases that would raise some rents tenfold. Such increases, the dealers assert, would force them to inflate prices sharply for customers -- mainly retail fish stores and restaurants -- or leave the market.
 Mr. Mastro refused to disclose the increases the city is seeking.
 Joseph L. Forstadt, a lawyer for the South Street Sidewalk Association, a group of 11 dealers, said that he doubted that any replacement merchants could afford the rents that the city is demanding from the established dealers.
 "The city is currently asking for a level of rent that is just too high for anyone to survive," said Mr. Forstadt, a partner in the firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan.
 Mr. Forstadt said that a lease agreement reached in 1982 with the dealers limited rent increases by the city to the rise in the annual cost-of-living rate. He maintained that the agreement was still in effect, although the city had not asked for a change in 13 years.
 In their search for alternative market sites, the dealers associations appear to be making little headway.
 Andrew J. Maniglia, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development in Yonkers, said that on Wednesday merchants from the market inspected a number of privately owned places in that city, including the parking lot at Yonkers Raceway.
 "They need 200,000 square feet," Mr. Maniglia said, "and there are not many sites of that magnitude available in Yonkers." The merchants were advised by Yonkers officials to deal directly with the private owners for leases, Mr. Maniglia noted.
 Lillian C. Liburdi, the director of Port Development for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said that she had rejected requests by market associations to inspect vacant buildings and warehouses owned by the agency on the Brooklyn and Newark waterfronts. These places, she said, were intended for marine commerce and not for the large-scale parking of trucks required for a seafood market.

HEADLINE: TERROR IN OKLAHOMA: THE FAR RIGHT;
Manual for Terrorists Extols 'Greatest Coldbloodedness'

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER 

 BODY:
Since the Oklahoma City bombing, leaders of paramilitary groups have said in dozens of interviews that their groups were organized solely to defend themselves against a Government they view as out of control.
But a number of internal training manuals sold by the most influential of these groups advocate a campaign of terror and lay out specific strategies for actions, including attacking vulnerable Federal buildings, kidnapping important people, sabotaging the food supply and executing enemies. 
 By far the most complete and explicit of these documents to emerge so far is the multipart "M.O.D. Training Manuals," distributed by the Militia of Montana, one of the three most influential paramilitary groups in the country, along with the Michigan Militia and the United States Militia Association, based in Idaho. Just what "M.O.D" stands for is unclear.
The $75 manual, consisting of more than 200 pages, is part of an extensive catalogue of videotapes, audiotapes and literature marketed by the group. It describes what it says are the biblical and ideological justification for a guerrilla war in the United States and provides details about how to conduct it.
The Federal authorities have not said whether any paramilitary groups were involved in the bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. But the main suspect, Timothy J. McVeigh, and James and Terry Nichols, the two brothers who have been charged with conspiring to make explosive devices, attended at least one meeting of a paramilitary group in Michigan, members of the Michigan Militia have said.
The manual distributed by the Montana group was obtained by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a group that monitors the new paramilitary movement, which has set up organizations in least 30 states. The directives of the training manual include these:
*Undertaking a campaign of domestic terrorism, defined as "an action usually involving the placement of a bomb or fire explosion of great destructive power, which is capable of effecting irreparable loss against the enemy." It goes on to say: "Requires theoretical and practical knowledge of how to make explosives. It is an action the urban guerrilla must execute with the greatest coldbloodedness."
*Coordinating sabotage attacks to cripple the "economy of the country, agricultural or industrial production, transport and communication systems, the military and police systems."
"Public offices, centers of government services, government warehouses are easy targets for sabotage," the manual says, adding, "Industrial workers acting as urban guerrillas are excellent industrial saboteurs since they, better than anyone, understand the industry, the factory, the machine or the part most likely to destroy an entire operation, doing far more damage than a poorly informed layman."
*Destroying "the firms and properties of people that are not Americans," it says, explaining, "Firms and property in this country that are not owned by Americans must become such frequent targets of sabotage that the volume of actions directed against them surpasses the total of all other actions against vital enemy points."
*Conducting a "war of nerves" by planting false rumors with the police, exploiting Government mismanagement and letting "false plans" fall into the hands of authorities. The aim of the disinformation campaign, the manual says, is to create "an air of nervousness, discredit, insecurity, uncertainty and concern on the part of the government."
*Raiding armories in order to seize "arms, ammo and explosives."
*"Kidnapping of personalities who are known artists, sports figures or are outstanding in some other field, who have evidenced no political interest." Such kidnapping "can be a useful form of propaganda for the revolutionary and patriot principles, provided the kidnapping is handled so that the public sympathizes with it."
*Executing spies, government officials and "those who go to the police of their own free will to make denunciations and accusations, who supply clues and information and finger people" in paramilitary groups.
*Developing skills in weather forecasting, survival, ambushes, assassination and sniper attacks, and handling night vision equipment, booby traps , hand grenades and other ordnance.
*Keeping militia activities secret from members' families. "Under no circumstances is the material in your field manual to be divulged to or read to your wife and kids unless they have been approved by your cell leader for actual recruiting and membership."
In effect, said Rabbi Marvin Hier, the founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a human rights group in Los Angeles that tracks hate groups, the manual is a basic text for teaching disaffected citizens how to conduct a low-intensity conflict intended to foment a right-wing revolution.
Neither he nor other experts said they knew what the "M.O.D." stood for in the manual's title.
David Trochmann, 49, a co-founder of the Militia of Montana, confirmed in an interview on Wednesday that his group was distributing the manual. His group's name and address is on the front page.
But, he said, the paramilitary group was not the manual's author. Furthermore, he said he did not know who the author was or what "M.O.D." stood for. He also said he had not read the documents and did not know about their contents.
"If this stuff is in here and we haven't checked it out completely, then it's coming out of the catalogue," Mr. Trochmann said. "This manual has not been checked out thoroughly, and it should have been checked out. I don't agree with any of that stuff. We didn't realize this kind of stuff was in there. This one slipped by."
Mr. Trochmann also said he did not know how many manuals had been distributed, even though the $75 price made them among the most expensive items in the Militia of Montana's extensive catalogue.
Rabbi Hier said the training manuals provided more documented evidence that the militia movement had tried to mislead the public by insisting that its aims were merely defensive.
"They say they are law-abiding patriots but at the same time they are training and looking behind every tree for Federal agents," Rabbi Hier said. "It's a recipe for disaster."

HEADLINE: Working Less, And Not Upset;
Japan's Slump Cracks Tradition of Long Hours

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 28

 BODY:
When Sumitomo Metal Industries began closing its offices and factories for two workdays each month to save money, many employees at first dreaded the loss of income. A year and a half later, some of the steel company's workers now worry that the shutdowns will end.
 "People are getting used to it," said Nobuaki Masuda, an assistant manager in corporate planning. "We are saying that if we have to work five days a week every week we will die." 
 Yes, even the Japanese enjoy some time off. And owing in part to the nation's economic slump, they are now getting it. Indeed, by some measures, the Japanese, who have been known for six-day workweeks and long stretches of overtime, are now apparently working fewer hours than Americans, whom Japanese politicians were denouncing only a few years ago as lazy.
 The Japanese worked an average of 1,904 hours in 1994, down from 2,111 hours in 1988 and way down from a peak of 2,432 in 1960, according to the Ministry of Labor.
 Comparable American figures are hard to come by because of different calculation methods. Looking only at blue-collar manufacturing workers, the Labor Ministry estimated that Japanese employees put in 2,017 hours in 1992, compared with 1,957 for American workers. But by 1994, the Japanese figure had dropped to about 1,960 while American work hours, buoyed by a strong economy, had risen about 2.4 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States.
 Japan's prolonged recession, which has sharply cut overtime, is not the only reason for the decline. There has also been a longer-term fundamental shift to a shorter workweek and more vacations, as a now-affluent nation no longer has to work so hard to make ends meet.
 Some say the reduction in work hours is not as great as the statistics indicate because many employees, either out of a sense of duty or because of corporate pressure, put in time for which they are not paid and which is not recorded. One Government survey found that employees estimated they had worked about 400 hours a year more than the statistics showed. This so-called service overtime has probably increased as companies have clamped down on paid overtime.
 "Overtime work continued; overtime pay was cut," said Hiroshi Kawahito, a labor lawyer. He added that cases of death from overwork, known as karoshi, have not declined from an estimated 10,000 a year.
 It is also not clear how long the reduction in work hours will last. In the last few months, paid overtime has increased as the economy has shown some signs of recovery. The long recession has also changed the priority of workers from reducing hours to preserving job security.
 Still, regular working hours should continue to decline -- despite concerns by many business executives that Japan's competitiveness could be hurt -- as the nation moves toward a statutory workweek of 40 hours, down from the 44 to 48 hours that was typical a decade ago.
 Much of the change has been a result of Government directive, after other nations contended that Japan was competing unfairly by virtually enslaving its population to fuel its export machine.
 To counter such criticism, the Government started a program to make Japan a "life style superpower" as well as an economic one, by coaxing and sometimes practically forcing people to take it easy.
 Companies, sometimes reluctantly, sometimes out of self-interest, went along, at times even paying their workers extra to take vacations and turning off the lights to get people to go home.
 Experts and everyday workers alike say there has been a gradual shift away from the mentality of sacrificing one's personal life for the company.
 "When I was young there was a sense that if your boss was still working you should stay," said Toshiya Tsugami, 38, a bureaucrat at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which is nicknamed the "ministry where people routinely work overtime."
 "But recently, that mood has disappeared," he said.
 One factor is that employees are seeing that the lifetime employment system, which provided security in exchange for loyalty, has been weakened by the prolonged slump.
 Many companies have introduced flexible working hours and merit pay systems, so that employees are now evaluated on their accomplishments, not merely on the basis of seniority or hours worked. And companies are now saying that well-rested employees are more valuable than stressed-out ones.
 "It used to be the person who stayed in the office the whole time was considered a good employee," said Junzo Ishino, a spokesman for Mitsubishi Motors. "Now a good employee is considered one who can take a vacation." The auto company requires its employees to take at least three consecutive weekdays off once a year.
 Still, the change is gradual. Asked how many vacation days he took last year, Mr. Ishino hesitantly replied, "not so many." And some Japanese workers say that despite what their employers say, pressures remain to work late and to skip vacations.
 "I took 16 days of the 44 I was owed and went to Australia last year," said one office worker at a major electronics company. "It was regarded as a kind of scandal."
 The Government's goal is an average of 1,800 working hours a year by the fiscal year that ends in March 1997. With two years to go and 100 work hours to cut, the goal does not look achievable.
 At the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, average working hours have already fallen, to 1,802 in the year that ended in March 1994, compared with 2,050 four years earlier. The company achieved the reduction by cutting overtime, shortening the workday by 15 minutes, increasing vacations and introducing sabbaticals.
 To cut hours -- and save money -- many companies have established no-overtime days, also called "refresh days," usually on Wednesdays.
 "They literally lock the doors at 8 so you really have to leave the office," an employee of a major bank said. At the headquarters of NEC, the electronics company, computers shut off the lights at 7 P.M. on Wednesdays.
 Some employees say they have come to like the system. "I can make appointments for sure on Wednesdays," said Ayako Imai, a 23-year-old office worker for the Kuwayama Jewelry Company.
By March 1997, companies with 30 or more employees will have to institute a 40-hour workweek. To help companies cut hours, the Government is offering subsidies to pay for labor-saving technology or for the hiring of extra workers.
 Most big companies and Government agencies already have a five-day week, while small companies still usually work on Saturdays.
 Paid vacation days have increased, too, with big companies now giving about 20 days a year. The challenge is getting people to take those days.
 In Japanese companies, in which employees often work in teams, it has been considered an imposition on colleagues to take a long vacation. It can also be seen as a lack of dedication.
 Suffering from an acute need to rest, people instead take off on national holidays, when it is socially acceptable to stay away from work. A result is huge traffic jams and crowded resorts on those occasions.
 Some companies have started using sign-up sheets to get employees to take their vacations. Many big companies are also offering what are called "refresh vacations" -- short sabbaticals for veteran workers, often accompanied by some money to help them have a good time. At Ricoh, the office equipment maker, employees in their 20th year get an extra 10 days off and 200,000 yen, or about $2,400.
 Responding to such programs and Government exhortations, Japanese workers now take an average of 56 percent of their vacation days, up from 50 percent a few years ago.
 The Government has also been increasing the number of holidays. There are already 14 national holidays, compared with 10 Federal holidays in the United States, and another one, Ocean Day, will be added next year. Many companies supplement the holidays by closing for extra days around New Year's Day, the middle of August and the first week of May. This year, some companies will be adding a few days to the early May holiday, which begins on Saturday, because business is slow.
 But further moves to cut working hours are starting to find opposition. "As the five-day workweek proliferates, some people feel that they don't need any more holidays," said Shunichi Ando, a Labor Ministry official.
 With pay increases crimped by the economic slump, some workers want more overtime pay. And companies have cut many workers in the recession, increasing the workload on those who remain.
 Companies are also resisting additional moves toward shorter hours. "We are already in a situation where Japan's labor hours are not particularly long," said Shigeru Hasegawa, manager of the personnel management division of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations.
 Executives say Japan's competitiveness has been hurt because wages have not been reduced even as the workweek has been shortened and vacation days increased.
 "We went from one Saturday off a month to two Saturdays last year," said Takashi Kuroiwa, manager of a printing shop in Tokyo. "Our productivity was lower and our delivery time lengthened."

HEADLINE: A Traditional Coalition Shows Signs of Wear

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, April 28

 BODY:
With his defection to the Republican Party earlier this month, Representative Nathan Deal of Georgia left a sharp tear in the tattered biracial coalition that many had once thought could save the Democratic Party in the South.
In switching parties, the Congressman from the hilly country of north Georgia had little effect on the balance of power in his state's House delegation, serving only to tip it further toward the Republican Party. But the shift by Mr. Deal, who is white, left a stark racial contrast: now all eight Republican Representatives are white and all three Democrats are black. 
 While Mr. Deal, who was first elected to Congress in 1992, undoubtedly did not set out to create such a racial split, analysts and some officials found the results unsettling.
"This is obviously troubling for the long-term implications for the biracial coalition," said David Bositis, an analyst with the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington group that focuses on political trends involving blacks and other minorities nationally. "It is still out there in a number of Congressional districts in the South, but it is tenuous. And the dissolution of multiracial politics in the South would be unwholesome and in the long term harmful."
Mr. Deal's district has historically been one of the state's whitest Congressional districts, with a voting-age population that is only 3 percent black. Mr. Deal and his Democratic predecessors, unlike many of their Southern colleagues, rarely had to juggle the concerns of entrenched whites with those of a surging black electorate.
Merle Black, a political scientist at Emory University who has written several books on Southern politics, suggests that race had little to do with Mr. Deal's decision.
"The motivation for his switch was more because his district was voting increasingly heavily Republican in Presidential races and getting disenchanted with the direction that people like Richard Gephardt were taking the national Democrats," Mr. Black said. Mr. Gephardt, of Missouri, is the House minority leader.
Nevertheless, he said, Mr. Deal's switch had sharp racial implications, sketching a state Congressional delegation that mirrored a deepening racial polarization in the South.
While a decade ago, nearly all the Congressional seats in Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina were held by Democrats, 19 of the 36 seats are now held by white Republicans, 9 by white Democrats and 8 by black Democrats. And in most of those districts represented by white Democrats -- as well as in Mr. Deal's -- Republican Presidential candidates have received more votes than their Democratic opponents in the last two elections.
After Mr. Deal announced his decision, one of the state's black Democratic House members, Representative Cynthia McKinney, expressed satisfaction and said that Democrats did not need any "worried warriors" like him.
Many white Democrats in the region were either silent or openly sympathetic to Mr. Deal. Representative Mike Parker of Mississippi, for instance, said the move was simply a reflection of the frustration and anger that conservative Southern Democrats, himself included, felt about the direction of the party.
Mr. Parker, a three-term Congressman from Jackson whose district is 41 percent black, stopped short of saying that he, too, was likely to bolt the party, but warned that Democrats nationally were likely to find that black voters in the South are more conservative and willing to try different approaches than many think.
"We have been telling them that," Mr. Parker said, "but they still don't get it."
It is the concentration of black voters after the Congressional redistricting in 1990 that many point to as crucial in the growing Republican dominance. In Georgia, for example, in all but one of six seats that have shifted to Republican from Democratic over the last two elections, the percentage of the voting-age population that is black declined after the districts were redrawn.
And by the same token, as Mr. Black pointed out, those same districts were increasingly willing to vote Republican, giving majorities to George Bush in 1988 and 1992.
For now all of these "short-term factors" in the region favor greater Republican gains, Mr. Black said. But he added that short-term factors by definition never last forever.
Even Mr. Deal's seemingly provident switch could ultimately bite him. Local Republicans -- who charged that the change in parties was "brokered in Washington" by Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia, without consulting them -- said that Mr. Deal was likely to face opposition in the next Republican primary.
"It's not a 100 percent love fest up here," said State Representative Steven Lyle Stancil, a Republican and potential challenger. "A lot of people feel like it was unfair to those who had labored in the vineyards. Nathan isn't out of harm's way by a long shot."

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 6.57 to a Record After Recouping Early Loss

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks recovered from early losses yesterday to push the Dow Jones industrial average to another record high.
The rally was led by big cylical companies like General Motors, Alcoa and Caterpillar on expectations that interest rates would remain stable. 
 "Worldwide economic growth is strong and the dollar is weak enough for demand to enhance earnings growth of multinational companies," said Phil Schettewi, chief portfolio strategist at Loomis Sayles in Washington, which manages $2.5 billion.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.57 points yesterday, to 4,321.27, its 22d record high this year. "The Dow is hitting new highs every day," said Kenneth Ducey, director of trading at BT Brokerage. "People are starting to look through rose-colored glasses -- not looking at 4,300, but at 4,500 now."
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.16 points, to 514.71, its 24th high this year. The Nasdaq composite index rose 3.03 points, to 843.98, its third consecutive high.
Among stocks moving the market yesterday, shares of Procter & Gamble rose, lifting the shares of other household-product makers, after the company reported strong third-quarter earnings on Thursday. Yesterday, a Merrill Lynch analyst, Deepak Raj, raised his fiscal 1995 and 1996 earnings estimates for the company. P.& G. shares rose 1 5/8, to 69 7/8. Scott Paper shared the good news, rising 1 1/2, to 89 1/8. Clorox climbed 1 1/8, to 58 3/4.
The Bell stocks rose after the seven regional telephone companies won approval to offer nationwide long-distance cellular services -- an important step for the Bells in their quest to enter the long-distance market. Ameritech jumped 5/8, to 44 3/4. BellSouth rose 5/8, to 61 1/8.
Chrysler gained 1 3/8, to 43 1/4, after Kirk Kerkorian said he had hired D. F. King & Company in New York to solicit proxies from Chrysler shareholders, possibly setting the stage for a proxy fight. Ford Motor gained 1/4, to 27 1/8, while General Motors rose 1 5/8, to 45 1/8.
CBS rose 3 1/2 to 64 3/4. Dan Dorfman, the financial correspondent for the CNBC cable channel, said there was speculation on Wall Street that Westinghouse might be interested in buying CBS for $80 a share. Both companies declined to comment on the report. Westinghouse was unchanged at 15.
Shares of gold mining companies sank after gold prices fell, reversing earlier gains. Newmont Mining slid 1 1/8, to 41 7/8, and Placer Dome was down 7/8, to 23 3/4.
Intel continued to lead technology shares higher, joined by Microsoft, which rebounded from Thursday's fall.
Intel set the pace, posting its fifth consecutive record high. After the market closed on Thursday, Intel announced a 2-for-1 stock split and said it would increase its dividend to 4 cents a share from 3 cents after the split. Intel climbed 1 3/4, to 102 3/8.
Microsoft rebounded from its decline on Thursday, when the Justice Department filed an antitrust suit to block the company's proposed acquisition of Intuit. Microsoft shares rose 3 1/8 yesterday to 81 3/4 and Intuit fell 5, to 67 3/4.
Among the technology shares that faltered were Cyrix, which slipped 2 1/2, to 23 3/4, after analysts expressed concern about whether the semiconductor company would ship its new high-end products, which will compete with Intel microprocessors.
Gateway 2000 lost after it warned that component shortages might hurt earnings this quarter. The personal computer maker announced first-quarter earnings that matched analysts' forecasts. Its shares slid 25/16 , to 1815/16 .
In Japan, stocks ended the week lower in lackluster trading. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed down 77.24 points, or five-tenths of 1 percent, at 16,806.75

HEADLINE: Kamp-Lintfort Journal;
Once-Mighty Miners Now Have Backs to the Wall

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: KAMP-LINTFORT, Germany

 BODY:
This town in the Ruhr Valley, with its immaculate streets, tidy brick row houses, bright flowers and modern cars seems a long way away from its American counterpart, a run-down West Virginia coal-mining town.
But then the German coal industry is perhaps different from that in any other country. Not only are German miners the highest paid, earning on average almost $40,000 a year. They also produce the most expensive coal in the world. 
 Here, thousands of feet underground, Ruhrkohle A.G., owner of the Kamp-Lintfort mine, spends $200 to extract a ton of the hard black rock used to fuel Germany's electric power plants. The world price is more like $60. What that means is that Germany and its taxpayers pay about $7 billion to subsidize the 52 million tons of hard coal produced yearly in this country.
But Kamp-Lintfort's combination of working-class affluence and seven-hour workdays along a 1,000-foot coal face is at risk as the Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl struggles to maintain such costly subsidies in the face of rising political opposition and a populace showing the first signs of weariness with Germany's high tax rate.
"Germany still needs a coal industry to make sure it has its own source of energy," Werner Flegel, a 47-year-old miner, said as he took a break during his shift some 3,300 feet under Kamp-Lintfort. "This is not just a question of the German people supporting 90,000 coal miners and their families. It's a matter of national security."
Defenders of the security argument note that Germany has no oil and no interest in being hostage to oil shocks of the kind that emanated from the Middle East in the 1970's. But more and more, as world energy prices have declined or remained stable, and the country has obtained new sources of soft coal in the former East Germany that can be strip-mined at a much lower cost, that logic has seemed worn.
Miners find they are fighting harder than ever to hold onto public support, with critics describing them as "leeches" because of the huge subsidies they enjoy.
They have had to argue on the basis of local political impact, contending that shutting down the mines would create enormous social dislocation and pain.
They say they are not as affluent as many think, noting that they have accepted pay cuts and other reductions in their benefits that have dropped them from the eighth highest paid workers in Germany to No. 48.
But they are concerned that the Government will renege on its promises to continue large subsidies, destroying an industry that has already seen its payroll shrink to 95,000, from 600,000 in the mid-1950's.
"Our sons are not coming into the business," said another miner, Dieter Ernst, 42. "And those who can are looking to change jobs. We're probably the last real generation of coal miners."
Ulrike Platen, a 34-year-old worker at Ruhrkohle, worried that the character of Kamp-Lintfort would be changed, and she joined in a five-week sit-in at a local church to dramatize the miners' plight.
"This town must not become a dormitory for people working in Dusseldorf or elsewhere," she said.
Political tensions began to heat up in December, when Germany's constitutional court ruled that the so-called kohlepfennig, a fee levied on all electric bills, was unconstitutional and that revenues for the coal subsidy had to come out of general Government taxes. Immediately, debate began over whether to impose new taxes or cut the Government subsidy. Taxes were to jump anyway in 1995 by more than 10 percent.
Mr. Kohl's Christian Democrats and the opposition Social Democrats supported a new tax. But the tiny Free Democratic Party, a vital member of Mr. Kohl's governing coalition, threatened to pull out if new taxes were imposed. And Mr. Kohl gave in, at least temporarily, meaning that to support the coal miners other Government programs will have to be cut.
Moreover, until early April the Kohl Government refused to pay 1995 subsidies on hard coal production by such companies as Ruhrkohle, trying to put pressure on the states, which also reap enormous social benefits from the subsidies, to pay a larger share.
Industry officials and miners warn that though the Government eventually reached an agreement with the states, the political jockeying is far from over. Germany faces the highest levels of unemployment in decades. The strong German mark is all but certain to dampen exports, restricting economic growth.
And now every year during the budget debate in the Kohl Government, the industry subsidies will be a potential target of its opponents.
"Next year we may be in the same position again," said Elke Weiler, a coal worker here who was part of the church sit-in. "It's nothing to be happy with."
Using an old-time German expression, Mr. Platen added, "The cow is not safely off the ice."

HEADLINE: Japan Jobless Rate at Postwar High

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 28

 BODY:
Japan's unemployment rate hit a postwar high of 2.9 percent in the fiscal year that ended on March 31, the Government said today in the latest reflection of the nation's prolonged economic slowdown.
 The unemployment rate was 2.6 percent the previous fiscal year. 
 The latest reading was the highest since 1953, when the Government adopted the current method for computing unemployment data. The previous high of 2.8 percent was recorded in fiscal 1986 and 1987.
 The rates would be much higher if calculated by United States or European methods. In Japan, people who work more than one hour in the last week of a month and all members of the armed forces are counted as employed.
 A five-year economic slump and the persistent rise of the yen against other currencies have squeezed the job market as many manufacturers shift production overseas, where labor and other costs are cheaper.
 A Government official said the effects of the earthquake that struck Kobe in January helped nudge the monthly rate a tenth of a percentage point higher in March, to 3 percent.

One recent afternoon, Barry R. Freedman, the director of Mount Sinai Hospital, traveled to Westchester to speak with administrators and physicians at a hospital there about becoming part of the Manhattan medical center's growing health care network.
 As he emerged from the meeting into the reception area, Mr. Freedman bumped into an old friend, Dr. Spencer Foreman, director of the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, who was there to make a similar bid on behalf of his hospital. Like two door-to-door salesmen arriving at the same house, the two laughed, nervously. 
 By trying to woo the suburban hospital, both men were hoping to secure one of its most valuable assets: its patients.
 With managed care cutting the amount of money that insurers pay for hospital services, administrators of major medical centers in New York City are scrambling to find new pipelines for patients.
 But rather than reaching out directly to individual patients -- whose choices of doctors and hospitals have become more limited because of managed care -- hospitals are aggressively promoting themselves instead to health care providers with large volumes of patients: health maintenance organizations, insurers, smaller hospitals, and clinics and doctors groups.
 The patients are referred to variously as "covered lives," "potential revenue sources" or just plain "bodies," and hospital executives say that they need to serve more of them to keep their institutions afloat.
 "What you have on now is a hunt for bodies," said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University.
 "We like to use the word 'position,' " said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association. "What hospitals here are doing is positioning ourselves to maximize potential in this move toward a market orientation, which is coming now with a vengeance."
 The search for patients is one of the many signs of how the health care landscape in New York has changed in recent years in a somewhat belated response to the surge of managed care across the country. Regional hospitals that just a few years ago tried to insure their survival by seeking out affiliations with large medical centers now find themselves pursued because of their access to patients.
 But the pursuit goes beyond the regional hospitals. Many large medical centers are reaching out to virtually every link along the health care delivery chain in the hope that it will increase the number of patients who come through their doors.
 And in some cases the hospitals are reaching out to the H.M.O.'s that they shunned only a few years ago in resistance to the whole concept of managed care.
 Hospitals are choosing different strategies for building up these bigger patient bases. Some are buying smaller hospitals or large doctors' offices outside the city. Beth Israel Medical Center, for example, bought a chain of doctors' offices 18 months ago in Westchester; the chain serves more than 150,000 patients, who are now referred almost exclusively to Beth Israel when they need surgery or other advanced care.
 Others are forming affiliations that nudge but don't force patients their way. Mount Sinai, for one, has formed a health system network that includes 22 hospitals, long-term care centers and physicians' groups in the metropolitan area and Florida, in the expectation that doctors in the affiliates will send patients their way.
 And some hospitals have joined together to form looser alliances that offer a wide range of services, locations and medical specialization to the health maintenance organizations that control the gates to so many patients. Montefiore Medical Center, for example, joined with a group of five hospitals to appeal to one insurer and teamed up with a different group of institutions to close a deal with another.
 "There are a variety of mechanisms," said Gerard F. Anderson, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Hospital Finance and Management. "But there is one goal: to maintain and build patient volume."
 Dr. Foreman said that Montefiore was "in touch with insurance companies, other institutions, physicians constantly, every day, trying to expand our reach."
 "Underlying this is not the relationship of hospital to hospital," he explained. "The linkages are promoted in order to induce doctors who practice at smaller hospitals and H.M.O.'s to send patients who need a different level of care to us."
 The competition is fierce. Of a dozen hospital administrators who were interviewed, all refused to go into any detail about the way they pitch their hospitals to potential affiliates, and they gave only brief outlines of the deals they have made with other providers.
 In fact, Dr. Foreman and Mr. Freedman declined to name the Westchester hospital where they unexpectedly crossed paths, each fearing that doing so might jeopardize a successful courtship.
 "People who used to be colleagues are now either partners or competitors," Dr. Foreman said.
 Many of the objects of this desire are grinning over their newly found popularity, having been long shunned by major medical centers resistant to managed care and to associating with colleagues at less prestigious institutions.
 "In 1987, I would have loved to have had Mount Sinai or some of these other places on our panel," said Thomas A. Travers, vice president for health care delivery, contracting and network development for Oxford Health Plan, one of the fastest growing managed care companies in New York. "They would listen cordially; then they would remind us who they were and that they didn't need us. Now that we have over 353,000 covered lives, I get at least three calls a day from people and facilities in the greater New York area making a pitch to us."
 Some of the presentations are slick, said Mr. Travers and other administrators of health care companies. They described promotions offering slides, brochures and handshakes with celebrity specialists, like surgeons who work on world-famous transplant teams. Others use a more homespun touch, with the suitors talking over cups of tea and simple handouts about being like a family or a community.
 What all the overtures have in common is that they are initiated and handled by high-level executives at the major medical centers. "This is the future of our hospital and has to be handled at the highest levels," said Peter A. Kelly, executive vice president for operations at Beth Israel. "It demonstrates interest and intent and offers the best source for information."
 But while the sought-after doctors' groups, hospitals, insurance companies and H.M.O.'s know that they have a lucrative asset in their patients, they also realize that the major medical centers that pursue them have benefits to offer in return. Among the lures they dangle are low-interest loans, consultations with world-renowned specialists, prestige and academic posts for staff members.
 "A lot of doctors are insecure in this climate and want to be part of a bigger institution rather than being self-employed," said John P. McGovern, a health care consultant for the consulting firm of Ernst & Young.
 For Doctors' Hospital of Staten Island, an affiliation with Beth Israel Medical Center has brought several advantages to a 117-bed community hospital. In exchange for referring all its cardiology and other speciality care patients, Doctors' Hospital gets to use the medical center's laboratory and radiology services at reduced rates and now sends its staff members to Beth Israel for management and professional seminars. In addition, the hospital has an entree to H.M.O.'s and managed care companies that had given little notice before to a small, local hospital.
 Before the affiliation, Doctors' Hospital was not on the panel of a single insurance company; it is now associated with four.
 "We gave them a conduit to patients," said Stephen N. F. Anderson, executive director of Doctors' Hospital. "And they gave us a conduit to specialists that we never had before and to penetrate the managed care market."
 The big hospitals use different methods for scouting out new sources of patients. They rely both on casual suggestions through word of mouth and sophisticated analysis of data on the patients who already use their services: Where do they come from? What are the major doctors' practices there? Are there other areas in the region with similar demographics where people are not using the hospital? What are the institutions there?
 "The first thing you have to do is understand your market share," said Mr. Freedman of Mount Sinai. "Then you try to figure out what your opportunities are to preserve that market and penetrate others. To form a strategy of where other opportunities lie, we do a demographic and geographic analysis. Then we start to look at provider profiles that might exist in those areas."
 This "zoning in" as he called it, often involves questioning Mount Sinai staff members about certain doctors or clinics in the suburban communities where they live. "We have actually gone to the Yellow Pages just to get an understanding of the possibilities," he said.
 "The patients are there," he added. "We just have to find a way to them."

HEADLINE: Queens Man Is Accused In Bar Killing

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
A Queens man shot and killed a fellow bar patron, then barricaded himself inside the bar for seven hours before police officers stormed the place early yesterday -- only to find him asleep, the police said.
 The suspect, Frank Napolitano, 60, of 130-32 117th Street in Ozone Park, Queens, has a long criminal history dating to 1952, when he served about six years at the Sing Sing Correctional Facility for killing a man in Brooklyn, according to the Queens District Attorney's office. 
 Yesterday, Mr. Napolitano was charged with second-degree murder, criminal possession of a weapon and attempted murder, said Mary de Bourbon, a spokeswoman for the Queens District Attorney.
 Mr. Napolitano was arrested about 2:30 A.M. yesterday inside the Winners Circle Bar on Rockaway Boulevard in Queens.
 The incident began when Mr. Napolitano got into an argument with the victim, Brian O'Connor, 37, of 105-27 91st Street in Woodhaven, the police said.
 The police said Mr. Napolitano had been asked to leave the bar early Thursday evening after drinking for most of the day and becoming boisterous. He left, but returned about 15 minutes later with a gun, they said, adding that about 7:30 P.M. he fired five times at Mr. O'Connor while eight other people fled the bar.
 Police officers who arrived were met with gunfire as they tried to enter the bar, though none was hurt. They backed out and called the hostage negotiating team. More than 50 officers cordoned off several blocks around the bar.
 The ensuing seven-hour standoff snarled traffic and forced residents to stay off the street. Customers inside a Home Depot across the street had to stay in the store. At 2:30 A.M. the police said, they finally stormed the building and found Mr. Napolitano asleep.
 Mr. O'Connor, a bus maintenance worker, was found dead on the floor of the bar, with several gunshot wounds. He worked at the Kingsbridge bus depot in the Bronx for nine years.
 Mr. Napolitano "had been drinking since earlier in the day," Deputy Chief Lawrence Loesch said. The police reached him by telephone during the standoff, he said, but "he'd talk to us and he'd fade out."
 During the negotiations, Mr. Napolitano voiced anger against the Federal Government and mentioned the bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, said Sgt. Kerry Schreiner of the hostage negotiating team. The sergeant did not elaborate, but there was no indication that there was any political motive in the shooting.
 Mr. Napolitano, an unemployed carpenter, was treated at Jamaica Hospital for a cut to the head and intoxication.
 Besides the 1952 murder, Ms. de Bourbon said, Mr. Napolitano's criminal record includes a 1967 conviction for gun possession, a five-year prison term in 1970 on a conspiracy and weapons conviction and a 1982 charge of attempted murder that was dismissed when the victim died of natural causes before the case went to trial.
 Yesterday, Mr. Napolitano said nothing as he was led out of the 106th Precinct station house. He was wearing blue hospital garb and had a large bruise near his temple.

HEADLINE: U.S. Rebuffs Japanese Overture To Limit Scope of Auto Talks

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
Senior Administration officials today rebuffed an overture from Japanese trade negotiators to limit the scope of auto trade talks, as American negotiators continued to draft a list of possible Japanese targets for American trade sanctions.
 Laura Tyson, the head of President Clinton's National Economic Council, said tonight that the officials had unanimously agreed to insist on progress on all three sticking points in the trade talks, and not just on two out of three issues, as urged by the Japanese. 
 Japanese officials have taken a conciliatory position on increasing the number of Japanese car dealers that carry American vehicles, and on relaxing regulations for auto inspections and repairs in Japan so that more American spare parts can be used. But they have objected to American requests that targets be set for additional Japanese purchases of parts for the assembly of new cars.
 Ms. Tyson said that all three issues would have to be resolved. "That was the strong consensus decision within the group," she said.
 American trade officials are drafting a list of Japanese car parts and some consumer products on which the United States would threaten to apply stiff punitive tariffs if the trade talks do not produce an agreement. A trade consultant who insisted on anonymity said tonight that as much as $7 billion to $9 billion of annual Japanese imports could end up on the threat list. Any actual sanctions, however, would subsequently be applied to considerably less than half of these goods.
 Ms. Tyson refused to accept questions on what the United States might do if Japan rejected its demands. "I'm not going to discuss any of the options that we discussed today," she said.
 American and Japanese negotiators are scheduled to hold further talks next week in Vancouver, British Columbia. The United States team will be led by the Administration's top trade official, Mickey Kantor. Administration officials with responsibility for Japan trade policy will meet again at the end of next week to review their options, Ms. Tyson said.

HEADLINE: ECONOMY SLOWED TO 2.8% GROWTH IN FIRST QUARTER

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
The economy slowed to a 2.8 percent rate of growth in the first three months of 1995, the Government reported today. That was well below the 5.1 percent pace of expansion in the fourth quarter of 1994 as consumers paused after a year-end spending spree.
The fourth-quarter pace was about twice as fast as could be sustained without causing inflation to heat up, and economists generally welcomed today's report. 
 "This economy is still growing," said Michael L. Penzer, vice president and senior economist at the Bank of America. Because of the slowdown in consumer spending in the first quarter, inventories of unsold goods swelled by the biggest amount in a decade. Still, Mr. Penzer added, the inventory buildup is not so large as many had feared, and there are signs that auto makers and other companies have already set about paring them.
The Clinton Administration quickly hailed the report on the gross domestic product, the nation's output of all goods and services, which showed that growth was the slowest since the summer of 1993.
"The expansion continues while the economy moves to a more sustainable long-run growth rate," Joseph E. Stiglitz and Martin N. Baily, senior economic advisers at the White House, declared in a joint statement. "Strong, noninflationary growth, concentrated in investment and the private sector, gives this period one of the best macroeconomic performances in recent history."
Private analysts were more cautious in their praise; many suggested the desired slowdown from overrapid growth -- 4.1 percent for 1994 as a whole -- might prove uncomfortably abrupt. Even though the slowdown was greater than analysts had expected, few saw any significant risk that the economy would skid into recession. The slowdown results from the Federal Reserve's efforts to brake the economy by pushing up interest rates seven times since early last year.
At the same time, companies have stepped up an already breakneck rate of investment in new equipment and buildings, a phenomenon that analysts said should keep the economy moving satisfactorily until consumer spending picks up in the next few months.
"I expect the consumer to come back in the second half" of the year, said Richard Aspinwall, senior vice president and chief economist at the Chase Manhattan Bank. He cited solid job growth, increased consumer confidence and a recent decline in long-term interest rates.
Today's G.D.P. report by the Commerce Department also showed a moderate uptick in inflation, but no more than economists had expected. Most said the Federal Reserve was likely to be pleased with the way the economy had slowed without stalling, thereby limiting upward pressure on prices.
Securities markets showed little reaction to the data on G.D.P. Instead, traders focused on a separate report by corporate purchasing managers in the Chicago area that showed surprising industrial strength in the Midwest, taken by some as previewing national purchasing results to be published on Monday. Since the rise in the Chicago-area index, to 57.6 for April from 55 in March, contrasted sharply with a survey last week by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, bond prices eased. Stocks initially fell with bonds but subsequently recovered.
A report by New York purchasing managers, also published today, showed that the overall pace of business weakened in April, with the index of current conditions slipping to 47.2 after a March spurt. The manufacturing component, however, advanced sharply to the highest point since October.
In still another indicator, the University of Michigan's index of consumer confidence edged down to 92.5 for April from 93.8 at its interim reading in mid-month. The March figure was 90.3.
Mr. Aspinwall predicted that the economy would grow as much as 2 percent in the current quarter and 2.5 to 3 percent in the second half of the year. "Inventories have been unusually low relative to sales," he said.
Goods that are produced but not yet sold are counted as part of G.D.P., making inventories a major swing factor in tabulations of economic growth.
Large stocks tend to lead eventually to production cutbacks, but analysts say that even after four straight quarters of sizable increases -- the latest, $63 billion at an annual rate, is the biggest -- inventories are still not a major burden.
Consumers did little during the first quarter to bolster the economy. Personal spending rose at a rate of just 1.4 percent, far below the 5.1 percent splurge in the October-December period.
This meant that the sector that accounts for two-thirds of G.D.P. -- $3.64 trillion of $5.47 trillion at the first-quarter rate -- accounted for only one-third of the growth and contributed only enough to offset the contraction from the import-export sector. Exports actually fell slightly after a big advance, with shipments to Mexico down enough to trim G.D.P. by perhaps two-tenths of a point, one official estimated.
With the various negatives, including another decline in purchases by the Federal Government, David Bostian, economist at Herzog, Heine, Geduld, cautioned that the economy "may hit the runway a little bit harder" than the hoped-for soft landing sought by policy makers, but he predicted there would be no recessionary "crackup."
Corporate investment in new equipment grew at a sizzling annual rate of 20.8 percent that included all subgroups, the report also showed, while nonresidential structures climbed at a 14.1 percent rate.
Among prices related to output, the G.D.P. deflator showed a 2.2 percent inflation rate in the first quarter, up from 1.3 percent in the final months of last year. The fixed-weight price index for domestic purchases, which in contrast to the deflator does not reflect shifts in the composition of output, rose to 2.8 percent from 2.6 percent.
G.D.P. expressed in current dollars rather than in constant 1987 dollars, advanced at a 5.1 percent pace in the latest period, down from 6.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1994.
Reflecting lower spending by consumers, the savings rate -- personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income -- moved up to 5.2 percent from 4.6 percent, the department also reported.
Data included in the gross domestic product for the fourth quarter of 1994 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates.

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Weaken on Some Upbeat Economic Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were weaker yesterday after economic data on manufacturing and consumer sentiment failed to confirm that economic growth was slowing enough to allay fears of inflation.
The Government reported yesterday that economic growth slowed to a 2.8 percent pace in the first three months of 1995, from 5.1 percent in the previous quarter. Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Bank in Pittsburgh, noted that the data showed a moderation in economic growth nearer to the level sought by the Federal Reserve, while inflation held steady at around 3 percent. 
 But the effects of the Government's report were undermined by independent data showing strength in manufacturing in the Chicago area and in consumer sentiment.
The price of the 30-year bond slipped 1/32 of a percentage point, to 103 17/32 , leaving its yield unchanged at 7.33 percent. Prices of shorter- maturity bills and intermediate-term notes were weaker. The yield on the one-year bill rose 6 basis points, to 5.91 percent, and the yield on a five-year note rose 4 basis points, to 6.87 percent. Yields and prices move in opposite directions; a basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Traders focused on the Chicago Purchasing Management Association's index for April, which rose to 57.6 from 55 in March, a sharper rise than expected.
The Chicago index is often viewed as a prelude to the report by the National Association of Purchasing Managers, which is scheduled to be released on Monday. The Chicago report showed strength in manufacturing in the upper Midwest, contrasting sharply with the regional weakness seen in a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia last week.
Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, noted that all the components of the Chicago index -- except for supplier deliveries and prices paid -- registered increases during April. "The data, nevertheless, indicate a deceleration in activity relative to 1994," she said.
One trader said yesterday: "The purchasing management report doesn't necessarily signal a resurgence in manufacturing around the country. But has the economy slowed? Yes. Has it stopped? No."
In another sign of economic strength, the University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment rose to 92.5 in April from 90.3 in March.
Mr. Hoffman of PNC Bank noted that some of the strength in yesterday's data showed that the deceleration in the economy was not a free fall. "Over the last couple of months, everything has been down," Mr. Hoffman said. "What today's report did was remind the market that things can go up."
He added, "The slow rise in consumer confidence and the Chicago purchasing managers' index in April confirm that the slowdown is not snowballing into something worse."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
In Thin Trading, Dollar Rallies Against the Mark and the Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rallied against the German mark and the Japanese yen yesterday in thin, choppy trading.
Some currency dealers attributed the advance to growing perceptions that the American economy could strengthen later this year and to resilient hopes after this week's meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations that there may be some coordinated international effort to bolster the dollar. Technical factors also helped the dollar, dealers said. 
 The volume of trading was light, exaggerating movements, ahead of holidays in Europe and Japan. Monday is a national holiday in much of Europe, and next week is the Golden Week of holidays in Japan.
But traders said the advance yesterday was significant and suggested a possible shift in underlying sentiment about the anemic dollar.
"We're closing on a very positive note for the end of the week," said Paul Alley, assistant vice president at the foreign exchange desk of the New York branch of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan. Still, "this whole thing could disappear Monday," he said. "If there's no follow-through buying, this was an aberration."
The dollar rose as high as 1.3945 marks, its highest level since April 13, before settling in late New York trading at 1.3874 marks, up from 1.3785 marks on Thursday. The dollar climbed to 84.26 yen, from 83.68 yen. For the week, the dollar was up 1.77 percent against the yen, its biggest one-week gain in four months.
The dollar initially weakened on a Government report that the United States economy's growth rate fell to 2.8 percent in the first three months of the year, the weakest since the summer of 1993. But dollar buyers emerged and the currency zigzagged higher throughout the rest of the day.
The dollar was further bolstered by a report from the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago that pointed to strong economic growth in April.
"We've overdone the view that the U.S. economy is weakening," said John Rothfield, a currency market analyst with the Chicago office of Nationsbank.
The dollar was helped further yesterday by traders who had sold the dollar short, or bet the dollar would fall. When the dollar began rising instead, they had to buy dollars to minimize their losses, which created a big run-up in the dollar's value late in the day.
"The dollar went through certain levels, and this initiated the move in the dollar all the way up to 139.50 marks," said Jesse Torres, chief dealer at the New York branch of Bank Austria. "Once everyone cleaned out their short positions, some sellers moved in."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Lumber Prices Decline Sharply; Gasoline Rises to 3-Year High

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Lumber prices fell sharply yesterday as yards unloaded inventories because of the weak housing market.
"A lot of wholesalers and yards bought lumber last week to plug holes in their inventories, but now everyone seems to be concentrating on just selling what they've got," said Curt Cunningham, president of the Pacific Futures Trading Company in Eugene, Ore. "There's no new business out there to justify any price increases." 
 On other commodity markets, gasoline prices rose. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities fell 0.16 point, to 235.30.
May lumber fell $3.40, to $254.40 for 1,000 board feet, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the lowest price since July 1993.
Higher mortgage rates have dampened growth in home sales, leaving bulging inventories at companies that stocked up on lumber in anticipation of a seasonal surge in construction. About 70 percent of the lumber produced in North America is used in the construction industry.
"Right now, it seems like all segments of the lumber business have slowed," said Gene Walters, general lumber sales manager with Willamette Industries Inc., a forest and paper products company in Portland, Ore.
Gasoline rose to the highest price in nearly three years as companies bought the expiring May contract as a way to secure supplies, which some analysts say will not be sufficient to meet demand.
American gasoline inventories fell last week and now are 3 percent smaller than a year ago, even as refiners increased gasoline production and total output to the highest rate since early January, according to the American Petroleum Institute.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, unleaded gasoline for May delivery rose 0.37 cent, to 65.33 cents a gallon, the highest price since June 1992. June crude oil slipped 5 cents, to $20.38 a barrel, while the expiring May heating oil contract lost 0.07 cent, to 51.19 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Replacement Umpires Called Out in Toronto

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Baseball management suffered another legal loss yesterday when the Ontario Labor Board ruled that the American League cannot use replacement umpires for Blue Jays games in Toronto.
 The league received one break: The board made the decision effective next Wednesday, after the Blue Jays' current homestand ends, meaning neither the league nor the team faces a problem until the Yankees play at the Skydome on May 9. 
 "This will give the parties an opportunity to consider their legal and collective bargaining positions prior to the Blue Jays' return to Toronto later in May," the board's decision said.
 The 64 major league umpires have been locked out since Jan. 1. The American and National Leagues took that step when their collective bargaining agreement with the umpires expired. Replacement umpires worked all exhibition games and have worked the games since the season began Tuesday night.
 Ontario provincial law prohibits the use of replacement workers during a strike or a lockout. When the players were on strike, and it appeared that the owners were going to start the season with replacement players, the Blue Jays planned to play their home games at their spring training site in Dunedin, Fla.
 League lawyers had argued that the law didn't apply to the American League because it was not a Canadian employer. But the board found, after a two-day hearing, that not only was the use of replacements unlawful, but the lockout was also unlawful.
 Richie Phillips, the umpires' lawyer, was delighted at the outcome, saying he hoped "this monumental victory for the umpires will pave the way for a total resolution" of the dispute.
 In the dispute over salaries and other economic issues, the two sides are an estimated $10 million apart over what would be the four-year term of a new agreement.
 Speaking of the Ontario ruling, the leagues' negotiator, Robert Kheel, said, "In practical terms it has no effect at all until the next homestand, by which time we can make whatever arrangements are appropriate, either with the association or by use of other creative legal procedures."
 If no settlement is reached by May 9, the league may tell the umpires association four of its members can work Blue Jays home games. But Phillips has said that would be a selective end to the lockout, and would not be legal.

HEADLINE: The High Court Loses Restraint

 BODY:
In deciding that Congress lacks the power to outlaw gun possession within 1,000 feet of a school, the Supreme Court has taken an unfortunate historical turn and needlessly questioned previously settled law.
Chief Justice William Rehnquist mustered a 5-to-4 majority for this brake on Congressional power to legislate a wide range of activities under the Constitution's commerce clause, but the dissenters had the better case. Justice Stephen Breyer made clear the value of judicial restraint, of deferring to Congress when Congress showed a rational basis for finding an interstate commercial impact in its law. Justice David Souter warned that the Court might be repeating past mistakes when justices obstructed Congress by substituting their judgments about commerce for the legislature's. 
 At its best, the Court has recognized the genius of the American way of fostering and regulating commerce in a large and free nation. Chief Justice John Marshall honored the early vision of a national common market not subject to toll collectors at every state line, for the movement of goods and services. Regulation of commerce "among the several states" is assigned to the national Congress, a body not confined to state borders nor bound to concepts of an 18th-century economy.
The Supreme Court occasionally threw obstacles in the way. A century ago it made hair-splitting, unreal distinctions between "manufacture" and commerce, hobbling consumer legislation aimed at an entire industry's operation. Most freakish was the Court's famous discovery that organized baseball was not commerce at all, just a game.
Another wrong turn by the Court crippled the early New Deal laws. The last time the Court struck down a law as beyond the commerce power was in 1936, when the "Nine Old Men" held that labor relations at a coal mine were "a local affair." By 1942 the Court was sustaining -- rightly, the justices agreed this week -- Federal crop limits imposed on an Ohio farmer who grew wheat only for his own consumption.
Like most states, Texas, where the court case arose, has its own gun laws aimed at school safety, so localities can survive the reversal of Alfonso Lopez's conviction in Federal court for carrying a .38-caliber hundgun into his San Antonio high school. But the Court decision has cast doubt on many other enactments as well. The opinion seriously undermines the doctrine of deference to Congress, especially at the edge of economic change where Congress, for all its faults, is better positioned to know what modern interstate commerce means.
The dissenters argued cogently that Congress, in passing the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, had sufficient reason to invoke its commerce power. Gun violence in city schools affects the economy by influencing where businesses and people locate and by hindering the education of the future work force.
According to the Chief Justice, Alfonso Lopez "was a local student at a local school; there is no indication that he had recently moved in interstate commerce." That ignored decades of understanding that Congress has the right to consider the ripple effect of matters that did not, at first glance, seem directly related to manufacturing, transportation and sales.
This gun law can probably be restored, perhaps by requiring the prosecution to prove that the weapon moved in interstate commerce. But such formalism should not be necessary. Nor should Congress wonder anew about the constitutionality, for example, of abortion-clinic safety laws. They are based in part on the fact that when clinics are bombed, sometimes by terrorists who have moved themselves or their explosives across state lines, women must travel to other states to exercise their constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy.
This newspaper has questioned the wisdom of much new crime legislation that makes a Federal case out of local muggings. But to strip Congress of the power to function is a throwback to the misguided rulings of earlier times. The nation will be better off if the Court now makes clear that the Lopez case was a single day's departure from judicial restraint in what the majority deemed an extreme overreach by Congress.

HEADLINE: A Business-Hungry Vietnam Forgets . . .

BYLINE: By Peter Ross Range; Peter Ross Range was Time magazine's last bureau chief in Saigon.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The general yawn provoked in Vietnam by Robert McNamara's controversial mea culpa tells a great deal about the enduring difference between the American and Vietnamese relationships to the war.
In both Hanoi and Saigon, as the bustling southern city is still commonly called, the focus is on the present and future, not on the sins of the past. "Vietnam is a country, not a war," Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai is fond of saying. Mr. McNamara's tears are not Vietnam's. 
 Even tomorrow's 20th anniversary of the country's reunification (in Vietnam, it's the reunification, not the war victory, that counts) is seen as a minor distraction from the real business at hand -- that of becoming the next Asian tiger. Workers were building bleachers in the park in front of the old Presidential palace in Saigon last week for a parade, but almost nobody I met cared.
Vietnam today is in the business of business. Even Hanoi, the once sleepy outpost of post-colonial charm and Soviet collectivism, is a cauldron of capitalism. Everybody, everywhere, is selling something. From the soup stall to the high-rise construction cranes, the country resembles nothing so much as the unbridled free-market economies of the West or, better, of the Asian tigers Vietnam seeks so ardently to emulate. Hanoi is madly striking deals with international investors eager to rebuild roads, phone systems and the remaining machinery of a market economy.
Yet American businessmen find themselves handicapped in a game fueled by cash streams from Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and Australia. The lack of full diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Vietnam, held up by the demands of the tiny missing-in-action lobby, cripples American companies by preventing them from using such key instruments as the Export-Import Bank. The consensus among Americans in Hanoi is that closer relations would foster closer cooperation and enhance the full accounting that M.I.A. lobbyists seek. President Clinton should break the impasse with a historic exchange of ambassadors with Vietnam.
Hanoi strikes the visitor as a surprisingly free and open place. I detected none of the dangerous electricity I always felt in the Moscow and East Berlin of old, where you knew the heavy hand of the secret constabulary was only a phone tap away. In Hanoi, men in uniform were few and far between; if anything, the city needs more cops on the street to manage the colossal traffic.
This climate extends to the flow of information. Local TV is heavily westernized. On my first night in town, I was stunned to see "Apocalypse Now" showing on the main channel. On other days, Oprah, Popeye, the Masters tournament and the N.C.A.A. final four -- the jewels of American popular culture -- washed over the doorman and drivers gathered before the TV set in my hotel lobby.
Though Government-controlled, the press is relatively uppity, reporting all manner of corruption, scandal and general incompetence. When the much admired Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's semiretired dictator and Hanoi's unofficial chief adviser, was in town this month, he publicly upbraided the Government of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet for "your inability administratively." He was impatient with continuing bureaucratic impediments to private investment and miffed at yet another power outage that had killed his mike and darkened the hall where he was about to speak. All this received front-page treatment in the press.
This does not mean Vietnam is free in larger terms. It is a one-party state with secret surveillance of those thought to be a threat. Some key Buddhist leaders are imprisoned, some intellectuals gagged or hounded, some harsh sentences meted out for the slightest show of dissent -- such as the 15 years given to a man named Pham Van Quang for waving the flag of the former South Vietnam during the 1992 Ho Chi Minh City international marathon.
Still, political repression is hardly a topic that's on everybody's lips. As best I could tell, in fact, it was on nobody's lips, unless I brought it up. The national preoccupation is economic, not political, and Vietnam is clearly a country on the make.
Nine years into doi moi, Vietnam's perestroika, the leadership is obviously doing something right. "The Communists have succeeded," said my old anti-Communist friend Ly Quy Chung one day in Saigon. It was an extraordinary admission from a former opposition politician, now a journalist, who had battled both the Viet Cong and the U.S.-supported Government of President Nguyen Van Thieu in the 1970's.
He meant that his old enemies, after the "10 dark years" from 1975 to 1985, had now got it right, not merely economically but politically as well. By giving the people what they want -- the liberty to pursue economic happiness -- the Communist gerontocracy is able to keep what it wants: full control.
But many think Vietnam, opened to the West and electronically liberated by sidewalk fax and photocopy stalls, is slouching toward democracy. By putting the war behind them and eagerly grasping their future, the Vietnamese are able to forgive and forget and move forward. The question is whether America is ready to do the same.

Eyes on the Prize

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WADE 

 BODY:
A PRIZE TO HONOR INVENTORS the way the Nobel Prize exalts scientists? That's what the Massachusetts Institute of Technology thinks is needed. And last month, with a $500,000 purse from a wealthy inventor, Jerome Lemelson, it chose its first laureate.
A prize committee led by the economist Lester Thurow scoured the nation for a candidate who would "personify American ingenuity." And what cutting-edge invention did they find to honor? What new Edison was ushered onto the public stage? The palm went to an automotive engineer employed by General Motors. His chief gift to civilization: not the phone, the transistor or the Internet, but helping to develop the traction control system of the Saturn automobile. 
 Mr. Lemelson, if you'd been hoping to get the public excited about invention, M.I.T. has just blown $500,000 of your money. Instead of thinking about the prize creatively, they've spent it cozying up to a big corporate sponsor. And like the many award givers that strive to imitate the Nobel Prize, they've missed some easy ways to improve on it.
There are two kinds of prizes, one designed to prompt new invention, the other to reward work already done. The prospective kind of prize requires superb technical insight. A suitable technical goal has to be set, one that's not too easy but doesn't require the next century's technology either. In 1959 the physicist Richard Feynman presciently offered two $1,000 prizes for the first steps toward what is now called nanotechnology. He had to pay up for one almost immediately, for the other 26 years later.
Henry Kremer, an English industrialist, offered a 50,000 prize (roughly $100,000 at the time) in 1959 for the first human-powered flight under reasonably testing conditions. His challenge wasn't met for 18 years, when Paul MacCready created the Gossamer Condor, a glorious mixture of piano wire, economic design and bicycle power that now hangs in the Smithsonian.
Another stimulating prize of the prospective variety is the $100,000 that the computer scientist Edward Fredkin has offered for the first computer program to win the world chess championship. The prize hasn't yet been claimed, but it may be only a matter of years before a non-human triumphs in this most intellectual of sports.
Choosing the right goal is a matter of fine technical judgment, but M.I.T. would surely not shrink from the challenge. Its inspiration should be the 23 major unsolved problems drawn up in 1900 by the mathematician David Hilbert, an agenda that has energized mathematicians ever since. I would have M.I.T. devise a list of the 20 major technical innovations likely to have the greatest impact on the economy, and I'd award a $500,000 prize each time one of these landmark objectives was reached.
But if the goals were properly challenging, that wouldn't happen every year. So most years I'd allot the $500,000 to a retrospective prize, though not by the lazy method of the Nobel committee and its many imitators. What those prize givers crave most is safety. They like to give their award to scientists who have collected lesser prizes already, which is why a narrow group of scientists garners almost all the available prizes. A principal exception to this rule is the Lasker Prize for medical research; its committee seems to work harder and is willing to take chances. Last year, for example, it gave its prize to Stanley Prusiner, a neurologist at the University of California at San Francisco, for inferring the existence of disease agents called prions -- even though Prusiner has not proved their existence to everyone's satisfaction.
Even the safety-first method doesn't prevent prizes from being wrongly awarded on occasion. Prize committees seldom have the time or aptitude to investigate the specific circumstances of a discovery. Columbia University in 1980 and the General Motors Cancer Research Foundation in 1981 both gave prizes to Cesar Milstein for the invention of monoclonal antibodies, ignoring the other author on the discovery paper, who was a mere graduate student of Milstein's. Had they or their advisers bothered to ask, they would have learned that the graduate student, Georges Kohler, conceived and executed the critical experiment. (In 1984, Kohler shared the Nobel Prize for Medicine with Milstein and a third recipient.)
The Nobel physics committee honored Antony Hewish in 1974 for the discovery of a unique class of stars called pulsars, doubtless because the professors who advised the committee believed professors deserve credit for everything that happens in the laboratory. But the pulsars were first discovered, and their nature confirmed, by Hewish's graduate student Jocelyn Bell.
The wider point is that, by making heroes of individual scientists, the Nobel and other prize committees distort the true pattern of discovery, which is often an interactive process in which many researchers contribute vital pieces to the problem. Like Robin Hood in reverse, a prize committee often robs credit from many to make just a handful rich.
Why do scientists, for whom intellectual credit is so important, tolerate the crudities of so slapdash a system? There's an easy way to make prize-giving more rigorous, and M.I.T. should apply it to the retrospective part of the Lemelson prize.
Having decided which discovery to honor, the selection committee should assign a historian of science or a journalist to write its full history, going beyond the deliberately ahistorical accounts in the scientific literature by interviewing all those who contributed pieces to the puzzle. The history of the invention would be laid out in a monograph, and all those mentioned would thereby receive due credit for their work, even if the prize money were given just to the major contributor.
Prize committees seldom give written explanations for their awards for fear of challenge. But a well-researched monograph would prevent a committee from honoring the wrong person. It would also show the public how often scientific discovery is a rich and complex social progress, not the crude apple-drops-on-Newton affair implied by the Nobel Prize and its imitators. A scientific prize committee that produced visible proof of having done its homework would so distinguish itself from its peers that it would soon eclipse them.
Mr. Lemelson, the $6.7 million gift you've given M.I.T. for your prize surely buys the right to expect some fun, some fireworks and the intellectual energy to distinguish between a creative invention and improving a power train. Don't let them rob you again next year.

Hems and Haws

BYLINE: By MAX FRANKEL 

 BODY:
IF YOU'VE EVER THROWN OUT A RACK OF skirts because they suddenly looked too short or a collection of ties because they suddenly seemed too wide, you have been, depending on your attitude about shopping, either a beneficiary or victim of fashion. If you have wondered about the source of those periodic changes of taste, you also qualify as a student of fashion. Responding to these urges, hundreds of journals and newspapers deem it their duty to instruct you in the vagaries of dress and the musings of designers; indeed, some exist mainly to harvest the advertisements that flourish in such manuals. But they rarely teach you what is really going on.
The best of the fashion magazines, like Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, satisfy a lust for fantasy, the imaginary try-on of clothes you couldn't afford, fit into or dare to wear. The better newspapers report colorfully on the semiannual runway romps in Paris, Milan and New York. That is where the most famous designers advertise themselves by draping unnaturally thin, beautiful women in outrageous or sumptuous ways and exhort the public with novelties of style that might stimulate the sale of mass-produced imitations. 
 Only rarely, however, do fashion articles satisfy my primal urge to understand the designers' sources of inspiration and the industry's strategies of obsolescence. How do they plot the hemline's descent from thigh to ankle, or shall it be the knee? Who leads, who copies, who resists? Does Barneys' vote count for more than Bradlees'? Will they next attack my wide lapels or merely condemn the white collar on my blue shirt? How much influence do consumers really exert?
I FOUND ONLY A FEW CLUES THIS SPRING IN the coverage of the shows in Europe and in the tents of Bryant Park in New York. Even the most knowledgeable magazines were so busy celebrating and prescribing novelty that they drowned out sober analysis:
"Suddenly clothes are beautiful again, rich-looking, well cut, sexy and demure at the same time in that Grace Kelly kind of way," Vogue proclaimed in March. "We go through these unfortunate and dangerous periods of puritanism in this country when to look nice is equated with possession by the devil or being Nancy Reagan. . . . The hard-edged, Joan Crawford-style face is definitely giving way to a more delicate -- but equally icy -- Grace Kelly look." (Imagine this tone in other contexts: Suddenly chasing welfare cheats is popular again in that Ronnie Reagan kind of way. . . . The bleeding-heart, Lyndon Johnson-style is definitely giving way to a more responsible -- but equally humane -- Herbert Hoover look.)
Just a month later, without a by-your-leave, Vogue was weakening on the tough stuff again: "Who says soft florals -- and other feminine prints -- can't have their harder side? In the spirit of Pulp Fiction's retro chic, spring's key looks -- simple dresses, flirty skirts and structured swimsuits -- are toughening up with dramatic details, including slick stiletto heels and deep red lips and nails." (Who says Newt Gingrich can't love orphans?)
But then, between March and April, there seemed to be real news developing. Vogue quietly pulled up the hems in its photographs, to the knee. Harper's Bazaar brazenly pounced on the whiff of a trend: "Paris says it's official: the new length is on the knee . . . jackets are tiny and waisted . . . shoes are stilettos . . . stockings are sheer . . . hair is set . . . jewelry is back."
Paris says? Milan and New York only parrot? "It is the only length that can be accepted in a feminist epoch," Marc Audibet, a French designer, intoned in Time -- ignoring a decade of wild hem gyrations. "A long length isn't practical, and a miniskirt won't work because of today's sexual wars. This skirt length is the only one that could be really new."
Time itself ratified the trend but insisted on credit for America. It argued that recent obituaries for Audrey Hepburn and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis had reinforced the sexy but classy Grace Kelly look. And Bazaar opined that just as the grunge look hit the runways in the week of Bill Clinton's election, "the Newt Length" was riding the wave of rising Republican fortune.
"Still," Bazaar added, presumably for Democrats, "the emotional symbolism contained in these trends goes beyond straight party politics. . . . What makes the 50's-flavor feel right is the way it harks back to everything people feel they'd like in their lives now -- a sense of certainty and order, consensus, self-discipline and optimism."
I might have bought all this political linkage if it weren't for my colleague Amy Spindler. She dared to recall that designers, with desperate disdain for the customer, have been evoking a new era every six months, even in political off years. Yet she, too, smelled a trend in this year's American collections: they were "increasingly commercial" and betrayed the pressures designers were feeling from retailers and their own boutiques, from sales staffs, licensees and the fashion press.
Women's Wear Daily, the industry's house organ, elaborated on these business pressures by greeting the New York shows with a loud reminder of Seventh Avenue's "Great Depression." It ran a full-page portrait of Sigmund Freud, cigar in hand, complaining that 30 years of research still left him wondering, "What does a woman want?" It caught retailers complaining about designers, designers complaining about the models and everyone complaining about the press. By rewarding glitz and glitter with flattering publicity, it seems, the press had lured designers into betraying their true artistry.
Only between the lines did I sense that pressure from retailers weighed heaviest on this year's fashion circus. Business has bombed of late and left everyone panting for that rarity -- a design consensus for a salable head-to-toe makeover. As Elisabeth Bumiller described the longed-for look in The Washington Post: "Conservative chic for women in their late 30's and 40's and 1960's mod for their daughters." Bazaar not only concurred but, with remarkable restraint, buried its trepidations deep in its report: "Bluntly, it's that or fashion Armageddon."
THESE CULLINGS FROM ONE SEASON'S fashion file should suffice to suggest what rich veins of sociology, commerce and psychiatry have been left unexplored by journalism. The big fashion magazines are so clearly part of the industry that they cannot stand analytically apart. (Because of a longstanding feud, even independent-sounding WWD unprofessionally forbids any mention of Geoffrey Beene, whom Spindler judges one of the best: "innovative and, yes, intellectual.")
The big newspapers, alas, too often consign fashion articles to their "soft news" pages, and write them accordingly. They seem to think that the decision of millions of women to replace or not to replace half their wardrobe has no real relevance to front-page economic and political life. In the hidebound, event-driven conventions of newspapering, the news that a President or First Lady favored longer skirts to stimulate the economy would probably land on the front page. But let normally competitive and contentious designers join with hungry retailers in a frantic international campaign to drop the hem to the knee and hardly any headlines catch the drift or track the trend. Maybe the mostly men in charge will notice when Brooks Brothers starts pushing Eisenhower jackets.

HEADLINE: Quick Trips to the Hermitage

BYLINE: By LAUREL GRAEBER; LAUREL GRAEBER is a writer and editor who contributes frequently to The Times.

 BODY:
RUSSIA has never been famous for sharing its secrets with the West. But this spring witnessed a notable exception: the opening of "Hidden Treasures Revealed: Impressionist Masterpieces and Other Important French Paintings Preserved by the State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg." Both a substantial symbol of the new Russian openness and a major event in the art world, the exhibition consists of 74 paintings that were taken out of Europe by Russian forces during World War II and concealed under lock and key for 50 years. On view through October 29, the exhibition includes Degas's "Place de la Concorde," which was presumed destroyed during the war; Renoir's "In the Garden," never before exhibited, and one of van Gogh's final paintings, "The White House at Night."
"Every day I get many letters and many phone calls about the exhibition," said Valentin I. Manturov, director, U.S.A., of the newly established Russian National Tourist Office in New York. "People ask how to go, how to book hotels, and they have many questions about the exhibit." 
 In response, many tour operators are offering short packages departing from Finland (and sometimes from the United States). It's possible to travel by air, train, bus or boat, and to find excursions for a range of budgets. A tour of the Hermitage and of "Hidden Treasures Revealed" are usually included, with the advantage that the traveler does not have to wait in one of those legendary Russian lines for entry. There are also more opportunities for independent travel, with individual itineraries and private guided tours. Keep in mind that a Russian visa is almost always required, and that hotels usually impose a surcharge for single rooms. The accommodations mentioned here have been rated by the Russian Travel Bureau: five-star hotels are deluxe, Western-style establishments; four- and three-star are clean and comfortable but have fewer amenities (don't expect room service or an ice machine in the hall). Here are some of the options.
 
By Air
Finnway, a subsidiary of the Finnish airline Finnair, offers both the four-day, three-night "St. Petersburg Flyaway" and the three-day, two-night "Czarist Russia -- St. Petersburg by Air." Both are led by an English-speaking guide.
"What we usually do is part of the regular Hermitage tour and also the Impressionists -- so that everyone going gets to see the exhibit," said Anneli Karppinen, president of Finnway.
For the "Flyaway" tour, flights leave from Helsinki every Saturday morning; the package includes air fare, meals, a theater or folklore performance, sightseeing and a Sunday afternoon tour of the museum. Prices per person staying in a double room vary from $629 at St. Petersburg's three-star Hotel Ohtinskaya to $1,059 for the five-star Hotel Grand Europe, a Western-style establishment. Flights for "Czarist Russia" leave Helsinki early every Friday afternoon from June 2 to Sept. 1. The offerings are similar to those of the "Flyaway"; city sightseeing includes a Saturday afternoon tour of the Hermitage and a Sunday trip to a czarist palace. The price is $830 a person, which includes double accommodations at the five-star Russian-owned Hotel Astoria, which is near the museum. Information: (800) 526-4927 or (212) 818-1198.
Holiday Tours in New York offers several packages from Helsinki to St. Petersburg. Its three-day, two-night "St. Petersburg by Air" follows a schedule much like Finnway's "Czarist Russia," with Friday afternoon flights through the summer. For $775, the tour includes the main attractions of St. Petersburg, a full afternoon at the Hermitage and a visit to an imperial palace, with double rooms at the five-star Hotel Nevsky Palace, which is quite close to the museum. Information: (800) 677-6454 or (212) 832-8989.
For travelers wishing for more variety and a slightly longer stay, General Tours in Keene, N.H., which handles tours of Eastern Europe via Delta Airlines, offers "St. Petersburg Story," a six-day, four-night tour departing from the United States. Prices, including air fare, range from $1,169 for double accommodations at the four-star Hotel Pribaltiiskaya to $1,849 for the Grand Hotel Europe. (Departures from Helsinki can also be arranged, at prices ranging from $1,152 to $1,632, including round-trip train fare.) In either case, a private three-hour guided tour of the Hermitage Museum, including "Hidden Treasures Revealed," is an additional $45. The package is unescorted, but General's staff of Russian tour managers in St. Petersburg are available to handle specific requests. Information: (800) 221-2216 or (603) 357-5033.
Union Tours and the Russian Travel Bureau, both in New York, also offer the option of a departure from either the United States or Helsinki. Among Union's "Short Stay City Packages" is a three-night visit to St. Petersburg. The price covers round-trip trans-Atlantic passage on Finnair and per-person double accommodations in either the renovated three-star St. Petersburg Hotel ($889) or the luxurious Grand Europe ($1,199). (The same tour, originating in Helsinki, including round-trip train fare, ranges from about $289 to $649.) A four-hour private tour of the Hermitage for two people is an additional $50 per person. Information: (800) 451-9511 or (212) 683-9500.
The Russian Travel Bureau, which despite its name is an American-owned company, has put together its "Welcome America" package, a weeklong trip that includes a visit to "Hidden Treasures Revealed." Prices begin at $1,089 for round-trip Finnair flights from the United States to St. Petersburg, connecting in Helsinki, with accommodations at three-star hotels, daily breakfasts, sightseeing, a theater performance and special restaurant and shop discounts for tour participants. (The price for the package with Helsinki as the point of origin, including air fare, is $699.) Weekend departures begin May 21. Information: (800) 847-1800 or (212) 986-1500.
Museums and publications are also planning tours. The Educated Traveler magazine, in conjunction with The Traveler's Guide to Art Museum Exhibitions, is sponsoring three special fall packages: Sept. 4 to 11, Sept. 18 to 25 and Sept. 25 to Oct. 2. The schedule for each includes an afternoon at the Hermitage's private collections (tour members can return for another half-day if they wish) and an entire morning at "Hidden Treasures Revealed," where the guides will include an art historian and Albert Kostenevich, the author of the exhibition catalogue, published by Harry N. Abrams. The cost of the tour, which also includes the Russian Museum, is $3,000 a person; the fee covers round-trip fare on Finnair from New York City (connecting in Helsinki), meals, sightseeing, entertainment and accommodations at the Hotel Nevsky Palace. For information, call International Seminar Design, which is also handling bookings for a tour Sept. 12 to 19 sponsored by the North Carolina Museum of Art: (202) 244-1448.
The Santa Barbara Museum of Art in California is offering its own one-time-only tour, Oct. 5 to 12, that focuses on "Hidden Treasures Revealed." Open to nonmembers of the museum, it is currently limited to 25 people. Participants will spend a full day at the Hermitage, with a private catered lunch and a private guided tour of the exhibition. The cost of $2,885 includes round-trip Finnair flights from New York, double accommodations at the Hotel Astoria, all meals, entertainment and sightseeing. From Helsinki, the package, including round-trip air fare to and from Finland only, costs $2,485. The museum has a 24-hour information line: (805) 963-4364, ext. 336.
 
By Land
Tourists traveling to Finland who would like to have the most economical visit to St. Petersburg can choose to take a train or a bus. Two trains, one Finnish and one Russian, depart daily from Helsinki at 6:30 A.M. and 3:32 P.M., respectively. Depending on the schedule, the trip to St. Petersburg takes seven to eight hours; the return is under six. One-way costs range from $70 for second-class travel to $115 to $130 for first class. Several tour packages take advantage of this inexpensive ground transportation.
Finnway's "St. Petersburg by Train" tour is four days and three nights, running weekly from May 29 to Sept. 4. The $550 price includes a second-class compartment on the Sibelius (the Finnish train) plus meals and double accommodations in a three-star hotel. The program's guide accompanies the group from Helsinki, leading them on tours to city sites, an imperial palace and the Hermitage, where the participants spend an afternoon.
Finnway's "St. Petersburg by Bus," also four days and three nights, departs from Helsinki every Tuesday from May 2 to Oct. 10. Participants ride through southern Finland, and on Wednesday tour St. Petersburg's Nevsky Prospekt in the morning and the Hermitage in the afternoon. Parks and palaces are also among the stops. The $480 price covers meals and a double room at a four-star hotel.
Holiday Tours offers three train tours from Helsinki to St. Petersburg; two are escorted, the other independent. All include morning travel on the Sibelius and a half-day visit to the Hermitage. The four-day, three-night escorted tour, running Monday to Thursday from May 29 to Sept. 4, costs $510 in a four-star hotel. The three-day, two-night escorted tour, available June 18 to Aug. 20, ranges from $495 per person for a double in a four-star hotel to $795 for five-star accommodations. The unescorted tour, three days and two nights, allows travelers their choice of hotel accommodations ($415, $660 or $840 a night), with a private guided tour of the Hermitage and private-car transportation and sightseeing.
Holiday has also put together a four-day, three-night bus tour from May 2 to Oct. 10, which includes three-star hotel stays at a cost of $460 per person. In addition to the Hermitage, all the overland tours include highlights selected from the parks, palaces and squares of the city.
 
By Ship
One of the most popular ways to visit St. Petersburg briefly is on board the Baltic Line's Konstantin Siminov, a Polish-built Russian ship with an English-speaking staff. The Siminov's four-day cruises, departing from Helsinki in the late afternoon on Mondays and Thursdays (the ship arrives in St. Petersburg the following morning), are visa-free, which means that individual visas are not required if the traveler purchases in advance one of several possible shore excursions; he can then get on and off the ship as much as he wants. There is always a shore excursion that includes a tour of the Hermitage.
Eurocruises in New York, for instance, sells a four-hour shore excursion to the Hermitage for $36. The Bergen Line, another New York operator, offers a half-day at the Hermitage for $26; a full day with city sightseeing in the morning and the Hermitage in the afternoon is $37.
Many tour companies book on the Siminov; from mid-May through late September, cruise prices range from a low of $190 per person double occupancy for an inside cabin (these are snapped up so quickly they are rarely available) to $690 for a suite. Good buys are available in between from about $310 to $485. The fees include all meals, on-board entertainment and port charges. For Eurocruises information, call (800) 688-3876 or (212) 691-2099; for Bergen Line, (800) 323-7436 or (212) 319-1300. Russian Waterway Cruises in Brooklyn is another source, offering longer cruises that include St. Petersburg and the exhibition as well as other ports of call. Information: (800) 828-7970 or (718) 934-4100.
 
Tailor-Made Tours
Independent travel, or a custom-designed tour, is another possibility -- an option not readily available under the old Soviet regime. Such tours impose no limits on hotel choices or the amount of time one can wander through the Hermitage. "People want their own guide and to go at their own pace," said Marylou H. Foley, president of Tour Designs in Washington. "We arrange tours to include just the Hermitage or more. And the thing to emphasize is that there is such a range of hotel prices. A small hotel, the Deson Ladoga, was recently renovated and probably qualifies as a Best Western three-star. It's great, but not usually advertised -- and just under $100 a night for two."
Tour Designs, for instance, could arrange a "bare bones" six-day, four-night program, including round-trip Finnair fares from New York City, double accommodations at the Deson Ladoga, daily breakfasts and two visits to the Hermitage (one a guided tour of "Hidden Treasures Revealed") for about $1,299 to $1,428, depending on the dates of travel. A similar four-day, four-night program, including air fare to and from Helsinki only, would cost $585 to $685 per person. Information: (800) 432-8687 or (202) 554-5820.
Russiatours in Tampa, Fla., also puts together packages for individual travelers. "We include round-trip air fare from Helsinki and any number of days in any hotel," said Gregory M. Tepper, director, sales and marketing. "Our tours are all with a private car driver and guide, and we budget a whole day at the Hermitage." A typical four-day package, with city sightseeing, the Hermitage and "Hidden Treasures" tour, a ballet performance and a visit to a country palace would run from $1,075 a person to $1,350, depending on the hotel selected. Information: (800) 633-1008 or (813) 987-2477.
Moscow Nights Travel, an operator in San Francisco, will devise individual or group tours focusing on the "Hidden Treasures" exhibition and departing from Finland or the United States. For information on standard or deluxe packages, call (800) 878-8829.
For continuing information on new tours as they arise, the Europe Travel Center in Herndon, Va., which specializes in Eastern Europe, maintains an up-to-date data base of individual and group programs traveling to Russia. Owned and operated by Jonathan Chase, the service provides both information and bookings. Call (703) 264-9746; they can be reached by E-mail at this address: 73232.1246@compuserve.com.

HEADLINE: Along Times Sq., Signs of New Life Abound

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
FUSED together in legend and on the map, Times Square and 42d Street are still a world apart economically. Along the bow tie-shaped intersection of Broadway and Seventh Avenue, indications abound of fresh vitality: new leases, new construction, new supersigns.
There is evidence, too, in the demolition and construction that are actually under way, that the renascence of 42d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues may be at hand. 
 But the prospective tenants for the theaters that line 42d Street -- the Walt Disney Company, Viacom's MTV channel and American Multi-Cinema -- are in a holding pattern. Everyone, it seems, is waiting to see who will take the plunge first because no one wants to do it alone.
Charles A. Gargano, the new chairman of the New York State Urban Development Corporation, the corporate parent of the 42d Street Development Project Inc., said he and Gov. George E. Pataki were committed to "quick progress" on the 14-year-old project. "I'm determined to make this work," Mr. Gargano said.
For the moment, however, much of the action is around the corner, on Broadway.
The office space known as 1601 Broadway, at the base of the Crowne Plaza Hotel, between 48th and 49th Streets, is close to being leased to the American Management Association, which would occupy about 150,000 square feet. The retail space at the Bertelsmann Building, at 45th Street, which has been empty since the tower was completed five years ago, is being readied for a 65,000-square-foot music store (Virgin Megastore); a 35,000-square-foot, 750-seat sports-theme restaurant (the Official All Star Cafe) and the four-screen, 1,400-seat Sony State Theater.
At an "eight-digit" cost, Bertelsmann is rebuilding the shell of the base so tenants can get in by July and finish work on the spaces, said Hans-Martin Sorge, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Bertelsmann Inc. The complex is to open by Thanksgiving, Mr. Sorge added.
More surprising is the supersign under construction between 47th and 48th Streets; surprising because it is being built by Morgan Stanley, a global securities business that is not exactly known for razzle-dazzle self-promotion.
In buying the 42-story tower at 1585 Broadway, Morgan Stanley inherited a requirement, under the special Times Square zoning rules, that the building carry large, kinetic signage. The result is a giant information display, designed by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates and constructed by the Artkraft Strauss Sign Corporation. At the corners are two barrel-shaped maps, 44 feet high, with digital clocks telling the time around the world, highlighting cities where Morgan Stanley has offices.
Above these are three 140-foot-long electronic ticker boards, stacked atop each other. Two are 12 feet high and one is 10 feet high. They will use light-emitting diodes in place of incandescent bulbs and transmit information in "real time," as opposed to traditional traveling-message boards, which are programmed in advance. News bulletins might be carried on one board, with stock quotations on another and sports scores on the third. But nobody will say yet exactly what is planned.
At either end of the tickers will be 30-by-60-foot display boards capable of showing charts and other graphic images, as well as text. Ten decorative fins along the Broadway facade will be clad in mirrors, with blue-neon edges, and characters that spell out "1 5 8 5 B ' W A Y."
If the name "Morgan Stanley" appears anywhere at all on this extravaganza, it will be in discreet 7-inch-high letters on the global clock. But the company feels that a data-laden sign will convey its image as an information nerve center.
Morgan Stanley is readying the building for occupancy by year's end as its headquarters, with trading floors, investment banking and asset management offices. Although 1585 Broadway was virtually finished five years ago by Solomon Equities, the signage requirement does not take force until a certificate of occupancy is requested for more than half of a new building.
Because 1585 Broadway has been largely vacant, it isolated the Crowne Plaza Hotel, to the north, from the rest of Times Square. "This building being empty, without signs, was a missing link," said Michael Silberstein, a Crowne Plaza executive. "By lighting it up, it will make us part of the Great White Way, so we're very, very excited."
IN the base of the hotel structure is an eight-story commercial unit known as 1601 Broadway, which has never been leased. The American Management Association, a not-for-profit organization that primarily conducts seminars to teach people how to manage, is "very close" to signing a lease there, said Frank R. Giglio, corporate vice president and chief financial officer. The group is now at 135 West 50th Street.
By a curious twist, Mr. Giglio said, the association was the original tenant William Zeckendorf Jr. had in mind when he began the hotel and office project in the 1980's. As a result, the column-free floors suit the group's need for flexible meeting spaces.
The association is asking the city for some relief from real estate taxes, for which it would be liable as a tenant. Nonprofit groups are exempt from real estate taxes if they own their own space, but the association cannot afford to buy 1601 Broadway as a condominium. The building is owned by K.G. Land. The lease would run 20 years, Mr. Giglio said, although he would not disclose the rent.
Another vacant space at the Crowne Plaza has been the curving south wall of its base, which was designed for a supersign. It is finally to get a 100-by-20-foot spectacular, which will include a giant television screen (433 inches, measured diagonally). Mr. Silberstein said only that its sponsors would include "some major players from the technology side." The hotel is also replacing its 80-by-16-foot "Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza" sign, to reflect its simpler new name.
Another hotel that is bedecking itself is the Marriott Marquis, between 45th and 46th Streets. The north tower recently sprouted signs for Hertz and Maxwell House. George N. Stonbely, the president of Spectacolor, which leases the sign space from the hotel, said a new sign on the south tower would promote another "premier American corporation" with "a lot of new technology that's never been on display before."
Directly across Broadway from the Marriott Marquis is the Bertelsmann Building, which the German publishing, music and entertainment conglomerate purchased in 1992. Its 150,000-square-foot, six-story retail atrium has been empty.
"Our intention is to create an entertainment center, because we're here in Times Square," said Mr. Sorge, of Bertelsmann.
The Virgin Megastore, designed by B N K Architects and Irvine & Johnston, will be the "largest music-entertainment store in the world," said Richard Branson, chairman and chief executive of the Virgin Group.
On the ground floor will be rock, pop and soul music sections, accessories and other merchandise; the cellar will have blues, Broadway, classical, foreign, jazz, soundtrack and vocal sections and the sub-cellar will have a cafe, bookstore, laser video and CD-ROM section, as well as the entrance to the Sony theaters.
Sharing part of the ground floor with Virgin will be the All Star Cafe, whose main dining room will be on the second floor. The restaurant is being designed by Rockwell Architecture, Planning and Design and developed by Robert Earl, the creator of Planet Hollywood, who described it as the "world's foremost tribute to sport in the form of a restaurant."
The sports theme carries over to the next block, where Strykers Boxing and Sporting Club is to open May 19 in 12,000 square feet in the basement of the Actors' Equity Building, Broadway and 46th Street. The partners in Strykers are Arthur Cutler, the restaurateur behind Carmine's, Ollie's and Docks, and Tom Cavallaro, a boxing promoter.
"We're trying to bring boxing back to Broadway, the way it was in the 40's, when the greats were here," Mr. Cavallaro said. He said the club cost $2 million to build but would not disclose the terms of the lease.
Two generations ago, the space was Zimmerman's Hungaria Restaurant. Its vaulted ceilings survive and its multicolored terrazzo floors have been restored. The centerpiece of the new business is a 20-by-20-foot boxing ring surrounded by dozens of exercise machines, which can be moved aside to create a 540-seat arena. Besides the workout area, there are locker rooms, steam rooms and massage rooms, as well as a lounge. The architect and contractor is the Elevations Design and Construction Company.
Gretchen Dykstra, president of the Times Square Business Improvement District, said Strykers is a "wonderful spin on the whole entertainment theme" and "very sensitive to the gestalt of the neighborhood."
Perhaps the tallest question mark in the neighborhood is One Times Square, the slender tower that is the centerpiece of New Year's Eve. It was purchased last month, reportedly for $27.5 million, by Lehman Brothers, the investment banking house. That put an end to plans for an entertainment complex on the site by Pearson P.L.C., the British company that owns Madame Tussaud's wax exhibition. And earlier this month, the enormous signs on the northern prow advertising Minolta and Pepsi were dismantled by Van Wagner Communications, which maintained the signs and made its own bid on One Times Square.
ALTHOUGH Lehman Brothers is tight-lipped on its plans, Ms. Dykstra said the firm "shows all the potential signs of being a good neighbor." She said she had a "very reassuring" conversation with a Lehman executive who persuaded her of his intention to "find a suitable entertainment use" for the building.
All around One Times Square are the four sites on which Times Square Center Associates, a joint venture between the Prudential Insurance Company of America and Park Tower Realty, once hoped -- and still plans -- to construct four enormous office towers, once the real estate market has regained its strength.
For the time being, most of the existing buildings on those parcels are being renovated to permit an interim retail development of 80,000 square feet. There will also be 42,000 square feet of signage on the sites.
As part of the project, asbestos is being removed from the existing buildings, partition walls are being removed to open up spaces, and new electrical systems and heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems are being installed.
A spokesman for Times Square Center Associates said there was "a great deal of interest by an excellent mix of retail tenants" and that the stores and restaurants would probably begin opening in the first three months of 1996.
The largest available space will be in the former Nathan's Famous Restaurant at Broadway and 43d Street, a streamlined structure built 55 years ago. The first floor has 16,000 square feet; combined with second floor and cellar, it could yield 42,000 square feet. Next door, in the Longacre Building, 9,500 square feet are available.
The next largest block of space is in the Rialto Theater Building, Broadway and 42d Street. This exuberant Art Deco structure was built in 1935 to designs by Thomas W. Lamb and Rosario Candela. It has 12,000 square feet of retail space, plus a 500-seat theater, which was used most recently for "The Montel Williams Show." Several smaller buildings next door also have space.
A new 6,700-square-foot restaurant will be built at the "crossroads" site on 42d Street, between Broadway and Seventh Avenue. There will also be retail space in two other buildings on the same block.
Across Seventh Avenue, several small buildings have been torn down to make way for a new 4,600-square-foot store, which may be leased to the Disney company, along with a three-story building next door. This store would adjoin the New Amsterdam Theater, which Disney is planning to lease from New York State for 49 years and restore for live productions -- provided the cost is not too high and other companies also make a commitment to 42d Street. Disney has until July 15 to make up its mind.
A dramatic makeover is already occurring at the 95-year-old Victory Theater, 207 West 42d Street, which has been renamed the New Victory and is scheduled to open next December or January (about three to four months behind schedule) as a theater for young audiences. The $11.4 million renovation has been undertaken by the New 42d Street Inc., a nonprofit organization that holds the leases to six theaters, and underwritten by Times Square Center Associates, as part of the development deal.
Cora Cahan, president of the New 42d Street, said the Victory was the "second most splendid" of the neighboring theaters (the New Amsterdam is widely acknowledged as the crown jewel) but had "little commercial viability." The building is not much more than an auditorium, with almost no ancillary space. Also, its rich architectural fabric must be restored.
NEW space was excavated under ground for a lobby, lockers and concession stand, while the vault area under the sidewalk was used for new toilets. The dressing rooms and offices will occupy an old tenement on 43d Street that adjoins the back of the theater. A grand exterior staircase will be rebuilt on 42d Street. The architects for the renovation are Hardy Holzmann Pfeiffer Associates and the contractor is the F. J. Sciame Construction Company.
Next to the Victory is a cluster of three theaters on which Viacom holds an option: the Lyric, the Times Square and the Academy (also known as the Apollo). Although the company has developed ambitious plans for a studio complex including its MTV music channel, it has said almost nothing publicly. Mr. Gargano said the option had been extended until May 15 and that prospects for the project are good.
On the other side of 42d Street is a site on which American Multi-Cinema has proposed a 29-screen theater complex that would show first-run, second-run, revival and foreign movies, as well as virtual-reality offerings. This complex would include the Empire, Liberty and Harris Theaters, as well as a parcel to the west that is now in the process of condemnation.
Finally, at the westernmost end of the block, on Eighth Avenue, between 42d and 43d Streets, is the 57,500-square-foot, L-shaped parcel that has been set aside for a hotel and other uses. Three development teams are competing to develop the project and Mr. Gargano said a designation should be made before mid-May.
The teams are Marriott International and Triarc Equities Corporation, with Michael Graves as architect; Tishman Urban Development Corporation and Disney Development Corporation, with the Arquitectonica architectural firm and Milstein Properties Corporation, Weiler Arnow Management Company and Hilton Hotel Corporation, with the architect Zaha Hadid.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
Retiring the Water-Guzzlers of the Toilet World

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
NO conservation-minded inquisitor is likely to demand that New York City's householders reveal the number of times a day they flush their toilets. That's fortunate, because even ardent reflection may produce a blank.
But sages at the New York City Department of Environmental Protection say that there are at least four at-home flushes per person a day in the city. That's an average of 180 million gallons a day, or about 13.5 percent of total water consumption. The figure doesn't include flushes made in commercial and other nonresidential buildings. 
 Find a way to cut back on water consumed by toilet flushing and the pressure to expand the city's pumping capacity would be eased, as would the economic pressure on housing from rising charges for water and sewer service. Lower-income housing in particular has been hurt by the steady rise in water and sewer rates in recent years, largely because of higher occupancy rates.
So the department introduced the New York City Toilet Rebate Program, now entering its second year. It offers cash to owners who replace their old-style toilets, which use from 3.5 to 7 gallons per flush, with one that uses only 1.6 gallons, the only type that it is now legal to sell. They have to get low-flow showerheads and faucet aerators at the same time if they don't have them already.
The city pays $242 for the first toilet replaced and $150 for each additional toilet in the house or apartment. (Nonresidential buildings get a straight $150 per toilet.) In multifamily buildings at least 70 percent of all the toilets have to be replaced for the building to qualify. The work has to be done by one of the 350 licensed plumbers who have registered with the program.
The rebate is so calculated that the out-of-pocket cost to the participating owner is usually zero. The money goes eventually to the plumber, covering the cost of the product and the installation.
The program became effective citywide last August and has recently been picking up steam. The goal over three years is to replace about a third of the city's 3.5 million to 4 million toilets. That would save about 80 million or 90 million gallons of water a day. As of last Monday, owners had replaced 180,000 toilets in 6,800 properties, generating rebates of $32 million. There were 50,000 replacements in April and there will be 50,000 more in May. "We're on target," said Warren Liebold, director of water conservation in the environmental agency's Bureau of Water and Energy Conservation.
As expected, lower-income housing and lower-income neighborhoods have been the leading participants. Higher-income buildings, including many Manhattan co-ops, so far seem to be carrying on with high-consumption toilets. Since occupancy per unit is lower, water costs are a less significant factor in operating cost, though rising rates over time may change that. Nor have single-family homeowners come forward in large numbers. (Call (212) 685-5575 for information about the program.)
But it also appears that many landlords are hesitant about participating. "They're foolish!" said Jerome Waxenberg, principal in Norwax Associates in the Bronx, an owner-management firm that has installed new toilets in 3,000 apartments. "They say they don't want to be bothered by the paperwork, or they're afraid of stoppages, or leaks in the building, or they don't want the aggravation of dealing with the tenants."
The program has been set up to encourage entrepreneurialism. It has brought to the city, for example, a firm called Nationwide Consultants Inc., which has organized installations of low-flow toilets in California and Florida. Working for Bay Ridge Mechanical Inc., a Manhattan plumber, Nationwide has handled marketing and paperwork and on-site preparation in over 15,000 replacements in 40 buildings. It provides the financing for owners so that there are no out-of-pocket costs.
"Gaining access to apartments is the biggest problem," said Nicole Ager, who manages Nationwide's Manhattan office. "We kill ourselves to get 95 percent, working mornings, evenings, weekends -- whatever it takes. But we have to get cooperation from the owner. If the owner doesn't care then we'll get by with 75 or 80 percent."
Another entrepreneur who has emerged is Fred Glass, a master plumber who set up a storefront business called Water Savers Inc. in 1993 at 451 West 46th Street, specifically in hopes of making the rebate program into a production-scale business.
Potential customers can witness the flushing capabilities of a variety of competitive products at his storefront, which helps in choosing the product. More than 100 toilet models qualify for the rebate.
"I EXPECTED that people would fly in the door, but it's not happening," Mr. Glass said. "People in the middle-income buildings, the co-ops, are cautious. Water is too cheap for them." But he has replaced 1,500 toilets, mainly for owners of buildings with 20 to 40 apartments. "We've finally managed to sign up three big buildings, including two co-ops," he said.
One of the city's largest plumbing firms, New York Plumbing & Heating Corporation, is doing 14,000 replacements for Metropolitan Life at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, plus other work. And many other plumbers with long relationships with building owners have been drawn in.
"We are repipers from the old days," said Morris Miller, whose company, Diamond Plumbing of New York, has completed 160 buildings. Typically it takes eight days to do a 40-unit building, he said. Crews work over the weekend to be sure of gaining access to the maximum number of apartments.
A few firms have already been thrown out or suspended from the rebate program for violating its guidelines, city officials said. Plumbers participating are not allowed to split the rebate with owners or managing agents, for example. Sales people cannot represent themselves to owners as "endorsed" or "certified" by the program.
Nor does the installation in a rent-regulated building make the owner eligible for a rent increase under the major capital improvement program. City and state housing offices are kept informed of the buildings that enter the rebate program.
The plumbing team, arriving at a building after tenants have been notified, replaces the old toilet and takes it to one the city-designated dumping points. It gets a receipt that is submitted with documentation to the Department of Environmental Protection, which issues the check in about three weeks. The payment can go to an owner, a managing agent, the owner and a third party or the managing agent and a third party.
Rising water and sewer costs have been the fastest-growing component of operating costs in low-income housing for several years, so much so that the Water Board has capped the increase at $500 per apartment per year if conservation standards are met. But conservation alone will probably not be able to protect low-income-housing owners from the financial impact of billing by consumption rather than by the old frontage method.
The current water and sewer charge is $2.62 per 100 cubic foot, or 748 gallons. A study has shown that the average charge per unit a year under the frontage method in multifamily housing is $320, and that with metering -- and no caps -- it would be more than $500 per unit a year in 21 percent of the city's housing units -- mainly the lower-income stock.
Owners of lower-income housing say that a cap lower than $500 a unit is needed urgently. But they also endorse the rebate program. In the Bronx, for example, the Rosenberg Diamond Development Corporation said it had replaced toilets in all 50 of its buildings, reaching 95 percent of its 3,000 tenants.
"The best feature of the program is that it costs the owner nothing except a little time in insuring coordination and preparing a contract," said Robert Rosenberg, president. "Consultants survey the building, recommend plumbers if necessary, meet with tenants, make appointments, work on weekends and do all the paperwork. Why wouldn't anyone want to do it?"

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
Swiss Bank Beefs Up the Stamford Office Outlook

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

DATELINE: STAMFORD

 BODY:
LAST year, 1.3 million square feet of office space was leased in this business hub of Connecticut, bringing the vacancy rate under 20 percent for the first time in this decade. And now the city anticpates the construction of Swiss Bank's huge North American headquarters in a prime downtown location.
Nevertheless, the first quarter of 1995 saw more space vacated than rented and jobs have been lost because of corporate consolidations. 
 Employment figures fell from a peak in 1987 of 82,270 to 61,782 for February of this year, below the 1980 total of 66,000, according to figures supplied by Sacia, the southwest Connecticut business council. The anagram stands for Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association.
Office vacancies rose from 17 percent in the last quarter of 1994 to 18 percent for the first quarter of 1995. But leases are still ahead of the first quarter of 1994, when vacancies were just above 20 percent. And the vacancy rate is substantially down from the 23.6 percent of 1990.
Among real estate professionals these blips are regarded as "purely statistical," said Owen J. Brown, senior director of Cushman & Wakefield of Connecticut, commercial realtors who supplied the figures.
"American Tobacco is vacating some 67,000 square feet in its merger with Brown & Williamson, and Waldenbooks is leaving almost 295,000 square feet -- merging with Borders Books under Kmart ownership and moving to Michigan," he said. "That's healthy -- freeing up large spaces for which there is a crying need."
In addition, Xerox is consolidating within its 250,000-square-foot headquarters, vacating 280,000 square feet in two other buildings.
In spite of the empty spaces prices are rising. "Increases of 30 cents to $1.16 a square foot bring rents between the mid-teens to the mid-20's, depending on location," said Michael H. Siegel, executive director of Edward S. Gordon Company, a commercial brokerage. In 1990 the range was low teens to low 20's.
Swiss Bank's projected move from two of its three locations in Manhattan to an 11-acre site that Morgan Stanley considered in 1991 and rejected, is not yet a done deal. Earlier this month, the bank put $2 million in escrow to seal an agreement with the city guaranteeing a minimum first phase building of 930,000 square feet and 1,200 jobs, less than its original guarantee of 1.2 million square feet and 2,000 jobs. The reduction resulted from a 41 percent drop in profits for 1994.
A 10-year corporate tax credit offered by the state, based on the number of employees, wase a major reason for the move to Connecticut, but the terms must be approved by the General Assembly. On April 17 the Joint Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee voted favorably, 36 to 3, on the modified building and job figures. The measure will go to the Senate in May and then to the House of Representatives.
"The bank gets a 30 percent credit on their corporate taxes to start," said Arthur Diedrick, the state's Commissioner of Economic Development. "As they expand up to 2,000 employees it increases to 50 percent."
Should they expand to 3,000 employees in the 11th year, he said, they would get an additional five years of credit at 50 percent annually.
APPRAISALS of the 33 parcels on the site -- bounded by Atlantic Street, North State Street, Washington Boulevard and Federal Street -- "will guide the city in negotiating with landowners, exercising its eminent domain authority," said Anne Dayton, interim director of the city's Urban Renewal Commission.
According to Frank Kerwin, the Assessor, the land is worth $45 a square foot, or $21.5 million. "Property taxes would be $335,000 for the first phase, and around $2 million when fully built," he said. The bank could eventually have about 2 million square feet of space and employ 3,000 people. Property taxes on equipment and furniture will add considerably to the totals.
The first phase is estimated to cost $184 million, including land, a 12-story office building and trading pavilion, a 1,400-car garage, furniture and equipment. Construction could begin in July and would be completed early in 1998, according to Matthias Beckmann, spokesman for the bank.
The project may be telegraphing "the next wave in Fairfield County real estate -- a return to new construction for specific clients," said Gerard P. Hallock, senior vice president of Rostenberg-Doern Company, commercial realtors.
Some new construction has already begun.
Pitney Bowes, a Stamford company founded here in the 20's with its world headquarters on the waterfront, is completing a 300,000-square-foot office building and shipping depot in Shelton, where it has owned and occupied a second building for several years. "They have also purchased 32 acres for future development," said James Ryan, Shelton's Director of Economic Development.
Omega Engineering is putting up a 106,400-square-foot office building in the Riverbend Industrial Park here, and Duracell will complete its 308,000-square-foot headquarters at Berkshire Corporate Park in Bethel in October. Six of the eight other locations that the company now occupies in the park will be vacated, leaving 175,000 square feet empty.
Significant acquisitions of existing buildings include the purchase by Virgin Atlantic Airways of a 41,000 square foot headquarters building in Norwalk for $4.1 million. Foreclosed and never occupied, its partially finished interior is now being completed.
"WE will move there from Manhattan in August," said David Tait, executive vice president, who mentioned that "Connecticut was much nicer with cash incentives than New York or New Jersey, where we also looked." A regional sales office will remain in Manhattan and half of the 210 Norwalk jobs will be filled locally.
About 20 percent of downtown Stamford's 6.6 million square feet of first-class space was purchased for $146 million from 1992 through 1994 by Zell-Merrill Lynch, the Chicago-based real estate investment firm. The buildings have an overall vacancy rate of only 12 percent.
"They are always looking for additional properties and they will buy more if the occasion arises," said Margaret Carlson, leasing agent for Equity Office Properties, the firm's management company.
W&M Properties of Connecticut is targeting smaller tenants who don't need to be in downtown Stamford and who pay modest salaries. Their employees have serious problems with the high cost of living in Stamford and must commute long distances to less expensive towns, causing more highway congestion and wasted time in traffic.
"That's why we bought Soundview Plaza at Exit 9 of I-95 on the Stamford-Darien border, and Merritt View off the Merritt Parkway and the I-95 extension in Norwalk," said Anthony E. Malkin, president of the Manhattan-based W&M Properties, which built and owns the 276,000-square-foot Metro Center in Stamford. "Employees will save up to 40 minutes round trip." The buildings are undergoing extensive renovations for openings in May and September.
Stamford's future does seem to be evolving around an entrenched high cost of living. "Typically," said Mr. Brown of Cushman & Wakefield, "we are getting elite firms or divisions of companies whose employees are accustomed to New York and can afford to live there or here."

HEADLINE: State Seeks to Preserve More Meadowlands, With Developers Picking Up Part of the Bill

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

DATELINE: LYNDHURST

 BODY:
The future of the Hackensack Meadowlands the 32-square-mile region of virgin marshes, 12-lane highways and abandoned dumps that has long stood midway between national treasure and national joke -- is being reshaped by a new master plan meant to strike a balance between construction and conservation.
The plan, essentially a vast zoning map, was carved out after years of negotiation among landowners and state and Federal agencies. It seeks to preserve fragile wetlands, cut red tape for developers and require them to pay for environmental protection. If adopted by the state, it will replace a 1972 master plan that was widely regarded as visionary -- with a sleek new city center overlooking fields of waving marsh grasses, the New York skyline shimmering on the horizon -- but has long since been overtaken by economic and environmental realities. 
 "This will be a model for the nation," said Anthony Scardino, executive director of the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission, the state agency that acts as a supergovernment for the parts of 14 cities and towns that make up the region. "It will provide a sense of certainty to both the development and environmental communities, and create a balance between the two."
But the new plan is provoking bitter criticism from environmentalists and some planners, who say it does not go far enough in guaranteeing protection of fragile wetlands, and threatens to lure development away from Newark, Jersey City, Elizabeth and other nearby cities. They say the wetlands should be bought by the state and designated for protection instead of having their future tied to the financial contributions of real estate developers.
"This document simply fails to preserve what needs to be preserved," said Bill Neil, the New Jersey Audubon Society's assistant director for conservation. "And there is no guarantee that the plan won't be reworked again to the detriment of the wetlands."
Mr. Scardino said approval of the plan should speed construction of two major projects that have been on drawing boards for years: the Town Center in Carlstadt, where the Empire Development and Mills Corporations want to build offices, stores, a hotel and 5,000 apartments; and Allied Junction in Secaucus, where Allied Outdoor Advertising plans a 4-million-square-foot office complex and a railroad station linking Amtrak and local commuter lines.
Perhaps most critical to the plan's success are the financial links it envisions between development and wetlands protection at a time of shrinking Federal and state environmental budgets. It calls on developers to fill part of the void in government financing -- contributing more than $300 million for environmental work -- and do so at a time when the weak economies of New Jersey and New York City have discouraged almost all new construction.
Still, after seven years of preparation, the meadowlands commission plans to issue an environmental impact report on the new plan in late May. That will begin a process of public comment, which officials say they hope will lead to final approval by the end of the year.
If the new plan is adopted, it will come after slow and uneven progress in reclaiming an area of garbage-strewn marshland that by the 1960's had become a national symbol of environmental abuse in the same way that the South Bronx symbolized urban blight.
The state's biggest success in the meadowlands has been shutting down all but one of 27 garbage dumps that received more than 30 percent of New Jersey's garbage.
Although little garbage now ends up in the meadowlands, only five of the dumps have been cleaned up enough to stop leaking toxic material, and the 20-year plan calls for dedicating 60 percent of the money raised for environmental protection to cleaning up the old landfills, two of which are so severely polluted that they are on the Federal Government's list of Superfund sites.
While environmental projects have moved slowly in the meadowlands, so too has development. Particularly disappointing to some officials has been the pace of housing construction. Seventy thousand new homes, mostly apartments, were envisioned in the original master plan; only 3,000 have been built. (The new plan sets a goal of 14,000.)
State and Federal officials attribute the slow pace of development in part to the deep economic slump that brought almost all new construction in the region to a halt in the late 1980's. But they say a more important constraint has been Federal environmental laws, mainly the Clean Water Act and Coastal Zone Preservation Act, both passed in the 1970's, that created layers of bureaucracy and red tape.
Now, according to Robert Hargrove of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, applications for new development in the meadowlands languish for six years or more as they are reviewed by more than a dozen state and Federal agencies.
He said one of the biggest benefits of the proposed 20-year plan had come in the process of drafting it, since his agency, the Army Corps of Engineers, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and other agencies have agreed to work closely together in the application process, shortening it to less than a year.
In contrast to the 1972 master plan, in which 1,800 acres of the 20,000-acre meadowlands district were designated for development, the new plan sets aside only 850 acres for new development.
For developers, the biggest change is the requirement that they contribute to a pool of funds for environmental cleanup. They would pay $4 into the fund for every square foot they build. And since some of the new projects would be huge, the fees could add up quickly. Counting those fees, state and Federal grants, and income from the meadowlands' garbage transfer station, officials hope to raise nearly $1 billion for cleanup.
Still, the plan has provoked sharp criticism, not just from environmentalists but also from some of the 14 municipalities that were forced to give up their local zoning powers when the district was established in 1969. "They are going to inundate us with traffic and overly dense development, and it's just not fair," said Mayor Anthony E. Just of Secaucus.
But Mr. Scardino of the meadowlands commission said he was confident that the plan would be adopted because of the unusual consensus that has formed among state and Federal agencies. "This is a state-of-the-art approach to reversing the degradation in what has been the country's most severely assaulted wetlands area," he said.

Where Hope's Eternal and Jackpots Are Few

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
"BE HERE by 8:45 sharp," Mary Fasano had warned me when I bought my $18 ticket. "They wait for nobody."
I'm there by 8:30, and the bus is full of people in late middle-age and beyond -- the cannon fodder of Atlantic City's slot-machine-based casino economy. Mrs. Fasano waves me on. She is a cheerful woman who owns a candy store in Nutley. She also runs a monthly bus trip to Trump Castle. 
 She is a tiny player in a big business. Day and night, casino charter buses ply the highways of the Northeast like those farm-labor buses of old. Last year, more than 300,000 of them brought 8.5 million passengers to Atlantic City casinos; most were slot players gamely seeking that elusive jackpot.
Mrs. Fasano's trips leave in the middle of a month. "People usually have to wait to get their Social Security checks," she explains. One man brings as much as $1,000, "but a lot of them are in the $300 range." A few come not to gamble but to socialize. The quarters the casinos hand out to prime the pump buy a very nice lunch if you don't drop them in a slot machine first.
Brandishing her clipboard cruise activities-director style, Mrs. Fasano works the aisle to see that everyone is content. The bus leaves right on time. "Here we go!" an elderly man yelps.
Once out on the Garden State Parkway, Mrs. Fasano and a friend come up the narrow aisle, selling raffle tickets. "Compliments of S. W. Brown & Son Funeral Home," the stubs say. Somewhere near Exit 117, I win $6. "Congratulations," booms Frank, the man sitting beside me.
We arrive at 11. A casino employee bounds on board and distributes vouchers for $15 in coins. "I'm impressed," Mrs. Fasano murmers. "I was expecting $10."
"Last time I got $20," a man grumbles as we file out.
The casino is jammed. Mrs. Fasano spots a woman at a dollar slot machine with a bell on top that is ringing like a burglar alarm. "That lady just won $1,000," she explains. Still, she heads for the nickel machines. "Your money lasts longer that way."
Though I am the youngest passenger on the trip, I am plenty old enough to remember Atlantic City before the casinos came. Among the wonders of the old Steel Pier was the Piano Playing Duck. When a dime was dropped in the slot, this duck would waddle out of its cage and peck enthusiastically at a toy piano. Because the duck did not get a food pellet each time, its behavior appeared to be motivated solely by optimism. For that duck, hope sprang eternal.
Now I learn that the duck was a harbinger. It was really demonstrating the basic principle of the slot machine. According to Scott Wood, a professor of psychology at Drake University, slot machines are variations on the "Skinner box" -- devices that employ intermittent rewards to reinforce certain behavior in lab animals. Just as a duck can be conditioned to peck at a piano, the professor explains, slot machines elicit "behavior that is very, very persistent and will last for an extended time."
Last year, slot players engaging in some very persistent behavior lost $2.3 billion in the slot machines at Atlantic City's 12 casinos, which make twice as much money from slots as from all other forms of gambling combined. Overwhemingly, these frequent slot players are retired people living on pensions and Social Security.
After getting my free quarters at Trump Castle, I catch a jitney to the Boardwalk and saunter into the huge Taj Mahal, across from Steel Pier. Trading my quarters for dollars, I drop one into a machine and pull the handle. To my astonishment, the machine shrieks and spits out 60 dollar coins. Easy money! Twenty sweaty minutes later, the machine has taken it all back. I skulk out into the flourescent seashore glare, glad the duck isn't still around to say I told you so.
By 5 o'clock, as we line up for our trip home, the departure area at Trump Castle looks like the Port Authority at rush hour.
"How much did you lose?" a gray-haired woman in front of me asks.
"Oh, I spent the day walking. How about you?"
"A little over two hundred. But it was a nice day out."
Mrs. Fasano checks us us all off on her clipboard. As our bus joins the long procession of charters headed home, it seems to ride high and easy on the road. I figure that's probably because it's about 5,000 bucks lighter.

HEADLINE: HMO Or No?

BYLINE: By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE 

 BODY:
THE VOICE on the home phone was daughter Amy's. "Dad," she said, "I'm sitting here with a book with a list of doctors: Which one do I choose?"
Her father is Dr. Stanley S. Bergen Jr., president of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. But despite his long years of experience and exalted position in New Jersey medicine, he could not be of great help to his daughter. He knew a few of the doctors on the list provided by her new health maintenance organization, her H.M.O., but not well enough to recommend one. "It's a strange way to have to pick a doctor, isn't it?" he reflected. 
 Strange, and increasingly commonplace.
As the nation's medical system is tortuously transformed after years of sharply increasing costs, Americans find themselves faced with all manner of baffling decisions about their health care:
* Should they continue to get health care in the traditional manner, by seeing their own independent physicians, paying a fee for each visit and filing a claim with an insurance company?
* Should they heed the promise of lower costs and sign up with the rapidly expanding managed-care companies that provide and manage all their medical care for a set monthly fee?
* And if they do decide to switch, what kind of managed-care system should they join and how should they navigate it to their best advantage?
Here in New Jersey, as around the nation, more and more people are considering their options and deciding to make the change. As recently as two years ago, only 10 percent of New Jerseyans belonged to H.M.O.'s, according to the State Health Department. Today, that number has more than doubled; in a recent New York Times poll, 30 percent of New Jerseyans questioned said they belonged to H.M.O.'s. (This month the New Jersey Supreme Court recognized the growing reach of H.M.O.'s when it ruled that they should no longer be shielded from malpractice suits.)
This movement to managed care has given rise to a furious debate whose central ingredients are money, medical ethics and the quality of care. Though there can be little dispute that managed care has tempered health-care costs, many in the medical community fear that the companies' determination to do just that has compromised the quality of the care they offer. The managed-care companies and their supporters argue, in turn, that costs can be cut without harming quality, and they cite patient-satisfaction surveys to buttress their arguments.
Though several studies are under way to assess these issues, their answers are a long way away. In announcing one of these studies recently, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation of Princeton said that while "managed-care executives are constantly trying to make their operations more efficient to save costs, they do not yet have a systematic method for assessing the ethical dimensions of their decisions."
Still, amid all the point-counterpoint, one thing is sure: The pressure to switch to managed care is considerable and will only increase as employers muster carrots and sticks to keep their own health insurance costs in check.
So what is the consumer to do? In New Jersey, some of the most difficult decisions may be faced by the families of 300,000 state- and local-government employees who have had virtually free medical care for years. This year, Governor Whitman is proposing to give them a choice: switch to an H.M.O. or have the state pick up only a portion of the traditional health insurance premiums. "Christie Whitman says it's time the state entered the real world," remarked one state official.
But while that official considers herself quite knowledgeable about the health-care options available in the state, even she is at sea: should she pay the $40 a month it will cost her to continue with her own doctor, whom she has been satisfied with, or save the money and try something new? "At the moment," she said, "I have no idea what to do."
 
Getting Started
The A B C's of H.M.O.'s
These days, when it comes time to sign up for a health-care plan, you will probably find yourself staring at a forbidding bundle of folders, each containing vast amounts of information about different managed-care plans or generally more expensive traditional insurance policies.
In making your decision, then, first understand precisely what these new managed-care creatures are. An H.M.O., a dominant form of managed care, is usually a for-profit or nonprofit company that hires doctors under contract to treat patients for a set range of fees. Another common, and simpler, form is a preferred provider organization, or P.P.O., usually a network of physicians who have signed up with an insurance company and agree to treat its enrollees at below-standard rates.
Once in an H.M.O., you select a primary-care physician, called a "gatekeeper," who will do your checkups and treat a range of common illnesses. Generally, whenever you want to see a specialist, you must first see the primary-care physician, then get approval and a written referral to a specialist in the company's network. Though there is normally a small co-payment for each primary-care visit, from about $2 to $15, you pay no deductible, fill out no reimbursement forms and pay nothing more to see the approved specialist.
There can be a catch, however: if your gatekeeper keeps the gate closed and denies you permission to see a specialist, you may be out of luck. You can appeal. But that can be tedious or time-consuming under some plans. And you may lose the appeal.
Most H.M.O.'s also offer what may prove to be best of all worlds, a "point-of-service option," which, for a higher cost, lets you see a specialist outside the network.
The second thing to remember is that consumers' costs are beginning to come down under managed care. On average, the cost of premiums and doctor visits is significantly lower with H.M.O.'s than with fee-for-service plans. As a result, after years of steady increases, the average cost of health benefits for American workers declined last year to $3,741 from $3,781 the year before, according to a recent survey by Foster Higgins, a benefits consulting firm. During the same period, the Federal Labor Department reports, employers' insurance costs dropped by 1 percent.
But these economies cut to the heart of many of the criticisms of managed care. In their most general form, the fee-for-service doctors' arguments against managed care go like this: By managing health care with restrictions on what a patient may or may not do, the companies' decisions can place money before medicine. Furthermore, they say, quality suffers when patient and doctor are forced to give up the mutual trust, and the physician's knowledge of medical history, built up over the years.
"Making a profit is the American way, but there is something almost obscene about that quantity of dollars suddenly being earned," said Dr. Fred M. Palace, president of the Medical Society of New Jersey. "Making money has to be secondary. The first consideration must be the health of the patient, and that is often not the case with the health-care corporations. The bottom line is the primary consideration."
To Dale Florio, counsel to the New Jersey H.M.O. Association, these criticisms are attempts "to strike fear into the hearts of consumers" by doctors "afraid they are going to lose money." But, he said, "consumers are smart and willing to forgo the personal in favor of a health system that provides for all their needs." As for the argument that patient-doctor relationships will be severed in H.M.O.'s, Mr. Florio says consumers are finding it easier to stay with one doctor, the H.M.O. primary-care physician, than in the past, when they might have gone from one costly specialist to another.
The H.M.O.'s also point to their own national surveys, which most of them say show a high level of patient satisfaction, often greater than 90 percent. But it is not always easy to know precisely what is being surveyed. Tod Cooperman, president of Care Data Reports, an independent research group, said that while "the plans try to put their best material forward," the range of satisfaction goes from a high of 70 percent "highly satisfied" to 62 percent "dissatisfied."
By and large, the satisfied patients they are talking about are people like Marcia Gilbert of North Brunswick, who has been a Health Insurance Plan member since 1976. At first, she said, she was reluctant to leave a family doctor to join an H.M.O. but now she and her husband, both retired, are "extremely satisfied."
"We have always received what we needed -- and more," she said. "Twice we thought my husband was having a heart attack. Fortunately he wasn't, but the care and service he got were wonderful."
 
The Debate, Part 1
Calling In a Specialist
 To the critics of managed care in New Jersey, the problems have less to do with primary care than with what happens when a patient is seriously ill or injured. What they are seeing, they insist, are more than isolated anecdotal cases of bad medicine. They complain about patterns of problems in four areas: illnesses requiring care by a specialist; emergency decisions; premature hospital discharges of patients who suffer complications, and mental health. (All of these issues are now being studied by the State Health Commission, which is preparing its first revision of H.M.O. rules in two decades, due this summer.)
Often, the critics contend, the managed-care companies' restrictions keep patients from seeing the specialists they need.
Dr. James A. Charles, a neurologist in northern New Jersey, tells of a woman in her 40's, a member of H.M.O.-Blue (a New Jersey Blue Cross affiliate), who had a rare blood-clotting disorder, antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome. This was causing strokes that were, in turn, causing almost uncontrollable epileptic seizures. Dr. Charles, a consulting physician on the case, thought it crucial that the woman see one of the world's leading experts in this disorder, Dr. Orrin Devinsky at New York University Medical Center, who agreed to take the case.
"I received a phone call from an H.M.O.-Blue nurse," Dr. Charles recalled. "She said she had never heard of the disease, and directed me to the physicians' supervisor, a Dr. Platt. He told me he was looking to cut costs, and that the patient could be treated in New Jersey. He berated me, saying he had heard stories before from other physicians who want to transfer patients to New York or Philadelphia or Boston for more expensive treatment out of network. Five minutes later, I got another call from an H.M.O-Blue neurologist, a Dr. Wasserstrom, who said he agreed with me that the patient should go N.Y.U." In the end, though, he declined to authorize the transfer, saying H.M.O.-Blue was trying to cut costs.
Dr. Charles added: "This story had a happy ending: Her husband's insurance company authorized the transfer; she was treated in New York and is now doing well." But he said the case illustrated the seriousness of the problem.
H.M.O.-Blue said that neither the organization nor Dr. Ronald Platt would comment on the case, out of respect for patient confidentiality. But Dr. William Wasserstrom acknowledged that he had discussed the case with Dr. Charles. He declined to comment further, other than to ask how the patient had made out; when told, he said, "All's well that ends well."
Spokesmen for the H.M.O. industry say its doctors are as eager as anyone to have a top specialist treat a complicated case when necessary. Indeed, the Fragale family of Hewitt had just such an experience.
Starting when he was just a week old, the Fragales' son, Patrick, needed three rare operations to fix his heart, which had formed without a left ventricle or mitral and aortic valves. The odds against him were high, and several times during the months after the first two surgeries, his lungs filled with fluid. He turned blue and was near death. Then, to everyone's amazement, he began to spring back with full force.
In the midst of all this, his mother, Kara, recalled, the Fragales heard from their fee-for-service insurance carrier.
"Our insurance company started asking questions and said it would pay only a certain amount of the bills, leaving the balance of this financial burden on us," she said. "Here we were trying to save our son's life. It was just not something we wanted to deal with at that moment."
But Patrick's father then changed jobs and switched to U.S. Healthcare H.M.O.-N.J. When the day came for the third operation, Mrs. Fragale said, their new H.M.O. said, "No problem, just worry about your son." U.S. Healthcare never questioned the bills and paid them promptly -- "without the high deductibles we were used to."
"I never wanted to switch to an H.M.O.," she went on. "But they were great!"
 
The Debate, Part 2
Coping With a Crisis
Emergency care and hospital discharges are two other areas in which the fee-for-service doctors say sound medical judgment is often brushed aside in an effort to hold down costs.
For example, some physicians who work for H.M.O.'s said the companies had told them to transfer patients from non-network hospitals to network hospitals, even though they were too sick to be moved. Similarly, they told of having been discouraged from moving critically ill patients into intensive care until space opened up at a network hospital, rather than transferring the patient to the first open space at any nearby hospital. But the doctors were unwilling to speak for attribution, saying they feared having their H.M.O. contracts canceled.
Mr. Florio of the H.M.O. association said he could not comment on any such cases without knowing the details but insisted that H.M.O. doctors were under no such pressure. "They know an emergency is an emergency," he said.
The last main area of debate is mental health. Dr. George Wilson, chairman of psychiatry at Monmouth Medical Center, who has studied patient complaints for the New Jersey Psychiatric Association, says managed care is often inadequate or nonexistent for patients with serious long-term conditions -- clinical depression and anxiety, bipolarism and schizophrenia.
"Most H.M.O. plans are designed to provide short-term crisis intervention, brief anxiety or family conflicts, illnesses of brief duration," he said, adding that some lack enough psychiatrists. "There is pressure on the primary-care physician to treat these people themselves, financial disincentives not to refer them to the specialists. So they will prescribe Prozac, for example, thinking it has no side effects -- which is true in most cases but not all -- and they lack the expertise to detect the difference and properly monitor the medicated patient."
Recently, Dr. Wilson said, he had to hospitalize a Health Improvement Plan patient who was on an antidepressant, was not properly monitored and became suicidal.
Dr. Jack Ward, chief of the Center for Human Development, which provides mental health services for H.I.P., said he could not comment on the case since the patient's name was not given. But generally, he said, a consumer will have all the options an employer has contracted for. With H.I.P., he said, the basic plans provide for short-term crisis intervention, but some of its more expensive options do offer long-term care.
"What you get is what you pay for," he said, and when employers want to economize, "the first thing they seem to cut out is mental health health benefits." But, he added, this has become just as true with traditional insurance plans.
 
Decision Time
Charting the Territory
If neither side in this medical battleground has yet proved superiority, the case studies cited by the doctors can help you chart the managed-care territory.
The first step in assessing a managed-care plan is to seek information about the primary-care physicians, specialists and hospitals in your area, which are all listed in the brochures. As one doctor concerned about the managed-care trend said: "Remember, there are docs and not-so-good docs, good hospitals and not-so-good." So ask around. Ask the benefits people at your company who hear about good and bad experiences; ask friends, relatives. And ask doctors you respect if they are in a plan or if they know good physicians who are.
Call the plans you're considering and ask these questions:
* What is a plan's percentage of board-certified doctors (those who have passed national examinations establishing expertise in a specialty), as opposed to those simply licensed to practice medicine? Some plans have this important information readily available; some do not. You'll especially want to know if a primary-care physician is a board-certified internist.
* What does the plan cover -- or not cover? If you know you have a rare disease or a genetic predisposition toward such a disease, does the plan cover it? If there is chronic mental illness in the family, does the plan cover that?
* Does the plan have a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week appeals process available for emergencies, or a 48-hour response period for urgent matters?
* What are the monthly premiums? In comparing costs, remember to factor the deductible into any fee-for-service plan. Most H.M.O.'s don't have deductibles.
* How much does the company pay the primary-care physician? Generally, the good doctors tend to sign with the plans whose compensation they think is best. And how are the doctors paid? Network doctors and the H.M.O.'s frequently argue over whether the amounts and methods of payment discourage the doctor from making referrals or providing comprehensive treatment. Find out if a doctor feels pressure to limit referrals and keep treatments short.
* If you're not happy with your primary-care physician, can you switch to another in the network at any time?
* What does the H.M.O. offer for mental-health care?
* What does the H.M.O. offer if you want to go outside the network? And how much do these options cost?
 
The Future
Best of Both Worlds?
 Here in New Jersey, in an attempt to respond to the criticism that managed care is too beholden to the bottom line, several new plans are starting to talk as much about quality as cost. In a variety of ways, they seek to give the patient the best of the old and new ways of providing health care.
One of the fastest-growing H.M.O.'s is Oxford, and its managers contend that a principal reason is its emphasis on point of service, which enables a patient to go outside of network if he believes it necessary.
Citing similar motivations, two other plans have set up shop in New Jersey in the last year. One of them, First Option, was founded and is controlled by a group of doctors and hospitals. With no stockholders to answer to, its president, John Odessa, explained, the company's board has voted to limit its profit margin to 5 percent.
The other is a statewide academic-medicine managed-care organization, University Healthcare. Built around the state's six teaching hospitals, it was set up in March by the University of Medicine and Dentistry. Each of its preferred provider networks is made up largely of doctors and facilities affiliated with the teaching hospitals and under contract with University Healthcare to provide service at reduced rates.
To Dr. Bergen, the university's president, University Healthcare balances the economies of managed care and academic medicine's attention to high quality. Referring to skyrocketing health costs that led to the rise of managed care, he said, "I don't think there is any doubt that the doctors were culpable, but now with private companies taking over, the potential is there for the organization of medicine to become so commercialized that we lose sight of the need to treat and care for our patients."

Mortgage Rates Nearing Lows of a Year Ago

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
YOU wouldn't know it from the weak housing market of the last few months, but mortgage rates have been falling steadily to their lowest level in almost a year.
For anyone thinking about buying a home, long-term loans at fixed rates look especially attractive. The national average rate on a 30-year mortgage fell to 8.48 percent on Wednesday, from a recent peak of 9.41 percent on Dec. 16, according to HSH Associates, a mortgage research company in Butler, N.J. It is now at its lowest point since June 10. At current rates, the monthly payment on a standard $100,000 mortgage is $767, versus $834 at the peak. 
 Mortgages with rates that adjust periodically have not dipped as much. The national average for a one-year adjustable mortgage was 6.30 percent on Wednesday, down from its recent high of 6.90 percent on Jan. 20.
"The rate gap between fixed-rate mortgages and adjustables has closed," said Keith T. Gumbinger, an analyst with HSH Associates. The gap had been unusually wide for many months, making adjustables more attractive, he said, but it has now settled back to the normal 2 to 2.5 percentage points.
Home buyers have reacted, predictably, by taking out more fixed-rate loans. Adjustables accounted for just 44 percent of the loans made in March, down from 59 percent in January, according to the Federal Housing Finance Board in Washington. (The figures for adjustables include hybrid loans, which carry fixed rates for several years and then adjust to a market rate.)
Shifting consumer preferences may have less to do with which type of loan is a better deal than with which direction rates are headed. "When rates go up, people start to buy more A.R.M.'s," Mr. Gumbinger said. "And when rates go down, they start to buy more fixed."
Personal factors, like how long people expect to live in a house, come into play as well. But certainty beats uncertainty hands down for many borrowers. Most adjustable loans have lifetime caps of 6 percentage points, so a 6.9 percent adjustable loan could rise to 12.9 percent someday.
Home sales have not been rising as some might expect and as many would hope in a time of falling rates. Sales of previously owned homes rose 5.8 percent in March, for the first advance in three months, but remained far lower than a year earlier. The previous month, sales fell 5.3 percent to the lowest level since August 1992. The bright spot is the Midwest, where sales are brisk.
New homes are even harder to move than old ones. In February, the most recent month for which statistics are available, new home sales declined 14 percent to the lowest level in almost three years, according to the Commerce Department.
Housing analysts suggest that sales are sluggish in part because of lingering job insecurity, unfavorable demographics, slow wage growth and a lack of affordable homes, particularly for first-time buyers.
"You have a jaded populace out there that is demanding affordable starter homes, and in places like the Midwest, where there is an inventory of those kind of homes, the market is doing well," Mr. Gumbinger said. "In other places, where you don't have this inventory, it is not."
Although attractive in historical terms, rates have not tumbled to the 25-year lows that many people remember seeing just 18 months ago, when fixed-rate loans were as low as 7 percent, and adjustables had initial teaser rates as low as 3 percent.
Some analysts also suggest that just as potential buyers jump into the market when rates start to rise (to get head ahead of any further increases), they also delay buying homes when rates are falling (to catch rates when they hit bottom).

Gramley, a consulting economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington and a former governor of the Federal Reserve Board, found signs of a consumer awakening in the March numbers. Home buyers may have finally realized that interest rates are favorable and that lenders are aggressive, he said. One large builder, Kaufman & Broad Home Corporation in Sacramento, Calif., announced last week that it is offering mortgages with no money down on its homes priced under $315,000.
Analysts are divided about whether rates will fall much further. "This time last year, people were predicting 10 percent interest rates," Mr. Gumbinger said, when asked about the possibility of rising rates.
Mr. Gramley said he did not expect long-term rates to rise substantially unless the Federal Reserve raises short-term rates again. "We are probably in a period of stability for the time being," he said.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT: IN THE VINEYARD;
Immigrant's Search For Logic Leads Him To Top of C.P.A. Class

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE 

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I.

 BODY:
FOR Vitaly Sorkin, life is not what it used to be. When he immigrated here from the Soviet Union in 1990 he spoke little English and worked in a deli. "You want lettuce on that?" he used to say. "Mustard or mayonnaise? Tomatoes?"
Now Mr. Sorkin is an accountant with a Big Six firm, KPMG Peat Marwick. And he says that complicated terms like amortization, depreciation and intangible assets are a piece of cake. 
 It's a classic: the hard-driving immigrant. But Mr. Sorkin is not merely upwardly mobile. By one measure, he has gone higher than anyone else. Just a few months after his graduation from Bryant College in Smithfield, R.I., he earned the best score in the nation on the legendarily difficult Certified Public Accountant exam.
In other words, just as he switched from Russian to English, this 23-year-old son of Communism also mastered capitalism's main language in five years.
"It was a pretty hard test," he said, swishing a prawn through clarified butter at a downtown restaurant here. "But . . ." He trailed off, modestly.
Very modestly, in fact. Only about 12 percent of prospective C.P.A.'s pass the four-section, 15 and a half-hour exam on their first try.
Mark M. Chain, a partner at another of the Big Six firms, Deloitte & Touche, said many of the field's top people had taken the test three or four times before they could put those three letters after their names.
"Anyone who passes the first time, much less gets the highest score, it's pretty amazing." he said, confessing that he took the test three times.
Moreover, Mr. Sorkin was not flush with resources on either side of the Atlantic. He was born into a working-class family in Gomel, a small city 175 miles southeast of Minsk in Belarus.
"In Russia it's not what you know but who you know that counts -- and we didn't know anyone," he said, laughing. It didn't help that Gomel was the site of some of Chernobyl's heaviest fallout.
So Mr. Sorkin and his family immigrated to Pawtucket, R.I., on Feb. 12, 1990. His father found work as a mechanic and his mother cleaned rooms at a nursing home, while Mr. Sorkin and his younger brother went to school.
Mr. Sorkin said he majored in accounting to be able to make a living right out of college. But he also gives other reasons for his career choice -- and in them are clues to the desire that took him so far, so fast.
"I was drawn to accounting because I was curious about America," he said. "Business is the engine of the society. Here the system is rational. There's a procedure for everything, from getting movie tickets to doing a leveraged buyout. Once I plugged into the logic of how things work, I was, like they say, a duck in water."
He paused, then traced the story back again to his childhood in Russia.
He recalled the ever-longer lines for basic goods in the late 1980's as the Soviet system breathed its last gasps, with crime and rampant inflation rising and expectations nonexistent.
"As a student there I was drawn to math because it was logic and order," he said. "It was a rational realm in a world without reason."
And now he is surrounded by the order he craves.
"When the results came back from the test everyone here congratulated me and I got a small bonus," he said, popping another prawn into his mouth. "Then it was back to work. That's how it goes here."

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
Here's a Course in Personal Finance 101, the Hard Way

BYLINE: By ROBERT BRYCE 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
NICOLE WALTERS, a 20-year-old junior at the University of Texas, carries two Visa cards, two Mastercards, two department store credit cards -- and two part-time jobs to dig herself out of debt.
"I was buying things here and there and all of a sudden, $4,000 later, those little things added up," Ms. Walters said. She recalls buying a $600 car stereo, some clothes and gas for her car, but nothing else major. 
 Just a few hours on the university campus here turned up nearly a dozen students with similar tales of woe: a 19-year-old freshman with five cards said he owed $2,200, a 22-year-old senior acknowledged running up $8,000 on eight cards and a 26-year-old senior described $9,000 in bills on eight cards. The spending sprees weren't for school-related essentials, but for personal items and luxuries. For the card holders who graduate with thousands of dollars in student loans, too, managing the debt may amount to a crash course in personal finance.
Credit counselors in college towns across the country say students with large card debts are increasingly common. "Five years ago, we weren't seeing anybody still in college with as much debt as we are seeing now," said Candace Acevedo of the San Francisco office of the Consumer Credit Counseling Service, a nonprofit group providing financial education and debt advice. Five percent of the clients in her debt management program are students with at least $5,000 in credit card debt, she said. And the group's other offices in big college towns like Austin, Raleigh, N.C., and Columbia, Mo., report similar figures.
Although some students reach out to credit counseling agencies for help when their card bills become overwhelming, many resort to the most reliable creditors of all: Mom and Dad. Thus, parents paying for books, tuition and housing may also wind up paying their son's or daughter's Visa and American Express bills. If they don't pick it up before, parents may be tempted to pay off card debt at college graduation so their children can embark on their working lives without a burden.
"I think it's the parents who really take the brunt of this," said Irene Leech, a credit counselor and assistant professor of consumer studies at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Va. "Parents want their child to have the best, so they do all they can to help their children deal with these debts."
For a student, a credit card is as readily available as a class syllabus. Card applications are found in bookstores, campus publications and student mailboxes. To attract students, card issuers offer free concerts, plane tickets, T-shirts, even candy. According to Roper College Track, a research division of Roper Starch Worldwide, more than half of the 5.1 million full-time undergraduate students at four-year universities in the United States now have at least one major credit card. Mastercard International estimates that 80 percent of all college students carry a credit card by their senior year.
In 1994, Americans used more than 350 million major credit cards -- Visa, Discover, Mastercard and American Express -- to purchase more than half a trillion dollars of goods and services. With that much plastic money coursing through the system, why are issuers bothering with relatively poor college students?
For one, they want to build loyal customers at an early age. A study several years ago by Marketing Week magazine showed that 75 percent of college students keep their first card for 15 years, and 60 percent keep that card for life. Furthermore, college students are not entirely without money. Roper says the average student has an annual income of $4,000.
But if a student owes $2,000 on a credit card, repaying the debt can take years, especially when interest rates rise. The recent increase in rates caught Kevin LeBlanc by surprise. Mr. LeBlanc, a senior at the University of Texas, has two major credit cards with $500 credit lines, both of which are at their limit. "I just got a letter that said, 'We are changing your interest rate from 14.9 percent to 18.9 percent' and you can't do anything about it," he said.
Before the rate increase, Mr. LeBlanc said, his minimum payment "used to pay off a little bit of the balance." Now, he said, "all it does is pay my interest."
Overall delinquency rates on credit cards have been declining since 1989, when nearly 5 percent of card holders were behind in their payments. Last year, the delinquent portion fell to about 3 percent, but it has risen recently.
Although no statistics are available on late card payments by students, who now account for less than 3 percent of the domestic credit card business, counselors suggest that the group may be having more trouble than other borrowers. "I think it's a much bigger problem than is being recognized," said Allen Clary, a credit counselor in Raleigh, who figures that the average student in his program has $10,000 in card debt.
If students were falling hopelessly behind on their debts and refusing to pay, card issuers would undoubtedly stop lending to them. James Daly, editor of Credit Card News, a newsletter published in Chicago, says the parental safety net may keep that from happening. As credit risks, college students look no worse than the rest of the population, he said. But he added, "My impression is that a lot of them are getting help from their parents."
Critics say the card issuers have courted collegians too aggressively. Last year, Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, the Massachusetts Democrat, threatened to introduce legislation that would limit the ability of issuers to provide credit cards to students. Mr. Kennedy also conducted a hearing of the House Banking subcommittee on consumer credit and insurance to hear complaints from students and parents about the industry.
RUTH E. SUSSWEIN, executive director of the Bankcard Holders of America, a consumer advocacy group based in Salem, Va., testified at the hearing. In a recent interview, she said students "are being encouraged to put all these things on plastic" -- things like vacations.
Rus Maxham, a sophomore engineering student from Dallas, owes $2,200 on his credit cards, mostly because of a skiing trip to Lake Tahoe for spring break. Are credit cards too easy to get? "Yes," Mr. Maxham said. "A Visa card came in the mail, and I didn't even ask for it. It said, 'Just call this number to activate it.' It's like they're saying, 'Here's some rope, kid. Go hang yourself.' "
For several years, Ms. Susswein has been pushing credit card companies to help educate their young clients. The issuers have responded. American Express has distributed 10,000 personal finance education packets to high school teachers across the country. In 1991, Visa developed a personal finance program that is now used in 10,000 high schools, said Susan Murdy, a spokeswoman for Visa. In 1993, Mastercard created a video program on personal finance, which it has distributed for free to 18,000 high schools.
In general, high schools spend little time teaching students about budgeting and banking. "I think schools are doing a better job on sex education than they are on financial education," said Steve Apesos, a spokesman for Mastercard. "In a survey we did two years ago of 400 high school students, 96 percent of them said they don't get any personal finance education in school."
Some students have gotten the message, whether from their parents or their teachers, and use their credit cards strictly for convenience, fastidiously paying off the balances every month.
Larry Sacks, a senior at the University of Texas majoring in history, carries a Visa and a Mastercard but says he stopped short of taking an American Express card. He says he does not overdo the card purchases. "Who can afford to charge the maximum on them?" asked Mr. Sacks, who comes from St. Louis. "I think they are a dangerous thing, so I pay mine off every month."
What's a student to do if he flunks the credit card test the first time?
Consolidating the bills into student loans at interest rates of 7 to 9 percent may be a less painful way to pay off the cards, most of which charge interest rates of 15 to 20 percent.
Eva Hensley, director of the credit counseling office in Columbia, considers that preferable to a parental rescue. "It doesn't teach the students any responsibility if every time they get into a difficult situation they have their parents bail them out," she said, noting that 26 percent of the clients of her office are students and that their average card debt is $7,500.
Ms. Walters, the University of Texas junior, has not hidden her problem from her parents. During the school year, she has been working about 30 hours a week, on weekend days as a sales clerk and on weekend nights as a restaurant hostess. While she is making progress, she plans to "work a whole lot" this summer to get her debt firmly under control. She has decided not to get any more cards, even though the applications keep rolling in, and she has cut up the ones she had.
"We pay all of her college expenses and insurance for her car, so her only expenses are for clothes and makeup," said Nicole's mother, Anita Walters. Although she and her husband, Bill, a sales manager for a large electronics concern, could easily pay off Nicole's bills, she said they had decided against it. "She has to learn in this day and age that you can't do that," Mrs. Walters said. "Mom and Dad aren't going to be here forever."

HEADLINE: The Art of the Neighborhood Deal

BYLINE: BY TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
BACK in January, when the Parks Department disclosed plans to let a high-priced dinner circus pitch its tent in a small neighborhood park, Ross Graham was not at all pleased. Few words in a leftist's lexicon have a more odious ring than "privatization," and Ms. Graham, who chairs a community board on the West Side, was loath to turn over a patch of public space in her park-poor district to commercial use.
But Ms. Graham is a pragmatist, too, and figured that Community Board 4, an unpaid panel that can advise but not veto, could not count on blocking the $150-a-ticket circus, which happens to be a pet project of Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern. 
 So she decided to cut a deal. The 5.3-acre DeWitt Clinton Park, site of the circus's proposed seven-month run, has been neglected for two decades. Its bleachers are an unusable eyesore, its ball field is practically bare, and prostitutes conduct business under the stone steps at its entrance. If the Department of Parks and Recreation were to agree to a shopping list of improvements, Board 4 might be willing to lend its grudging support.
It was up to Ms. Graham to persuade the city that these concessions were a small price to pay for avoiding noisy protests and public relations problems. Within weeks, Ms. Graham, a veteran horse-trader, got almost everything she wanted: the Parks Department promised to tear down the bleachers, reconstruct two handball courts and two basketball courts, build a dog run, pay for new playground equipment and require producers of the circus, called "Pomp, Duck & Circumstance," to resod the ball field.
But Ms. Graham also had to yield on a couple of points. Getting rid of the stone steps of ill repute, for example, would be prohibitively cumbersome, the board chairwoman was told.
Still, Ms. Graham had obtained enough to go back to her board earlier this month and listen quietly while her carefully crafted deal was loudly denounced. In the end, a resolution endorsing the plan squeaked through by a one-vote margin.
After her nine years on the board, and two as chairman, Ms. Graham, 67, is an old hand at mediating between a community wedded to principle or sometimes resistant to change and a more powerful city government determined to assert its authority.
Compromises like the one on "Pomp, Duck" have become something of a signature. Instead of a reflexive and ineffectual "no," she tries to find a way to say "yes" -- but festoons her resolutions with conditions, like so many Christmas tree lights. While many community boards are assailed as bastions of "not-in-my-neighborhood" obstinacy, Board 4 has developed a reputation as a sophisticated organization with the political skill to leverage its limited powers, the willingness to master the tedious details of local government and the fortitude to withstand heat from constituents.
"Trying to balance everybody's interests and at the same time leading -- it's a challenge, but it's the part that's fun," said Ms. Graham.
Ms. Graham practices her craft in an economically and culturally diverse district, where many people eye the future warily, fearing their neighborhoods are potentially juicy targets of exploitation. Stretching from 14th Street to 59th Street, Board 4 encompasses Chelsea and Clinton, two waterfront communities that have undergone dramatic change in the decades since the city's shipping industry fell into decline. Chelsea's Eighth Avenue has displaced Christopher Street as a major gay center. Closer to the river, new art galleries have been springing up in abandoned loft buildings. Affluent professionals live in well-maintained town houses and send their children to schools once filled by the offspring of Irish dockworkers.
Clinton, also known these days by its once-discarded but more evocative name of Hell's Kitchen, is home to large numbers of low-income theater workers and immigrants, now primarily coming from Central and South America, as well as better-heeled residents, who, lured by the convenience to midtown, have restored some of the tenement buildings in the West 40's. Both the Coliseum and the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center lie within Board 4's boundaries.
"When you say 'Chelsea' or 'Clinton,' you think of a lot of different things -- it's very hard to pin us down," said Ms. Graham. "It's one of the most exciting community boards, because of the different focuses of its various communities."
 
 
NEW POWER, NEW RESPECT
 Ms. Graham's tenure has come at a time when community boards seem to be flexing their muscles in part because of new functions granted them by the last charter revision, and also because of the respect some are able to command with city agencies. The boards, whose members are appointed by the borough president and the City Council members representing a particular district, now have the responsibility to exercise initial review of all proposals to develop or improve property within their district and the authority to develop blueprints for their communities' future.
They also offer a pipeline to local elected officials and a mechanism for disgruntled residents to let off steam. "The people on the fringes are a good foil," said Roberta Brandes Gratz, author of "The Living City." The airing of an extreme, off-the- wall position makes it easier for a moderate view to seem acceptable, she explained.
While the visionaries among its members are preparing for the next century, much of Board 4's time is devoted to more immediate concerns of urban life: whether to give its blessing to a street fair sponsored by a church, how to help a resident fight a noisy neighbor, what to do about a lumber yard whose curbside operations are blocking neighbors' access.
Like the neighborhoods they represent, community boards have distinct personalities. Board 5, in the heart of midtown, has been dubbed the business board because residents make up only a small proportion of its constituents. Board 3, on the Lower East Side, is considered unruly and largely ineffective. Board 8, on the Upper East Side, reflects its more conservative constituency.
"Board 4 is a from-the-neighborhood kind of board -- it's probably the most mixed in the city ethnically, economically and in terms of sexual orientation," said Councilman Thomas K. Duane, who represents most of the district. "It's a gorgeous mosaic, with people from the projects, middle-income co-ops, brownstones and tenements."
In the other boroughs, many boards are said to be controlled by local politicians to a degree that would not be tolerated in Manhattan. "There's a long history," said Ronald Shiffman, a planning commissioner and chairman of the graduate urban planning program at the Pratt Institute. "The boards in Manhattan, from the time that Percy Sutton was borough president, have been more representative of the community and more articulate."
In the often-scruffy world of community activism, the auburn-haired Ms. Graham stands out in her silk blouses and sling-back heels. And in the context of Board 4, Ms. Graham is considered a moderate, in part because she believes that negotiating with opponents "is not necessarily selling out." But asked if she is a socialist, she pauses a moment and murmurs, "Close, close."
Raised in rural Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, Ms. Graham, the daughter of two teachers, became a reporter for The Reading Times in Pennsylvania after graduating from Tufts University and subsequently held several jobs in publicity and trade journalism. Inspired by John F. Kennedy's election as President, she started moonlighting in politics, joining the Chelsea Reform Democratic Club in the early 60's. There, she met State Senator Manfred Ohrenstein and in 1964, quit her dead-end post at Paper Trade Journal to become his aide.
It was the beginning of a political partnership that lasted until her retirement in 1985. "Ross literally was the first woman to be a major staffer in Albany," said Mr. Ohrenstein, a longtime Senate minority leader. She was a key participant in New York's five-year effort to legalize abortion.
Ms. Graham made her only bid for elective office in 1972, when she dropped a challenge to Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, a West Side Democrat. She then focused on getting other women elected, and today, she is president of Eleanor's List, a political action committee she helped found with the goal of getting more pro-abortion Democratic women into the New York State Legislature.
Her political experience makes her unique on a board whose members include a retired social worker, a guidance counselor, an optometrist, an artist and a public relations consultant. Some would not be happy being described as left-wing, but they share a sort of urban populist ideology: to prevent low-income people from being driven out; to rehabilitate existing housing stock wherever possible, rather than rebuild; to welcome social service agencies as long as they are modest in size and not bunched together, and to oppose allowing business improvement districts to take on government functions like sanitation.
During her two-year term as chairwoman, which ends in June, Ms. Graham has focused much of her attention on the future of Clinton and Chelsea and the long-delayed first steps to develop the waterfront. Her goal is to prevent these neighborhoods from going the way of, say, Yorkville, and being transformed into Third Avenue-like enclaves of bland high-rises.
"On the other hand, I want them to continue to thrive, and that means some kind of development -- new kinds of commerce within the scale we have," she said.
A step in this direction was taken last year when the city finally agreed to pay attention to a decade-old community-generated plan that aims to preserve Clinton's mix of residential, commercial and light industry spaces. It all came down to a basic horse trade: trucks for housing.
Ms. Graham saw her opening when the Giuliani Administration had to quickly find parking spaces for 60 sanitation trucks parked under the Williamsburg Bridge or face losing $95 million in Federal funds for rehabilitating the bridge. Other community boards flatly rejected the trucks, but Board 4 was willing to cooperate, provided that the city agree to let the board choose the site and meet certain other demands, including taking the Clinton plan out of mothballs, rehabilitating six dilapidated apartment buildings in the area and accelerating the board's move to nicer quarters in the old McGraw-Hill building on 42d Street.
Ms. Graham recalls that at one meeting, Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter expressed concern about the cost of relocating the trucks. "It seems to me, a little extra money to make the community less unhappy may be worth it to you,"' Ms. Graham said she told Ms. Reiter. At the same time, she remembers, Borough President Ruth W. Messinger was telling administration officials "that they were getting an extraordinarily cooperative community board on one of their crises, and they should be good to us."
The deal was struck at a subsequent meeting attended by several politicians and city officials against a backdrop of great urgency.
The upshot was that, for the first time, said Alice K. Olson, head of the Clinton Urban Renewal Area Task Force and Ms. Graham's predecessor as Board 4 chairwoman, the city took a serious look at her group's plan. More recently, housing officials agreed to allow a corporation formed by the community to begin seeking financing to implement the plan. "She made it happen," said Ms. Olson, referring to Ms. Graham's arm-twisting.
 
LIMITING HIGH-RISES AND USING THE PIERS
 In Chelsea, where Ms. Graham has lived in a one-bedroom apartment since 1966, she is engaged in a philosophical battle with the City Planning Department over where future high-rise buildings in that neighborhood should be situated. Board 4's blueprint for Chelsea, also a decade in the making, calls for rezoning to prevent what she describes as "tunnels of high-rises" from developing on Eighth and Ninth Avenues and altering the neighborhood's aesthetics.
As Chelsea grew, Ms. Graham notes approvingly, taller buildings like the Chelsea Hotel on 23d Street and St. Peter's Episcopal Church on 20th Street were placed in the middle of the block, alongside smaller row houses, rather than on the avenues.
But so far she has struck out with department officials and can only hope the board will win over the Planning Commission itself, which now has some community board alumni among its members.
When the Chelsea plan was on the drawing board, the building boom of the '80s was in full swing and encroaching development was a preoccupation at Board 4. But the collapse of the real estate market has helped nudge waterfront issues to the forefront and turned them into the current obsession.
Ms. Graham and the board helped expedite a $100 million project that is bringing a huge sports complex to several piers between 17th and 22d streets, and they have taken a lot of flak for it. Gloria Sukenick, a Chelsea resident for 25 years, said the Chelsea Piers project was rammed through without community support. "We wanted a view of the river, not this," she said.
But an unimpeded view of the Hudson was never an option, said Ms. Graham, who was co-chair of the board's Waterfront Planning and Preservation Committee when the sports complex was first proposed; certain points along the river had been designated by the state as revenue-generators for the park that is to be built along the river once Route 9A, the successor to the abandoned Westway, is completed. The alternative to the athletic complex could easily have been luxury housing rather than "something that the whole community could use," she maintained.
Once again, she extorted concessions in exchange for the board's cooperation. Project managers were required to provide public access around all of the piers, and had to leave a large part of Pier 62 sports-free so people could enjoy the river. To her regret, she lost one battle that resulted in the rest of Pier 62's being allotted for two in-line skating tracks, which are slated to open in June. But the deal also stipulates that these tracks be dismantled when Route 9A is finished.
Roland W. Betts, chairman of Chelsea Piers, had approached the board with trepidation. "If you get into a stink with a community board, it's going to be a hell of a lot harder to get it done," he said, referring to his project. "We lucked out in that we have a constructive board, a board that recognized that the public and private sectors can and should work together. A lot of other boards just say, 'No, no, no.' "
 
 
SYNERGY OR MANIPULATION?
 The Chelsea Piers project also highlighted the potential conflicts that can occur when community leaders who are also business people help to broker a commercial project. Ms. Graham's co-chair on the waterfront committee, Michael Kramer, was the object of unwanted attention after his family-owned company, Audio Speaker Technics, agreed to install the sound systems at the sports complex. "He is doing a ton of work for us," said Mr. Betts.
Defending Mr. Kramer, Ms. Graham said he did not enter into a deal with Chelsea Piers until "long after the basic arrangement" for the complex was completed. "I don't think it was in Michael's mind," she added.
Mr. Kramer said he withdrew from all discussion and decisions involving Chelsea Piers once he started doing business with Mr. Betts.
Under the city's conflict-of-interest rules, community board members are not barred from "having an interest in a firm that may be affected by" the board's action. But the rules also state that members must not vote on any matter "which may result in a personal and direct economic gain to the member or any person with whom the member is associated."
"The whole point of community boards is that they should be made up of people who are interested in and have expertise in things that happen in their community," said Ms. Graham. "What we are careful about is that anyone with a direct financial interest in something is removed from voting on that piece of that activity. But we don't want to lose that person altogether from that activity."
Marc Boddewyn, a landscape architect who is also chairman of the board's Parks and Open Space Committee, is just the kind of person she is talking about. At the April board meeting, two opponents of the "Pomp, Duck" project touched a sensitive nerve when they suggested that he stood to gain financially from alterations to DeWitt Clinton Park.
"Yes, I have worked for the Parks Department as a consultant," Mr. Boddewyn acknowledged, his voice rising. "But no, never have I worked on DeWitt Clinton Park. Nor do I have any possibility of gaining anything from this but pure aggravation." He told the two speakers to "go to hell" but subsequently apologized.
Mr. Boddewyn said in an interview that far from bringing him work, tangling with the Parks Department on a regular basis has done little to endear him to city officials. "It's actually not appreciated by the Parks Department that I'm doing what I'm doing," said Mr. Boddewyn, who quit the board once out of fear of losing future landscape work when the Hudson River Park is finally built. It was Ms. Graham who persuaded him to stay, he said, and he estimated he has spent 80 hours since then working on the DeWitt Clinton issue alone.
The reward? "The reward is that you feel you're not just being NIMBY," he said. "'The easiest thing in the world would be to say 'no' to 'Pomp, Duck & Circumstance.' The difference with Ross was that she was able to keep a debate going that let us explore the potential of this offer fully. That was her greatest gift here."
 
 
 
Community Boards: A Primer
Who's Who
There are 59 boards. Each has a maximum of 50 members, half of whom are appointed by the Borough President and half by the district's City Council members. Members serve without compensation and must live, work or have some other "significant interest" in the district.
 
The History
Community boards have evolved gradually since their origins in 1951, when Manhattan Borough President Robert F. Wagner established 12 neighborhood councils to advise him on planning and land-use matters.
As Mayor, Mr. Wagner extended the concept citywide, hoping to use the boards to weaken the Democratic Party bosses and decentralize decisions on how massive infusions of Federal urban renewal funds were to be spent, says Richard C. Wade, professor of urban history at the City University Graduate Center.
The boards were incorporated into the City Charter in 1963, and staffs were added in 1969. As the influence of the political clubs continued to wane, the boards expanded their role, if not their power. In 1975, they were given additional advisory functions and gained an official voice in the city's uniform land-use review process.
In the most recent charter revision, in 1989, boards were given first crack at new land-use proposals and the authority to develop blueprints -- albeit, nonbinding -- for their communities' future. Community Board 6 in Brooklyn recently became one of the first boards to take advantage of this new right when it submitted a widely praised plan for revitalizing Red Hook.
 
How They Work
Some boards are more effective than others. Their role is purely advisory but they can affect the outcome of development and government proposals -- depending on their credibility and their ability to mobilize and leverage local opinion.
Boards often find it difficult to attract and keep talented volunteers.
The boards are concerned that city budget cuts will make it more difficult to conduct the day-to-day business of handling complaints. These days, if you have complaint about a noisy bar or a proposal for a homeless residence, you may find yourself talking to an answering machine.
In the old days, the incubator for an aspiring politician was likely to be a Tammany Hall clubhouse. A number of today's public officials have cut their teeth on a community board.
"The best training I had to be a council member was being a community board member," said Councilman Thomas K. Duane, an alumnus of Board 4.
 
The Duties
Boards have 21 separate functions, many of which are performed by the district manager hired by the board.
The boards' duties include:
*Assisting city departments and agencies in communicating with the people in the district.
* Preparing comprehensive plans for the "growth, improvement and development" of the district.
* Submitting to the mayor its priorities for how capital and community development funds should be allocated.
* Exercising the initial review of proposals "of public agencies and private entities for the use, development or improvement of land located in the community district."
* Evaluating delivery of local services, including fire, sanitation, police and transportation.

Map/Photo: "The West Side Story"
Commuinity District 4 in a hybrid of rich and poor, families and single people, industrial and residential blocks. It is an area with mant hot issues. Ross Graham recently toured the district and made these observations.
 
THE UPSIDE OF THE DOWNSIDE
For a decade, Board 4 has been trying to stave off gentrification in this part of Clinton. The collapse of the real-estate market has been in their favor, Ms. Graham says. "I believe one reason that this current administration is now working with us is that they don't see any other development happening here anytime soon."
 
GHOSTS OF WESTWAY
"We would like the use of Pier 94 for community recreation purposes," says Ms. Graham. That's one reason she supports for construction of Route 9a, the successor to Westway. "Nothing's going to happen on the park until the road gets built," she says. "If you put off the road then who knows when or if any of these other things would happen."
 
THE POUND MUST GO
Ms. Graham is trying to remove an unsightly tow pound from a prime waterfront location. She says the city should lease slots from private parking lots. Is she advocating a form of privatization, a concept Board 4 deplores? "I guess I am," she said. "But city people would be doing the towing and manning the office."
 
GOING TO THE MAT
 Big Issue: Where to put the Guadalcanal, an aircraft carrier that is to serve as the West Side's new heliport, is one of Board 4's major worries. Under the city's plans, the heliport would block the view from the only pier in Clinton that is accessible to the public. "My line to the city is, 'You've got to understand that if you insist on putting Guadalcanal there, that's lie-down-in-front-of-the-bulldozers time,' " Ms. Graham said.
 
ART OR COMMERCE
 Board 4 wants Pier 64 turned over to the public. "We haven't figured out what to do with it inside. Lots of people have lots of different ideas." One suggestion is for art galleries and a small cafe, but with public access throughout. "What we would do is fix the bays so that you would have a wonderful view."
 
KEEPING THINGS SMALL
When a high-rise building sprouted on Eighth Avenue about a decade ago, the neighborhood was "energized" into taking preventative action for the future. Ms. Graham says. "We didn't have anything to say about it, and that kind of made us think about what this would be like if there were those on both sides up and down the avenue."
 
CONFUSING CIRCLE
"This ought to be a real entrance to Central Park and a gateway to the Upper West Side," Ms. Graham says. She would also like to see the confusing traffic patterns altered. "I don't know whether it's city inertia or the buses like going the way they go," she said. "Right now, it's not on the front burner."

A New York Story: The Mugging That Wasn't

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
THE mugger struck at 10:30 in the morning. Ilana Reich, who recounted this story, first in a letter, then in person, is a psychotherapist specializing in the treatment of post-traumatic stress, particularly in the victims of accidents and crimes.
On a Friday two months ago, a day off, Ms. Reich was walking briskly along West 15th Street from Sixth toward Fifth Avenue, a gym bag in one hand, a shopping bag filled with heavy photographic equipment in the other. Her pocketbook strap was looped over her shoulder, her elbow securing its bulk to her side. She remembers hearing thumping footsteps behind her, half-turning, then dismissing as no threat the man behind her. After all, it was 10:30 in the morning. 
 A moment later, he was alongside Ms. Reich. He yanked down on her pocketbook, breaking the strap. He pulled it away from her, turned and lumbered back toward Sixth. Ms. Reich turned after him and yelled: "Please, please take the money but leave the pocketbook."
The pocketbook contained a number of checks to be deposited, her vacation ticket for the next week, her keys and address, and the lists, schedules, notations of a crowded life. Her wallet contained credit cards and $65 for the errands she was running.
To Ms. Reich's astonishment, he stopped and began digging her wallet out of the pocketbook.
"This is the part my daughters hated," said Ms. Reich the other day, in her comfortable living room filled with the momentos of exotic travel. "They say it reinforces my 'naive belief' that I can talk to anyone."
The mugger was a chunky man in his early 30's, wearing jeans and a bomber-style jacket. Once he had the wallet out, he seemed bewildered and began walking back toward her. He had a tan complexion, she noticed, and she wondered if he was Hispanic. He had no accent when he said, "It's such a mess when your pocketbook is stolen."
As he handed her the pocketbook, Ms. Reich said, "Thank you very, very much, I really appreciate it." And then she snatched back her wallet.
He said, "I never do this. This is not what I usually do. I really am sorry. I feel very badly, but I was just at welfare, they turned me down again and I can't get a job. You know, the system really stinks. I feel desperate, but I'm really sorry."
As he talked, Ms. Reich felt herself switch into a professional track. But when he began to cry, so did she. Then he put his arm around her and began to comfort her. In retrospect, she thinks she was crying as much from tension relief as empathy.
Ms. Reich asked him if he ever had a job. He said he had been fired because he broke his finger. He held out a finger, which looked fine to her. Ms. Reich suggested he go to Workers' Compensation. He said he had gone there, and been rejected. Ms. Reich assumed he was working illegally, off the books, and had no recourse.
She plucked all the money out of her wallet, $65, and offered it to him. He refused at first, but when she told him he should not be mugging people because he was not good at it and would probably get hurt or arrested, he took the money.
Then she "took charge," she said, and walked away.
"I knew if it went much further, I'd be involved in his life," she said. She laughed. "Who knows, he'd be living with me, I'd be taking care of him."
"Shouldn't you at least have given him a free therapeutic hour?" I asked.
"He needed a social worker, not me," she said. "He was not a good candidate for psychotherapy. First of all, he didn't have insurance. Second of all, he was in pretty good psychological shape; he was polite, compassionate, concerned about me. His problems were about poverty, unemployment, re-training, getting social services.
"What he did wasn't crazy. It's easy to snatch a purse when you think the system is screwing you. You're angry. That particular crime doesn't seem so violent, so dreadful. There's a logic to it."
Ms. Reich says that the worst part of the story is that she couldn't help her mugger then, and still couldn't now, even if given a second chance; she has told the story to many friends and colleagues and no one, she says, has had a concrete suggestion of what she might have done to aid a man suffering "a poverty attack." She wonders what phone number of what agency she might have given him, what solution there might be.
"I think there are many people in similar positions," she said, "and the number will keep growing as the cuts get deeper. This won't be such an odd story. Some of the endings will be much worse."
Ms. Reich is bright, lively, and direct, but when she begins to muse about her mugger, her features soften. "I'd like to know what happened to him. What was the story he told his friends. We cried together. Did it change his view of things, did it change his life?"

How the Other Half Defies Its Image

BYLINE: By SARAH BOXER 

 BODY:
"WHERE we gonna go?" "How we gonna get there?" "What we gonna do?" "Who we gonna fight?" "If we fight, what we gotta whip?"
 This was the caption Dorothea Lange wrote to go with her photograph of five displaced tenant farmers, looking dejected but calm in front of a house in Hardeman County, Tex., in 1937. But it could just as well have been the caption for Joseph Rodriguez's 1993 picture of four gang members in East Los Angeles, posturing defiantly for the camera -- one with a beer can, one with a knife and two with guns (one of which was pointed directly at the photographer). Of course, the words would have a completely different meaning. 
 The documentary photographers Dorothea Lange and Joseph Rodriguez, separated by more than half a century, make an uneasy couple. But because their work is being exhibited concurrently at the International Center for Photography in Manhattan, until today -- the Lange pictures upstairs in the main exhibition hall and Mr. Rodriguez's downstairs -- it's hard to resist a comparison. The two, as befits their positions in the museum, represent the heaven and hell of documentary photography. One is a view of long-suffering people battling the odds, a view with an obvious moral. The other is a vision of hellish recklessness, a violent world with no exit and no wish for salvation.
 Viewers pass through the three rooms devoted to Lange's work in hushed reverence, paying homage to American grit and stoicism. They walk up to the pictures of bread lines in San Francisco, look carefully at the prematurely lined faces and hands of white migrant workers in the San Joaquin Valley, study the gestures of black tenant farmers in Alabama, stare at the tags hanging on the coats of Japanese American families being packed off to internment camps. People huddle around as if looking at a family album. One viewer expressed the general sentiment of the gallery: Looking at the photograph of the five displaced tenant farmers, he said, "I know these men."
 It was a comment one was unlikely to hear in the room with Mr. Rodriguez's pictures of the Evergreen gang in East L.A. The photographs were big. The room was small. There was piped-in rap music. There were bewildering quotes from gang members that were connected only loosely to the photographs. There were large charts and graphs barely touching on the causes of the surrounding violence. Then there were the images themselves -- a man showing his baby daughter how to hold a .32-caliber pistol while the baby's mother watches, smiling; people looking on (many more curious than disturbed) at the open coffin of a baby killed in a drive-by shooting. How was one to react?
 While Lange's photographs seemed to evoke exactly what she intended -- the feeling, as John Szarkowski put it in "Photography Until Now" (1989), that these "are people of exceptional value, proud and independent and competent, who are unlikely to ask for help, but who clearly deserve it" -- Mr. Rodriguez's photographs evoked a feeling of desperate futility -- the feeling that these are people who, if they saw people coming to help, would rob them blind and shoot them without a second thought. The question one immediately felt was not "How is this possible?" but rather, "How can I get out of here as quickly as possible?"
 Why such a difference? Somewhere between the Great Depression and the depressing times we live in now, something changed. Is it just the subjects or the photographs, too? Is it the times or the way we now look at how they're represented?
 Traditionally, documentary photography has come with a political mission. The moral problem of peeking into other people's lives has been vitiated by the good that comes of it. The tacit agreement is that viewers have a social responsibility to look at the scary pictures and, if they're bothered enough, to do something. It's voyeurism with a purpose. And it comes with a certain esthetic. According to Mr. Szarkowski, the classic documentarians "sought pictures that would look ingenuous and free of guile: that would seem not merely honest but artless." Of course, they were not artless.
 Jacob Riis's photographs of New York slums and sweatshops, published in "How the Other Half Lives" a century ago, (and now exhibited at the Museum of the City of New York) were intended to shock and bring about change. And they did. Some of New York's slums were cleared and new tenements with air shafts were built. Fifty years later, Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans, employed by the Farm Security Administration, took their pictures with the purpose of getting more Government relief to the poor. Again, it worked.
 But what about now? Have we outgrown this medium?
 John Berger examined the moral mechanics of documentary photography in his essay "Photographs of Agony" in a book titled "About Looking" (1980). The most extreme photographs, he wrote, "show moments of agony in order to extort the maximum concern." But what if the photographs do not extort concern? What happens when the voyeurism inherent in documentary photography is cut loose from its moral function?
 We have inherited from documentary photography an obligation to look squarely at disturbing images. And photographers have adopted the idea that there is something intrinsically good about showing them. But the subjects of the photographs have, more and more, resisted the program.
 In Robert Frank's book "The Americans" (1958), Jack Kerouac described the beginnings of this change: "The faces don't editorialize or criticize or say anything but 'This is the way we are in real life and if you don't like it I don't know anything about it 'cause I'm living my own life my way and may God bless us all, mebbe' . . . 'if we deserve it.' " By now the subject's stance toward the photographer and the viewer is not just blase, but downright contemptuous.
 When Joseph Rodriguez photographed gang life, with the aim of getting to the roots of gang violence, he did what most documentary photographers do: he won the acceptance of his subjects, and he promised to represent them with respect. But the simple prescriptions he seemed to offer -- more jobs and more money for schools -- looked pathetically small next to the brutality he captured on film.

 
 
Their Own Program
 His subjects refused to go along passively. While Riis's subjects were often caught off guard and Lange's complied quietly with her project, Mr. Rodriguez's gang members seemed to have their own ideas about image-making. Their poses -- with guns, knives, cocaine and stacks of money -- defied any romantic vision of them or what could be done for them. The same could be said of Eugene Richards' infamously grisly photographs of crack addicts.
 The medium of documentary photography is, more and more, detached from its original message. In a recent show at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, in Manhattan, Andres Serrano included some of his portraits of the homeless layered in colorful clothing and moody shadows. He borrowed the traditional subjects of the documentarian -- homelessness and violence -- without adopting any of its social rhetoric.
 But it is Mr. Serrano's photographs of corpses in a morgue -- gigantic images of lives extinguished by fire, by stabbing, by rat poison -- that make the point most clearly. Like the classic documentary photographs, the morgue photos are unblinking and unbearable glimpses of violence. But the most disturbing thing about them is that no matter what feelings of horror and terror they evoke, there is absolutely nothing to be done.

Foreign Aid: Under Seige in the Budget Wars

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Foreign aid is one of the least understood -- and least loved -- parts of the Federal budget. Case in point: 41 percent of Americans said in a recent poll that foreign aid was the largest single item in the budget, even though it represents just 1 percent.
 In their search for budget cuts that will generate the least protest, the new Republican majority in Congress has made foreign assistance a prime target. Treating it as a distasteful form of welfare for foreigners, many Republican leaders are talking of chopping the $15 billion aid budget by 25 percent or more. 
 Overseas aid is used to reduce population growth in Kenya, build roads in Haiti, feed refugees in Rwanda and Bosnia, finance F-15's for Israel, and provide Russia with expertise on privatization. America's contributions to the World Bank help underwrite development loans, while the Export-Import Bank's low-cost loans enable other countries to buy American exports.
 Even as Republicans threaten wholesale cuts, though, it is widely recognized that the two largest aid recipients by far -- Israel, at $3 billion a year, and Egypt, at about $2 billion -- will escape largely untouched. This means that the cuts will come out of just $10 billion of the $15 billion aid budget ($10 billion is what Washington spends each year on farm subsidies). This also means countries other than Egypt and Israel will be cut by far more than 25 percent.
 Some Republicans want to eliminate most of the $1 billion in annual aid to Africa on the ground that the United States has no vital security interests there. The Republicans are also frustrated that after years of receiving millions in aid, many African nations are as bad off as ever. Other likely targets for cuts are $500 million in annual spending for population programs and $1.5 billion for the World Bank and other international development banks.
 The current hostility to foreign aid is a far cry from the program's early days when when the Marshall Plan sometimes spent more than $50 billion a year, translated into current dollars, to help Western Europe recover from World War II. While even then many Americans opposed foreign aid, the nation by and large was proud that this generosity not only helped consolidate democracy and restore prosperity in Western Europe, but helped it resist the siren song of Communism. But that was a different time. The Marshall Plan was successful largely because it helped industrialized nations rebuild, a far easier task than helping developing societies make the leap into modernity.
 Indeed, from the late 1940's until the Soviet empire collapsed five years ago, the central purpose of foreign aid was to lure countries away from Communism. Alleviating poverty and hunger was a secondary goal, American officials acknowledge. Now, with the cold war over, some Republicans suggest that foreign aid can be relegated to the dustbin of history.
 J. Brian Atwood, who heads the Government's main foreign aid arm, the Agency for International Development, insists that foreign assistance is just as vital today as during the cold war. The world is still plenty dangerous, he cautions, and a steady flow of aid is needed to prevent future Somalias and Rwandas.
 Foreign aid, he asserts, is needed to address the problems that spawn such crises: overpopulation, hunger, destruction of the environment. And, he says, it can help former Communist nations avoid economic chaos. "When societies fail there are wars and huge flows of refugees, and then the whole world has to spend a lot of money to resolve these problems," he said. "A little more investment earlier on might help prevent such crises." STEVEN GREENHOUSE

The Conspiracy That Never Ends

BYLINE: By GEORGE JOHNSON 

 BODY:
WHILE most of the world waited for news of the official investigation into the Oklahoma bombing, callers and talk show hosts on World Wide Christian Radio, the Nashville shortwave station that has become the shrill voice of the far right, had it all figured out: the Federal Building was destroyed as part of a plot by the United States Government, acting on behalf of a secret international cabal, the New World Order, whose symbol, the cold staring eye in the pyramid, mocks Americans from the back of every one dollar bill.
 Within days, the bombing had been tightly woven into the sprawling conspiracy theories that have obsessed some Americans since the beginning of the Republic. The historian Richard Hofstadter coined the phrase "the paranoid style in American politics" to describe this pathological world view in which history is a Manichean struggle between the forces of light and of darkness. The conspiratorial fantasies are not simply an expression of inchoate fear. There is a shape, an architecture, to the paranoia. 
 Rule No. 1: The conspirators are internationalist in their sympathies. In this century the main targets of conspiracy theories have been Jews, depicted as people whose loyalty to fellow Jews makes them endemically antipatriotic, and international Communism. The United Nations is suspect, as is the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, Interpol and even the Red Cross because they supposedly place international agendas above patriotic concerns. In the 19th century, the chief conspirators were said to be the Vatican and the Freemasons. In the mind of today's political paranoiacs, which include some militia members, followers of the Liberty Lobby (the Holocaust-is-a-myth crowd) and the Ku Klux Klan, all these groups are mushed together into the New World Order, or One World Government.
 The first rule is of more than academic historical interest because of Rule No. 2: In a conspiracy theory, nothing is ever discarded. Right-wing mail order bookstores still sell the "Protocols of the Elders of Zion," the anti-Semitic fantasy hatched in Russia a century ago. Another big seller is "Proofs of a Conspiracy," a 1797 book reprinted by the John Birch Society, which fueled speculation that a Freemasonic group called the Order of the Illuminati plotted with the Jeffersonians to turn over the fledging United States to followers of French Enlightenment philosophy -- the 18th century equivalent of secular humanism.
 This brings us to Rule No. 3: Seeming enemies are actually secret friends. As evil as the Communists, in the right-wing mind, are the Rockefellers and international bankers (often a synonym for Jews). Through the lens of the conspiracy theorists, capitalists and Communists work hand in hand.
 To what end? That's Rule No. 4: The takeover by the international godless government will be ignited by the collapse of the economic system. In an elaborate decades-long check-kiting scheme since the dollar was removed from the gold standard, the Federal Reserve has been creating money out of thin air. Once the conspirators give the word, the bankers will yank out the rug from this house of cards and your money will be worthless.
 As a sign that the conspirators have taken over the currency, they had printed on the back a Freemasonic symbol: the all-seeing eye of the enlightened ones perched atop the pyramid. And there, under the emblem, is their name: Novus Ordo Seclorum.
 Finally, Rule No. 5: It's all spelled out in the Bible. For those with a fundamentalist bent, the New World Order or One World Government is none other than the international kingdom of the Antichrist, described in the Book of Revelation. Revelation also speaks of the "mark of the beast," a symbol of the satanic leader that will be imprinted on everyone's forehead and right hand. Fundamentalist preachers like Hal Lindsey have popularized the notion that the mark of the beast is the zebra-striped Universal Product Code, which will be tattooed on everyone by laser to increase the acuity of the panoptic big eye.
 We may never know what went through the real conspirators' minds when, as investigators say, they rented a truck, packed it full of fertilizer and fuel oil, and ignited it where it would do the most harm. But if they hung out at militia meetings, or even just tuned in occasionally to WWCR, they would have been exposed to this kind of thinking, over and over and over again.

HEADLINE: Illinois Town, Fearing Racial Imbalance, to Advertise for Whites

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MATTESON, Ill., April 29

 BODY:
This community 40 miles south of Chicago has begun a $37,000 advertising campaign to lure affluent whites and slow racial change.
Some experts say the effort may fail, and critics say it is offensive to the growing black population here. "Let's be realistic," said a black resident, Ernest Wooten Jr. "There's some racism behind this. They say they want to keep it mixed. But my feelings are if you don't want to live here I don't want you here." 
 Village Administrator Ralph Coglianese said the difference from other communities was that Matteson was explicit. "Most of the people would just rather not do anything," Mr. Coglianese said. "It's the easy way out. We've seen no history of people being able to maintain racial diversity without working at it."
Matteson has neat single-family homes and tree-lined streets, with little crime. A boom in the 1970's attracted middle managers seeking housing within easy train commuting distance to Chicago. Split in half by Interstate 57, the older east side is mostly white, and the west side has become predominantly black. The construction of $100,000 to $300,000 houses has continued into the 1990's, mostly on the west side.
"When I moved here nine years ago, it was probably 50 percent black, 50 percent white," said Mr. Wooten, a west side resident. "Now it seems they're steering nothing but blacks here, and whites are moving out."
In 1980 the village was 12 percent black, according to the Census Bureau. In 10 years the black population grew 32 percent, and the white population dropped 31 percent. Today, experts say, 48 percent of the 11,500 residents are classified as black.
A panel made up nearly equally of blacks and whites has recommended promotions through brochures and advertising aimed at "white home-seeking prospects interested in residing in a racially diverse suburban community." The advertisements could appear in the summer.
Village Trustee Denise Clemons said the drive was about economics, not racism. "If you have only one group of people looking at real estate in this area," Ms. Clemons said, "then you're not seeing the whole market. This is about home values and the quality of life here."
Historically after a community becomes mostly black, housing prices drop and decay follows, said Doug Massey, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in studying urban segregation. The black middle class is often too small to make up for an exodus of middle-class whites, Professor Massey said, leading to increased renting to lower-income people who do not keep up the properties.
"The racism is not the individuals in the community who are trying to fight the downward spiral in housing costs," he said. "The racism is in the structure of the housing and lending markets and in the general society."
Property values in communities that maintain predominantly white populations rise consistently, experts said. In Evanston, where the black population has remained at 22 percent for years, the median home value climbed 109 percent from 1980 to 1990, the Census Bureau said. In Matteson the increase was 31 percent, compared with 68 percent nationally.
Trying to reverse such trends is difficult, and efforts can easily be perceived as racist, said Edwin Mills, a professor of real estate at the J. L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University. "Nobody advertised to bring blacks in, I bet," Professor Mills said. "The evidence I see is that whites are more concerned about class than race nowadays. But many whites are obsessively prone to identify lower class with blacks."

HEADLINE: On Saigon's Day of Defeat, a Glitter of Rebirth

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Sunday, April 30

 BODY:
In the glittering chaos of Vietnam's boom town, it is difficult to imagine that 20 years ago today, Saigon was a city so defeated that it was forced even to sacrifice its name.
Government-issued maps now identify it as Ho Chi Minh City, the name it was given on April 30, 1975. That was the morning when a North Vietnamese tank crashed through the gates of the presidential palace of the collapsed, American-backed Government of South Vietnam. 
 But for most of this city's four million residents, this is -- and will always be -- Saigon. They never stopped calling it Saigon.
And exactly two decades after it came under the control of the Communist North, this city is more prosperous and, in many ways, more powerful than at any time in its history.
Much more than the aging Communist soldiers in Hanoi who won the war and humiliated a superpower, the ambitious capitalists of this city are pointing the way to Vietnam's future -- rushing into the free markets that today even the Communists must grudgingly endorse.
Anyone who doubts their independence need only witness how the people of the city are marking the 20th anniversary of its capture.
To be sure, large buildings in the city have been draped in banners and bunting bearing the hammer and sickle and the grinning, wispy-bearded image of Ho Chi Minh. But for every banner with a portrait of Ho, another flutters in the warm breeze with the red, white and blue logo of Pepsi Cola, an official sponsor of the celebrations.
"I think Saigon is the most exciting city in the world," said Lu Thang, a 25-year-old business student who, when asked about her career goal, replied in a gentle voice, "Real estate." She said she would miss the anniversary parade today because she had work to do at her father's newly opened computer store.
The war, she said, "is over -- we do not want to talk about it anymore."
"I think everybody, including all the people in Hanoi and all over Vietnam, agree that what is best for our country is that we try to make some money and feed ourselves and have enough clothes," she added. "And we are doing that."
 
From Embassy Roof, A City Transformed
 Twenty years ago this weekend, the view from the top of the United States Embassy in Saigon was one of panic as thousands of Vietnamese pushed in desperately against the embassy gates. Their goal was to reach the staircase leading to the seventh-floor roof, where American helicopters offered the final route of escape from the city.
The Communists were closing in. Mortar fire had turned night into day. In the embassy garden, American marines were making a bonfire of millions of dollars in cash that had been brought into Vietnam to pay informers and was too heavy to carry out on the helicopters.
Today, the abandoned embassy is crumbling, the helicopter pads coated with orange-brown rust from the tropical heat. The panorama from the rooftop is one of a fixed forest of construction cranes, signaling the birth of a futuristic skyline for Vietnam's largest city.
Since the Communists made their first grudging steps toward the free market in 1986 under a policy known as doi moi, or renovation, the city has been transformed. Applying lessons of their Western patrons -- first the French, then the Americans -- the people have set to work on rebuilding a city shattered by war and the neglect born of poverty. The result is a town that glories in its newfound prosperity, with freshly painted store fronts decorated in marble and neon lights.
The most famous boulevard -- known as Tu Do (Freedom) Street before 1975, and renamed Dong Khoi (Revolution) Street by the Communists -- is crowded with expensive cafes and boutiques that would not be out of place on the grander avenues of Manhattan.
Many of the big multinational companies that have rushed back have taken over decrepit villas dating from the French colonial occupation and turned them into shimmering palaces of commerce.
At night the streets become a dense parade of fancy new motor bikes. "I wonder what the old Communists think when they see this new chrome," an American banker said. "Remind me: Who won this war?"
Hanoi, the once-dour Communist capital, is also beginning to prosper. The notorious prison known as the Hanoi Hilton, once a place of brutal confinement for American prisoners of war, is falling to the wrecking ball this month, to be replaced by a plush office complex.
But there is still no comparison in the wealth of the two cities. Per capita income in Ho Chi Minh City is nearly $850, more than three times the average in the rest of the country and almost double that of the capital.
 
Lingering Bitterness Of the Vanquished
 While the physical scars from the war have begun to vanish from Ho Chi Minh City, the other sort remains. For many Vietnamese, it has proved far easier to forgive the Americans for any damage that they may have done to this country than to forgive each other.
"The hostility is always in my mind -- the anger is in my mind even today," said Le Tay Nguyen, who was a captain in the South Vietnamese Army in 1975.
Mr. Nguyen was one of hundreds of Vietnamese who sat patiently one afternoon last week on the wooden benches outside the offices of the Orderly Departure Program. Set up by the United States, the program offers asylum to former soldiers of the South Vietnamese Government and others who were persecuted after the war.
Mr. Nguyen said he wanted desperately to leave. After the war, he said, he was interned for six years in a Communist re-education camp in which conditions were "terrible." "They knocked out my teeth," he said, pointing to a long row of dentures along his lower jaw before pointing to his feet. "They ran sticks along my feet as torture," he explained.
Ee Duc Thanh, 55, clutched papers showing he had worked in the American Embassy from 1967 to 1975 as a translator. The only reason he was unable to join the evacuation 20 years ago, he said, was that a thief had stolen a suitcase that contained the documents verifying his position. It has taken him all these years, he said, to obtain new copies.
"I must go to the U.S. to live because I have difficulty in my life in Vietnam," said Mr. Thanh, who added that his children had paid the biggest price for his past. "Because I worked for the Americans, my children could not go to university and they cannot find a good job," he said. "That is why they want to go to America too."
A few blocks away, in the offices of the Vietnamese Veterans' Association, the victors in that long-ago war sat beneath a faded lacquer portrait of Ho Chi Minh and insisted that they had not set out to punish the vanquished. "We know that some of the South Vietnamese joined in the war with the Americans," said Vo Thang Kiet, a 66-year-old retired colonel in the North Vietnamese Army. "But for these people, we do not feel any hostility, any dislike."
That sense of charity was not found at the nearby offices of the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Welfare, which has never bothered to include the South Vietnamese Army casualties in official totals of war dead. "We do not care about what happened to these people," said Nghiem Xuan Tue, a ministry spokesman.
 
Two Decades Later, 'The War is Over'
 Twenty years ago this morning, Ly Quy Chung prepared to surrender Saigon to the Communist North, an act that would reunify his homeland after a generation of war and the loss of millions of lives, including those of at least 58,000 Americans. The last American diplomats had fled the city hours before.
Mr. Chung, who had been drafted as the Information Minister for the Saigon Government only three days before its collapse, remembered the quiet as he waited in front of the presidential palace for something to happen. Finally, he said, a tank appeared in the distance.
"When the tank arrived, it fired a shot at the palace -- boom -- to create a certain panic," he said. "They shouted for us to raise our hands to surrender."
The tank crashed through the heavy gates, and a soldier rushed toward the palace demanding to know how to reach the flagpole on the roof. "I told him to follow me," Mr. Chung said. "So we went to the elevator, but the soldier refused to enter because this was the first time in his life that he had seen an elevator, this strange box."
"I told him not to be afraid," Mr. Chung recalled, grinning at the memory. "Finally we got to the roof." Minutes later, the red and gold flag of the Communist forces was fluttering over Saigon, which hours later would become Ho Chi Minh City.
Mr. Chung had been one of the few opposition politicians in South Vietnam, a member of the so-called Third Force that opposed the repressive American-backed regime of President Nguyen Van Thieu.
"History pushed me into this situation," he said of his role in the surrender. "It was not a happy end for me." But with reunification, he said, "it was a happy end for the country." Because he had opposed the Thieu Government, Mr. Chung, now 55, was spared imprisonment in a re-education camp. He is now editor of his own weekly newspaper, which like all publications in Vietnam is subject to tight censorship.
But what he cannot say in print in his newspaper, he will say in person. He readily concedes that the Communists made disastrous mistakes in the 10 years after they captured Saigon, including collectivist economic policies that drove the country to the brink of starvation.
"It was a very dark period," he said. "There were bad economic policies, bad political policies, and that is why so many people left the country in this period." He was speaking of the mass exodus by more than one million Vietnamese who became known as the boat people.
Mr. Chung's family was among those who took to the rickety boats. All seven of his brothers and sisters now live in the United States or Canada, and his mother later left for New York under the Orderly Departure Program. "I am the only one left," he said.
With the Government's move to the free market in 1986 and the rebirth of this city, the conditions that drove his family away have ended, Mr. Chung said. "Now, I think the life in this city is better than before 1975," he said. "The people are more optimistic than ever before. The dark period is over. The war is over."

HEADLINE: Expulsion Seen as Sign Of New Mood

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: PLAINFIELD, N.J.

 BODY:
Dozens of trophies collected during seven years in the Scotch Plains-Fanwood schools clog the dresser top and most every surface in Jason McLean's bedroom -- a Most Valuable Player statue from his freshman football team, a plaque honoring his four years as a varsity wrestler.
The room is a shrine to what should be the end of a charmed high school career -- yearbooks the 17-year-old worked on, mementos from two years as class president, his two-toned black and white shoes from the junior prom. 
 But three months before Jason's graduation, Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School declared him a nonresident, handed him his transcript and told him to leave. The expulsion last month came on his first day back after his crowning wrestling triumph for the school -- finishing at the top 16 at the state championships in Atlantic City.
"You have to have all your teachers sign you out," Jason said. "I broke down crying in the hall and then I went home."
Jason McLean's experience is a striking example of how in these tough budget times, public schools are going to new lengths to make sure that every student is a resident and is entitled to attend the district's schools.
The McLean family acknowledges that it does not live in Scotch Plains anymore. They declared bankruptcy in 1994, losing their house. The parents said that they moved away at the start of the school year and that that fact was widely known in the community -- Jason was even picked up for wrestling matches from his new home in neighboring Plainfield. But, they said, Scotch Plains officials turned a blind eye until the wrestling season ended and the school could no longer benefit from his athletic talents.
Scotch Plains officials countered that their residency investigation just happened to coincide with the end of wrestling season, but either way, the case illustrates the aggressiveness of residency crackdowns going on statewide.
As budget cuts have taken hold under Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, local school officials have pressed to make sure that no outsiders are trying to get a free education in their districts.
The New Jersey School Boards Association estimates that the number of such "rogue" students peaked at 8,000 to 10,000 last year and is now falling because of the new hardball tactics.
"The general cutbacks from the Whitman administration have made dollars scarce, so districts want to make sure that the dollars they have to spend on education programs benefit children domiciled in their community, " said Dr. Lawrence S. Feinsod, president of the Garden State Coalition of Schools, a group of 110 largely prosperous districts.
"There has been an increased effort by school districts to weed out students who do no live in the district because of the increasing scarcity of resources," he said.
Most cases are not like Jason McLean's. They usually involve parents sneaking younger children into suburban programs not available in their own poorer urban districts -- all-day kindergarten, for example.
But Jason's experience has been a particularly painful test of the new attitude.
"What we are most upset about is the way that they did it," said Agness McLean, Jason's mother. "They allowed Jason to wrestle. They allowed him to participate up until the end of the wrestling season. The next school day they put him out. We feel they used him."
So far, an editorial in the school newspaper, a petition drive and pleas from the McLean family that Jason be allowed to graduate with his classmates have not elicited a response from the Union County school.
The family, while admitting that it should have been more open with officials, is considering a lawsuit to get Jason a diploma from the high school where he spent 3 3/4 years.
Under the rules at Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School, seniors who start the year have the right to finish even if their parents move away. The McLeans say that they are owed this right, having been forced out of their house after the start of the school year on Sept. 8, 1994. Jonathan J. McLean, the father, lost his job as a boilermaker and was unemployed for eight months before the family declared bankruptcy.
School officials said that the family had moved earlier, and in any case forfeited the right by not coming forward to explain the problem and by enrolling Jason's two younger brothers as a junior and a freshman. They were expelled at the same time he was.
"It was our observation that they intended to go through with the junior for two years and the freshman for four years," said Dr. Terry Riegel, principal at the 1,100-student high school.
"It is flagrant fraud," he said, noting that the school could have pursued the family for $30,000 in tuition.
Dr. Riegel said that it was a coincidence that the undercover residency investigation culminated on the very Monday after the wrestling championships.
He said an anonymous tipster called in mid-February and gave them a license plate number of the McLeans' car. An investigator shadowed the car from Plainfield until it dropped the three boys off at the high school.
"I like to win and I like to be a champion, but the kid was not a legal resident," Dr. Riegel said.
Roy Schleicher, associate director of the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association, said the school would not forfeit its wrestling ranking as long as the student involved was considered a legal resident at the time of the championships.
The McLeans said that they had hoped to keep the brothers in school together for one last year to anchor them while their family life was in such turmoil.
"We are the adults here, " Mrs. McLean said. "We made a horrible mistake. Things are bad enough. This kid has lost his home. Do you punish him even further by denying him the opportunity to graduate with his peers when he has given so much?"
Penny Venetis, a professor at Rutgers University Law School's Constitution Litigation Clinic who represents Jason, said she believes that there might be two grounds to legally reinstate him. First, there was no formal hearing after his expulsion, she said, and second, the school benefited from Jason's enrollment by allowing him to wrestle even while suspecting his residency.
Some students reacted with an editorial this month in the school newspaper and collected 400 signatures on a petition asking that Jason be reinstated.
"Whether school officials were ignorant of the situation because of incompetence or ulterior motives is not an issue," the editorial said. "The fact is that McLean had completed the majority of his senior year. His education has already been paid for through tax money and no one stood to gain anything by removing McLean from school. In fact, McLean's dismissal only resulted in a great loss to many."
The McLean family moved to Scotch Plains in May 1988, gaining instant local fame when the oldest son, Dana, helped reverse the high school football team's losing streak. Mr. McLean, 41, coached youth league football and baseball teams. Jason still umpires for one of the Police Athletic League baseball teams. Mrs. McLean, 39, has collected three scrapbooks and a plastic shopping bag full of articles about the family's athletic triumphs.
The McLeans said that as African-Americans they never felt overt hostility but never felt quite welcome either in a community that is 88 percent white.
Jason was popular, winning the class presidency his sophomore and junior years. Teachers said they found him to be an enthusiastic pupil. "He was always active -- taking pictures, writing copy, working on the layouts," said Michelle Zarro, the yearbook faculty adviser.
His wrestling coach did not want to comment, but fellow students said they liked watching him wrestle in the 126-pound class. "When you went to a wrestling match he was the one people would go to watch because he was so exciting," said Craig Costello, a senior. "He was very energetic on the mat."
After his expulsion, Jason enrolled in Plainfield High School. He is considering repeating his senior year at a local private school to pull up his B-minus average and get into a more competitive college with a strong wrestling program.
For now he wants to add just one thing to his room: a diploma from Scotch Plains-Fanwood High.
"I didn't realize how much I liked it until the day I was leaving, until the day I started crying in the hall," he said. "I didn't realize how much a part of that school I was until kids started walking up to me in the hall and telling me that they were sorry about what happened. I didn't realize how much a part of it I was until I wasn't there."

HEADLINE: U.S. Enslaves Japanese, Cabinet Official Says

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 29

 BODY:
A Cabinet minister has bitterly rebuked the United States, saying it enslaved the Japanese people as it once enslaved Africans, but he then backtracked by saying he had meant his comments to be off the record.
The official, Transport Minister Shizuka Kamei, was expressing Japan's frustration at its predicament as the yen rises against the dollar. 
 "If I dare to use a metaphor, there was a time when America bought black slaves from Africa and produced wealth," Mr. Kamei said, according to Japanese press reports on Friday. "The recent behavior of the United States makes me suspect that it may be using Japan and saying, 'There are very diligent Japanese whom you can use as slaves and produce good results.'
"Doesn't it seem that the feelings toward Japan of the United States, the country we democracies depend on the most, have chilled recently? This may sound like the weeping of a jilted woman, but that's the sort of feeling I've got."
Mr. Kamei's remarks underscore the growing anger at what is seen as American indifference to the shift in exchange rates. The yen's trajectory -- to about 84 yen to the dollar now, compared with about 100 yen to the dollar at the beginning of the year -- is a major political issue in Japan.
While Japan is a bit proud of its strong currency, it is extremely concerned about the effects on exporters, who find it much more difficult to compete in international markets at today's exchange rates. In addition, even purely domestic companies are now facing growing pressure from imports that are much cheaper because of the strength of the yen.
Mr. Kamei, an outspoken former police official, made his remarks in a speech Thursday night in Tokyo to the Japan Critics Association, a writers' group.
After his remarks caused a stir in Tokyo, Mr. Kamei appeared to backtrack, but he stopped short of an apology or retraction. According to Japanese press reports, he told the Foreign Minister and the Chief Cabinet Secretary that the remarks were inappropriate.
Asked for a response, he told Japanese reporters on Friday: "This was a place I lectured on the condition of its being off the record. I have no intention of announcing it publicly to the United States."
Americans tend to blame Japan in part for the strength of its currency, saying that it should do more to deregulate its markets. In theory that could fuel extra economic activity, which could lead to more imports and a declining currency. But Japanese officials contend that they are already deregulating markets, and they are concerned about losing influence in areas they have dominated for decades.
Many economists say that in the immediate future Japan is more likely than the United States to suffer the consequences of the strong yen, so that the problem should be addressed in Japan now.
"They can't come up with a coherent policy, so they look for a scapegoat," said Mineko Sasaki-Smith, an economist at Morgan Stanley Japan.

HEADLINE: New York Pledge to House Poor Works a Rare, Quiet Revolution

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
In 1986, Mayor Edward I. Koch made a bold commitment, promising that New York City would spend $4.2 billion in the following decade to build new homes for poor and working-class New Yorkers.
Nine years later, the city has made good on much of that ambitious pledge. Under Mr. Koch and his successors, the city has financed and overseen the creation of more than 50,000 new apartments and houses -- enough to fill a small city. 
 The investment has transformed huge swaths of New York's most blighted neighborhoods, including Harlem, the South Bronx, Crown Heights, East New York, Brownsville and Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Abandoned, gutted buildings have been rebuilt. Houses have gone up on empty, littered lots. In some areas, stores have begun popping up for new homeowners and apartment dwellers. Property values have increased, and banks are granting mortgages.
The Giuliani administration has devised several new programs to revive the remaining vacant buildings, which are small and scattered, representing a potential for 12,000 new apartments. But many housing experts fear that the city will run out of money and political will before it runs out of small abandoned buildings.
Should that happen, community organizers and housing developers warn, the little miracles that have brought neighborhoods back to life will no longer be duplicated.
On Williams Avenue in East New York, Brooklyn, for example, one of the toughest blocks in one of the city's most high-crime neighborhoods, a vacant three-story building with nine apartments was completely rebuilt in 1993. So were several smaller buildings on the street.
That same year, there were three drug-related murders and 500 drug trafficking arrests on the block, in an area known as "the dead zone" by local planners. Today, after repeated efforts by the police and community organizers working for the nonprofit group that reconstructed the buildings, the dealers have moved on.
The local group, the East New York Urban Youth Corps, has rebuilt 32 small buildings within six blocks of Williams Avenue over the last four years, delighting longtime residents who stuck out the lean years. "It was bad, bad, bad, bad, bad," said James Worth, who has owned a house in the neighborhood for 32 years. "It went down so far it had no place to go but up. There have been a lot of improvements."
Perhaps the most notable aspect of the city's effort is its scale. New York's program is not simply larger than those of other cities, specialists in low-income housing say; it is larger than those of every other American city combined.
And yet, because middle-class and affluent New Yorkers so seldom venture into neighborhoods like East New York, many are unaware of their revival. "It was one of those secret successes," said Carol Lamberg, the executive director of the Settlement Housing Fund, a nonprofit agency that owns and manages many buildings.
 
Crisis
Steps to Counter An Abandonment
 In the mid-1980's, city housing officials found themselves at a crossroads. Every poor neighborhood in New York had been devastated by the economic decline of the 1970's. The South Bronx, Harlem and central and eastern Brooklyn were littered with more than 5,000 burnt-out wrecks, many of them not much more than brick walls and foundations, filled with garbage, piles of tires and even abandoned cars. Homeless families were filling up shelters and welfare hotels.
The Federal Government, under President Ronald Reagan, had withdrawn from its traditional role as the prime builder of low-income housing, although it continued to provide rent subsidies for poor people.
With New York City having finally recovered from the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, Mr. Koch and his advisers decided they had no choice but to step in, committing major resources to revitalize poor neighborhoods by rebuilding their housing stock.
They had few models. Traditionally, the low-income housing provided by the Federal Government was in high-rise projects.
Paul A. Crotty, who is now the city's Corporation Counsel and who was Housing Commissioner in 1986 and 1987, recalled several early crucial decisions. Officials reasoned they could reduce construction costs by taking advantage of an unlikely resource, the abandoned buildings and vacant land that had fallen into the city's hands through tax foreclosures.
And they decided to create a half-dozen new programs, instead of one large effort, so they could tap into many different constituencies: private, for-profit developers, nonprofit housing managers, community and church groups, and national foundations committed to community development.
A related goal was to produce new housing for New Yorkers of different economic classes, including families with moderate incomes as well as the working poor and the destitute.
In effect, they tried a series of experiments to see what would work best. "We were going to try to hit all the notes," Mr. Crotty said. "We tried to get a lot of things going at once."
In one component, the city gave vacant shells to private developers. In another, the buildings went to nonprofit community groups. The new owners used varying combinations of city subsidies, bank financing and a Federal low-income housing tax credit to underwrite the reconstructions. In a third segment, the city directly hired large construction companies to rebuild clusters of abandoned shells.
Today, more than 3,000 abandoned apartment houses have been rebuilt, providing more than 39,000 new apartments. And 12,000 new one-, two- and three-family houses have been constructed on vacant, city-owned land and sold to working families. In all, the city has spent $4 billion in the last nine years.
 
Experiments
City Learns From Its Mistakes
 There were growing pains, of course, like more than $50 million in cost overruns in one program.
The city hired top-of-the-line construction companies to rebuild two clusters of buildings, one a group of 46 small vacant shells in central Harlem and the other a group of 14 larger gutted structures on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx. The Harlem buildings eventually cost about $140,000 an apartment, and the Bronx cluster $98,000 an apartment. They had originally been projected to cost $65,000 an apartment.
City officials learned from these problems, and they reconfigured the program to reduce costs, using smaller clusters of buildings and hiring smaller construction companies with more experience renovating apartment buildings.
Other rehabilitations of gutted buildings were more successful. In the vacant buildings program, through which private developers bought shells for $1 and reconstructed them with city subsidies, the rebuilding cost about $65,000 an apartment.
Housing officials say it would have cost much more to build new mid-rise apartment houses from scratch. The city's Housing Authority, which manages high-rise projects built with Federal money a generation ago, estimates that if it had to replace its 180,000 apartments today, it would cost $125,000 an apartment.
There was debate in the early years over who should live in the city's rebuilt structures. In one program, the city filled buildings with homeless families.
Many community organizers and housing managers assailed the practice, arguing against congregating so many poor, troubled families together. By 1989, the Koch administration was putting homeless people in only half the apartments in this program.
Today, at least a half-dozen of these buildings have aged badly. But the cause of their deterioration may have had less to do with who lived there than with who managed them: in almost every case, the city.
Drug dealers took over a building at 815 Fairmount Place, in East Tremont just north of the Cross-Bronx Expressway, causing such extensive damage that the city had to replace the elevator.
On Avenue St. John, just off Southern Boulevard in the South Bronx, two adjacent buildings that gleamed when they were completed in 1989 are now worn. Five apartments are boarded up at 1037 Avenue St. John, and the front hall is marred by graffiti. "It's been bad for two or three years," said Iris Romero, who has lived in the building since it re-opened. "H.P.D., bad landlord," she said.
Officials of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development did not dispute the assertion; they said the building and the one next door would be turned over to a local nonprofit group this year. The building on Fairmount Place is now managed by a local group, as are most of the 200 buildings in this segment.
 
Success
New Communities For False Ones
 But if the housing revival has occasionally misstepped, it has nonetheless altered the landscape of countless blocks, bringing a measure of hope to places where it is often in short supply.
"The hemorrhaging was stopped," said Ronald Shiffman, director of the graduate center for planning and the environment at Pratt Institute. "Buildings that were abandoned were put back on line, rebuilding and reinvigorating neighborhoods."
On what were once vast tracts of vacant land in a section of East New York, hundreds of single-family houses have been built, creating an entirely new community.
A mile away, the apartment house at 1610 St. Johns Place in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, was a hulking, abandoned shell just three years ago. Today, it is home to families like Elaine Newkirk and her three children, who were once homeless and now share a tidy three-bedroom apartment. With its clean brick facade and bright red fire escapes, Ms. Newkirk's building and its three identical neighbors illuminate an otherwise bleak block at the eastern edge of Crown Heights.
"This is as good as it gets," Ms. Newkirk said.
On Fulton Avenue in the South Bronx, a row of buildings, their brick exteriors steam-cleaned, sit high on a hill overlooking the Cross-Bronx Expressway. Once, they defined urban despair, so much so that desperate city officials with no money to spend for renovations in the early 1980's put vinyl facings showing shutters and flowerpots over blocked-up windows, trying in vain to disguise the buildings' demise.
And in Harlem, 46 buildings have been reconstructed in a five-block area bounded by 139th Street, 144th Street, Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and Lenox Avenue.
Noreen Lynch moved in January into one of the biggest and most handsome of these renovated buildings, at the corner of 142d Street and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard. Ms. Lynch once worked as a home health-care attendant in a public housing project right across the street, and she used to watch workers remaking the building.
Now, after spending four years in a city hospital because of severe injuries from an auto accident, Ms. Lynch is delighted with her new home, which has 24-hour security and a conscientious superintendent.
"These buildings were really redone nicely," she said.
Without the city's intervention, the blighted neighborhoods surely would have continued to decline. Neither the state nor Federal governments were prepared to commit significant resources for new housing, and private business did not show much willingness to invest in poor neighborhoods.
"It's one of the best examples of government accomplishing something in an age when there is a lot of cynicism about government's ability to get things done," said Abraham Biderman, who was Housing Commissioner under Mr. Koch in 1988 and 1989.
 
The Future
Plans Are Certain, But Not the Will
 Where the housing program goes from here is uncertain. Deborah C. Wright, the Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, has devised new ways to clean up the hundreds of small abandoned buildings still scattered around neighborhoods. She is packaging them with rundown, occupied buildings also owned by the city, and plans to turn these small clusters over to local for-profit housing managers and nonprofit groups for rebuilding.
"What we're trying to do is have a comprehensive approach that focuses on the neighborhood and not on individual buildings," Ms. Wright said. "We're trying to address the unit that matters, which is the block, and to address every single housing problem on the block."
Many community groups have applauded the approach, although some object to the use of private housing managers. But they fear that Ms. Wright may not get enough financial and political support to complete the job begun under Mr. Koch and continued under Mayor David N. Dinkins.
Housing experts contend that the city must also commit more money to upgrade another segment of the city-owned housing stock: the 38,000 apartments in old, dilapidated occupied buildings.
Others say the city should devise new programs to spur renovation of thousands of rundown apartment buildings still privately owned.
Many people are worried, too, about the long-term stability of the neighborhoods that were so recently revived. Federal rent subsidies are likely to be cut; if the Mayor and City Council decide to significantly reduce city spending on housing, many experts fear the consequences.
"If we cut off public and private resources, these neighborhoods will slide back very quickly," said Katherine Wylde, president of the New York City Housing Partnership.

HEADLINE: A Proposed Definition of Poverty May Raise Number of U.S. Poor

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
Experts at the National Academy of Sciences will soon recommend to Congress huge changes in the way poverty is defined and measured, and the changes could substantially increase the number of working Americans classified as poor.
The official definition of poverty used by the Federal Government for three decades is based simply on cash income before taxes. But in a report to be issued on Wednesday, a panel of experts convened by the Academy three years ago at the behest of Congress says the Government should move toward a concept of poverty based on disposable income, the amount left after a family pays taxes and essential expenses. 
 Under the proposal, the Government would count not only a family's cash income, but also noncash Government benefits like food stamps, subsidized housing, school lunches and home energy assistance. Those items would increase family income.
But other recommendations would reduce family income. Specifically, the panel said that taxes, work expenses, child care costs and medical expenses paid by consumers from their own pockets should be deducted from cash income.
If its recommendations are adopted, the panel said, there will be "higher poverty rates for families with one or more workers and for families that lack health insurance coverage, and lower rates for families that receive public assistance."
The 12-member committee, the Panel on Poverty and Family Assistance, was convened in 1992, when Congress was controlled by Democrats. But the forthcoming report seems unlikely to be embraced by the Republicans who now control Congress and who could block changes to which they object.
The recommendations have immense political implications. Voters and politicians use poverty statistics to assess the performance of Presidents and the health of the economy. Eligibility for more than 25 Government programs, including food stamps, Head Start and Medicaid, is linked in some way to the official poverty levels. Poverty is also a factor in the formulas for distributing billions of Federal dollars to state and local governments for education and other purposes.
In its report, the panel tried to estimate the effects of its proposals on the poverty rate for 1992. In the Census Bureau's original report for that year, 14.5 percent of Americans were officially classified as poor, but under the panel's recommendations, this figure would have been at least 15 percent or 16 percent, and under some of the panel's options for measuring poverty, it could have exceeded 18 percent. Each percentage point represents more than 2.5 million people.
The panel also recommends that the official poverty threshold, now $15,141 for a family of four, be adjusted for geographical differences in housing costs. The threshold is now the same for all families of a particular size, even though it is well known that housing costs are greater in New York City, for example, than in rural Mississippi.
In its report, the panel will say, "Our major conclusion is that the current measure needs to be revised: it no longer provides an accurate picture of the differences in the extent of economic poverty among population groups or geographic areas of the country."
The panel was headed by Prof. Robert T. Michael, a former dean of the Graduate School of Public Policy Studies at the University of Chicago. Members of the panel, including economists, sociologists and other social scientists, said they tried to be nonpartisan and apolitical.
It was conservatives who first demanded a full-scale re-examination of the way that poverty is measured. Since the early 1980's, they have asserted that the current definition of poverty overstates the problem because it ignores the value of noncash benefits like food stamps and Medicaid.
But the report contains a stinging dissent from the one conservative Republican on the panel, John F. Cogan, who was deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan. The panel's major recommendations, he said, "are not based on scientific evidence," but reflect "value judgments made by scientists with a particular point of view."
The panel does not recommend a specific dollar amount for the new poverty level, saying, "Ultimately, that decision is a matter of judgment." But it does suggest "a reasonable range" for the poverty threshold: $13,700 to $15,900 for a family of four in 1992 dollars. The official poverty level in that year was $14,228, and it would probably rise faster in future years under the panel's recommendations than under current policy.
The original poverty level, developed by Mollie Orshansky of the Social Security Administration in the early 1960's, was set at three times the cost of a minimal diet, because the Agriculture Department had found that the average family spent about one-third of its income on food.
But in its report, the Academy said that the poverty level should be set in a different way, to reflect the cost of food, clothing and shelter including utilities, plus a small additional amount to allow for other needs like household supplies and personal care.
Even under the traditional definition of poverty, the number of poor people has been rising. In its latest report, the Census Bureau said that the number of Americans in poverty rose in 1993 for the fourth straight year, to 39.3 million.
The current measure of poverty was developed in the early 1960's and has remained essentially unchanged since then. "From the beginning," the panel said, "the poverty measure had weaknesses, and they have become more apparent and consequential because of far-reaching changes in the U.S. society and economy and in Government policies."
The official poverty levels are adjusted each year for increases in consumer prices, so they "represent the same purchasing power now as they did 30 years ago," the panel said. But, it declared, the poverty thresholds have not kept pace with improvements in the American standard of living. Indeed, it said, simply updating the thresholds for inflation "ignores changes in living standards over time."
The panel said that the official poverty thresholds should be "updated annually to reflect changes in expenditures on food, clothing and shelter over the previous three years." If President Clinton adopted this recommendation, the official poverty levels would probably rise faster than the current thresholds because consumer spending on these basic goods and services is expected to rise more than prices over the long term.
The panel said that its proposed yardstick would more accurately measure poverty and "would improve the targeting of benefits to needy families." But it could also increase the number of people who qualify for assistance and the cost of social welfare programs. So, given fiscal constraints, the Government may need to readjust the standards for determining need and eligibility, the panel said.
In his dissent, Mr. Cogan, an economist at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University, said the panel's recommendations would "fundamentally change the concept of poverty from an absolute standard to a relative standard." As a result, he said, "the poverty line would rise about 8 percent faster per year than under the current method."
The panel finds many defects in the current measure of poverty:
*"Because of the increased labor force participation of mothers, there are more working families who must pay for child care, but the current measure does not distinguish between the needs of families in which the parents do or do not work outside the home."
*"Because of differences in health status and insurance coverage, different population groups face significant variations in medical care costs, but the current measure does not take account of them."
*The current measure of poverty takes no account of tax laws and social welfare programs that profoundly alter the economic well-being of millions of Americans. For example, Social Security payroll taxes have substantially increased over the last 30 years, reducing workers' disposable income, while the food stamp program has expanded, raising disposable income for beneficiaries.
As might be expected, the panel had great difficulty deciding how to treat medical care benefits. Ultimately, it decided that the value of Medicare, Medicaid and health benefits provided by employers should not be counted as income. And the proposed poverty thresholds, based on the need for food, clothing and shelter, do not include an allowance for medical care.
But the panel said that in determining family income, the Government should deduct any amounts that family members actually pay for medical care or health insurance premiums. "Even with insurance," it said, "many people must pay out of pocket to obtain that insurance or to receive care, and such expenses reduce disposable income."
Likewise, the panel said that income should be redefined to exclude child care costs. "The child care deduction should be capped and apply only to families in which there is no adult at home to provide the care," it said.
The panel also said, "The definition of 'family' should be broadened for purposes of poverty measurement to include cohabiting couples" who are not married.

HEADLINE: TERROR IN OKLAHOMA: SECURITY;
Overseas, Oklahoma City Bombing Is Seen Through Prism of Experience

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

 BODY:
While the Oklahoma City bombing has thrown the United States into a clamorous debate over what steps will be needed to control domestic terrorism, many in the Old World have been looking on with an experienced and somewhat paternalistic eye, as if to say, "Welcome to the club."
In many Western European countries, domestic terrorism has been a fact of life for decades, whether from the Red Army Faction in Germany, the Irish Republican Army in Britain, Basque separatists in Spain, the Mafia in Italy, Algerians in France or one of the many other groups seeking violent publicity for their causes and grievances. Cities like Beirut and Belfast have become synonyms for political violence, and many nations, like Israel, have learned to live under constant threat. 
 Rooted in such a background, many comments in the foreign press focused on America's loss of innocence. "Whatever happens, one conclusion is already clear," Le Monde of France said in an editorial. "The United States is no longer impervious to that urban terrorism which their West European allies have known for a long time."
Along with expressions of sympathy came somewhat more testy reminders that the United States could hardly regard itself as less violent than the rest of the world. If Americans have tended to view terrorism as a foreign phenomenon, they noted, much of the rest of the world has often seen the United States as a nation that indulged a passion for guns and an addiction to violence.
Russians commonly blame the proliferation of American movie violence for the spread of crime and street violence, and American incursions into Grenada and Panama prompted many European commentaries on the tenacity of the "cowboy mentality" in American foreign policy.
"The fact is that America is dominated by an excess of violence and that conflicts there are far too often resolved with weapons," Stuttgarter Zeitung in Germany editorialized.
From a Third World perspective, Cairo's Al Akhbar el Yom expressed the hope that Oklahoma City would serve as a lesson in humility for the powerful states: "No longer will the great powers be able to reprimand small countries and complain that their measures to contain terrorism violate human rights."
Indeed, the central question in the aftermath of the Oklahoma blast was how far the world's leading democracy was prepared to curtail civil liberties to combat terrorism. It was a question many other major democracies had already been forced to confront, and many had responded with legislation that nudged up against, or breached, the canons of civil and human rights, usually with the reluctant consent of their populations.
Britain's long struggle with the Irish Republican Army calmed after a cease-fire last Aug. 31, but the legacy is bitter. Since it first sent troops into Northern Ireland to counter the militant nationalists of the I.R.A. in 1969, the British Government has tried a variety of measures, with varying degrees of effectiveness.
It made even membership in the I.R.A. a crime, and Northern Irish courts were authorized to dispense with juries and the usual rules of evidence in the trials of terrorists. For several years in the early 1970's, I.R.A. suspects could be interned indefinitely without trial, and after that provision was lifted, they could still be held up to a week without being formally charged.
Most of the measures were limited to Northern Ireland, but a large bomb explosion in England in 1974 led to the passage of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which the Government itself described as "Draconian" but necessary. Since then, 35 people have been killed in the 20 most serious attacks, and mainland Britons have learned to live with roadblocks, bomb threats, impromptu searches and barricades.
One of the more curious measures was a law passed in 1988 that allowed I.R.A. spokesmen to be seen on television, but not heard. Thus Gerry Adams would be seen speaking, but his words would be spoken by an actor or written out in subtitles. The law was believed to derive from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's abhorrence for the voices of the nationalists, and with Mrs. Thatcher no longer in office, it was recently dropped.
In West Germany, the rise of the fanatic Red Army Faction in the late 1960's and the attack by Palestinian terrorists at the Munich Olympics in 1972 challenged the resistance to a strong national police force that had originated in the abuses of the Nazi era. In 1973, the elite federal police group known as GSG-9, or Grenzschutzgruppe-9, was set up to respond to airplane hijackings and other acts of terror.
Most German laws draw no distinction between terrorists and other criminals, but a few special measures have been enacted. A law passed in 1976 made membership in a group that had been declared terrorist punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and several Red Army members were imprisoned this way.
The German police have been empowered to tap the phones of suspected terrorists and to open their mail, and prosecutors have the power to reduce the sentences of terrorist suspects who cooperate with investigators. Other measures bar any contact among jailed terrorists and provide for the Government to monitor their meetings with lawyers. Prison wardens are authorized to place convicted terrorists under surveillance and to separate them from visitors with glass partitions.
Like Germany, Japan has been reluctant to give excessive powers to the police, but unlike Germany, it has not been pressured to do so. The only direct consequence so far of the recent poison gas attacks in Japan has been to ban the nerve gas sarin. Otherwise, there is no anti-terrorism law, and laws on surveillance and wiretapping are generally vague.
Battered by Middle Eastern terrorists in the 1980's, France responded with a variety of special measures. One of them recently backfired when Prime Minister Edouard Balladur came under fire for authorizing a wiretap against the relative of a judge investigating the finances of Mr. Balladur's party.
The bombing in Oklahoma City, despite the enormous damage and carnage, did not represent the sort of pervasive threat that much of Europe has faced.
But if in the past the United States was prone to remind the Old World about the primacy of human rights over security, the veterans of terrorism in the Old World seemed to feel it was now their turn to issue some reminders to America.
Writing in Liberation in Paris, the columnist Jacques Amalric raised the hope that Americans "would come to question the virtues ascribed to isolationism, that chronic disease of the United States, which supposedly protects them from the evils of the world."
In London, The Guardian asserted, "Beefing up the F.B.I. is not the real answer to the sickness of American society."
The Schwaebische Zeitung in Germany editorialized, "Controlling enemies must not bring a return to the McCarthy era, when Communists in the United States were hunted like wild animals."
And The Economist of England proclaimed, "The dangers of government acting too strongly may be greater than the dangers of failing to act."

HEADLINE: U.N. Aid Officials Plead for Food Relief

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
United Nations officials in charge of funneling relief aid to victims of war and drought are warning of severe food shortages in Central Africa, Bosnia and Herzegovina and other areas because of multiplying crises and cutbacks in donations by wealthy nations.
Relief officials are making emergency pleas for the United States, Japan, the European Union and other donors to contribute additional food to help hundreds of thousands of refugees from wars in Rwanda, Bosnia, Liberia and the Caucasus region who are now receiving a fraction of the normal daily food allotment. 
"Right now we are operating hand to mouth," said Catherine Bertini, executive director of the World Food Program, a United Nations agency responsible for emergency food relief. There are currently 25 crises involving 24.3 million people.
"Our stockpiles are at an all-time low," she said. "We borrow from everywhere we can. If there is a new crisis, it will be very difficult for us to come up with more food. It's all needed so desperately."
In Goma, Zaire, for example, some 700,000 Rwandans in refugee camps have been receiving rations of 1,077 calories a day, half the desired amount. Donor nations have contributed just one-sixth of the 138,000 metric tons of food needed this year to feed about 1.7 million people fleeing wars in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Chechnya.
Last week the World Food Program made an emergency plea to donors, saying it would have to slash rations for 437,000 people in Sarajevo and 300,000 people in other encircled Bosnian enclaves in July unless wealthy nations immediately contributed more money.
"We have never been in such bad shape in the former Yugoslavia, and we are really getting nervous," Ms. Bertini said. "We need firm pledges right now."
Similarly grim observations are being made by officials at the United States Agency for International Development, the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization and private relief groups.
Relief experts fear their efforts to meet emergency needs could fall hopelessly behind this year if either of two feared catastrophes materializes: a flood of refugees from Burundi, whose ethnic tensions parallel Rwanda's, or a prolongation of the drought in southern African countries including Botswana and Malawi.
"We're all worried that drought could produce a very bad harvest in southern Africa this year," said Lionel Rosenblatt, president of Refugees International, a Washington-based relief organization. "We're definitely out of food and money for the next big emergency."
In one sign that the cupboard is nearly bare, the United States has just $25 million left in its $817 million emergency food budget with five months left in the fiscal year.
Governments, aid officials say, usually come up with enough food to prevent famine when a Bosnia or Rwanda leaps onto the evening news and front pages. That was the case a year ago, when Rwanda's ethnic massacres and refugee crisis galvanized the world into action.
But many of the new shortages are arising in areas where crises have dragged on for years, like Bosnia, or in places that have only hovered near catastrophe, like Liberia, where civil strife has disrupted food production since 1989.
In another factor contributing to the worst emergency food situation in more than a decade, 23 donor nations including the United States have reduced aid commitments to 5.35 million metric tons of grain for next year, from 7.5 million metric tons, under an international food treaty.
Under pressure from Congress to cut foreign assistance, the Clinton Administration has proposed cutting American food aid to $1.02 billion next year, less than half the amount allotted in 1993.
Compounding the shortfall are cuts in agricultural subsidies, which have effectively erased vast surpluses that many Western countries used to tap to relieve crises overseas.
Demand, meanwhile, has grown steadily. First came crises in the Sudan and Afghanistan that required outside agencies to feed more than two million people. Angola was added to the list in 1989, and Somalia, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Rwanda the following year.
War broke out in 1991 in the former Yugoslavia, where the World Food Program is now feeding 2.1 million people. Food emergencies have since arisen from assorted wars in the former Soviet Union, from Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan to Tajikistan and most recently, Chechnya.
"There are a lot of weary donors around the world," said David Garms, an American representative to the United Nations food organizations.

HEADLINE: District of Columbia Special Election Will Test Influence of Marion Barry

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
When Marion S. Barry Jr. was elected Mayor of the District of Columbia last November, vacating a seat on the City Council, he won more than 91 percent of the votes in the ward he represented.
But that level of confidence faces a stern test in a special election on Tuesday when voters in the ward choose a successor to complete Mr. Barry's four-term council term from among 21 candidates. The Mayor is a strong supporter of one of the candidates, Eydie D. Whittington. 
 Throughout his campaign last year, which followed three terms as Mayor, six months in jail on a cocaine charge and election to the council in 1992, Mr. Barry promised better times for the residents of his ward, No. 8.
The ward has the city's highest rates of crime, unemployment and welfare recipients, and it remains the poorest jurisdiction in the city. Stark reminders of people in need abound: the ward has no movie theater or bowling alley and there are 32 liquor stores to 1 supermarket.
Many residents say that since Mayor Barry took office, instead of improvements they have only suffered as a result of the city's current fiscal crisis and the subsequent cuts in services. And with a Federal control board soon to be appointed to oversee the city's finances, many ward residents contend that their quality of life could get worse.
"Very few people even think he did anything as a City Council member to enhance the ward," James Bunn, president of the Ward 8 Democratic Party and one of the council candidates, said of Mr. Barry. "With a control board coming, he has done even less. This has always been the least-served ward in the city and we've already seen cutbacks."
Further, Mr. Barry has recently become embroiled in an investigation over the possible diversion of $2,000 from the Mayor's campaign fund. A former housekeeper said that she was instructed to cash a check to her son from Mr. Barry's wife, Cora Masters Barry, and give the money to Mrs. Barry's son, Walter Masters.
The authorities are also trying to determine whether a contractor working in the house offered the housekeeper a job to change her story. They are also looking into accusations that former members of Mr. Barry's security detail tried to intimidate the housekeeper into changing her story.
If all that reflects badly on the Mayor, it could also hurt Ms. Whittington, a 39-year-old marketing director for a downtown law firm and a neighborhood worker who is making her first run for a position in city government. Mr. Barry has worked tirelessly for her, helping her raise more than $15,000 in campaign contributions, more than any other candidate.
The cost to her, however, is that opponents and many voters view her as the Mayor's pawn, a vote he can count on at a time the council is showing independence. Twice, for example, the council has voted against Mr. Barry's efforts to raise $40 million in property taxes.
At a candidates forum on Thursday night, William Lockridge, a counselor in the public schools and one of the leading contenders, called the Mayor's endorsement "patronage politics" and suggested that any mayoral endorsement of a council candidate "violates the spirit of the electoral process."
Ms. Whittington bristled at the suggestion she would become a rubber-stamp for the Mayor, insisting that they disagree on several issues, and cited as an example the Mayor's belief that the department of education, an independent agency, should be placed under his control. Ms. Whittington says it should remain independent.
Of the Mayor, she said, "I think he sees in me someone who is committed, energetic and persistent in wanting to do something about Ward 8."
When the question of Mr. Barry's support arose at the forum, Ms. Whittington responded sharply: "He walked past 20 candidates to endorse me. I didn't ask for his endorsement. He gave it to me. Please get over it. I have it."
With a light turnout expected and so many people running for the 18-month term -- more than in any other local election since the District won limited home rule from Congress more than 20 years ago -- political analysts are reluctant to predict a winner. Most agree, however, that the leading contenders include three of the 18 Democrats running: Ms. Whittington, Mr. Lockridge, 46, and Sandy Allen, 51, who is active in the community and who served as Mr. Barry's constituents service director in the ward for six years and as his campaign manager in the ward in 1992.
Ms. Allen said she was less upset over Mr. Barry's not endorsing her than his backing for Ms. Whittington. Ms. Allen, a fourth-generation resident of the ward, said that Ms. Whittington, who moved to the ward in 1987, and others are not as familiar with its problems as she is.
If Ms. Whittington is riding Mr. Barry's political coattails, Malik Shabazz, a 28-year-old law student at Howard University and a follower of Minister Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam, is clutching at them. Mr. Shabazz, who won national attention last year for his anti-Semitic remarks in a speech, is running as an independent on a platform of self-sufficiency for blacks. He advocatesa boycott of all stores in the ward owned by Asians. Their presence, he argued at the forum, prevents blacks from establishing an economic foothold.
His campaign literature includes a picture of Mr. Barry, and in response to a question at the forum about his experience, Mr. Shabazz described himself as a "student of the previous legislator, Councilman Marion Barry."
After winning the Democratic primary last September, Mr. Barry began distancing himself from Mr. Shabazz. "There is a young man hanging on to my camp, Malik Shabazz," he said then. "I've been trying to get out of the way for a long time."

HEADLINE: British Watch Trial Of Simpson

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: LONDON, April 29

 BODY:
Since it began in January, the O. J. Simpson trial has been beamed here by satellite every night, providing the British with a window into a peculiarly American mix of crime, race and celebrity. But in a country where cameras are not allowed in courtrooms, the most extraordinary thing about the Simpson trial is that it is shown on television at all.
For Tougay Hassan, a grocery clerk in north London, broadcasts of the trial are exotic and compelling. But as much as Mr. Hassan enjoys watching it, he said, he is also distressed by the focus on celebrity, by the chatty analysis and by what he perceives as American overplay. Although Britain has its tabloid excesses, pretrial publicity is forbidden under British law and lawyers and judges are not allowed to discuss cases out of court. And Mr. Hassan said that might not be so bad. 
 "I don't think you can get a fair trial with all this razzmatazz," said Mr. Hassan, who first heard of Mr. Simpson when watching the freeway chase on television in June.
Newspapers here began covering the case when Mr. Simpson was arrested and still regularly publish articles about the trial. The British Sky Broadcasting Group, the Rupert Murdoch-owned satellite system, is providing nightly broadcasts of the trial, both taped and live, on its 24-hour all-news channel for more than four hours, starting at 7 P.M.
The BBC's second channel is broadcasting a weekly, hourlong Sunday program that includes trial highlights, commentary and coverage of the coverage. The program, which is broadcast in the evening, has been drawing audiences of 1.5 million to 2 million, or about an 8 percent share of the audience then.
Why is anyone here interested?
"People get a chance to watch amazing lawyers at work," said Janey Walker, series editor for the BBC program covering the Simpson trial. "They get a chance to see something that they know is a phenomenon in America. And they get a chance to hear extraordinary details about how a group of people in California live their lives."
But for legal experts like Geoffrey Robertson, a high-profile lawyer who regularly watches the BBC program, the value of the coverage lies in its insight into the American court system.
"When I watch it, it makes me want to salute America for televising the courts, because television cuts lawyers down to size," said Mr. Robertson, who argues that the British court system is far too shrouded in secrecy.
"The oversized ego of F. Lee Bailey was reduced by the disastrous cross-examination of Fuhrman," he said, referring to one of the police detectives. "I think that's good because lawyers, and particularly American lawyers, are greedy egomaniacs."
At Sky Broadcasting, Liz Roberts, a spokeswoman, said that its daily coverage of the trial attracts an average audience of 112,000, or double the figure for its news, and that 38 percent of satellite owners have watched part of the trial on Sky.
Gary Solis, an American lawyer who provides commentary for Sky, said he was amazed at viewers' responses, not just across Britain, but also in continental Europe. What strikes foreigners, said Mr. Solis, who teaches criminal law at the London School of Economics, is how open, almost folksy, the American system seems.
"In England you don't have the informal and humorous exchanges between the judge and practitioners, and between the practitioners themselves, and you don't have the lawyers making statements outside the courtroom," he said. "And certainly judges here in their robes and wigs wouldn't drink Diet Coke out of a black coffee mug."
Mr. Solis has become something of a celebrity here, touted by his neighbors and even recognized on the street, where a passer-by once called out, "I really admire your work," as he waited for a taxi. In the end, he said, what interests the British is the same thing that interests Americans.
"I bet I've asked 50 people here why British people are interested at all in an individual that they clearly didn't know about before," he said. "The answer is that there's sex, celebrity, money, fame and violence all in this courtroom. The things that fascinate on the other side of the Atlantic seem to fascinate here as well."

HEADLINE: CLINTON SEEKS WAY TO RETAIN GUN BAN IN SCHOOL ZONES

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that he was "terribly disappointed" by the Supreme Court ruling this week overturning the Federal ban on gun possession within 1,000 feet of schools. The President ordered Attorney General Janet Reno to recommend ways to get around the decision, perhaps by linking Federal education aid to states' enforcement of such bans.
"This Supreme Court decision could condemn more of our children to going to schools where there are guns," Mr. Clinton said in his weekly radio address, in an unusually pointed Presidential comment on a Court ruling. "And our job is to help our children learn everything they need to get ahead in safety, not to send them to school and put them in harm's way. 
 "I am determined to keep guns out of our schools. That's what the American people want, and it's the right thing to do."
Mr. Clinton made his comments at the end of a week in which he repeatedly pledged to protect the public with new Federal measures to combat terrorism. The remarks represent his latest effort to argue for a Federal role on a contentious issue like gun control by casting himself as a defender of children's health and safety. He has made a similar case in opposing efforts by the Republican Congress to curtail the Federal school lunch program or relax environmental regulations.
"We all know that guns simply don't belong in school, so members of Congress of both parties passed the law," Mr. Clinton said in the speech, which he taped on Friday for broadcast today. "Unfortunately the Supreme Court struck down the specific law. They said the Federal Government couldn't regulate that activity, because it didn't have enough to do with interstate commerce."
"I am directing the Attorney General to come back to me within a week with what action I can take to keep guns away from schools," he added. "I want the action to be constitutional, but I am determined to keep guns away from schools.
"For example, Congress could encourage states to ban guns from school zones by linking Federal funds to enactment of school-zone gun bans. At least we could tie the money we have for safe schools to such a ban."
More than 40 states have laws banning guns in or near schools. So Mr. Clinton's order has more symbolic import than practical effect.
But it was not lost on the White House that the ruling was the first in nearly 60 years in which the Court has overturned a Federal law on the ground that it exceeded the Congressional power over commerce. In 1936, at the height of the New Deal, the High Court struck down minimum-wage and maximum-hour requirements for the coal industry.
In a bitterly divided 5-to-4 ruling on Wednesday the Court held that Congress acted beyond its constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce five years ago, when it made possession of a gun within 1,000 feet of a school a Federal crime. The ruling, while overturning no precedents, nevertheless cast doubt on Congress's ability to regulate a range of activities it has recently defined as Federal crimes, including carjackings and drive-by shootings.
Both of Mr. Clinton's two appointees to the Court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, were in the minority. In his dissent Justice Breyer said the decision "threatens legal uncertainty in an area of law that, until this case, seemed reasonably well settled."
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the majority, said the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 was a criminal statute that had nothing to do with "commerce" in the traditional sense. He rejected the Administration's argument that guns and violence in schools hurt the economy by impeding education and making children less productive potential workers.
The opinion left open options like Mr. Clinton's suggestion to tie Federal aid to the adoption of state gun bans. Attaching such strings to Federal money in exchange for state action is a traditional approach in a host of fields like highway aid and education.
In fact, as Mr. Clinton noted today, Congress last year passed a somewhat similar measure, the Gun Free Schools Act. It requires school districts around the country to expel for at least a year any student caught taking a gun to school, and Mr. Clinton authorized the Education Department to withhold Federal aid from districts that do not comply.
Under the law, school districts have until October to adopt "zero-tolerance" policies on gun possession or risk losing aid.
In reserving comment on the Court decision until today, Mr. Clinton assured himself wide coverage in large-circulation Sunday newspapers and broadcasts. But White House aides said he had not made the decision to speak out against the ruling lightly. With relatively rare exceptions, Presidents cut the Supreme Court a wide berth in interpreting the law of the land.
"It comes down to the fact that kids are different," the senior Presidential adviser, George Stephanopoulos, said. "The President believes we are measured by how we treat our children, and it's simply common sense to keep guns out of schools. The importance of signaling a strong stand against violence and the prospect of kids' killing kids with guns -- they shouldn't have outweighed the traditional reluctance to comment."
In his address Mr. Clinton cited statistics on school violence from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to buttress his case. He said the C.D.C. has recorded 105 violent school-related deaths in the last two years. In 1990, Mr. Clinton said, a study found that 1 in 24 students carried guns in a 30-day period, and by 1993 the ratio was 1 in 12.
"The number of high school students carrying a gun doubled in only three years," Mr. Clinton said. "This is certainly a national crisis, and we must have a national effort to fight it. We need a seamless web of safety that keeps guns out of the hands of our children and out of our schools."

Blue Jays Take Aim On Belated Chance For 3d Straight Title

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Eighteen months have passed since the Toronto Blue Jays won their second successive World Series. Because no one won a World Series six months ago, the Blue Jays are the only team this year that can win the Series for a third consecutive time.
"Doing it twice is a remarkable achievement," Gord Ash, the Jays' general manager, said. "Doing it a third time would be even more so." 
 If the Blue Jays were to win this year, their feat would fall short of the three in a row won by the Oakland Athletics in 1972-73-74 and the Yankees in the 50's and 30's. The achievement would not be cheapened, but the streak would be tainted slightly because of the relatively poor season the Jays had last year.
When the strike ended the season prematurely, Toronto was 16 games from first place, had virtually no chance of making the playoffs even as the wild-card team and had a losing record (55-60) for the first time in 12 years. What happened, and what might be different about this season? Ash offered a multipronged view.
"Winning two championships in a row puts not so much a physical but a mental drain on the players," the general manager said. "When you look at the time element alone, starting spring training in the middle of February and going almost to November, it is mentally taxing."
Specifically, Ash pointed to the absence of Duane Ward, the team's closer, who had recorded a league-leading 45 saves the previous season.
"We just weren't ready to start the season," he said. "Our guys were worn out, we were a little tentative in the bullpen, our hitters put too much pressure on themselves to score runs to make up for the deficiency in the bullpen."
Ash recalled an early-season game that he said was critical to undermining the team's confidence. Having scored five runs each in the eighth and ninth innings, the Blue Jays took a 13-6 lead into the California half of the ninth, but the bullpen squandered it as the Angels erupted for seven runs in the ninth, then won with another run in the 10th.
"It's hard to point to one game and say it had that much effect, but it set the tone for a while," Ash said. "We didn't get cranked up until sometime in June."
Seeking a more general reason for the decline of a two-time champion, Ash said: "Maybe it's overplayed and it's hard to prove, but that mental edge wasn't there." But why should it have been there entering the 1993 season and not last year?
"From '92 to '93, we turned over the roster a little," he said. "We had some fresh faces. Paul Molitor was one of them, and he was leading that charge in terms of being hungry to win. That wasn't so much the case from '93 to '94. There were a couple youngsters in there who were new, but it wasn't the same as having veterans like Molitor coming in. They were in a little awe playing for a two-time championship club, taking the place of important people. That had some bearing on what happened."
The Blue Jays have a pair of rookies in this season's lineup, Alex Gonzalez at shortstop and Shawn Green in right field, but the awe should be absent. Further, the pitching rotation has a pair of new veterans, David Cone and Danny Darwin, who Ash said are "hungry to win."
The Blue Jays generally are eager to return to their '92-'93 status. "Not having the kind of season we wanted to have will have an impact," said the general manager, himself a rookie eager to duplicate the performance of his predecessor and mentor, Pat Gillick.
 
Righetti Still Wants a Role
 A year ago in spring training, Dave Righetti was discussing the efforts of some of his fellow aging relievers to hang on as long as they could, moving here and there and wherever else necessary to get a job.
"I don't know if I want to bounce around and do that," he said, sitting in the Oakland Athletics' clubhouse. "I didn't really want to leave the Yankees and go somewhere else. Then I'd rather have finished my career with the Giants. Now I'd like to make this my last stop. But if things don't go well this year, you won't see me anymore. I'm almost sure of that."
Righetti, now 36 years old, hasn't been seen prominently this year, but he's still around.
The Athletics released him last April 27. Eighteen days later, he joined the Blue Jays' organization and split the rest of the season between Knoxville and Toronto. The Blue Jays released him after the season. This year, the left-hander went to spring training with the Chicago White Sox, but he didn't win a major league job. Now he has bounced to the minors again, Nashville this time. The next bounce, he hopes, will land him in Chicago.
 
New Dodger Discoveries
 Watching the Los Angeles Dodgers shed Orel Hershiser, Brett Butler, Kevin Gross, Jim Gott, Roger McDowell and Cory Snyder, one might be tempted to conclude that they were playing the payroll game. Tommy Lasorda, beginning his 19th year as the Dodgers' manager, was asked if the roster moves were economic or strategic.
"I would have to say it's practically all strategic," he said, "because if there's a player we felt we needed, we would get him, so it's not strictly economic. But we feel we wanted to give the young players the chance to play, like we did two years ago with Mike Piazza. We wanted to give him the opportunity so we let Mike Scioscia go. The same with Eric Karros. We let Kal Daniels go. The same thing with Raul Mondesi last year. All three of those guys were the National League rookie of the year."
The Dodgers, Lasorda said, like outfielders Billy Ashley and Todd Hollandsworth and pitchers Hideo Nomo and Pedro Osuna. "If we didn't have these guys, we would've signed those other guys," he added. "We have good young talent, and talent used develops. Talent not used wastes away."
 
Reinsdorf Responds
 No one ever accused Jerry Reinsdorf of being acutely sensitive to criticism, but he draws the line when he is cited for decisions his baseball people make.
It was suggested here recently that Reinsdorf, the behind-the-scenes leader of the hard-line owners in the labor dispute, cares more about winning off the field than on it. Exhibit A was the failure of the Chicago White Sox to sign Mickey Tettleton as a free agent, opting instead to make Chris Sabo their designated hitter.
That decision, Reinsdorf said, was made by General Manager Ron Schueler and his aides, a fact Schueler confirmed.
"We just did not want any strikeouts in the No. 4 hole," Schueler said. "Last year, we tried to get away from it with Franco. We found we were better off putting the ball in play. We're not concerned with the power."
In the past six seasons, Tettleton has hit 153 home runs to 101 for Sabo but has struck out twice as often, 782 times in 2,742 at-bats (once every 3.5) to 367 in 2,607 for Sabo (once every 7.1). Strikeouts notwithstanding, Tettleton, in that period, has driven in 449 runs to Sabo's 355.
 
Belcher Bides Time
 Assessing his plight as a free agent during spring training, Tim Belcher said he made the mistake of having a bad season for a bad team. His 15 losses for the last-place Detroit Tigers led the American League, and his 5.89 earned run average was the highest for any pitcher with 131 innings or more.
He remains jobless, working out with a former team, the Los Angeles Dodgers, in their extended spring training program at Port St. Lucie, Fla.
"He had a number of offers, but the offers basically were low in the economic track and with teams he didn't want to pursue," Scott Boras, Belcher's agent, reported. "So he basically has taken the tack that he's going to get in shape, have a normal spring training, and when clubs start looking for starters, his market will be better than it has been."
 
Total Payroll Holds Steady
 With about three dozen free agents accepting pay cuts that exceeded last year's average salary of nearly $1.2 million and others signing for tiny salaries as well, it seemed very likely that the total major league payroll would plummet this season. Preliminary indications, however, are that it should be about the same as a year ago.
After eight players who had filed for salary arbitration signed Friday, the total payroll was about $810 million. The 39 players left on the arbitration list are seeking about $100 million in salary; their clubs have offered about $75 million.
Most of those cases will settle close to the midpoint of the players' and clubs' figures. Of those that reach hearings, players will win some, clubs will win more. Add about $85 million for all of those players to the current total, and the payroll reaches $895 million.
One more step is needed to compare the payroll with last year's figure. Because of the abbreviated spring training, clubs have 28 players on the rosters. If the extra players are basically young players at or close to the minimum salary, their total of about $9 million could be subtracted from the estimated payroll, leaving $886 million.
That is virtually the same total that opening-day payrolls came to last season.

HEADLINE: Waterways Give Up Grim Telltale Signs of Spring

BYLINE: By JENNIFER KINGSON BLOOM 

 BODY:
To those who patrol the waterways in this city of rivers, bridges and mobsters, the arrival of spring foretells a phenomenon that is as unpleasant as it is inevitable: floating bodies.
Bodies appear in the waterways year round, but harbor officials estimate that as many as half of those recovered annually are found in April and May. At this time of year, the water warms to 38 degrees Fahrenheit and higher, and gases are produced inside a submerged body, causing it to float to the surface. 
 While the United States Coast Guard and the city's Fire Department vessels often find the bodies first, only the Police Department's Harbor Unit is authorized to retrieve them. The task may sound macabre. But harbor veterans whose jobs include spotting and retrieving bodies view the duty with nonchalance.
"The first time you get a little bit queasy, but after a while if you pretend it's actually not a person, it's a lot easier," said Jason Cirillo, who has been a Coast Guard seaman for four years. "If you look at it as just like a sack of potatoes -- oh, I know, it sounds morbid."
The procedure has spun off its own lore. Officers sometimes swap stories while waiting for detectives to come to investigate a possible homicide and the Medical Examiner's office to take the body to the morgue. "The person with the least seniority has to search the body for any identifying effects," said Sgt. Jim Cowan, a Harbor Unit diver.
Capt. Vincent Abbene, commander of the Harbor Unit, said most of the recovered bodies were suicides, and their numbers fluctuated with the economy. "I guess things weren't so great for New Yorkers in the early 80's, so there were a lot of suicides," he said. "In the late 80's, things got better."
Winter is the season with the most suicides. Because many people jump from bridges at night, often nobody sees them and their bodies are not recovered until much later. Cold temperatures also cause the water to function as a refrigerator, preserving a body under ice.
"If somebody jumps in the water in the summer, they'll be up the next day, but if somebody jumps in November, they won't come up until the spring," Sergeant Cowan said. "The deeper the water, the longer they take to come up."
Spring rains and melting snow also churn up the water and bring bodies to the surface. "The faster current may help to dislodge bodies that are trapped in debris on the bottom of the river," said Dr. Charles S. Hirsch, the city's Chief Medical Examiner. The Harbor Unit has recovered 11 bodies so far this year, compared with 38 in 1994. The numbers have declined steadily since 1984, when 92 bodies were retrieved.
While many of the bodies are, in the waterfront jargon, "jumpers," or people who have committed suicide by jumping off a bridge, others are homeless people who have accidentally fallen in the water unnoticed. But the most memorable are the victims of gangland slayings.
Sgt. John Cummings, a 12-year veteran of the Harbor Unit who does about 1,500 dives a year, said he has helped retrieve bodies the police later identified as mob informers. Divers have recovered people out of the water who have had cement blocks tied to them, he said. "Once all those gases build up, the body can lift all kinds of weight."
Last week, the diving unit searched the Harlem River for a body that a mob informer told the police had been disposed of there two years ago, anchored by 40 pounds of weights and chains. "They think if you put it in the water, it will disappear," Captain Abbene said.
Some bodies turn out to be victims of high-profile crimes. "Joel Rifkin put them in 55-gallon drums," said Sergeant Cummings, referring to the Long Island man who has confessed to killing 17 women and dumping their bodies around the New York region. "We recovered two of them by Coney Island."
The recovery work does have its poignant side. If someone is reported dead but no body is found, surviving family members may have difficulty collecting insurance claims or pensions. Finding a lost loved one also adds that sense of closure.
"If you think about some family missing this person, it fills a void for them," Sergeant Cummings said. "In that way, you kind of feel it's a little something you're doing to try to help the family out."

TAKEOVERS
The Day Chrysler Fever Broke
Two weeks ago, Chrysler's stock soared -- simply because one man, Kirk Kerkorian, said he wanted to buy the company. Since then, the stock has done a tentative dance, with doubts creeping in about the deal but investors, remembering the power of Mr. Kerkorian's 10 percent stake, not quite ready to bail out. But last week the company lashed out at its uninvited suitor, saying it had no interest in "gambling with Chrysler's future" and brushing off Mr. Kerkorian's request for a tripling of the dividend (which would add over $100 million to Mr. Kerkorian's annual income). For investors, that seemed to settle it, as the stock fell $2.50 on Wednesday, close to its pre-hysteria level, before creeping up again by week's end.
 
THE ECONOMY
Slowing to a Steady Walk
Surprise! Interest rates went up -- thanks to the Federal Reserve -- and people stopped buying so much stuff. At the end of last year, Americans were still spending big, and the economy grew at a fast 5.1 percent pace -- just the type of too-frantic growth the Fed wanted to head off. But in this year's first quarter, reality set in, wallets closed -- well, part way -- and economic growth slowed to a 2.8 percent rate, the laziest in two years. Keeping things going were corporations that made big investments in equipment and buildings. All this was apparently fine with the stock market, as the Dow industrials kept bumping along to new records.
 
MUTUAL FUNDS
Follow the Money Trail
Mutual funds are where the nation's money is, so their vital signs provide good indicators of what, in an economic sense, is going on. If, that is, you can make sense of those vital signs. Last week came word that cash levels in stock funds were down to 7 percent -- the lowest in well over a decade. What's cash for? Basically, redemptions and safety. But with money flowing in and stocks rising, fund managers seem worried about neither. Fund cash is often what powers the market, though, so is this thin wallet worrisome? Not as long as new cash keeps coming -- which it certainly did recently, going into retirement accounts before the dreaded April 17.
 
THE WORKPLACE
Those Vanishing Benefits
Most employees already know this, of course: companies are getting stingier with benefits. Workers are paying a bigger share of health coverage or being nudged into H.M.O.'s, and must take greater responsibility for retirement through 401(k)'s and the like. But now it's official. A report last week showed that benefit costs for the first quarter showed the smallest rise in eight years. For the past year, in fact, benefit costs rose no faster than overall compensation -- again, for the first time in eight years. The overall report "confirms that there's no inflation push from wages," said Labor Secretary Reich. It also confirms that the days of the all-giving, kindly-uncle employer are vanishing fast.
 
ANTITRUST
One Microsoft, Indivisible
Soon, no doubt, there'll be a Government agency called the Microsoft Department, or at least a Microsoft Division at the Justice Department. The giant company seems a perennial Washington topic. Just last week Justice officials were defending Microsoft one minute against being called monopolistic and then going to court to block its acquisition of Intuit, maker of Quicken personal-finance software, saying this dominance could lead to higher prices and fewer choices for consumers. No inconsistency, the agency said -- different legal issues. And there's no truth, by the way, to rumors that Microsoft is planning to acquire the Justice Department. Just the mint.
 
BANKING
A Human Teller? Naw!
In the old days, we'll tell our grandchildren (by e-mail, of course), you actually saw people at bank windows, talked to human beings on the phone, not multiple-choice recordings. They'll smile an indulgent smile, then log on to their sixth-grade math class. It's true, though. Until late April of '95, you could walk into any bank and hand a teller a deposit. But then First Chicago said you had to pay $3 for that honor (unless you had $2,500 stagnating in a checking account) if you could have used an A.T.M. instead. A teller transaction, you see, costs 6 to 12 times what an A.T.M. transaction does, and they had to watch all those pennies. Even though, in yet older days, the world somehow muddled through with -- brace yourselves -- no A.T.M.'s at all.
 
ORANGE COUNTY
Mr. Citron Takes His Lumps
"The dog ate my homework" may work for a young scholar, but for grown-ups, "the broker ate my lunch" goes only so far. When you're managing a $7.4 billion government fund, as Robert Citron was in Orange County, you're ultimately responsible. For a while, Mr. Citron insisted he was just a blushing victim when the county lost $1.7 billion, blaming Merrill Lynch for leading him astray, but last week that excuse crumbled when he pleaded guilty to felonies like misappropriating funds and misleading investors. He could get up to 14 years in prison. In other words, derivatives don't make money vanish; people do.
 
INNER CITY
Bodegas vs. Pathmark
You can't win. In some people's view, the inner city perpetuates poverty partly because a lack of fair-priced supermarkets forces residents to shop at high-priced bodegas. But when a plan emerged for a Pathmark in East Harlem, opponents cried out that the store would hurt bodega owners. The plan seemed doomed right up to the last minute, but then a City Councilman switched sides and the Manhattan Borough Board approved it, the lure of low prices and added jobs apparently winning the day.
 
TECHNOLOGY
High-Tech Coffee Break
Sometimes we seem to be rushing headlong into a world with all the high-tech stuff jumbled together -- television shows coming out of phones, phone calls coming out of computers, information coming from just about anywhere. But occasionally the world pauses on this mad dash, as when Bell Atlantic decided last week to rethink its idea of offering video services to three million phone customers. Even though the company was well along in the F.C.C. approval process, it said its executives needed to "to catch our breath." So does this point, as some suggested, to mounting confusion in this whole pile-up of technologies? Or does Bell Atlantic just want, as it says, to hold out for better fiber-optic technology? Stay, uh, tuned.
 
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
And the Sons Did Homework
Thursday was Take Our Daughters to Work Day, a jubilant little affirmative-action idea cooked up a few years ago by the Ms. Foundation. Nationwide, perhaps six million girls played hooky to get a glimpse of the way the adult world works -- or at least the way it works with six million rosy little souls playing hopscotch in the staid hallways of commerce. But "affirmative action" is a dirty word these days -- O.K., two words -- so the glee is now tempered with dissension. Why were boys left out? They get precious little chance to watch Dad -- and Mom -- work. Not to mention that if they saw women doing all sorts of jobs, a lesson might sink in. Then again, why shouldn't girls hog the spotlight for a day? Then again . . . oh, who knows.

HEADLINE: U.N. Should Think Again on Afghanistan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 While Barnett R. Rubin's "Salvaging Afghanistan" (Op-Ed, April 22) strongly endorses the United Nations peace mission to Afghanistan, it fails to take some important political, historical and social realities into consideration. 
 Mr. Rubin's faith in the United Nations ability to restore order through establishment of a ruling coalition backed by a new security force is admirable. However, this lofty goal will not materialize unless the year-old United Nations initiative is revamped or given a new mandate by the Secretary General.
 Afghanistan's problems cannot simply be attributed to ethnic strife, which is more of an effect than a cause today.
 Afghanistan's political disintegration and power vacuum began with the Communist takeover in 1978 and was worsened by a decade of brutal Soviet military occupation that caused innumerable deaths and destroyed the social and economic fabric of the country.
 A generation of children was raised in the midst of war. Billions of dollars' worth of weaponry was supplied by several countries, including the United States, to fight the cold war on the Afghan battlefield.
 Pakistan was the main conduit for arms and aid distribution to the Afghans and favored some extremist groups over other, more moderate ones. Because of regional rivalries, Iran and Saudi Arabia followed suit. When the Afghan Communist regime fell in 1992, a bloody power struggle, instigated by the extremist factions and fueled by foreign sources, followed.
 The sudden emergence of the Taliban movement of Islamic students last October is just the latest manifestation of the same pattern of a foreign-inspired power struggle in Afghanistan. It is the dangerous perpetuation of such actions that may flare up ethnic resentments.
 Any future United Nations initiative would first have to tackle this matter by securing guarantees of noninterference in Afghan affairs. Only then would it be easier for the United Nations to work with the main Afghan powers to accept a realistic, proportional power-sharing formula, and incorporate parts of their forces into a national defense apparatus.
 Thus, Mr. Rubin's assertion that the present powers should dismantle their armies and accept a new "peacekeeping body" is illusionary.
 The United Nations mission's credibility and effectiveness would be best served if the monies that Mr. Rubin would like to have appropriated for the creation of yet another armed force were used to pay for pressing humanitarian and reconstruction needs instead.
 The United Nations does have a role to play in securing peace in Afghanistan. However, after several setbacks, lessons should be drawn. It is time to revise the peace process or start a new one.

HEADLINE: Mickey Mouse Practices Old-Time Capitalism

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re Peter Passell's April 27 Economic Scene, "Disneyland and the old U.S.S.R.: Sharing Something in Common": Mr. Passell asks, "Why doesn't Disney charge for individual rides according to their popularity, thereby reducing the waste inherent in queuing?" 
 It is unlikely that Mickey Mouse is practicing socialism, but rather that Disney is maximizing profits by "bundling." McDonald's bundles a Big Mac, Coke and french fries into a "value meal," which it sells at a discount relative to the total cost of those items purchased separately.
 It does this in hopes of enticing people to buy more than they would if they had to pay full price for every item. McDonald's increases its sales this way, even though it receives slightly less profit on each item sold. So too Disney.
 To get into the Magic Kingdom, a family of four must pay $166. If Disney charged a premium for desirable rides, it would lose many visitors. But if it compensated by lowering its lump-sum entry fee, it would lose a lot of easy money.

HEADLINE: ON CAMPUS;
Army of Adjuncts Seeks to Organize on State College Campuses

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
They call themselves "gypsy scholars," scurrying from campus to campus, often in a single day. Deprived of office space, they grade papers in parking lots and hold office hours in noisy snack bars. Although many carry full college teaching loads, they seldom earn more than $12,000 a year.
And now these instructors -- adjuncts, or part-time faculty members, at New Jersey's state colleges -- say they are fed up. 
 This spring, an effort was begun to unionize more than 4,000 adjuncts at eight state colleges. The process could prove difficult: because adjuncts have hectic schedules, organizing such a disparate group is itself a challenge. Some fear that fighting for a union will jeopardize their careers, or that college officials could delay the effort with litigation.
But many adjuncts say it is crucial to lobby for higher pay, health benefits, job security and improved working conditions. They also say their drive for recognition is long overdue.
Nationally, the ranks of adjuncts have swelled in recent years as colleges have struggled with tighter budgets. In New Jersey, part-time instructors now make up one-third of the faculty members at public four-year colleges, and more at community colleges.
"As budgets have been cut, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of adjuncts because they are the cheapest option," said Donald Silverman, president of the Council of New Jersey State College Locals, which is leading the unionization effort. The council, which voted in February to help organize adjuncts, already represents full-time faculty members at the eight campuses.
So far, reaction from college administrations has been muted. Since the state's collective bargaining law allows for the unionization of public employees, they cannot prevent the effort. But as the need to cut costs becomes more pressing, the prospect of paying adjunct professors higher salaries can only be unsettling.
"Since there are no laws against what they're doing, we really have no response," said Dr. Larry Carter, vice president for academic affairs at Jersey City State College, one of the eight campuses involved. "I have a lot of sympathy for people with terminal degrees who can't find full-time jobs, but their situation is a reflection of our economy."
At New Jersey's state colleges, most adjuncts do not receive health benefits, pensions or tenure, Dr. Silverman said. They have no job security from one semester to the next, and can be bumped from teaching schedules at the last minute if courses don't fill up. Adjuncts are paid about $450 per credit hour, Dr. Silverman said, and most classes carry three credit hours. If they teach the maximum two courses at one campus, they could earn $2,700. Some earn three times that amount in a semester, but that involves a staggering load of 18 credits.
For full-time instructors at state colleges, the beginning salary is $27,755, Dr. Silverman said. Tenured professors can make as much as $74,775.
"The salary is just laughable," said Cherie Kipple, an adjunct professor who teaches composition at Jersey City State. "A lot of us have master's degrees and doctorates, but we have to run our legs off to survive."
Since February, the council has been compiling lists of adjuncts at the eight colleges. They include Jersey City State, Kean College in Union, Montclair State University, William Paterson College in Wayne. Ramapo College in Mahwah, Rowan College in Glassboro, Richard Stockton College in Pomona and Trenton State College.
"I have never encountered a campaign with more positive support," said Mel Driban, a representative of the American Federation of Teachers who is supervising the effort. "It's very unusual to have not only the adjuncts, but the full-time faculty recognizing that it's time to end this abuse."
Although many adjuncts have credentials equal to or better than those of full-time faculty members, there can be drawbacks. Ralph Edelbach, an associate professor of technology who is supervising the union effort at Trenton State College, says full-time faculty members have more time to spend with students.
"There are situations where adjuncts can bring unique skills into the classroom," he said. "But there's no doubt that for basic classes, full-timers are the best option."
Mr. Driban said that if there are no obstacles, the state Public Employee Relations Commission could hold an election for a bargaining agent as early as December. But in the past, administrations at other New Jersey colleges have fought the unionization of adjuncts. At Raritan Valley Community College in Branchburg, litigation delayed a unionization effort for six years. And at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, part-time faculty members spent three years establishing a chapter of the American Association of University Professors. It took them another three years to negotiate a contract.
The potential challenges do not faze people like Ruben Diaz, an adjunct professor of mathematics who teaches at Jersey City State and two other colleges. He works six days a week, often from 7 A.M. to 10 P.M., then spends another two hours grading papers. Constantly on the road, he rarely sees his wife and two children.
"My life is never easy, and I am tired of running," he said. "If this will bring some change, I will help work for it."
But even at Rutgers, where the average part-time salary was raised to $650 per credit hour after unionization, there have been few other improvements, said Karen Thompson, vice president of the part-time faculty union.
"There has been a certain lessening of abuse, but it's still overwhelmingly true that part-timers are the invisible faculty," she said. "To stick with this life, you must be driven by an incredible love of teaching."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 7, 1995, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article last week about attempts to unionize part-time college instructors misstated the pay scale at Rutgers University; $650 per credit is the minimum salary, not the average salary. The article also misidentified the president of the New Jersey Council of State College Locals. He is Donald Silberman, not Silverman.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: LONG ISLAND CITY;
Will It Be Kmart Sono Buoni?

BYLINE: By THOMAS H. MATTHEWS 

 BODY:
The Kmart Corporation has been granted a permit to renovate the old Ronzoni factory, bringing the retail giant one step closer to building a megastore on a strip of Northern Boulevard that is fast attracting large retail outlets.
Kmart officials would not discuss details of the plan to take over the pasta plant (remembered for the slogan Ronzoni Sono Buoni; basically "Ronzoni is good"), but a spokeswoman said Kmart will build on the site if it receives approval. 
 Jesse Masyr, a lawyer for Kmart, said the corporation, which is based in Troy, Mich., had received a permit from the City Department of Planning to build retail space of more than 10,000 square feet on property designated for manufacturing use.
If the store is approved by the Borough President's office and Community Boards 1 and 2, Kmart will become the neighbor of large retail outlets including Tops Appliance City, which opened last August, and the Sports Authority, which recently broke ground for a 45,000-square-foot store. The planned Kmart would be about 123,000 square feet.
"This area of Queens is the geographic center of New York," Mr. McCaffrey said. "There is access to over a million people here."
Though Mr. McCaffrey touted the income and employment that large retailers bring, the influx of large stores on Northern Boulevard has raised concerns. Julian Wagner, a member of several business organizations, said that the lack of express subway service and growing traffic volume could overwhelm local roads. "What we're going to see is gridlock all day and all night in that area,' he said. But he added that he does not oppose the megastores.
"We could not, should not and will not stand in the way of economic development," Mr. Wagner said. "To lay down in front of progress would be nonsensical."

 CORRECTION:
An article in the Neighborhood Report last Sunday about Kmart's plans to renovate the old Ronzoni factory on Northern Boulevard incorrectly described a permit the company has received. Kmart has received certification to begin the city's uniform land-use review process; it has not been given a permit to build.

HEADLINE: Noblesse Oblige . . . With Strings

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT and SHELBY WHITE 

 BODY:
MAYBE it is better to give than to receive. But leave it to the very rich to figure out how to do both.
In perhaps no other country are the rich so rewarded for charitable giving as they are in America. Not only does Uncle Sam give them substantial tax breaks for their largess, but many of the 575,000 not-for-profit institutions in this country cultivate them, lionize them and reward them with seats on boards, names on walls and accolades at candlelight fund-raising dinners. 
 Their efforts were not in vain: charitable gifts of more than $1 million totaled nearly $975 million in 1993 up from $931 million in 1992, according to Giving U.S.A., a philanthropy-research organization. Gifts from all donors rose to $126 billion from $122 billion, the group reported.
It isn't that the wealthy are more generous than less well-heeled Americans -- quite the contrary. A philanthropy researcher, Claude Rosenberg, estimates in his book "Wealthy and Wise" that people with income-producing assets of more than $1.3 million give away half of 1 percent of that wealth annually, on average, while those with income-producing assets of between $40,000 and $1.3 million part with between 0.8 percent and 1.5 percent.
It's just that the rich are, well, rich, and can still give big sums. "People put them on boards because they think eventually it will pay off with a big donation," said one leading fund raiser, who requested anonymity.
Good luck. Interviews with some of the mega-billionaires who top the Forbes magazine list of America's richest people, and an analysis of the activities of their charitable foundations, indicate that they generally take the same approach to doling out their money as they did in amassing it: they drive tough bargains.
That should come as no surprise, especially in the wake of the scandal involving misappropriated funds at United Way, America's biggest charity.
"Entrepreneurs as donors often drive bargains. That is how they lead their lives, and they want to make sure that charities do not misuse their funds," said Willian D. Zabel, author of "The Rich Die Richer and You can Too." Mr. Zabel is a trust and estates lawyer at Shulte Roth & Zabel.
Laurence A. Tisch, chairman of CBS and Loews Corporation who frequently plays an active role on charitable boards said: "We want to make sure that what we do has the positive impact that we are desiging the gift for. We want to be sure that we have confidence in the people running the institution."
While the public generally sees the splashy big-dollar headlines, it rarely catches a glimpse of the months of complex and intensive negotiations over such issues as deferred payments, the value of noncash gifts and conditions like matching gifts.
Just ask the Guggenheim Museum. It received a $10 million pledge from Ronald O. Perelman, chairman of Revlon, in early 1994. Mr. Perelman was subsequently named chairman of the Guggenheim, but so far, the museum has received no cash from him toward that gift. Instead, he has given the museum a brownstone on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, which it has yet to sell. And, the sale is complicated because the land beneath the building is owned by someone else. The museum knew the terms from the outset but a museum spokeswoman declined to comment on them.
Earlier, the Guggenheim got another $10 million pledge, the largest ever at the time, from the builder Samuel J. LeFrak, who agreed to make the gift in 1993 "with no strings attached."
But when the New York City Landmarks Commission declined to approve the LeFrak name on the exterior rotunda at Fifth Avenue and 89th Street, Mr. LeFrak apparently had second thoughts. He and the Guggenheim began looking for other "naming opportunities," as Mr. LeFrak's spokesman put it a year later.
To mollify Mr. LeFrak, the Guggenheim managed to get his name on the fifth floor gallery. "Wealthy people are paying more attention to making certain that their contributions work the way they want them to," said Russ Prince of Prince & Associates, a fund-raising consultant.
And with good reason. The late investment banker Andre Meyer donated $2.5 million to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. After his death the 19th century painting galleries were named after him. His heirs are disappointed that today only one gallery bears his name. A museum spokesman said Mr. Meyer had given the money to construct the galleries, not to name them.
Donors have always wanted their names emblazoned on the walls of prominent institutions. Those who do give often want the world to know. Fund raisers estimate that less than 5 percent of giving is anonymous.
Then there are the gifts, announced by the recipient and the charities with great fanfare, whose actual amounts can vary. In 1992, the Central Park Conservancy in New York announced a $17 million gift over five years from Richard Gilder, a partner at Gilder Gagnon Howe & Company, an investment firm.
The contribution, however, was a matching gift, with no minimum payment required. Thus, Mr. Gilder will pay the entire $17 million only if the conservancy and the city come up with a total of $34 million. The city has pledged its share, and the conservancy is trying to raise its part. Mr. Gilder has so far contributed $3.5 million.
Some of the delay reflects the well-intended desire to influence how the recipients use the money. Laurence Tisch and his brother, Preston, are paying out a $30 million pledge to New York University Medical Center over 15 years. The delayed payments not only make the gift more affordable because of inflation but also assure that the brothers will have a continuing say in the institution's affairs.
Nonetheless, a lot of the rich are procrastinators when it comes to philanthropy. They fully intend to spread their wealth around -- someday. Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman and the richest man in America with an $11.2 billion fortune, is aiming to do some serious giving when he is 50 or 60 years old. He is now 39. The investor Warren E. Buffett, No. 2 on the Forbes list of the super rich is holding onto the vast bulk of his fortune until he dies.
And others just hate to say it all in cash. "There are other ways to give," said Sumner M. Redstone, chairman of Viacom Inc., whose stake in the company is valued at $4 billion. "Not to denigrate money, but I feel best about the teaching I have done" at Harvard Law School.
According to Paul G. Schervish, associate professor of sociology at Boston College, some entrepreneurs "see their making of money and the expansion of their business as a contribution to society."
Still other rich people give their money away, then take it back. Last month, Lee Bass, the billionaire from Fort Worth, got a $20 million gift back, plus interest, from Yale University after the school had failed to create a Western civilization curriculum to his liking -- and refused to give him veto power over the professors who would be carrying out his mission.
And in rare cases, the recipients have had to go to court to collect. According to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, Joel Jablonski, a real estate executive, thrilled Yeshiva University in New York in 1990 when he promised the school 55 percent of his estate -- valued at $6 million at the time. After the Washington Heights campus was renamed after him, he gave away assets to relatives, arguing that the size of his estate was not his problem. The university sued him for breach of contract in 1993, and the case was settled privately.
Likewise, the financier Saul P. Steinberg irked Lawrence Woodmere Academy in Woodmere, L.I., his children's prep school, in the mid-1970's, when he failed to pay more than half a $375,000 pledge. His reason: Israel was in such "severe and dire straits," he wrote, that he felt compelled to reorder priorities. A court found his "formal, printed pledge" binding and ordered him to pay up, and he appears to have learned a lesson. He has since donated $36 million to his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, where two buildings bear his name. And he is a highly regarded board member of several prestigious nonprofits including the New York Public Library.
So just how are some of the richest people in the United States, as identified by Forbes magazine, giving away their money these days?
 
 
Bill Gates
The Tribulations Of a Future Donor
 Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, has already had an overwhelming impact on the software industry. Now he wants to exert the same influence on the charity scene.
There is only one problem. Most of Mr. Gates's $11.2 billion fortune is in Microsoft stock and putting that into a foundation would tie his hands. "There are incredible limitations," he said in a telephone interview. "A foundation can't vote stock."
His biggest gift to date was a $12 million grant to the University of Washington in his home state to finance a new molecular biotechnology department. He has given another $10 million to other causes.
"I have made a decision that most of my money will go to charitable causes," he said. "It will be later in life, after I'm 50 or 60."
To charities instead of his heirs? "My relatives will not be running this company," Mr. Gates said firmly. "This is not a family company. Microsoft is not a dynasty."
Not yet, anyway. Mr. Gates married Melinda French on New Year's Day 1994. There may someday be children yanking at his financial heartstrings. One longtime fund-raiser says it is likely that Mr. Gates will change his tune.
 
Warren E. Buffett
Billions of Dollars, Billions Of People
 Warren E. Buffett, founder of Berkshire Hathaway, a company with a storied investment record, gets a lot of credit for Berkshire Hathaway's policy of letting shareholders direct a specified number of corporate dollars for each share they own to their favorite charities. His favorite charity, however, is his own foundation.
The Buffett Foundation, which reported assets totaling $21.4 million in its latest fiscal-year tax returns, has given away $14.1 million in the last five years, mostly to population-control groups but also to high schools in his native Omaha. Virtually all of that money originated with the company.
And the philanthropic world will have to sit tight before it gets its hands on the really big money. Mr. Buffett has publicly voiced his concerns about population growth and plans to put the bulk of his $10.3 billion on the line, presumably to slow the increase in the number of the world's inhabitants.
But Mr. Buffett approaches charity as he does investing: long term. He's willing to wait. And so the world will have to wait, too, until he and his wife are gone. Mr. Buffett declined to be interviewed, but associates say he plans to hold onto most of his 40.3 percent stake in Berkshire Hathaway as long as he and his wife are alive.
 
John Kluge
Shunning 'Designer Giving'
 John Kluge, the 80-year-old media mogul with a $5.9 billion fortune, is not as rich as Mr. Buffett, but he has pledged $110 million to recruit professors and give financial assistance to students at Columbia University. And his goal is to create a $1 billion charitable foundation in his will. He has made some big gifts to blue-chip institutions like Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and the Library of Congress.
Mr. Kluge, who acknowledges being sympathetic to communist causes as a young man, also donated money after the collapse of the Soviet Union to fund an exhibition of Russian archives at the Library of Congress. "I found out Lenin wasn't a nice guy," he said in an interview at his New York office.
But over all, he explains, he eschews "designer giving" to socially acceptable charities. Nor does he want his name on a building. "In 100 years, the building is dusty," he said. "Nobody cleans the nameplate."
One example of that contrarianism is the money he has showered on minorities. Born in Germany, Mr. Kluge and his widowed mother emigrated to the United States in 1922 when he was 8. He later won a scholarship to Columbia and says he wants to give minority youths the same chance. That determination has led to a $700,000 donation to the Institute for Education in Transformation at Claremont University in California, to study how children of different cultures interact in the classroom.
 
Sumner M. Redstone
Teaching and MTV As Philanthropy
 Sumner M. Redstone is ill at ease as an billionaire. He avoids limousines and fancy houses and buys off-the-rack suits. Similarly, the contributions that excite him the most are low-budget: He volunteers his time as a teacher of law at Harvard and Boston University.
"When I teach, I feel good. For me teaching is a kind of philanthropy," he said. "These students could have the best professors, but someone like myself brings a unique experience."
Mr. Redstone, 71, whose controlling stake in Viacom Inc. is worth $4 billion, also believes that using his influence as an arbiter of popular culture can do at least as much good as signing checks. Viacom's MTV television music channel, he says, has been involved in fighting racism and intolerance, been active in fighting AIDS and gotten "lots of young kids to vote."
"To use what you do instead of money is phony," he says. "But there are a lot of ways to give money away."
And Mr. Redstone's way? His two personal foundations have given $1.7 million in the last five years. Though the company would not provide documentation, a Viacom spokesman said Mr. Redstone should also be given credit for about $33 million in gifts that the entrepreneur has made personally and through companies he controls the last five years.
Among the recipients: the Dana Farber Cancer Center, the United Jewish Appeal and a chair at Harvard Medical School. Another gift went to the Massachusetts General Hospital burn center. Mr. Redstone nearly died in a hotel fire in Boston in 1979, and had to undergo more than 60 hours of surgery. A lawyer who is not shy to litigate, he sued the hotel for $12 million, settled and gave the proceeds to Massachusetts General. The burn center was subsequently renamed after him.
 
Ronald O. Perelman
What's in A Name? Sometimes Dollars
 Ronald O. Perelman, the 51-year-old Revlon chairman, reaped his wealth by building a patchwork of businesses ranging from television stations to lip gloss. His charity is equally diversified. "My giving is entrepreneurial and not systematized," Mr. Perelman said in an interview.
Since 1988, he says he has pledged $125 million of his $4.5 billion fortune and has donated $77 million so far.
His gifts have one thing in common, though: he likes to attach his, or his company's, name to them. For example, he has pledged $12 million to the Revlon Breast Cancer Center in Los Angeles, and agreed to give $10 million to build a student center bearing his name on the University of Pennsylvania campus.
In yet another transaction, Mr. Perelman offered New York University's medical school $10 million to construct a building. The cost of the building escalated, and when Mr. Perelman didn't up the ante, another donor's name went on the building instead. Mr. Perelman got the consolation prize: his money went for research in biomolecular medicine, and the university named its department of dermatology after him.
Sometimes, his contributions to charities are rather convoluted. Of his announced $10 million gift to the Guggenheim, the only asset that has actually changed hands is a brownstone. The building, in the East 50's of Manhattan, has yet to be sold, and the land under it is leased. The museum and the holder of the lease have jointly put the building up for sale for $11 million.
If and when the sale goes through, the Guggenheim would get a unspecified portion of the proceeds. Mr. Perelman and the Guggenheim signed a confidentiality agreement not to reveal the specifics of the deal.
"Most boards prefer cash or stock," said one New Yorker who serves on four boards. "Generally they don't want the burden and uncertainty of selling a nonliquid asset."
 
S. I. Newhouse Jr.
The Money Follows The Company
 While Mr. Perelman appreciates the clout that comes with blockbuster gifts, S. I. Newhouse Jr. and his brother, Donald, who own a $9 billion media empire, prefer to do their giving in smaller spurts.
Tax returns for the Samuel I. Newhouse Foundation, their primary vehicle for philanthropy, show that it has given $32 million or so the last five years. That is virtually all the family's charitable giving, Donald Newhouse said. "We are giving on a very significant scale," he added.
The causes they adopt also tend to hug their business interests. Of the $7.3 million the Newhouses gave away last year, for example, an estimated $2 million was targeted to cities where they own either cable systems or newspapers.
 
Richard DeVos
Sports and Religion Taken Seriously
 Richard DeVos woke up one morning about 15 years ago and realized he was rich. " 'O.K. You have a lot of money,' " he recalled telling himself. "You say, 'O.K., you could do something big.' "
"A lot of money" is an understatement. Today, Mr. DeVos, 69, is worth $4.5 billion as co-owner of Amway, the direct marketery. His motivation for doing something big is simple. "I was brought up in a typical Midwestern Christian home," Mr. DeVos said from his home in Florida. He said he and his wife, Helen, give heavily to Christian causes, hospitals and community organizations. "We don't just throw it up against the wall and hope it sticks," he said.
One place it stuck was in America's national pasttime. Years ago, Mr. DeVos -- a sports fan and owner of the Orlando Magic basketball team -- started baseball chapels for players with Bobby Richardson, the former New York Yankees second baseman. "We gave it the seed money," he said. "Now others contribute."

EDMUND WILSON
A Biography.
By Jeffrey Meyers.
Illustrated. 554 pp. Boston:
A Peter Davison Book/Houghton Mifflin Company. $35. 
ONE of the surest ways to estimate a writer's reputation is to count the biographies. By this measure, Edmund Wilson (1895-1972) is doing well, with a respectable two. While Lewis Dabney's authorized biography drags on into its second decade -- rumors of its imminence have been around for years -- the indefatigable Jeffrey Meyers has managed to slip in under the wire, coming out on the centenary of Wilson's birth with what his publisher describes as "the first full-scale biography of a literary titan." According to the breathless press release, "the University of California-trained literary critic and biographer, author of 400 articles and 37 books, Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and university lecturer, worked inexhaustibly, seven days a week, for only a year to produce this . . . volume." Phew!
Mr. Meyers's output is prodigious. Fat biographies bearing his name appear with alarming frequency. But his prodigality has not always served him well. His biographies tend to be uneven, to say the least -- haphazard, hasty, on occasion ill-tempered, as if the author himself were weary of his frenetic pace. His most recent book -- or was it the one before the last? -- a biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald, devoted an unseemly amount of space to Fitzgerald's penis size. For Mr. Meyers, biography is a marathon, a sweat-inducing labor; he's adding to the gross national product.
So it was with little hope, with trepidation even, that I approached this hefty opus. Not only was the biographer a dubious quantity, his subject was problematic. Edmund Wilson was one of this country's greatest men of letters, and he deserves a major biography. But the trouble with actually writing one (or reading one, for that matter) is the familiarity of the material. Wilson's shelf of books -- nearly as long as his biographer's -- is heavily autobiographical. Between the thick volumes of journals, some of them verging on a thousand pages, the memoir "Upstate" and the several volumes of letters, what is there left for a biographer to reveal that Wilson did not reveal himself? He wrote his own biography.
Yet somehow Mr. Meyers has produced a highly engaging book. Lively, well proportioned, insightful about the life and work, his brisk narrative puts it all together: the lonely middle-class childhood in Red Bank, N.J.; Princeton University, where Wilson met Fitzgerald; the hard-drinking Greenwich Village and Vanity Fair era in the 1920's; the four wives, including the famously difficult Mary McCarthy; the celebrated quarrels with Vladimir Nabokov and the drones of the Modern Language Association; the years at The New Yorker, where Wilson created a base of operations for his critical and literary forays. Mr. Meyers has wisely grouped his material by theme and period, for example, "Nervous Breakdown, 1927-1929," "Marxism and Russia, 1932-1935," "Mistresses, 1936-1937."
The result is a biography that -- how rare in this day of "definitive" doorstoppers -- is fun to read. It was Wilson's great distinction to have devised a style that made literature accessible to the general reader; he resented that academics -- "the professorial sodality," his biographer calls them -- had taken over the field.
Mr. Meyers has managed to do for Wilson the one thing Wilson couldn't do for himself: bring some insight to his life. For all his unremitting and clinical self-scrutiny, Wilson was notably disinclined to introspection. Working mostly from published sources, Mr. Meyers has assembled an evocative portrait of Wilson as the only child of two unloving parents. His father was remote and depression-prone and his mother resented -- to borrow Mary McCarthy's blunt image -- "that his large head had torn her vaginal tissues as he was being born." It was from his own unhappy childhood, Mr. Meyers theorizes, that Wilson formulated the central trope of "The Wound and the Bow," "that genius and disease, like strength and mutilation, may be inextricably bound up together."
Our image of Wilson as a grand old man -- even as a young man, he looked old -- obscures the pain and struggle that dogged his life. Literary recognition came to him fairly late, after years of itinerant freelancing -- "Axel's Castle," which established his reputation as a critic, was published when he was 36. The failure of his first novel, "I Thought of Daisy," had precipitated a full-scale nervous breakdown two years earlier. He earned pathetic amounts of money: his advance for "To the Finland Station" was $1,700 -- less than $300 for each year he worked on it. A regular writing job at The New Yorker, where he signed on when he was 48, provided a measure of stability, but his finances were precarious to the end. He spent a good part of his 60's sitting in the offices of the Internal Revenue Service in Utica, N.Y., negotiating settlement of the tax bill he had neglected to pay out of some combination of principle, neglect and megalomania. (Wilson recounted the story of his long skirmish with the I.R.S. in "The Cold War and the Income Tax.")
His private life was just as embattled as his public life. After his divorce from the actress Mary Blair in 1930, he married the hard-drinking Margaret Canby, a wealthy California socialite who died of a skull fracture two years into their marriage by falling down a flight of stairs. Then there was Mary McCarthy, who fought with him -- sometimes physically -- for the duration of their notoriously stormy partnership. Mr. Meyers usefully collates the considerable data on their seven-year marriage scattered throughout McCarthy's copious memoirs and Wilson's equally copious journals, supplying few fresh details. But in his sympathetic telling the two high-strung and willful writers both come off better than they did in their self-serving accounts.
WILSON'S last marriage, in 1946, to the stylishly cosmopolitan Elena Thornton, was the only happy one he had -- which didn't prevent him from having a fling with the New Yorker film critic Penelope Gilliatt at the Princeton Club in his 75th year. (He also worked in a hot affair with his dentist's wife.) When it came to sex, Wilson was a truly prodigious engine. Women applauded his "bull-like physical stamina," and the chronicle of sexual encounters enumerated by Mr. Meyers is richly salacious. "The most idiosyncratic aspect of Wilson's sexual taste was his obsessive foot-fetishism," according to his biographer, who also recounts episodes of sadism, masochism and other dank activities (I never knew that Wilson briefly owned a whip). An avid student of his own sex life, Wilson was "amoral and clinically distant," in Mr. Meyers's words; he tended to concentrate on what Cyril Connolly, reviewing Wilson's semi-pornographic novel, "Memoirs of Hecate County," devastatingly complained of as the "insect monotony" of sex. Wilson's lifelong quest for sexual adventure had a poignant source: at the root of his trouble with women was his fear "of not being loved, which I have carried all my life from childhood," he confided to Mary McCarthy.
Wilson was hard to like -- one of his wives described him as "a cold fishy leprous person." Even Mr. Meyers, his admiring biographer, concludes that he "lacked warmth." He was cruel to his wives, largely indifferent to his children, at times breathtakingly obtuse. (Not a model family man, he read "The Story of O" at the dinner table.) He was not an attractive drunk -- in one scene, Mr. Meyers quotes a neighbor who remembers Wilson crashing through the door of his apartment. And he could be intransigent, even abusive in literary debate, as in his remorseless attack on Nabokov's translation of "Eugene Onegin," which eventually destroyed their friendship; Mr. Meyers, putting this trait in its kindest light, quotes Anais Nin's description of his "harsh absolutism and literalness."
What makes this a vigorous biography is Mr. Meyers's authorial voice: he has a point of view. He is not one of those "democrats of the archive," in Leon Edel's phrase, who lay out the material without troubling to interpret it. For one thing, he is partisan; he likes Wilson's writing. Mr. Meyers is good on Wilson's strengths as a critic -- his psychological acuity, his ability to summarize complex literary trends in lucid and straightforward prose, his energy and curiosity. But Mr. Meyers is not afraid to point out his subject's weaknesses -- the historical myopia that enabled Wilson to apotheosize the architects of the Russian Revolution in "To the Finland Station" just as Stalin was consolidating power; his tin ear for poetry; the woodenness of his fiction; the disorganization and laziness of his compilations. Mr. Meyers also notes Wilson's tendency to overpraise mediocrities like Phelps Putnam, Elinor Wylie and Wilson's lover Edna St. Vincent Millay. He seduced Anais Nin by writing feeble encomiums to her books. But Wilson's enthusiasm for his friends' work was a generous fault, Mr. Meyers observes with characteristic forbearance.
ON occasion, Mr. Meyers manifests a sly wit, as when he speaks of the catholicity of Wilson's interests, which ranged from "the natives of the Algonquin Hotel to the tribes of the Iroquois." Like his subject, he has strong opinions about people: Nabokov was "as touchy as a Samurai," Robert Lowell was a "brilliant maniac," Brendan Gill of The New Yorker had "a nasty streak." At times, the voice is too pronounced. Mr. Meyers has a weakness for jocund asides -- a pointless footnote about Woody Allen's satire on the Dead Sea Scrolls; a dumb joke about carrots and lettuce (Wilson's nickname was Bunny). Describing Wilson's feud with Nabokov, he offers up an unpardonable pun about "when Pushkin came to shovekin." But even these off-the-wall outbursts personalize the book; you feel there is a sensibility there, however quirky and obnoxious.
Wilson's last years make for a somber story. As early as the mid-1950's, according to Mr. Meyers, he identified himself with "a half-obsolete group of survivors from the Victorian age." His later work is curmudgeonly to the point of self-parody; the journals of his 60's and 70's recount a desolate cycle of drink and depression, exacerbated by diminishing sexual powers. Mr. Meyers conjures up a sad image of Wilson in old age -- "the dark defile," as he memorably called it -- sitting on the toilet and reading old reviews of his books to boost his morale. Yet Mr. Meyers, chin up, maintains an elegiac tone. "The qualities exemplified in Edmund Wilson must be valued and restored if our literary culture is to survive," he writes.
It won't happen. No culture is ever restored, only transformed. In Mr. Meyers's summing up, Wilson was "the best, and one of the last, of the learned democratic critics who expressed a genuine love of literature." One of the last: the values that Edmund Wilson exemplified belong to history.

HEADLINE: Fund Offering More Than Fresh Air

BYLINE: By SARAH JAY

 BODY:
Before last summer, she had never traveled far from her housing project in the Bronx. In fact, she had never spent a night away from her mother.
But when 8-year-old Alanah Wade returned from two weeks in Pennsylvania's Amish country with a Fresh Air family, she was bubbling with smiles and stories: She had had corn on the cob and ice cream sundaes, picnics by day and fresh berries at night, Sunday rides in a horse-drawn buggy. 
 "If you sit in the front, the horse's hair gets in your face," Alanah said. "And he got white sweat on his back."
She was awed by the Pennsylvania countryside, where the trees and the grass and the woods never end. "It's like being in a wide open park, wherever you go," Alanah told her mother.
This year, Alanah can hardly wait to return. "They're going to teach me how to swim and ride a bike," she said.
And so it goes every year, as thousands of the city's poorest children anticipate the return of summer, and the chance to reunite with their adopted families in the Fresh Air Fund, which has been arranging free vacations for needy youngsters since 1877.
That first year, the Rev. Willard Parsons, a Presbyterian minister, urged his parishioners in Sherman, Pa., to open their homes to 60 children living in New York City tenement houses. Since then, 1.6 million children have become Fresh Air alumni, many of them forming lifelong bonds with their host families.
The organization, now in its 119th season, begins its annual fund-raising campaign today.
Jenny Morgenthau, executive director of the fund since 1983, has watched countless city children blossom under the sunny attention of their host families.
"They see that they have options and choices," Ms. Morgenthau said. "It makes kids feel good that the families didn't get paid to do this, that they did this out of affection for them."
For many, the vacation is also a sort of summer school, a chance to learn about nature. "Sometimes they don't know that milk comes from a cow, not from a supermarket," Ms. Morgenthau said.
Alanah, for example, discovered that vegetables grow in the ground and not cans. Her brother Julian, 9, spent lots of time in a treehouse. His family, also Amish, had no television. "But I didn't even care," he said. "I listened to the radio."
Eyon Flament, 8, joined a Fresh Air family in Akron, Pa., and learned to swim. He chased fireflies. He caught snails and used them as bait while fishing. He and his family got along well, and like most Fresh Air children, he has been invited back. "They're nice to me," he said. "Plus, they have a computer."
The Fresh Air Fund also sends 2,900 children, ages 8 to 15, to camp. The 3,000-acre campsite in Fishkill, N.Y., is equipped with a model farm, a planetarium and a wildlife refuge. Last year, a career awareness camp was added.
Ms. Morgenthau has two main concerns this summer. "One is to get more host families," she said, noting that the number has been slipping for two decades and has only recently begun to rise again. "The other thing is money. Like everyone else, I'm concerned about the economy."
At a time when welfare programs are coming under fire in Congress, she said, the fund can have a vital effect on the lives of the children, most of whom are on public assistance.
It costs the fund an average of $315 to arrange a visit with a volunteer host family and $912 to send a child to camp. About 80 percent of contributions come from private donors. Last year, the fund raised $4,117,604 from nearly 50,000 individuals.
The Fresh Air Fund is an independent, nonprofit agency with 42 staff members. It depends on 7,000 volunteers to help recruit and interview host families in 13 states, from Maine to Virginia, and Canada. Children come from low-income families affiliated with about 60 social service organizations in New York.
Last summer, 6,686 children stayed with host families, and Ms. Morgenthau said she would like the number to top 7,000 this year. She also wants to expand the base of New York City residents who take children to their summer homes and on vacations in the country. Only 51 New York families participated last year.
Families that want to be hosts may call (800) 367-0003. To offer other help, volunteers may call (212) 221-0900. Tax-deductible contributions may be sent to the Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Save the Dollar: Encourage Saving

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
For connoisseurs of pointless bickering, the run-up to last week's meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers was a joy. Those who think the plunge of the dollar is an American problem demanded that the United States tighten something, either fiscal or monetary policy. To which Robert Rubin, the Treasury Secretary, said, in effect, "So's you mama." By international standards the American budget deficit was not all that big, he said, and higher interest rates could hurt the economy.
 In the end, the Group of Seven countries, pretending that they are all allies embarked on a common course, put out a statement saying that the dollar was undervalued but not indicating much of anything that should be done about it. Currency traders jeered, but in fact the battered buck did rally a bit. 
 The foreign criticism was focused on the wrong deficit. The budget deficit would not matter much if the question was one whether the American Government paid its bills by taxing or borrowing from its own citizens. But with the massive trade deficits also being run, this has become a country that gets by through issuing i.o.u.'s Japan exports cars and electronic equipment. We export wheat and dollars.
 The rest of the world could put a stop to that if it wanted to, simply by refusing to accept dollars. That is, as yet, unthinkable, but the hesitance of lots of foreigners to hold dollar-denominated assets is a major reason for the dollar tumbling to its current state of absurd undervaluation.
 The trade picture is likely to soon brighten on a cyclical basis, as the low dollar bolsters exports even more and as a slowdown in growth cuts imports. The national savings rate is rising slowly, but not nearly as fast as is needed or as fast as one might expect given that the older Baby Boomers are about to turn 50 and are in the stage of life where they should be accumulating assets to fund retirement.
 This country needs to find a way to lift savings substantially before the boomers retire. The likeliest answer to that is in tax policy. And perhaps the most encouraging aspect of the current political climate is that taxes are suddenly a fashionable topic of real debate, rather than just a way for irresponsible posturing of the "balance-the-budget-while-slashing-taxes" variety.
 If we were starting from scratch, a pure consumption tax might be the answer. Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, in his bid for the Republican Presidential nomination, has proposed such a thing through a European-style value added tax. The big problem with that - aside from political realities - would be the transition. When Britain raised its value added tax and cut its income tax some years ago, the result was a predictable boom and bust, as everyone rushed to buy before the sales tax took effect and then stopped buying when it did.
 The lates proposal may also be the best. Senators Sam Nunn of Georgia and Pete Domenici of New Mexico last week put forth something called the "Unlimited Savings Allowance" tax system, which called for most Americans to pay 40 percent of their income in taxes, but only after deducting net savings from income. They claim it would bring in as much money as the current tax system.
 To fundamentally change the tax system will require bipartisanship and willingness to avoid demagogic opposition. In other words, getting anything accomplished is a long shot. But it is worth the effort.

HEADLINE: Reverse Commuting Is Making Some Gains

BYLINE: By PHILLIP LUTZ 

 BODY:
WHILE the number of commuters from Long Island to New York City has essentially stopped growing, the daily flow of workers to the Island continues to increase.
Economists and planners say the growth of so-called reverse commuting reflects more than the usual cycles of economic activity. The trend indicates a growing interdependence between the city, where many people seek entry-level jobs, and the suburbs, where such jobs often go begging. 
 Aiding the growth, the experts say, are changes in transportation, including new peak-hour trains and connecting buses, upgraded stations and intensified marketing by transit agencies that now regard reverse commuters as a distinct group.
"They're becoming a more significant commuter flow, a more significant part of our economy," the chief economist for the Long Island Regional Planning Board, Pearl Kamer, said, "and something that we want to facilitate."
From 1980 to 1990 the total of morning work trips by New York City residents to Nassau and Suffolk Counties increased 43 percent, to 87,000, and the trips by Long Islanders to Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan remained at 269,000, according to an analysis of census data by the regional planning board.
Continuing that growth, reverse ridership on the Long Island Rail Road from 1991 to 1994 increased 14 percent, to 7,600, compared with a 1 percent increase for the usual ridership, said a spokesman for the L.I.R.R., Sam Zambuto.
The importance of the reverse commuters goes beyond their numbers, Ms. Kamer said. "It's the industry of employment and the occupations of the reverse commuters," that are important, "because they provide occupational skills we don't have in our resident labor force."
The economic profiles of the two commuter groups contrast sharply. According to the board's study, 41 percent of citybound commuters are executives, managers or professionals, compared with 29 percent of reverse commuters. Conversely, 13 percent of the citybound are clerical workers, compared with 20 percent of the Island-bound, and 4 percent of the citybound hold service jobs other than that of guard, compared with 11 percent of the Island-bound.
The median household income of citybound commuters in 1991, the latest year for which the railroad has statistics, was $66,000, 50 percent higher than that of reverse commuters, Mr. Zambuto said.
Most reverse commuters drive, and their number has been increasing since jobs began to spread into the suburbs. But proportionately more growth has recently occurred among the rail riders.
Nearly half of all reverse rail riders begin their trips at Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan, with most of the others' boarding in Brooklyn, Queens and western Nassau. Ms. Kamer said she thought that many of those passengers were recent immigrants who were "willing to take jobs that many Americans won't take, and have been doing so in large numbers."
A senior fellow at the Regional Plan Association, Jeffrey M. Zupan, said the new riders might be "people who typically have not come from a culture where everyone was seeking a car at the age of 16."
Businesses on Long Island actively recruit immigrants and minority members in the city, Mr. Zupan said. "The lower-skill-level jobs that are in the suburbs, are not easily filled by residents of the suburbs," he said.
The hotel business is one sector looking to fill such jobs. The improved economy has led to an increased demand for hotel rooms and for people to clean them. City residents, many of whom have recently arrived from Haiti and Jamaica, are taking the jobs, said the general manager of the 302-room Huntington Hilton, Michael Hollander.
About one-quarter of the the 300 hourly employees, including most housekeeping and food-service workers, live in New York City, Mr. Hollander said, adding that newspaper advertisements for readers in in Queens and Brooklyn and on Long Island usually generated responses just from the city, where word spreads in immigrant and minority communities about the jobs.
"It's hard for me to find people," he said. "With all the stories you hear about unemployment I have jobs available."
Workers travel to the hotel on Broadhollow Road near Route 110 in Melville in several ways, he said. Many take trains, buses or combinations. Those who have cars often drive several co-workers and share the expenses. At times, Mr. Hollander added, other hotels have sent buses to central locations to pick up workers.
At the Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point a diverse group of reverse commuters accounts for many of the 206 workers, according to a spokesman, Capt. John Jochmans. Because its site on the North Shore is poorly served by public transportation, Captain Jochmans said, many workers drive. But, he added, some low-paid workers cannot afford cars, and they have come up with unusual ways to travel from their homes in the city to the academy. A group of six cleaners from the Bronx rents a van, Captain Jochmans said.
Most reverse commuters are from Queens. Many more reverse-work trips -- 66,000 -- were made from there than any other borough in 1990, although the growth rate of reverse-peak commuting was higher in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
The workers have been important to the expansion of the Island economy, and would be important to expansion, Ms. Kamer said. "That our clerical jobs grew so rapidly during the 1980's and could grow so rapidly stems from the fact that they could draw on the large residential clerical labor force living in Queens, particularly eastern Queens."
Some banks are moving back-office operations off the Island, and demand at major banks for clerical workers is apparently not as strong as the demand for hotel housekeepers. Perhaps a few hundred Queens residents work at the huge credit-card and other operations of Chemical and Chase Manhattan banks in Hicksville, Jericho and Garden City, spokesmen said. But many more, economists said, are clerks in smaller companies.
Reverse commuters are not just clerks and service workers. They are also blue-collar manufacturing workers. Less than 10 percent of traditional commuters, compared with more than 15 percent of reverse commuters, hold manufacturing jobs, the regional planning board found.
Some businesses seek professionals from the city. One company, Mondo Publishing in Greenvale, which produces educational books, hired two city residents a few months ago, for sales and editorial jobs, said the sales director, Jane Binkoff. Six of the 12 employees at Mondo are reverse commuters, Miss Binkoff said.
"These kinds of volumes are growing more rapidly than growth into the core," Mr. Zupan said.
Transit agencies, seeing that the proportion of employed Long Islanders with jobs in New York City declined slightly from 1980 to 1990, according to the planning board, are trying to take advantage of the growth in reverse commuting, even as they take credit for some of it.
Literature handed out at major reverse-commuter stations beginning next month will aim at increasing the awareness of a program under which employers buy transit vouchers for employees and receive tax breaks.
Eighty companies on Long Island participate in the program, an increase of 20 percent over 1993, said Larry Filler, executive director of the Transit Center, an agency that runs the Transitchek voucher program. As many as900 Long Island employers are eligible.
Transitchek, which opened a sales office in Garden City this year, is organizing seminars, sending mailings and installing computers to identify potential customers.
Expansion of the program fits in with the L.I.R.R. strategy, based on a study of 1990 Census data, that identifies reverse commuters as a market.
"Because of the employment pool," Mr. Filler said, "you're going to get a lot of people coming in from the city. As a matter of fact, although it's difficult for the L.I.R.R. to run a huge number of trains in a reverse direction because of the constraints on the system -- all the trains going westbound in the morning -- those trains are pretty crowded."
New trains for reverse commuters are part of the strategy. Last year the railroad restored half-hourly reverse-peak service on the Port Washington Branch after track work had cut the service to hourly, Mr. Zambuto said. The number of riders leaving the train in Port Washington increased from 1991 to last year by 109, to 317, he said.
He credited the addition of the two new Penn Station trains in the morning, the 5:48 to Huntington and the 7:39 to Ronkonkoma, with helping increase reverse-peak ridership at Mineola and Hicksville. Both trains stop at Mineola, where the daily riders leaving the train in the morning rose from 1991 to 1994 by 102, to 435, and at Hicksville, where ridership grew 27, to 402.
The railroad has added a train that stops at Stony Brook, the 7:09 from Huntington to Port Jefferson. In addition, a train that had originated at Smithtown now begins at Stony Brook.
Two morning trains were added from Penn Station to Babylon, the 7:10 and 7:49, as well as a westbound evening train, which leaves Babylon at 4:35 and arrives at Jamaica at 5:11. The new Babylon trains have not made a perceptible difference in the volume at that stop. Despite the addition of the Ronkonkoma train, that station has declined in popularity as a destination.
Mr. Zambuto said economic and other factors were sometimes more important than improved service. But, he said, ridership more than doubled at Farmingdale, to 187, where the Ronkonkoma train also stops.
A further increase is expected at Farmingdale, he said, because of improved bus service, which includes a new shuttle linking the train with Route 110 in Melville. Riders on the Farmingdale shuttle have been taking 130 trips a day since it began in September, Mr. Zambuto said.
In Woodbury the number of daily trips on a shuttle linking the Hicksville station with the Crossways and Gateways commercial complexes has increased 50 percent, to 90, since the shuttle started last year, he added.
Reverse ridership should increase as a result of plans to modernize popular reverse-commuting stations like Jamaica, Woodside and Forest Hills, Mr. Zambuto said. He attributed an increase in reverse ridership at Penn Station, in part, to a $190 million renovation. With the improving economy as well as improved service, the number of riders leaving Penn Station in the morning has increased in the last three years by 423, to 3,692.
At Jamaica, which is used by 1,205 riders, or 16 percent of the reverse-rail market, work is scheduled to begin in July and finish next year on a $15.5 million renovation of the waiting room, ticket office and mezzanine. Jamaica is the station used second most often by reverse commuters.
At Woodside work is also scheduled for July, on new platforms, an escalator and elevators. Scheduled to be finished in early 1998, the joint venture with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will cost the L.I.R.R. $25.5 million. Woodside is the fourth most popular point of origin for reverse riders, with a daily ridership of 379, or 5 percent of the total.
At the end of the year, $4.3 million in renovation work is scheduled to begin at Forest Hills.
And by 1998 work is to be completed on the Hempstead Hub, a $17.5 million project being designed to include a new station building, new platforms and improved parking.
Although the most reverse-work trips are taken between eastern Queens and the Town of Hempstead, the Hempstead terminal has a daily reverse-peak ridership of 224, a substantial number still well below that of other major stations, despite its proximity to major employment centers.
Mr. Zambuto said officials hoped to increase the use of the terminal by expanding links with the bus terminal across the street, making signal and track improvements and starting half-hourly reverse-peak service.
There may be evidence that reverse commuters will choose public transportation when it is reasonably convenient. About 30 percent of travelers from Jamaica to Hempstead and North Hempstead use buses.
In an encouraging finding for rail supporters, the study reported that one-third of the work trips from downtown Brooklyn to North Hempstead were by rail. But, Mr. Zambuto said, the L.I.R.R. is physically limited in providing reverse peak service.
Although the railroad has an opportunity to increase its small share of the reverse-peak market, he said, doing so will depend on obtaining $700 million for more track between Bellerose and Hicksville and on electrifying the Main Line between Ronkonkoma and Yaphank. Both projects have been supported by state legislators, but will be competing for money in a tight market.
Meanwhile, Ms. Kamer said, the railroad can employ new pricing strategies. "In cases where they're running a train almost empty in the reverse direction," she said, "there's almost zero marginal cost to bringing these workers out at a very low fare."
Officials of the planning board and the railroad have informally discussed reducing fares, Ms. Kamer said. But, Mr. Zambuto added, the railroad has no plans for a reduction. Reduced-fare, multiple-trip tickets are available.
Some other strategies have also been discussed, like providing shuttle buses. Although planners say it is critical to address transportation from stations to work sites, problems could discourage using buses at locations where they are most needed, like Route 110.
"The difficulty," Mr. Zupan said, "is one of microscale design. Because these buildings are set back from the road you get off a bus and you have to walk. Sometimes there's no sidewalk, no shelters where you're waiting."
Ms. Binkoff of Mondo Publishing said that she found time to think on her one-hour drive from the Upper East Side of Manhattan to Greenvale and that she liked the flexibility the car afforded for the return trips.
Lack of flexibility is the main complaint of a co-worker of Ms. Binkoff, Louise Gruber, an editor and a reverse-rail rider. Although Ms. Gruber spends just a few minutes walking from her home on East 32d Street in Manhattan to Penn Station and from the train to the office, she said, there is a two-hour gap between trains that leave Greenvale at the most critical time of night.
But, she added, she did not want to drive. Having won a trip to England in a contest sponsored by the L.I.R.R., Ms. Gruber might have been favorably disposed toward the railroad for that reason. But even before she won the prize, she had adjusted to her reverse commuting.
"I've found it pretty pleasant," she said.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Tales Tall and Tales True, Family-Style

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK

 BODY:
IT'S storytelling time at the Crossroads Theater Company. But not just that, though the splendid way Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee and Guy Davis tell tales, the tall and the true, is the heady stuff of an evening's abundance.
There is more. 
 The show, in its world premiere, is "Two Hah Hahs and a Homeboy," a title that takes some getting used to. Mr. Davis and Ms. Dee are husband and wife, sustained by laughter (hence, one ha for each). Guy Davis is their son. That explains homeboy. About the show's subtitle, "Or, How Come We All Ain't Crazy?," don't ask.
Give thanks that this compilation by Ms. Dee of folk tales and folk songs in the first half and mostly original material written by all three in the second does not turn consciousness of selves into a thematic device or even a reference point.
It doesn't have to. The family's affection is a felt thing, a consummately professional interaction. It is a pleasure to behold them beholding one another. And the show's fusion of humor and history, in an airy staging by Micki Grant, gorgeously designed by Felix E. Cochren, is self-evident.
In dedication to Zora Neale Hurston ("spiritual mother to the three of us," Ms. Dee writes in a program note), the first act is defined by those Ms. Hurston called "the once-upon-a-time people who could neither read nor write and who never heard of Ibsen."
Listen to "Beatcha Makin' Money" (told by a victorious slave), "Sis Snail" (she's Ossie Davis, narrating in backwoods dialect, shawl over his head, putting snuff to his inside lower lip), "Pieced Up Rock" (which hilariously explains why the Christian church is split up into so many different denominations) and "John Wanted to Go to Heaven" (a joyous stage traffic among three accomplished farceurs in a life-and-death story of priceless, knowing irony).
These are Ms. Hurston's accounts of slaves and masters, horses and buggies, the tricksters and the tricked. They evolved "out of the sky, out of the ground, out of the water," Ms. Dee tells us. And watch Guy Davis (as John), fleet of foot, running from God.
Joshua's "Gig in Jericho" (lyrics by the elder Mr. Davis, music composed and played by the younger on acoustic guitar and harmonica) enhances the first act. Ossie Davis's own eloquent and funny piece, "Talking Drums and Haitian Dumplings" -- a majestically told grown-up fairy tale involving "dumplings jumping and soldiers dancing," a lovely revenge for Toussaint L'Ouverture, a mighty defeat for Napoleon and a resonating freedom for Haiti -- sends the audience off to the intermission with a positively liberating glow.
In content, Act II represents something of a downhill slide. A child's first haircut, recollected by Guy Davis, allowing too much leeway to imprecise language, is not the heart-tugger it means to be. The joy of "Thumb Thing," a comic sketch by Ms. Dee, the writer, proves utterly elusive, a waste of the charms of Ms. Dee, the actress.
In contrast, six domestic arguments and reconciliations of a married couple are astutely observed, filled with wicked turnarounds and truths that only rare people in love have the wisdom to acknowledge and the wit to express.
In "Litany of the Laid Off," a bravura display of performing art by Ossie Davis, he becomes the "National Unemployed Worker of the Year": the spokesman for the President's new economic policy.
Ms. Dee is the personification of star; it is not possible to avert one's eyes when she is on the sidelines, reacting. The actor and writer to whom she has been married for 46 years is clearly a sly political satirist as well. The two have nurtured a son of grace and talent.
There is more.
This classy family dresses to kill.

HEADLINE: Role of Visiting Nurse Services Changing

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
THE more things change, the more they remain the same. Home health care, newly important in today's health-care system with its emphasis on short hospital stays, prevention and personal responsibility, took root in Westchester nearly 100 years ago.
A visiting nurse association, an outgrowth of the Visiting Nurse and Henry Street Settlement started by Lillian Wald on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in 1893, was established in Yonkers in 1901 to care for the immigrant families of workers who came to build the railroads. Similarly, the Dominican Sisters Family Health Services in Ossining is the outgrowth of a service that began on the West Side of Manhattan when Mary Walsh and a dedicated band of volunteers brought home care to newly arrived immigrants 115 years ago. 
 Nonprofit home health care agencies are still providing skilled nursing services in Westchester communities. "In 1994, we made almost 100,000 home visits, seeing 4,000 patients, which represents a 400 percent increase since 1988," said Joseph J. Burns, president and chief executive of the Visiting Nurse Services in Westchester, based in White Plains, the largest nonprofit certified home health agency in the county.
Mr. Burns continued: "With numbers like that, plus all the other services we offer, such as free blood pressure testing, nurse counseling at over 40 different sites and educational programs, you might think we have a secure place in the changing health care system, but we are facing a double-edged sword as we head toward our 100th anniversary.
"On one hand, as the Westchester population ages, the demand for our services increases, but on the other hand, there are those who would like to control the home health care system and push agencies like ours out of the way."
What is happening, Mr. Burns said, is that during the last five years three Westchester hospitals -- New Rochelle, White Plains and United Medical Center in Port Chester -- have set up their own certified home health agencies, which has resulted in a significant reduction of patient referrals to community-based home health agencies like Visiting Nurse Services. In addition, the hospitals have formed two hospital networks -- the Westchester Health Network and Excell -- of five hospitals each, which control the hospitals' home health assignments and have virtually shut out the Visiting Nurse Service.
"Seventy-five percent of our business comes from referrals from hospitals," Mr. Burns said. "But now in the changing health care environment we are competing with controlled home health care referrals. How much we will eventually lose has become a major concern of our board."
What prompts the concern, Mr. Burns said, is that hospitals, facing a reduction in patients, are looking for ways to generate additional revenue. "They see that their future depends on expanding services out into the community, which literally puts them in direct competition with nonprofit certified home health agencies like ours," he said.
Visiting Nurse Services, he continued, is striving to make home health care more accessible at lower costs with an even higher level of quality in order to compete.
"In this changing health care scene, we have to decide what kind of a partnership we should develop in order to survive," he said. "Why survive? Because we believe that our community home health care nurses -- and we have almost 100 of them -- have proven time and time again they are the best qualified and trained to provide special care in the home, which is different from care by nurses in hospitals."
When asked what makes Visiting Nurses different from other nurses, Mr. Burns said: "They are, first of all, highly qualified, independent, rugged individualists who can work without a doctor at their side. Their mission is skilled nursing for patients, but they are also confidants and household organizers who occupy a very unique place in the homes that they visit."
In order to continue to deliver high-quality health services, Mr. Burns said, the 15 certified nurse services in the county would be more effective if they combined forces. "We are the largest not-for-profit, more than double the size of the next largest agency," he said. "But if all of us -- all the home health agencies in Westchester -- would ban together, the fear of the smaller being gobbled up would lessen. Together we would be able to reduce all our overhead. We would be saving countless salaries by having 1 administrator for all instead of 15 individual administrators. Savings would also accrue by eliminating expensive duplication of services that we have presently."
With one agency, he said, fewer staff specialist nurse practitioners would be needed. Specialist nurses, like wound specialists and psychological nurses, earn salaries of more than $50,000 a year.
"This is nothing new," he said. "We've been down this road before. Twenty-five years ago with the passage of Medicare and its many new requirements and restrictions, many of the smaller Visiting Nurse Associations weren't able to deal with them. Their choices were to surrender or ban together. At that time nine of the small Visiting Nurse Associations in Westchester made a decision to consolidate and stay afloat under a new partnership umbrella. Together we formed the Visiting Nurse Association of Westchester into one freestanding nursing service."
Visiting Nurse Service operates on a yearly budget of $10 million, 90 percent of which comes from reimbursement from Medicare co-payment insurance companies. The other $1 million is raised through fund-raising activities.
"No one is ever turned away because of financial need," he said. "About 8 percent of our patients get free care every year."
Sister Virginia Hanrahan, executive director of the Dominican Sisters Family Health Service in Ossining, which serves patients and their families in the area, including Westchester and Suffolk Counties and parts of the Bronx, said that in 1994, Dominican Sisters Service provided help to 5,600 patients and families and made 132,300 home visits. About 10 percent of the visits were provided without cost to the patient.
"The hospital-based home health care agencies are quite different from ours," she said. "We are Catholic related, and special emphasis is given to the poor. We have many free programs, outreach services, and in addition to providing skilled home care, we provide case management, home health care aides, long-term health care and AIDS home care programs and pastoral care."
But, Sister Virginia said, Dominican Sisters is continuing to look at all possibilities for consolidating and networking some of its services with other home health care agencies.
During the last decade, the pressure on hospitals to discharge patients earlier and earlier has increased the need for home health services.
"Home health care is more economical than hospitalization or convalescent homes," Mr. Burns said. "Technical advances have made it possible for specialty services that used to be available only in hospitals, such as intravenous therapies to be done at home. And portable equipment has made it possible for physical therapy also to be done in the home." Services to new mothers by Visiting Nurses have also escalated, he added.
As for personnel, Mr. Burns said, there is no shortage of registered nurses for home health care positions. Why? "Because, after years of shortages, to save money, hospitals are getting rid of R.N.'s and substituting lower-paid nurse assistants."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Manalapan;
Despite Growth, the Ambiance Is Rural

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW 

 BODY:
THE name Manalapan means "land that produces good bread" in the language of the Leni Lenape Indians who inhabited the site before the first English and Scottish settlers arrived in the late 17th century.
Indeed, the 31-square-mile township has been a breadbasket for more than 300 years, producing grain, vegetables and livestock. Today about two dozen working farms hang on amid residential development. 
 "We still own and farm 320 acres," said Lydia S. Wikoff, township historian and matriarch of a sixth-generation farm family that moved to the area in 1839. "We used to rent much more land from developers for farming, but now they are building on it. Soon there may not be enough land to make it economical for us to operate the large equipment we need for farming."
Mrs. Wikoff complains about the "heavy traffic" on Gordon's Corner Road near the family farm. She recalls when it was a dirt road that her father would plow and scrape in winter, with the aid of horses, in exchange for a tax abatement.
Today, Manalapan (pronounced Ma-NAH-la-p'n), in northern Monmouth County in south central New Jersey, has slightly more than 9,000 housing units and a population that has doubled since 1970. More than two-thirds of the housing units are single-family, with most of the remainder in the 1,831-unit Covered Bridge, a senior-citizen condominium community off New Jersey Route 9, and in two other condominium communities -- Oak Knolls off Longwood Drive and Southfield off Symmes Road.
While old-timers think the town has become crowded, newcomers are attracted by the remaining rural ambiance. Among them are Marion E. and Eamon G. Greene, who moved to Manalapan from neighboring Freehold with their 2-year-old daughter a year and a half ago.
"There are still horse farms here," said Mrs. Greene. "It is far less congested than northern New Jersey and is less than half an hour from the Jersey shore."
Mr. Greene commutes 60 minutes daily to New York City, where he works in an insurance brokerage. Mrs. Greene is a homemaker and former systems manager for Merrill Lynch. The Greenes bought a four-bedroom split-level home on half an acre in the Yorktown development, one of the older housing areas. Mrs. Greene describes most of her neighbors as being "in their late 50's and 60's, having purchased their houses 30 years ago when the development was built." She terms her relationship with her neighbors as "friendly" but would like to see more young families move into the neighborhood.
HOUSING prices in Manalapan range from about $165,000 for some small three-bedroom homes without basements in the older central and northern sections of town, up to $750,000 for some of the large new homes in the southern section. One of the priciest and most prestigious neighborhoods is the Taylorr Lake Estates section in the southern area off Kinney Road, where some of the houses have six bedrooms, maids' quarters and three-car garages.
More typical new construction is in the Pine Hill Estates neighborhood off Pease Road, where 3,100-square-foot custom houses on half an acre start at $325,000.
The largest single-family development is the 30-year-old Monmouth Heights, a 685-home neighborhood built by the Levitt organization off Route 9. The deeds stipulate that homeowners in the neighborhood must join the Monmouth Heights Community Association. The annual fee of $185 entitles homeowners to the use of the association's swimming pool, kiddie pool, two tennis courts and volleyball court off Ryan Road.
According to Linda Trott, president and broker at ERA Trott Realty, four-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath splits, ranches and colonials in Monmouth Heights go for between $200,000 and $270,000, depending on condition and improvements to the original home.
Prices at The Covered Bridge start at $55,000 for a one-bedroom condo and go up to about $120,000 for some ranch-style end units. To buy into the community, at least one spouse must be 62 or older.
The largest condominium community is the 330-unit Oak Knolls off Longwood Drive. Two-bedroom units start at about $115,000, with three-bedrooms selling for about $20,000 more.
Over the next decade, Manalapan is expected to grow by about 30 percent because developers have purchased two parcels of land in the southern section of the township and applied for permits for the construction of 3,580 housing units.
So far, permits have been approved for the construction of 800 units in the smaller of the two parcels, known as Knob Hill. The owners of the larger parcel are in litigation for approvals. Township Administrator James J. Devereaux says the street pattern inside the larger development, to be known as The Villages, is at issue, not the projected 2,780 homes.
Manalapan has no apartment buildings. Rentals, Mrs. Trott says, are hard to come by. Some apartments, however, are rented in The Covered Bridge section or in private homes. Some two-bedroom units rent for $900 and single-family homes for an average of $1,600, Mrs. Trott says.
Manalapan was the site of the Battle of Monmouth, a Revolutionary War engagement involving 30,000 British and Continental troops. Much of the battleground is now the 1,520-acre Monmouth Battlefield State Park, 80 percent of which is in Manalapan. The park, which has a visitors' center, playgrounds and picnic tables, is open from 8 A.M. to 6 P.M.
The park is used for the annual celebration of Manalapan Day, which is to be held on June 17 this year. The day's events include dancing, a re-enactment of the Battle of Monmouth and food concessions.
Near the park on Route 33 is Wemrock Orchards, and just a block away on Wemrock Road is Battleview Orchards. Both are known throughout the region for apple picking in season and for their farm stores, which sell fresh fruits and vegetables and freshly baked pies.
The most widely used park is the Manalapan Recreation Center, a 150-acre municipal area across from town hall on Route 522. It includes nine soccer fields, six baseball diamonds, six basketball courts, six tennis courts, a roller-hockey rink and several playgrounds. Also in the park is the Dryer House, a farmhouse that local historians say was built before 1876 and that has the date 1811 scratched on one of its windowpanes.
The town has three supermarkets and extensive shopping along Route 9. The closest major shopping center is the Freehold Raceway Mall, two miles south of the town line in Freehold Township. The 22-store Manalapan Mall, anchored by Steinbach's on Route 9, is in a state of disrepair, as the mall owner and the township battle through the courts over the owner's request for approval of expansion plans. Nearby homeowners are afraid that such an expansion will increase traffic.
AMONG the more colorful shopping meccas in Manalapan is the Englishtown Auction, a giant flea market on the Freehold-Englishtown Road near the borough of Englishtown, which is surrounded by Manalapan. It was opened as a farmers' auction market in 1929 and attracts busloads of shoppers from as far away as New York City and Washington.
The most colorful restaurant in the town is the Old Silver Tavern on Route 522, known for its inexpensive, tasty grill food and free bowls of popcorn. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman often appears there unannounced for a helping of its spicy buffalo wings.
The Manalapan-Englishtown Regional Schools is a 4,712-student district, in which all but 170 students are from Manalapan. It includes three K-3 elementary schools, two schools for fourth through sixth grades and the Manalapan Englishtown Middle School for grades seven and eight. Manalapan High School, which most Manalapan students attend, is part of the five-school, eight-municipality Freehold Regional High School District. Last year, Manalapan High sent 92 percent of its 416-student graduating class to higher education. It offers advanced-placement courses in English, mathematics, American history and the sciences.
The superintendent of the Manalapan Englishtown Schools, Joseph S. Scozzari, said that the existing elementary schools were nearing capacity and that he intended to ask the township to approve a $13 million bond referendum to construct a sixth elementary school.
"We now have 4,712 students and expect increases of 4 percent per year, excluding the new low- and moderate-income housing," said Mr. Scozzari. "Already next year, some of our schools may have to save classrooms by making art and music traveling subjects." Mr. Scozzari said construction of The Villages and Knob Hill could create a need for two additional schools besides the one that is already necessary.
According to the superintendent, the elementary and middle schools stress reading, writing and problem-solving skills. Indeed, a team from the township's Lafayette Mills School for grades five and six will represent New Jersey at the Odyssey of the Mind international problem-solving competition in Tennessee next month.
Manalapan has many buildings dating from Colonial times. The best known is the Old Tennent Church on Tennent Road. The cedar-clad structure was built in 1751 and is surrounded by a cemetery that dates back to 1730. Also in the township is the oldest black church in Monmouth County, St. James African Methodist Church, built in 1836 by freed slaves.
The main branch of the Monmouth County Library is on Symmes Road in Manalapan. The sprawling building contains 490,000 volumes and collections of videos, audio cassettes, music on compact disks and research materials on CD-ROM. The library is also used extensively for concerts, lectures, meetings and movies.

HEADLINE: Doing Battle, Once Again, Against Base Closings

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
FOR months, groups from two Connecticut coastal communities, with help from state agencies and the state's Congressional delegation, have been mapping strategies to save thousands of military contract jobs threatened by the 1995 base closure process. This week, those strategies will be put to the test.
At a Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission hearing on Friday aboard the aircraft carrier Intrepid in New York City, officials from New London and Stratford will argue against the Pentagon's recommendations for military installations in those towns. 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of East Haddam and the senior member of the Connecticut Congressional delegation, will supervise the presentation. He said the two regions face a tough fight. "Each and every one involved in this fight feels for the workers involved in this struggle," he said, but the unfortunate fact of the matter was that no one prevails "by basing their case solely on jobs and pain inflicted on a region. It takes cold hard facts, and that's exactly what we think we have."
The Senator continued: "It's clear the Army's assessment of Stratford and the Navy's numbers on New London simply don't add up -- and that, in the end, is the best armor as we head into this fight. It simply makes no sense to break up the unique synergy on submarines in New London -- or junk the Stratford facility, given its important role in our nation's defense."
In Stratford, regional officials are preparing to fight a recommendation to close an Army tank engine plant operated by Allied Signal, which employs 1,600.
"We don't have many employers that large left in the Bridgeport region," said Paul S. Timpanelli, president of the Bridgeport Regional Business Council, which is aiding the efforts to save the Allied Signal plant. Furthermore, the Allied Signal jobs high-paying positions, he noted, and it's estimated that there are thousands of spinoff jobs involved, from barbers who cut Allied Signal employees' hair, to the company's suppliers and subcontractors.
In New London a grassroots group will oppose the Pentagon's proposal that the Naval Undersea Warfare Center be closed, and shift its 1,200 jobs to Rhode Island. In addition, the Department of Defense has proposed that nuclear power schools scheduled to move to the Naval Submarine Base in Groton be moved instead to Charleston, S.C., which would mean Connecticut's not getting 500 instructor positions and 3,000 students a year. William D. Moore, chairman of the Subase Realignment Coalition, the group fighting both recommendations, said he was particularly concerned about the warfare center, which has a payroll of more than $65 million and issued $119 million of contracts last year, many of them to subcontractors in the area that employ an estimated 2,000 people.
"That's a lot of money to take out of the economy," Mr. Moore said. He explained that the schools have not yet been established in the state "so it's a much different economic impact."
"You're not going to lose," he said, "but neither will you realize the benefits for those dollars coming into the community."
Representative Sam Gejdenson, Democrat of Bozrah, whose district includes Groton, noted that the region could have fared far worse than it did. Navy documents show that the service ran a computer simulation three times, and each time it recommended closing the Groton base, which would have meant a loss of more than 10,000 jobs.
"We had to come back from the dead to win this fight," Mr. Gejdenson said, crediting work by the grassroots organization and the Congressional delegation to convince the Navy that the base has major military value.
"None of these fights are over -- we still intend to fight for Naval Undersea Warfare Center and the training schools," Mr. Gejdenson said. "But if we'd lost the base, we would not be talking today about saving N.U.W.C. or saving the schools."
The 1995 round of base closures is the fourth since 1988, and the last required under a law Congress passed to reduce the size of the military infrastructure. In the first three rounds, about 15 percent of the military's base structure was ordered closed or scaled back, including more than 100 bases and 200 smaller installations.
This year the Pentagon has recommended 146 closings or realignments that it says will save $6 billion by the turn of the century. But as with past base closures, each community affected gets an opportunity to argue against closure before the commission.
The hearing Friday is the last of 11 conducted around the country, and will focus on bases in New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, as well as Connecticut. Two of the commissioners will visit the Stratford and New London installations before the hearing, to gather information.
John Earnhardt, a spokesman for the commission, said each decision would be based on eight criteria: four dealing with the military value of a base, one on how much the military will save and three dealing with the economic and environmental impact of the closing on the community. Each state will get one hour for its presentation.
"We are sticking very closely to the schedule," Mr. Earnhardt said. Issues new to the commissioners have been raised -- and even if it's not new, it does not hurt a community's efforts, Mr. Earnhardt stressed.
The commission has until July 1 to make its final recommendations to President Clinton, who has until July 15 to decide whether to accept the list or send it back. If it is sent back, the commission has until Aug. 15 to submit a revised list to the President, who has until Sept. 1 to accept or reject the revision.
If Mr. Clinton accepts either list, it goes on to Congress, which must also accept or reject the list in its entirety. On Dec. 31, the commission will be disbanded.
Frank O'Beirne, a retired Navy captain and consultant to Connecticut's Department of Economic Development on base closure matters, said the two groups faced a difficult task. In the last three rounds of base closures -- in 1988, 1991 and 1993 -- fewer than 15 percent of the Pentagon's recommendations have been overturned, he noted.
"You have to assume the Department of Defense has put a year's worth of efforts into these recommendations, and analyzed them in great detail," he said, "so the commissioners are going to put a great deal of weight on them. You have to come up with some pretty good arguments to overcome them."
Mr. O'Beirne, who worked with the southeastern Connecticut group two years ago when the Pentagon proposed closing the submarine base in Groton, said the strategy of many community groups in the past has been suggest other bases that could be closed to generate more savings.
"The problem is, all the easy decisions have been made now," he said. "That can work in our favor -- we can argue that a choice doesn't make sense. But it means the base closure commissioners' job is going to be that much more difficult."
Southeastern Connecticut is in a much better position to deal with the Pentagon recommendations this year, because it has been through the process twice before. In 1991 the Pentagon proposed closing the warfare center in New London, but the grassroots group convinced the commission to spare it. It was ordered to shrink from 1,500 jobs to about 500. As of early this year, though, there were still 1,200 people working at the center, awaiting other assignments.
In 1993 the Pentagon recommended the submarine base in Groton be closed. The commission overturned that recommendation, and ordered the nuclear propulsion schools the Navy operates in Orlando, Fla., to be moved to Groton.
Mr. Moore said the argument to save the warfare center this year would center largely on money. The Navy said it would cost $56 million to consolidate the offices in New London with its base in Newport, R.I., and a Congressional accounting office worked out, at the time, that if the cost rose by 30 percent the Navy would save no money at all. Since then, the cost has risen to an estimated $120 million. The coalition will argue that the warfare center, which specializes in sonar, should instead become a Navy center for acoustics.
Mr. Moore said the coalition would argue that the nuclear schools belong in Connecticut instead of South Carolina because many graduates of the submarine school in Groton go on to attend the nuclear schools, and it would make more sense for them to be on the same site.
"Southeastern Connecticut is the submarine center of the world," Mr. Moore said. "We've got Electric Boat, which builds the fleet, and a tactics development squadron of submarines, an operational squadron, the research center; in one five-mile loop you've got the heart and soul of all submarine technology. That's something you should build on, not break up."
The Stratford group faces a tougher battle because the tank-engine plant operates at less than two-thirds capacity, and has no military contracts beyond 1997. In addition, the Army's latest vehicles use diesel rather than gas-turbine drive trains.
Still, the recommendation caught the region by surprise. Just weeks before the Pentagon proposed closing the plant, it notified the Connecticut Congressional delegation that it was planning to spend $34.5 million on renovations. Allied Signal apparently had no warning either; four months before the announcement it purchased the operation from Textron Lycoming.
"It was quite a shock," said Maura L. Keefe, a spokeswoman for Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of New Haven, whose office is working closely with the grassroots organization fighting the proposal.
Ms. Keefe said the state and affected communities have hired a retired Army major general, Peter McVey of the Cambridge Group in Washington, D.C., who was program manager of tank systems in the 1980's, and has worked closely with the southeastern Connecticut coalition to develop a strategy. The coalition has formed two subcommittees, one gathering data to prove the military value of the plant.
"This is the Army's only tank-engine manufacturing facility," Ms. Keefe said. "Where are they going to do this work if they close Stratford, and how much time will it take and what will it cost to reconstitute the production lines? These are questions that have to be answered."
The other subcommittee will explore ways to reduce the cost to the Army by bringing in more commercial work.
William Reavis, a spokesman at Allied Signal headquarters in Phoenix, said military contracts currently made up about 60 percent of production, with 40 percent devoted to small aircraft engines.
But the tank-engine operation is one of a handful of Government-owned, contractor-operated plants in the country.
"If the Pentagon's recommendation is accepted, we'd have to shift all our work to another location," Mr. Reavis said. The company has not determined whether the commercial work would remain in Connecticut, he said.
The Stratford Town Manager, Mark S. Barnhart, said the group's argument would be based not only on the military value of the plant, but also on economics. Even if the Army is going to produce fewer gas-turbine engines, it will need the equipment here.
"We think the Army has grossly underestimated the cost of reproducing the production lines elsewhere," Mr. Barnhart said. "It's going to cost the military a heck of a lot more to do something that we do extremely well here in Stratford."
He said that because the Army installation is tax exempt the town would lose only the $1.3 million of taxes on Allied Signal equipment at the plant, which works out to less than 2 percent of the town's tax revenue. The larger impact is the 1,600 jobs, which affects the entire region, in addition to spinoff jobs.
"We hope to have a figure ready for presentation to the commission, but we also know that's not going to be the primary consideration," Mr. Barnhart said. "The success of any argument this year is going to have to be based on military value. And that's what we're going to stress."

HEADLINE: County's Wealth: Two Sides Of the Coin

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
FOR the well-to-do, Westchester is the suburb north of New York City known for its rolling hills, pricey real estate and sought-after addresses like Scarsdale and Rye. But for the struggling middle class -- whose numbers grow smaller each year, according to economists -- and for the poor, the county is a place where the cost of housing is often out of reach and the cost of living daunting.
"Westchester is a fine place if you are one of the haves," said Frank M. Surdey, a regional economist with the State Department of Labor, "but it's not so great if you're a have-not." 
 A study of average incomes in New York made public recently by the State Department of Taxation and Finance showed that Westchester County ranked second only to Manhattan in terms of personal income reported by residents on their 1992 tax returns.
In a separate study of median incomes prepared by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, the county ranked third nationwide.
The Department of Taxation and Finance study, based on adjusted gross incomes, reported $57,906 as the 1992 average income for Westchester residents and $3,255 as the average tax bill paid that year. Manhattan topped the list at $63,661 for average income and $3,850 for the average tax bill.
In the Federal study, based on estimated gross incomes for the current year, the median income in the county for 1995 was estimated to be $66,900. The highest median incomes in the country were reported in the Stamford-Norwalk area at $77,100 and in Danbury at $67,000. San Jose, Calif., followed after Westchester with an average median income of $64,200.
Advocates for the poor, however, take little solace in the numbers for Westchester. They were quick to say that those findings notwithstanding, the county was also home to many who struggled economically.
"It's a pyramid here with a few at the top who make fantastic salaries and a broad, broad base at the bottom of people who earn very little," said Christina Rohatynskyj, executive director of Food Patch in Millwood, a nonprofit agency that distributes food to food pantries, soup kitchens and shelters and is allied with Second Harvest, the largest hunger relief organization in the United States. "This is a county of great contrasts."
At the Sharing Community in Yonkers, a church-sponsored nonprofit organization that serves the homeless and the hungry, the Rev. George Anthony Hoeltzel, its executive director, called Westchester's poverty "the other side of the coin" of the county's great wealth.
"It's a county with gleaming office buildings and sculpture parks on the one hand -- and on the other, public housing with no glass in the windows and no doors on the jambs," Mr. Hoeltzel said.
The County Department of Social Services said that statistics of wealth notwithstanding, there were 39,081 welfare recipients -- 4 percent of the population -- in Westchester.
According to the New York Department of Taxation and Finance study, the average income for the state was $36,381. In Nassau County, it was $49,923; in Rockland, $43,319, and in Putnam, $42,243. The lowest average income for the state -- $22,768 -- was reported in Franklin County in northeastern New York.
The department's spokesman, Karl E. Felsen, said that Manhattan was the hub of economic activity for the New York City region and that Westchester was home to commuters who worked on Wall Street and in the advertising, entertainment and publishing industries.
"There may be a great deal of wealth generated in Manhattan," Mr. Felsen said, "but we also tend to see that wealth spread out around the area where it was earned."
In Scarsdale, the average per capita income in 1989 was $50,494, and in Rye it was $49,796, according to figures from the Bureau of the Census and the county's Department of Planning and the Office of Commerce and Economic Development.
By contrast, average per capita income in Mount Vernon in 1989 was $15,814. In Yonkers it was $16,538.
The latest figures available show that the poverty rate for the county in 1989 was 4.7 percent, meaning that 10,748 of the county's 885,731 residents had incomes below the poverty level. Six New York counties out of 62 had a lower poverty rate.
The highest rate in Westchester County was 9 percent in Yonkers, where 4,492 families lived below the poverty line. The lowest rate -- 0.3 percent or 6 families -- was in Thornwood.
By comparison, the highest rate of poverty for a single county in the state, 25.7 percent, occurred in the Bronx. The lowest countywide rates were in Putnam and Nassau where the poverty rate was 2.1 percent. The figures were presented in the 1994 New York State Statistical Yearbook, compiled by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York in Albany.
But a study of hunger in Westchester by Pace University recommended that poverty rates be regionalized to reflect differences in costs of living. "Such a local correction would help us better understand the depth of suffering in Westchester," the report said.
The official poverty level for 1993 was $14,763 for a family of four. But if the high cost of housing and other economic factors peculiar to Westchester were considered, the report said that 25 percent of all households in the county would be living in poverty.
Nationally, economists said that despite the economic rebound last year and declining jobless rates, the poverty rate remained high -- 14.8 percent in 1992 and 15.1 percent in 1993. The income of the average middle-income household dropped, and income disparities between the wealthy and the middle and lower classes widened, they said.
In 1993, census data showed that the upper class -- the top fifth -- held 48.2 percent of the income.
Or as Mr. Surdey at the New York Department of Labor said, "The rich got richer and the poor got poorer."
In Westchester, the distribution of wealth was even more skewed than it was in the rest of the country. Thomas J. Spitznas, a regional economist in Mount Vernon, said 66 percent of the income in the county in 1992 was held by the wealthiest 20 percent of the population. He added that the average adjusted gross income for that top group was $57,903. For the upper-middle-income group the average was $53,937; for the middle-income group it was $28,022; for the lower-middle-income group it was $12,882, and for the lowest income group it was $3,578.
"There continues to be a shift here toward a more unequal distribution of wealth," Mr. Spitznas said.
The middle class, in particular, was struggling with the high cost of living in the county, he said. Middle-income earners in Westchester accounted for 45.6 percent of the wealth in 1989; three years later, that figure had dropped to 32.7 percent.
He attributed the decline in part to the high number of corporate downsizings in the county. "Many in the middle class are reporting less income now," Mr. Spitznas said, "but some of them are simply out of jobs."
The loss of manufacturing jobs in the county has also hurt the middle class, and many former factory workers have been unable to find work in white collar fields because they lack training.
Mr. Surdey said Westchester was becoming "a dual society of the well-off and the poor."
A report from Second Harvest last year said that the gains of economic growth were not being shared by all classes but were going to the affluent. It attributed the problems to "wage erosion, cutbacks in government benefit programs for low-income families and individuals and increases in the number of female-headed families."
The report said that an "upward drift in poverty rates" had affected all groups, including working families, whites, minority groups, families headed by women and married couples. Among children, the poverty rate grew from 16.2 percent in 1977 to 22.7 percent in 1993.
Noreen L. Preston, an economist for the County Office of Commerce and Economic Development, observed that while those trends are being recorded throughout the United States, "they are happening faster in Westchester."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
First a Movie, Then a Novel, Now a Play

BYLINE: By BUDD SCHULBERG 

 BODY:
Forty-one years ago "On the Waterfront," a gritty American movie in cinema verite style about corruption on the docks of New York, became an instant classic. Ever after, its stars -- Marlon Brando, Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb, Rod Steiger and Eva Marie Saint -- were identified with the film, written by Budd Schulberg and directed by Elia Kazan.
Mr. Schulberg went on to write a novel with the same title, based on the movie and the true story behind it. On Monday, another "On the Waterfront" opens -- this time on the stage of the Brooks Atkinson Theater on Broadway. With a set designed by Eugene Lee, it stars David Morse as Father Barry, the waterfront priest; Ron Eldard as Terry Malloy, the ambivalent thug; Penelope Ann Miller as Edie Doyle, the woman who awakens his conscience, and Kevin Conway as Johnny Friendly, the mob chieftain. The director is Adrian Hall. 
 Mr. Schulberg, a screenwriter and playwright, is also the author of the novels "What Makes Sammy Run?" and "The Disenchanted," both of which he adapted for the stage. In this article he describes the creative process from film to novel to play.
ON WEST 47TH STREET, I STAND outside the Brooks Atkinson Theater, and there it is, on the marquee in big letters: "On the Waterfront." The play. Not the movie that surprised the director Elia Kazan and me when it overcame rejection by all the major studios to win a record number of Oscars and become a landmark film. But now in a legitimate theater only a 10-minute walk from the piers I had been drawn to after Kazan and I joined forces some 40 years earlier.
Malcolm Johnson's breakthrough expose, "Crime on the Waterfront," in the long-lost New York Sun pointed us to our subject matter. Following Johnson's lead, I had gone down to St. Xavier's Church on West 16th Street to meet one of the most unforgettable characters of my life, the Waterfront Priest, Father John (Pete) Corridan. Tough, canny, fast-talking, chain-smoking and sometimes profane, he had become the champion of the dockworkers who were treated like convict labor by the racket-ridden International Longshoremen's Association, whose officers were literally recruited in Sing Sing and Dannemora.
I had walked into a brutal, inhuman world -- just a few blocks from Sardi's. Longshoremen rebels daring to meet in the basement of St. Xavier's were set upon on their way out by union goons wielding baseball bats and steel pipes. But not a word appeared in any of the New York papers the next day.
Egged on by Father Corridan, I went to Turner Catledge, then the managing editor of The New York Times, and told him about the battle for control of the harbor that was going on from the Brooklyn docks to Hoboken. He invited me to write an article for the Sunday Magazine.
I came back with "Joe Docks, Forgotten Man of the Waterfront," a profile of the average longshoreman. There were some 40,000 of them, shaping up at dawn every morning, forming a human horseshoe around the hiring boss who picked them to work a four-hour shift according to his whims (or according to the amount they were willing to kick back for the job -- $2, $3, even $4 out of the $2.27 per hour they were getting for the most dangerous work in America). "Joe Docks" described them as "forgotten men performing rugged, thankless jobs in a jungle of vice and violence where law and conventional safeguards never existed."
My three years of prowling the waterfront resulted in a screenplay that so excited Kazan he took it immediately to Darryl Zanuck at 20th Century Fox, who promptly threw it back at us with, "Who's going to give a damn about a bunch of sweaty longshoremen?"
Longshoremen, or workingmen in general, were not "in" in 1953, and they're still a rarity if not invisible in the movies of 1995. It was only with the intervention of a colorful, manipulative freebooter, the producer Sam Spiegel, that we managed to get the film made on a B budget and a 35-day shooting schedule.
The Oscars, and the unexpected box-office success, were sweet revenge on the studios that had turned us down. But those years on the waterfront, including every one of the hearings held by the Waterfront Crime Commission, left me feeling that given the tight structure of a 90-minute movie, we could only tell part of the story.
The film focused on Terry Malloy, a fringe hoodlum caught between obeisance to the mob and the gradual awakening of his own conscience, stirred by the innocence of Edie Doyle, the sister of the young rebel Malloy had unwittingly helped to do in, and the prodding of the waterfront priest, now called Father Barry. What may strike many as a cliche -- "If you do it to the least of
Mine . . . " -- becomes dangerous doctrine in Barry's mouth. It was dangerous for him to stand up to the waterfront mobsters because behind them was a complex support system, involving the church, big business and city politics.
In our film, the priest -- memorably portrayed by Karl Malden -- was a heroic figure. But there was no hint of the ordeal that his real-life counterpart had to endure in bucking the archdiocese.
The ideal film moves from sequence to sequence, in a series of mounting climaxes. A novel has time to pause and wonder, time to put a Terry Malloy in proper perspective, to describe a social matrix of which Terry is totally unaware but one that is nonetheless driving him to put his life on the line. Choosing to do the novel through the eyes of "Father Pete Barry" gave me a vehicle for exploring his courageous challenge to church authority and describing his eventual banishment to an upstate, inland parish.
Despite what Sam Goldwyn was reputed to have said -- "If you want to send a message, try Western Union" -- I felt the message of my novel had been overwhelmed in the fame of the film and deserved to be heard more clearly.
Some 10 years ago, my lifelong friend and frequent collaborator, Stan Silverman, and I discussed still a third way of presenting the material: reinventing it as a play.
That the greatest natural harbor in the world was still held hostage by the mob exerted a nagging fascination on us. The cargo ships with their old-fashioned slings into the hold had given way to 900-foot container ships so high tech that two men could do the work of 20. But credit the mob with resilience and resourcefulness. The Gambinos in Brooklyn and the Genoveses in Port Newark-Elizabeth weren't going to go away -- not as long as billions of dollars' worth of cargo was moving in and out.
IF THE SHAPE-UP KICKBACKS WERE ancient history now, the high-level kickbacks from stevedores and shipping companies to crooked longshoremen union officials, and modern methods of corruption, were the old story in a new setting. No one on the inside, from the F.B.I. to the United States attorneys to the district attorney to the computerized bi-state waterfront commissioners, doubts that despite their best efforts, the Five Families are still doing "very lovely" around the harbor.
It struck Stan Silverman and me that it was time to tell the rest of the story. And what better way than on the stage? The theater offers an opportunity to combine the drama of film with the subtext of a novel. But we had to find ways to dramatize the social and moral issues that there had been no time for in the movie and which were often expressed in interior monologues in the book.
While the play includes scenes straight out of the movie and drawn directly from the novel, it also includes new ones that this third "Waterfront" demands.
The love story is still there, somewhat enlarged, in fact, as we had more time to develop the relationship between Terry Malloy and Edie Doyle. While Terry's story remains, he shares virtually equal time with Father Barry, for whom, in the movie, there was not as much space as in the play, where he must come to terms with his own difficult choices and those of his critical superiors.
While there were worker-priests in France in the 1950's, and there have been priests speaking out for the impoverished peasantry of Latin America from the 1970's into the 1990's, the issue of liberation theology and the conflicts within the church about its current social role are sharpening every day.
The activism celebrated in our play may be new for the "X" Generation, which has often been accused of moral aphasia. Concern for one's fellow man or woman is considered old-fashioned and out of step in the era of get rich with Gingrich or starve on your own time and leave us real Americans alone. Why should our hard-earned dollars ease the pain of your unemployment or personal failure? the Gingriches ask. Today's anthem, all too often, seems to be, "If you do it to the least of Mine, it's O.K. by me."
In the play, Terry Malloy expresses his philosophy of survival on the docks: "Do it to him before he does it to me!" It prompts Edie Doyle's question "Isn't everyone a part of everyone else?" The answer to what seems a simplistic question goes to the heart of our modern malaise.
In the course of our play, Terry Malloy, the seemingly soulless street survivor, is forced to face up to the unfamiliar and inexorable demands of conscience, and the question: Where do we draw the line between naked self-interest and responsibility to our fellow beings?
Although the time of our play is still the mid-50's, when crimes in 57 varieties were shrugged off as the facts of life -- and death -- on the waterfront, the moral quandary that Terry and the waterfront priest face is the same one that the film and novel posed 40 years ago. Only now, in hindsight and, we hope, with foresight, are we able in this Broadway version to cut a lot closer to the bone.
ON MY WAY TO THE BROOKS ATKINSON recently, I stopped to buy the morning papers and scanned them over a coffee-shop breakfast. The Javits Center, I read (not exactly with surprise), was a hive of labor racketeering. The waterfront, moved inland.
A carpenter's union official, who had been ousted for daring to speak up for union democracy, had been set on fire. The Mayor was quoted as saying that if the Javits Center situation was not cleaned up, "It will go the way of the Port." And we all know what happened when Mr. Giuliani declared his intention to break the stranglehold of organized crime on the Fulton Fish Market. "They" burned part of it down.
The look has changed, the technology has changed, but the modus operandi of the old waterfront days is doing "very lovely" in the new waterfront days. And what is the waterfront, after all, if not a microcosm of the good-old-bad-old U.S.A. '95?
