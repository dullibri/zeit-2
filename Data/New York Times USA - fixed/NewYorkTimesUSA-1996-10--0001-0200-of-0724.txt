HEADLINE: FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW;
Wheeling and Dealing in Taiwan's Backwaters

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
Several recent films have shown contemporary Taiwan in all its up-to-the-minute urbanized glory, but how many have poked their noses into the country's sprawling suburban backwater? Hou Hsiao-hsien's strikingly handsome film "Goodbye South, Goodbye" is set in what might be described as the Taiwanese equivalent of David Mamet territory. As its youthful characters scuttle around the country pursuing various shady money-making schemes, you could imagine their American equivalents wheeling and dealing in a dingier outskirt of Miami.
The director, who was born in China and grew up in southern Taiwan, photographs the landscape with such an intensely observant eye that even what's ugly carries a poetic visual resonance. At moments, the movie pointedly steps away from its characters to linger on the lush subtropical scenery viewed from the back of a moving train or a sleek highway vista seen from a car through brightly tinted lenses. 
 It is a world in which speed is of the essence. The film's peripatetic characters are so engrossed in their plans, they barely notice their surroundings as they jabber over their cellular phones and snap at one another in impatient staccato bursts.
The story follows the luckless entrepreneurial schemes of Kao (Jack Kao); his girlfriend, Ying (Hsu Kuie-ying); his best friend, Hsi (Hsi Hsiang), his younger brother, Flat Head (Lim Goong), and Flat Head's girlfriend, Pretzel (Anne Shizuka Inoh). In the movie's opening scene, Flat Head's volatile temper ruins a short-term gambling operation that Kao and Hsi have set up outside a small-town railroad station. Their master plan is to raise enough money to open a disco in Shanghai, but the telephone constantly brings bad news from the Chinese mainland. Apparently the local bureaucracy is so corrupt that establishing a club would require untold millions in kickbacks, and their debts are already mountainous.
After the disco dream evaporates, the next scheme involves collecting a kickback from the sale to a farmer's cooperative of several thousand pigs removed from land condemned by the Government. With the pittance they make from the deal, Kao and his friends have a drunken celebration. Then Flat Head impulsively decides to confront his uncle and demand his share of his family's recently sold ancestral plot. His request unearths a wasp's nest of complicity and double-dealing, and he finds himself beaten up and thrown in jail.
"Goodbye South, Goodbye" tells its difficult-to-follow story in a fractured elliptical style that mirrors the characters' rootless, jumpy lives. The movie, which the New York Film Festival is showing this evening at 9 at Alice Tully Hall, is really an impressionistic portrait of the dark side of a modern Wild West economy. In this big floating crap game, Kao and his cohorts, despite their frantic efforts, seem destined to be numbered among the losers left behind in a cloud of dust.

HEADLINE: Look at Tuition Costs As Shackles From Jail

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The rise in college tuition (news article, Sept. 26), at least in public universities, is attributable to more than the "tax revolt" that slashed local budgets in the 1980's. States are cutting the percentage of their budgets they devote to colleges and universities. California, which for decades has claimed the nation's premier public university system, offers a stark example: In 1967, when Ronald Reagan was Governor, higher education received 17 percent of the state budget. By 1994-95, that percentage had fallen nearly one-third, to 12 percent. 
 Virtually every area of the state budget benefited at higher education's expense, including the health, welfare, business, transportation and housing agencies, as well as the legislative, judicial and executive branches of government. But no area ate up more of the pie than prisons; from 1967 to 1995, the slice going to corrections more than doubled, rising from 4 percent under Mr. Reagan to 9 percent under Gov. Pete Wilson.
Among casualties of the past five years is California's 125-year tradition of providing residents with tuition-free education at the University of California, something the state maintained even through the Depression. For the first time in California's history, the cost of instruction is shifting from the current working generation to its children.
Amazingly, the atrophy of educational opportunity comes at the dawn of the "information age," when most agree that economic and social progress will depend more than ever on education and research. Public higher education, through such institutions as the University of California and the City University of New York, has done more to expand opportunity in the country than perhaps any other engine. What kind of social policy sees prisons as an investment in the future and education as a burden on the public treasury?

HEADLINE: New Deal Had a Better Approach on Workfare

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Sept. 27 editorial supporting New York City's workfare program fails to address the real problem with such initiatives. Every survey of job vacancies in the United States in the past three decades has shown that the economy does not provide enough jobs to employ everyone who wants to work. When welfare recipients are put to work performing services that otherwise would be performed by other workers, job opportunities in the regular labor market shrink still faster. 
 This does not reduce joblessness. It merely moves it around. Since welfare recipients are paid less, this kind of workfare also puts downward pressure on wages. The result is the same whether the effects are immediate, as with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority plan, or occur over time, as under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's approach.
New Deal social welfare planners had a better grasp of labor-market realities and drafted their programs accordingly. Their model was a simple one: Provide dignified income support for people who either cannot work or whom society does not expect to work, thereby meeting their material needs while making it possible for them to withdraw from competition for scarce jobs.
For those expected to work, their strategy was to create jobs -- not because requiring people to work for their public assistance benefits was necessary to correct shortcomings in the recipient population, but to preserve their dignity. Harry Hopkins, who headed the New Deal's public relief effort, summed up their attitude: "Give a man a dole and you save his body and destroy his spirit; give him a job and pay him an assured wage, and you save both the body and the spirit."
We should learn from their example and undertake to create enough jobs to employ everyone who wants to work, at wages capable of supporting a dignified existence. If we are unable or unwilling to achieve that goal, because of concerns about what it would cost or fears of inflation, simple honesty should dictate that we stop complaining about welfare dependency and stop pretending that everyone can work in an economy that does not provide enough work.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
An Internet newcomer is making money by selling moving ads as part of screen savers.

BYLINE: By David Barboza 

 BODY:
ADVERTISING in cyberspace has not been a lucrative venture for many. But one Internet company thinks it has hit upon a formula that could work.
Pointcast Inc., a new company based in Cupertino, Calif., has begun what it calls "Internet broadcasting," delivering customized news, weather forecasts, stock quotes, sports scores -- and yes, even advertising -- directly into computers using an Internet connection. After just three months on line, its site is already challenging the Netscape Communications Corporation and Yahoo Inc. as one of the biggest earners of advertising dollars on the Web. 
 In fact, the site's prospects were so highly regarded that within months of its start in May, the company raised $36 million from outside investors, including the Compaq Computer Corporation, the Gannett Company and Knight-Ridder Inc.
"Pointcast is probably the most closely watched application in cyberspace," said Adam Schoenfeld, an analyst at Jupiter Communications Inc. in New York.
People are watching Pointcast because of its novel application called "off-line delivery," a technology that periodically logs onto the Internet and retrieves only the information that users have selected and stores it on the Pointcast "channel viewer," which also acts as a screen saver program.
Analysts say it's the difference between going down to a newsstand and having a newspaper thrown onto the front lawn. The news and information is provided by Reuters, Accu Weather and Time-Warner, with CNN, The New York Times and several Knight-Ridder newspapers coming soon.
"From the very beginning, we approached this with the promise not that it delivers traffic but that it delivers a message to a demographic that is hard to reach," said Anna Zornosa, vice president of sales at Pointcast. "We approached people and said, 'We're going to get you into an environment that you haven't been able to get into.' "
Thus far, Pointcast claims about 500,000 regular subscribers (a million people have registered by downloading the software free over the Internet at www.pointcast.com).
In addition to the news content, viewers see a rotation of animated, 30-second "commercials" on a frame in the upper right-hand corner of the screen, a new advertising tool that executives contend is a compelling alternative to the static banner ads that now dominate the Web.
"With banners, you're talking about very flat messages," Ms. Zornosa said. "If you want to tell a consumer your mint is best, you can't do that in a static banner. Contrast that with a 30-second animated commercial."
Although Pointcast's "smart ads" are not full-motion video, they do run up to 10 frames a second, giving the ads a near-television effect. And because they are downloaded directly into a hard drive, they will also run when a computer is off-line or in the screen saver mode.
Pointcast has about 50 commercials available and says it expects its fourth-quarter advertising revenue to top $3 million. That would make Pointcast one of the top ad-supported sites in cyberspace, according to Adspend, a web-tracking service owned by Jupiter Communications. Netscape tops the list with $9 million in the first half of the year.
Pointcast has successfully lured large consumer-oriented brands into advertising in cyberspace, such as Avis, Fidelity, General Motors, Johnston & Murphy shoes and Nationsbank.
"We're bringing new players to the Web," Ms. Zornosa said, noting that about 25 companies have agreed to pay the standard rate of $100,000 to advertise on Pointcast in the fourth quarter.
For that money, advertisers are guaranteed 20 million "impressions," or viewings, a month. Each time a 30-second spot plays, it registers in the user's computer. When the user logs back on to Pointcast, that information is delivered to the company. Pointcast says the data will be verified by the Audit Bureau of Circulation.
Meanwhile, Pointcast is beginning to face competition from companies including Freeloader Inc. in Washington, and V-Cast Inc. in New York. Yesterday, Berkeley Systems Inc., known for its After Dark screen saver program, introduced a news and information station in the form of a screen saver, with news and features provided by, among others, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal and Sports Illustrated.
Bill Bass, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., said the Microsoft Corporation, the "Magilla Gorilla" in the field, was already working on a customized application called Active Desktop, which will be built right into the Windows operating system.
"The problem is the more compelling your work, the more interested Microsoft is in doing something similar," Mr. Schoenfeld at Jupiter Communications said. But, he added, "Pointcast got out first and got out best, and that cannot be negated."

HEADLINE: Panama Still Wants Yankees to Go Home, but Not Right Away

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PANAMA, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Since World War I, Fort Amador has been the jewel of the American military presence here, dominating the Pacific Ocean entrance of the Panama Canal. But on Tuesday, the 207-acre site, which includes the residence of the United States Army commander, is to be transferred to Panamanian control.
The change is the beginning of a marked acceleration in the pace of the American withdrawal from Panama. Over the next year, the United States is also scheduled to hand over Albrook Air Force Station, Gorgas Hospital and the Arraijan fuel depot and reduce its strength here from 6,800 to 4,400 soldiers. 
 In addition, by the time the Federal Government's 1997 fiscal year ends next Sept. 30, the headquarters of the United States Southern Command, here on Quarry Heights in one form or another since 1916, plans to have left for its new billet in Miami.
Among Panamanians, that prospect has awakened as much apprehension as pride.
With barely three years remaining before the final American departure, this country of 2.5 million people finds itself rummaging for ways to put these newly reverting areas to use and gradually realizing that maintenance costs will be huge, especially if private investment projects fail to materialize.
With that in mind, President Ernesto Perez Balladares and his Government are urging Washington to retain some sort of military presence into the 21st century, or at least to contribute to a regional anti-narcotics center that they hope to see based here.
But the Clinton Administration is closing military bases in the United States and facing pressure to cut spending further, and the American response has been lukewarm.
Signed in 1977, the Panama Canal treaties require the United States to give up control of the canal and withdraw from its bases here by Dec. 31, 1999.
That process moved at a snail's pace for more than 15 years, a result first of tension between the countries during the dictatorship of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and then the abolition of the Panama Defense Forces after the American invasion of December 1989. General Noriega was ousted after the invasion.
"This is a subject that must be settled sometime late in 1996 or early in 1997," Panama's Foreign Minister, Ricardo Alberto Arias, said of the prospect of a continued American presence. "If there is going to be a presence, they should prepare for it, and if there is not, we should prepare for it."
Mr. Arias said Panama would insist on some form of "direct economic benefit" as the price of any United States military presence after 1999. Washington has repeatedly said it will not pay rent for the use of any bases, but Panamanian groups have suggested other forms of compensation, ranging from construction of a new bridge or tunnel across the canal to signing a free trade agreement.
In the meantime, the Panamanian Government faces a major test of stewardship with the transfer of Fort Amador. The site includes four small islands, a golf and country club and beaches and causeways that have become popular gathering spots since the Panama Canal Zone went out of existence in 1979.
The Panamanian Government hopes to turn Amador into a tourist attraction and has signed letters of intent for construction of hotels, restaurants and shopping centers on the installation once it leaves American hands. But many ordinary Panamanians are skeptical of those grandiose plans, noting that many existing hotels and time-share condominiums here are empty.

HEADLINE: Ulan Bator Journal;
Mongolia Is Throwing Out 75 Years of Rusty Ideas

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: ULAN BATOR, Mongolia

 BODY:
A small man sits in an enormous, wood-paneled office inside the austere and cavernous Government House here each morning, a tremendous amount of responsibility suddenly thrust in his hands.
The official, Enkbold, a 30-year-old lawyer, did not have a day of Government experience before this summer, when he assumed charge of an ambitious plan to privatize the bulk of Mongolia's industry, residential housing and land, all at once. His graduation from law school, Mr. Enkbold admits, was only a few months ago. 
 A remarkably young, inexperienced but determined group of politicians has set up the first non-Communist Government here in 75 years. After surprising the ruling party with an upset victory in a parliamentary election on June 30, the Democratic Union, as they call their group, has now begun to carry out a detailed plan for radical reform.
"By our contract with the voters, we have to privatize 60 percent of all state property," said Mr. Enkbold, who like many Mongolians uses only one name. "We have to move fast. The longer we wait, the harder it will be."
Contract?
Mr. Enkbold smiled. Yes, the idea was taken from the Republican Party in the United States. Like the Republican Contract With America, Mongolia's Contract With Voters promises a slashing of Government spending, a sharp reduction of aid to the needy and a top-to-bottom transformation of the Government.
The difference, Mr. Enkbold said, is obvious: America is as big and cash-rich as Mongolia is small and cash-poor, with just 2.4 million people and per capita income of $350 a year. With a Government built to survive on Soviet support, and no longer getting any, Mongolia is in the midst of a wrenching economic transition where inflation is raging and jobs are disappearing.
Although few politicians here predicted the election results, the consensus in hindsight seems as widespread as it is obvious: Voters were fed up with the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, whose formerly Communist leaders clung to power after democracy arrived in 1990, but failed to undertake serious changes.
In the election, where many herdsmen rode horseback for miles to vote, a clear majority chose the young and untested democratic opposition, which held just 6 of 76 seats in the previous legislature, and said publicly that they hoped to win 15 to 25 seats this year. Instead, they won 50 of 76 seats.
An important tool of the campaign, many politicians agree, was the Contract, which sets out more than 200 one-sentence promises. "To ease the burden on taxpayers by 20 to 30 percent" is one promise; "to support herders' rights to use non-cash payment methods" is another.
"It was an important tool to educate voters," said Hashbat Hulan, a newly elected legislator. "People needed to see that a government can be responsive and can be held accountable. In that sense, it worked."
Leaders of the defeated party, whose own pollsters said later that data predicting their loss had been disbelieved and suppressed, handed over the reins of power with little resistance. A 41-year-old man named Enkhsaikhan took office as Prime Minister in July and got to work.
In his first three months, Mr. Enkhsaikhan and his team have reduced the central Government from 13 ministries to 9, drastically raised the prices of many essential goods and begun fiscal reform to avert a collapse of the central bank.
They also dismissed the directors of several state-owned industries without notice one Saturday night in August, now referred to jokingly by young democrats, ever aware of American history, as the Saturday Night Massacre.
With all this sudden change, there is a palpable sense of excitement among young people in the new Government that they can move Mongolia toward a system characterized by initiative and self-determination, and gradually extinguish the inertia made so prevalent in Soviet times.
"In all of the state's plans, the underlying objective is to encourage people to take charge of their lives, to do something, to get out there and find a way to make money," said Batkhuyag, a senior economic adviser to the Prime Minister. "Otherwise there are simply no options. It's time to move people, to get them to move on their own and not just sit there and wait for instructions."
At the same time, many members of the new Government express amazement that they are in office at all. Mr. Enkbold, for one, confessed that he was as surprised as anyone by the election results, and daunted by the tasks that followed.
"I remember that night," he said. "I had been planning to go on a long vacation with my family, and when the results came in, I was stunned."
Instead of getting a day off, Mr. Enkbold got what he calls "the job no one else would accept."
As chairman of the State Committee on Property, Mr. Enkbold oversees the dismantling of empires that Communist bureaucrats have been building for years. He will also oversee the one-time collection of millions of dollars in revenue.
"It's a great amount of responsibility, but when I step down everyone will hate me," Mr. Enkbold said.
And what qualified him for this huge undertaking?
"I'm a millionaire," he said, having worked as a "suitcase trader," or independent businessman, for several years. "No one can bribe me."

HEADLINE: Frances Lear, a Mercurial Figure of the Media and a Magazine Founder, Dead at 73

BYLINE: BY ENID NEMY 

 BODY:
Frances Lear, a mercurial figure in the media world who spent some $25 million she received in a divorce settlement to start a magazine named after herself, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.
She died of breast cancer, said Dr. Jonathan LaPook, her son-in-law. 
 Ms. Lear was married for 28 years to Norman Lear, the highly successful television producer of series like "All in the Family" and "Maude." Her divorce settlement from Mr. Lear, an amount variously estimated to be between $100 million and $112 million, was one of the largest ever recorded.
"I was very much a part of his thinking," she often said, justifying the amount of the settlement. "Norman could not have done his shows without me."
It is generally considered -- and she herself claimed -- that she was the inspiration for Maude, the feisty and opinionated title character played by Bea Arthur.
Ms. Lear made a name for herself among feminists, working in political campaigns, including Eugene McCarthy's Presidential campaign in 1968; with the National Organization for Women on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment, which was not ratified; as a partner in an executive search firm specializing in placing women, and as a writer, producing articles for a number of national publications. But she believed that she had faded into the background as her husband's career took off in the 1970's. After Mr. Lear acquired his own movie studio and founded his own civil liberties group, People for the American Way, she discussed her frustrations in an Op-Ed piece in The New York Times in 1981.
A woman in Hollywood is a nonperson, she wrote, "unless she is under 21, powerful or a star." She noted, too, that an industry wife was looked through, never at. In a later interview, recalling her years as a Hollywood wife, she said she had felt constantly ignored and undervalued, had had little self-esteem and had often been depressed.
Ms. Lear, in her own words, "always aspired to something out of the ordinary," and she moved to New York after her divorce in 1985. She quickly set out to change the nonperson identity she had felt in Hollywood by creating Lear's, a magazine aimed at women like herself -- "the woman who wasn't born yesterday," as the magazine said on its cover.
Lear's began publication in 1988 and was a success. It began with a circulation base of 250,000 and grew to 350,000 in a year. But after two years, Ms. Lear abandoned her original concept and lowered the age of the theoretical Lear's woman to over 35. Abandoning the older-age niche put the magazine into competition with other women's magazines, and its advertising never recovered from the move.
Almost immediately after the magazine's debut, Ms. Lear developed a reputation for being unpredictable and hot-tempered. She held a series of intimate lunches in her apartment during which she sought, and then usually ignored, advice for her fledgling publication. She also frequently brought up more of her personal history than most of her guests were prepared for, revealing that she had a Dickensian childhood, that doctors had determined that she was manic-depressive and had prescribed lithium for her condition, that she was an alcoholic and that she had made several suicide attempts over the years.
There ensued a revolving door of editors and writers, many of whom complained of Ms. Lear's inexperience and capricious decisions. Numerous articles were accepted and not published, and layouts were changed at the last minute. In an article in The New York Times, a staff member recalled that when Ms. Lear had been told that she could not change a quotation, she had shouted, "It is my magazine, and I will do what I want."
A former associate once said of her, "She spent her life in Hollywood, where you go on your gut and you are prized for being slightly nuts." Ms. Lear did not deny the validity of the remark. She had lived with that behavior for many years, she said, and "very possibly some of it rubbed off."
Although circulation was more than 500,000 in its final months, Lear's ceased publication in March 1994. It had lost an estimated $25 million to $30 million in its six years of operation.
Ms. Lear then formed Lear Television, investing $500,000 in a video production company. The videos, which she referred to as "television books," were specifically for women and dealt with subjects like personal finances and relationships. She had also just completed a book, "Frances Lear's Guide to Work and Family in the 21st Century," which does not yet have a publisher.
Ms. Lear was born on July 14, 1923, at the Vanderheusen Home for Wayward Girls in Hudson, N.Y., the child of an unwed mother and an unknown father. "The odds were stacked high against me," she once said. She was given the name Evelyn, but she was renamed Frances when she was adopted after 14 months in an orphanage by Aline and Herbert Loeb of Larchmont, N.Y.
"Aline was outwardly affectionate with me for my father's sake, but she did not like me," Ms. Lear wrote in "The Second Seduction," (Alfred A. Knopf, 1992) an autobiography that pulled no punches. The slim volume laid out in harrowing detail her personal history and most intimate experiences.
The memoir related her years of sexual abuse, beginning at age 12, by the man whom her adoptive mother married after Mr. Loeb committed suicide during the Depression. She told, too, of being sent to a psychiatrist, to whom she revealed her stepfather's abuse, and of the psychiatrist's betrayal in repeating her confidences to her mother and stepfather. Her stepfather, she wrote, "met me at the door with a kitchen knife in his hand." Her mother "turned and left the room, went into her bedroom, closed the door and protected her economic hide." On her mother's death, her stepfather was left 90 percent of the $100,000 remaining from Mr. Loeb's insurance, Ms. Lear said.
Ms. Lear attended the Mary A. Burnham School for Girls in Northampton, Mass. In the 1940's and early 50's, she held a number of jobs, primarily in advertising and retailing in New York. She was, she never hesitated to say, dismissed from most of them for behavior like listening in on the boss's telephone conversations and drinking through lunch.
For a brief period, she was the camera girl at the Copacabana nightclub in New York. The job ended when she asked Frank Costello, the camera-shy gangster, whether he would like to have his picture taken. Her boss grabbed her under her armpits, lifted her into the air, carried her into the street, set her down, kissed her goodbye and advised her to try another line of work.
Ms. Lear had two short-lived marriages before she met Mr. Lear. Her first marriage, to Arnold Weiss, a traffic manager at the Navy Yard in Charleston, S.C., lasted less than two years. Her second marriage, to Morton Kaufman ("or Kauffman or Kaufmann -- I cannot remember how to spell my second husband's name," she wrote in the autobiography), was dissolved within a year. She said that he had been unfaithful, leading to her first suicide attempt and three weeks in the psychiatric ward at Bellevue Hospital.
"I tried to commit suicide three times seriously and three times with minimal interest in the outcome," she once said.
She was 33 and a buyer for better active sportswear at Lord & Taylor when she married Mr. Lear, who was then a television writer, and moved to California. She turned down a buyer's job with a Los Angeles store and concentrated on homemaking and rearing her two daughters.
One day, she recalled, she realized that "we had become he." She began to think seriously of leaving her marriage. It took her 15 years, she said, "to work up the courage."
"I believe the second half of one's life is meant to be better than the first half," she said in an interview last year. "It is certainly true of me."
Ms. Lear is survived by her two daughters, Maggie Beth Lear and Kate Breckir Lear (who is married to Dr. LaPook), both of Manhattan, and two grandsons.

BOB DOLE
Speaking by telephone yesterday from Florida to employees of Netscape in Mountain View, Calif.:
"The American voters and certainly people there today face a clear choice this year. Our opponents are liberals who want the public sector to grow without limits. We want the private sector to grow without limits. Our liberal opponents have big ambitions for the Federal Government and we have big ambitions for the American people. These differences will become even more apparent in the remaining five weeks of this campaign. 
 "As we go into the home stretch, let me say again that we're pleased to have you on our side and we'll be on your side after the election. We need your help to spread the word about our vision for America.
"You're the ones creating the jobs and expanding the frontiers of industry and making America the most competitive productive country in the world. There are tens of thousands out there who want to follow in your footsteps and we want that next generation of Americans to be just as successful and to help transform the world just as dramatically as you have. That's why Jack and I are campaigning on our economic program."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Corn and Soybean Prices Off; Energy and Gold Also Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Corn and soybean futures prices fell yesterday amid expectations of good weather in the Midwest and a Government report that stockpiles were unexpectedly strong.
On other markets, energy and gold futures prices retreated. 
 The Agriculture Department said soybean inventories on Sept. 1 were 183 million bushels, 20 million above expectations and 13 million above its most recent estimate.
The Agriculture report also said the 1995 harvest was 25 million bushels higher than expected, and there was talk among investors on the Chicago Board of Trade that this year's yields would also surpass expectations.
The harvest begins this week, and warm, dry weather should allow farmers to make good progress as well as strengthen immature crops. Prospects for a damaging Midwest frost have also waned.
Corn futures fell to the lowest spot price in a year after the Agriculture Department said the final 1995-96 stocks would be greater than the current forecast.
Soybeans for November delivery plunged 25 1/4 cents, to $7.58 a bushel, the lowest price since mid-August. December corn fell 6 1/2 cents, to $2.96 3/4 a bushel.
Energy prices were mostly lower in light volume on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid expiring contracts and word that Iraq would soon be to resume oil sales.
The United Nations hopes to approve a deal to allow the Iraqi sales in a matter of weeks.
Crude oil for November fell 22 cents, to $24.38 a barrel; the expiring October heating oil contract rose 0.02 cent, to 71.51 cents a gallon, but all other contracts fell. The expiring October unleaded gasoline contract fell 1.89 cents, to 62.71, but other contracts fell as well. Natural gas for November delivery rose 3.3 cents, to $2.214 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold fell to a 18-month low after the International Monetary Fund said it did not see inflation accelerating in industrial countries. Gold for December delivery fell $2.30 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange, to $380.50, the lowest price since November 1995.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Rose Sharply in August

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Sales of new homes during August rose at the briskest pace in a decade, the Commerce Department reported today, while personal income and consumer spending both picked up during the month.
New-home sales rose 4.7 percent, propelled by strong sales in the Midwest, to a surprisingly strong seasonally adjusted annual rate of 832,000 in August. That was the fastest clip since sales hit a rate of 857,000 a year in April 1986. 
 Both June and July rates were revised upward, with July sales up 8.3 percent, to 795,000 a year, from 7.9 percent, or 783,000.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said that August incomes from wages, salaries and other sources rebounded six-tenths of 1 percent, in line with expectations, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $6.5 trillion. Incomes had risen one-tenth of 1 percent in July.
Personal consumption also rose six-tenths of 1 percent, above the projected gain of five-tenths of 1 percent. Consumption rose two-tenths of 1 percent in July.
Analysts said that the surge in August new-home sales underlined the resilience of the housing industry. But, they added, both reports remained consistent with an expected slowing in economic activity in the third quarter, which ended today.
"The basic reason that G.D.P. will slow so significantly in the third quarter is that personal consumption spending falls off from the second quarter," said David Orr, an economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C.
He predicted that after growing at a two-year high of 4.7 percent a year in the second quarter, the gross domestic product would be found to have slowed to a 2 percent rate in the third quarter.
The big surprise today was the climb in sales of new homes, which had been predicted to decline instead of advance to a 10-year peak.
The new-home sector "has nine lives; it refuses to plateau," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis.
The August jump in national sales was led by a 28.9 percent increase in the Midwest, where houses sold at a rate of 196,000 a year.
Otherwise, the only region where August sales rose was in the South, up a modest 2.6 percent, to 355,000 a year. That was the strongest rate since 381,000 in July 1995.
Sales in the Northeast fell sharply in August by 13.9 percent, to an annual rate of 62,000, and in the West they declined 2.7 percent, to 219,000.
A vibrant economy, in its sixth year of expansion from the last recession in 1990-91, is aiding the housing sector by making consumers more confident about taking on long-term mortgage commitments.
"There's hundreds of thousands of jobs being created every month, incomes are being generated and it's giving consumers the wherewithal to go out and purchase a home," said David Lereah, an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.
He said he expected the upward trend to hold: "Applications for mortgages are up, so this should continue."
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said that rates for a 30-year mortgage averaged 8 percent in August, down from 8.25 percent in July and 8.32 percent in June. But that was still much higher than the average 7.03 percent January rate.
Consumer spending rose in five of the six months through August, with the only decline coming in June, when it fell five-tenths of 1 percent.
The August spending rise was concentrated on durable goods, which surged 3.1 percent, to an annual rate of $644 billion, from $624.9 billion in July.
By contrast, spending on nondurable products was flat at $1.54 trillion, while spending for services gained just three-tenths of 1 percent in August to $2.99 trillion.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Hits Highest Level In Two Years Against Yen

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The dollar jumped against the Japanese yen yesterday, rising to its highest level since the start of 1994. But while the dollar is now 38 percent above its record 1995 low, analysts are not yet convinced that its long-term turnaround is at hand.
The dollar was at 111.40 yen in late trading in New York, up from 110.83 Friday and its highest since Jan. 25, 1994, when it was 111.03. 
 Analysts said that the dollar could continue to move toward the 120 level in the short term as Japanese investors move more aggressively to invest abroad, which means selling yen to buy foreign currencies, especially the dollar.
But the longer-term outlook remains uncertain, in part because the big interest-rate differential that now exists between Japan and the United States -- which favors the dollar -- should narrow when the Japanese economy gets back on its feet. Meanwhile, the stronger dollar will hurt American exporters, leading to a wider trade deficit with Japan, which could send it down.
"Every dollar rally has all the health warnings attached to it," said Peter von Maydell, a currency economist at UBS Ltd. in London.
"I don't think it is going to run away," said Charles A. Spence, vice president for foreign exchange at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. "It is not a long-term change."
The dollar hit its postwar low of 80.63 yen on April 18, 1995. So far this year, it is up 7.6 percent against the yen, and 1.5 percent in the third quarter alone. That rally, and a 6 percent rally of the dollar against the German mark, could have a small negative impact on American companies that depend a lot on profits from abroad.
According to Thomas Doerflinger, an investment strategist at Paine Webber, the dollar's jump in the second quarter clipped from 2 percent to 5 percent off sales growth. But he said the hit this quarter should be less because the dollar was up less against all the currencies of the United States' major trading partners.
The immediate trigger for the jump in the dollar, according to traders, economists and analysts, is the end of the Japanese fiscal half-year, when a stronger dollar improves the valuation of Japanese companies' foreign assets. Additionally, comments over the weekend from American officials and their Group of Seven allies supported a stronger dollar.
Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs who was in Washington for the meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, said that currency traders were looking for a sign that the Clinton Administration might be unhappy if the dollar moved beyond 110 yen, in part because American auto makers had been grumbling about a stronger dollar hurting exports.
"There were not signals to that effect and that gave the market confidence," Mr. Hormats said. Indeed, in statements over the weekend, officials led by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said they favored a strong dollar.
Less than two weeks ago, when the dollar was at 109.43 yen, Robert J. Eaton, chairman and chief executive of the Chrysler Corporation, said that the dollar was too high against the yen and that its recent strength partly explained Japanese auto makers' decisions this autumn to hold prices level or even cut them in the United States market.
"It's quite clear that the dollar is overvalued; there's no doubt about that," he said.
The longer-term support for the dollar has been a push by the Japanese Government for a weaker yen, been shown in part by an encouragement of investment abroad.
This policy has been especially apparent recently because a weaker yen and a stronger dollar is an important tool Japan uses to stimulate its economy by making its exports cost less when sold in other countries, especially the United States.
The Government's other tools -- lower interest rates and higher Government spending -- have been pretty much exhausted. Official interest rates in Japan are at a half of 1 percent, compared with 5.25 percent in the United States, which is one reason that investing in United States Government securities is so attractive for the Japanese. In addition, the Japanese Government has already poured billions of dollars of program money into the economy.
"This is a dollar held higher against the yen not on its own merits but by Japan," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. "Fundamentals would prompt me to look for a cheaper dollar."
Michael Rosenberg, head of international fixed-income research at Merrill Lynch & Company, said that the dollar should also get a lift against the mark and other European currencies for the same reason -- Europe needs to keep interest rates low to stimulate growth and its currencies weaker to help exporters.
In fact, the recent cut in interest rates by the Bundesbank, the German central bank, was preceded by comments from its officials indicating that they thought the strength of the mark was impeding economic growth. Yesterday, the dollar was at 1.5245 marks in late New York trading, up from 1.5235 late on Friday.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Lower On Treasury Securities

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities turned lower yesterday for the second consecutive session, mostly on the strength of a housing report that surprised the market and again raised investors' concerns about inflation and higher interest rates.
The 30-year bond slipped 3/32, to a price of 97 28/32 to yield 6.92 percent, up from 6.90 percent on Friday. 
 A 4.7 percent jump in new-home sales for August surprised the market, and defied economists' predictions of a slowdown in that sector even as borrowing costs have risen over the last six months. The Chicago Purchasing Managers' September index, which was also released yesterday, showed a slight dip but did little to offset the market's negative reaction to the housing report.
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, said the economic momentum had slowed considerably from the hectic pace earlier this year, but the key question remained "whether the economy is slowing fast enough to allay inflation concerns."
New-home sales had been expected to decline to 744,000, from 783,000 in July, but instead surged to a 10- year high of 832,000 units on an annualized basis.
Overseas buying coming into the New York session did help lift prices early. A strong dollar, which surpassed recent highs against the Japanese yen and approached them against the German mark, also limited the downside to trading, since a strong dollar makes United States investments like Treasury securities attractive to foreign investors.
Jack Regan, chief derivative strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said that "the quarter-ending enthusiasm we saw Thursday and Friday has tempered," noting that volume was low even for a Monday.
"Data this morning came in surprisingly strong on the housing sector, to a decade high," Mr. Regan noted, adding, "This latest economic data are now giving the bond bulls some pause to reflect," he added
Analysts said the additional economic data due to be released this week could change the mood of the market. Due out are the National Association of Purchasing Management Report for September and the Conference Board's leading indicators for August, both to be released today, and on Friday, the Labor Department will release the closely watched employment figures for September. "By then many in the marketplace will perhaps have adjusted their buoyant feelings of last week," Mr. Regan said.
"We seem to be in a new trading band of 6.85 percent to a 6.95 percent yield on the long bond, or in the case of the December bond future, a price trading range of between 109 8/32 to 110 8/32," he said. Yesterday the December contract settled at a price of 109 6/32, down 9/32 on the day.
Elsewhere, as expected, rates were off in the Treasury's regular weekly bill auction. The average rate for a three-month bill was 5.01 percent, down 17 basis points from last week, while the six-month bill was 5.17 percent, down 13 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	 	Average Price	98.734	97.386	Discounted Rate	5.01%	5.17%	Coupon Yield	5.14	5.38%	High Price	98.736	97.391	Discounted Rate	5.00%	5.16%	Coupon Yield	5.13%	5.37%	Low Price	98.734	97.381	Discounted Rate	5.01%	5.18%	Coupon Yield	5.14%	5.39%	Accepted at low price	50%	10%	Total applied for	$49,636,671	$50,521,513	Accepted	$13,069,623	$13,196,113	Noncompetitive	$1,444,103	$1,208,188	
 
Both issues are dated Oct. 3, 1996. The three-month bills mature on Jan. 2, 1997, and the six-month bills mature on Apr. 3, 1997.

HEADLINE: Underwriting Shrinks, and Thus Do Fees

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Stock and bond underwriting shriveled in the quarter that ended yesterday, a sure sign that chief financial officers of some of the big investment banks are going to have to perform some fancy accounting footwork to dress up results.
The securities industry underwrote $205.3 billion of domestic debt and equity issues in the third quarter, a drop of 13 percent from the second quarter. Executives attributed the decline to uncertainty concerning the direction of the stock market and interest rates. 
 Wall Street firms underwrote $20.6 billion of common stock, half the level of equity underwriting they did in the preceding quarter, according to the Securities Data Corporation, which tracks the investment banking business.
They underwrote $77.5 billion of straight and convertible debt issues, a decline of roughly 40 percent from the second quarter.
Jitters over corporate earnings, weakness in technology issues, and uncertainty as to whether the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates combined with the traditional end-of-summer slowdown to create a roller-coaster environment for underwriting, executives at several securities firms said yesterday.
"After six months of steadily rising interest rates, we had a lot of gyrations up and down," John C. Qua, co-head of global debt capital markets at Merrill Lynch & Company, said.
Fee income, which set a record last quarter of $2.91 billion, plunged to $1.62 billion in the third quarter, according to Securities Data. Part of the reason is that the underwriting of initial public offerings, which traditionally earns the fattest fees, plunged 59 percent to $7.6 billion after breaking records in the second quarter.
And though bond underwriting compared favorably with the third quarter of last year, and stock issuance declined only slightly, year-over-year, fees dropped 14.3 percent, another indication that competition from commercial banks is driving down profit margins.
Still, most capital-markets executives said that there were signs of improvement in the last three weeks of September, as initial public offerings that had been postponed when the stock market dropped in July were floated, and investors showed an appetite for more complex bond issues and junk bonds.
"If the election doesn't pose a big change -- and most people don't think it will -- you're going to see a second push to get business done before the Thanksgiving holidays," said Kelley Millet, the managing director in charge of debt capital markets at J. P. Morgan & Company.
While Merrill Lynch topped the combined debt and equity underwriting chart yet again, the rest of the ranks were scrambled.
J. P. Morgan & Company stunned its investment-banking rivals, who like to call it a commercial bank, by jumping to fourth place, leap-frogging even Goldman, Sachs & Company and Morgan Stanley & Company, which typically round out the top three.
They fell to sixth and seventh place, respectively, ceding their usual positions to Lehman Brothers and Salomon Brothers.
The ongoing boom in mergers and acquisitions continues to help drive the underwriting business, as companies that have made acquisitions scramble to refinance. Merrill, for instance, recently underwrote a $1.4 billion debt refinancing for Aetna's purchase of U.S. Healthcare.
And Mr. Qua noted that Merrill had underwritten an unusual amount of "put" bonds, which allow their holders to lock in interest rates. "People are more confused about the direction of interest rates," he said. "Sentiment is very day-to-day, and if you're a portfolio manager, you're looking to hedge against the uncertainty."
On the equities side of the business, the market for initial public offerings has started to show renewed signs of life lately, as several new issues that were postponed in the summer came to market in the last couple of weeks. Smith Barney, the Travelers Group's investment banking unit, brought RMH Teleservices public; Goldman, Sachs brought Houston Exploration and Applied Analytical, and a host of other issues came to market as well.
"That bodes well for the final quarter," said Kathleen S. Smith, a principal at the Renaissance Capital Corporation, a research firm based in Greenwich, Conn. "We are concerned, though, that should the market hit any negatives, there will be a lot of trouble because there are a record number of deals in the pipeline."
Brian Hehir, head of equity capital markets at Merrill, said stable interest rates, strong mutual-fund cash flows and solid earnings had helped stabilize the equity underwriting market.
Additionally, new issues are being priced more rationally to entice investors. "Valuations have improved from an investor's standpoint particularly in the i.p.o. market, and we're continuing to see good reception for quality companies," he said.

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
Finally, That Championship Season

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
As the front-office employees of the Texas Rangers celebrated at a party in the early hours last Saturday morning, one man approached the team's general manager.
"I want to congratulate the man with the plan," the employee told Doug Melvin. 
 In the team's 23 years in Texas before Melvin arrived, the Rangers' five general managers had plans, but the blueprints always faded and the Rangers with them. Until last Friday night, the Rangers had never won a championship, had never reached the post-season.
Except for the four-year-old expansion teams, the Rockies and the Marlins, every team in the major leagues had won division championships, even other expansion teams like the Blue Jays and the Mariners, who began life 16 years after baseball created the Washington Senators Part II and five years after the Senators moved to Arlington, Tex.
Melvin, who began his baseball career as a minor league pitcher the same year the Senators became the Rangers (1972), arrived in Arlington two years ago as a rookie general manager and set about trying to eradicate the stigma that stuck to the Rangers like Krazy Glue.
"The plan was to change the philosophy and the attitude of the organization, to bring in pitching and defense," said Melvin, a Canadian with links to the Yankees. "I had asked a lot of people to give me a description of the Texas Rangers, and most people said power hitting, a lot of hitting, a lot of injuries, no pitching and the defense wasn't very good."
The Rangers were indeed notorious for their poor defense, perennially finishing at or near the bottom of the defensive statistics. The most noted aspect of their pitching was the frequency with which their starters seemed to suffer injuries. Their hitting had been good, but not good enough to overcome the shortcomings in the other parts of their game.
First, Melvin hired a manager, Johnny Oates, for whom pitching and defense were just as important as they were to the general manager. The second step in his plan was to find a player who would epitomize the Rangers' new defensive philosophy. The player turned out to be center fielder Otis Nixon, and to get him, Melvin sent Jose Canseco to the Boston Red Sox.
"At the time I took a lot of heat for trading Canseco," Melvin said. "My wife and I were in a restaurant, and the waiter made some sarcastic remark about trading him. I wondered if I was in the right position. But that turned out to be a big plus. It changed the attitude of the organization."
The trade was symbolic because it sacrificed hitting for fielding. It also was economical because it freed money Melvin used to sign pitchers as free agents.
Nixon remained with the Rangers only for last season, then left as a free agent. But they signed Darryl Hamilton to replace him, and the new center fielder went through this season without an error, leading a team that committed the fewest errors in the major leagues, 87, or barely one every other game. In the not-long-ago season of 1992, the Rangers made 154 errors, or nearly one a game.
Melvin's change in philosophy resulted in a dramatic change in performance as well.
In gaining their first championship, the Rangers held first place in the American League West for all but six days of the season. But winning the title wasn't all that easy. A six-and-a-half-game lead in late June dwindled to one game in early August, and a nine-game lead on Sept. 11 virtually disappeared in the space of eight days.
A players' meeting in Toronto on Aug. 9, after a ninth-inning, 3-2 loss in Detroit the night before, became the catalyst for the stretch that catapulted the Rangers away from the Mariners over the next month. It was Dave Valle's meeting.
Valle, a Queens native, is a 35-year-old reserve catcher who plays infrequently because the Rangers have the best catcher in the league in Ivan Rodriguez. But this season he has served another role, and he played it to the hilt that night in Toronto. His words to his teammates were so inspiring that Dennis Cook, a relief pitcher, said afterward, "I was so pumped up I wanted to wear my uniform home to bed."
Valle explained yesterday that he requested the meeting because a post-game meeting after the loss to the Tigers left a bad taste.
"It was a pretty harsh one," he said. "Things were said. I felt the things left undone would cause scars and division among the guys. We were such a tight-knit group, but it was in the heat of the moment after a very difficult loss that things were said. On the plane that night I felt something needed to be done to right the wrongs. I kind of stepped out on a limb and called a meeting."
Valle's goal was to elicit from each player a commitment to the team, a promise to put aside all individual accomplishments and statistics. He went around the clubhouse, stopping before each player, pointing a finger at him and asking, "Are you willing to make a commitment?" Whenever a player hesitated before replying, Valle refused to move, waiting until he received an affirmative response.
"He got in everyone's face and made them say, 'Yes, I will,' " Melvin said. "We jelled even more as a team and took off from there."
But 9 losses in 10 games in mid-September sent their lead plummeting once again, from nine games over the Mariners to one, and gave the skeptics an opportunity to raise the past. "People were saying, 'Same old Rangers; they're not going to win again,' " Melvin said.
Even Oates, speaking of the Mariners' four-game sweep of the Rangers in Seattle, said: "It wasn't so much we were looking over our shoulder at Seattle. We were looking over our shoulder at our history -- 25 years of not being there, of never winning." And Melvin acknowledged, "Even I started thinking, 'Good gosh, is this going to be one of those years?' "
But the players and the fans held firm. The fans flooded the team's hotel on the road with supportive faxes, and Eddie Napoleon, one of the coaches, posted them on the clubhouse walls. The players recalled what they had promised Valle and responded.
In the early hours of the morning last Saturday, after Seattle had lost in Oakland to give the Rangers their first division championship and everyone was partied out, Doug and Ellen Melvin prepared to leave the Ballpark in Arlington. With them were their 12-year-old daughter, Ashley, and her friend.
"Everything reeks of alcohol," Ellen Melvin recalled thinking. "How do I take Ashley's friend home and explain to her parents?"
But that was one of those things that, under the circumstances, didn't need explaining.

HEADLINE: Philanthropist Pledges Help To Immigrants

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
George Soros, the Hungarian-born philanthropist and international financier, said today he would give $50 million to assist legal immigrants in the United States.
Mr. Soros said he was creating the new charity in response to the recently enacted welfare law that greatly restricts public benefits like food stamps and Supplemental Security Income for legal immigrants. 
 "I am appalled by Congress's recent action to deny vital public assistance to noncitizens who are lawfully resident in this country," Mr. Soros, a naturalized United States citizen, said at a news conference.
"This is a clear-cut case of injustice and is contrary to this country's proud tradition of welcoming immigrants," he said. Mr. Soros emigrated to England from Hungary in 1947, and to the United States in 1956.
The money will go largely to pay for the costs of immigrants applying to become naturalized United States citizens and to assist local and community organizations that provide English-language classes and other aid to immigrants.
More than 1.1 million immigrants have become naturalized citizens this year, and Federal officials expect the harsh provisions in the welfare bill to push equally large numbers of legal immigrants toward citizenship in the next few years.
The charity, called the Emma Lazarus Fund after the poet whose words are inscribed on the Statue of Liberty, will also support organizations conducting legal or educational efforts on the behalf of immigrants.
Immigrant-rights groups expressed astonishment today at Mr. Soros's new project.
"We're thrilled," said Donald Kerwin, chief operating officer for Catholic Legal Immigration Network, a public-interest organization based in Washington. "This is probably more money in a given year than all the foundations and state bar associations give out. It's really shocking."
The new charity is an offshoot of the Open Society Institute and other Soros philanthropies, which spent $350 million in 1995 mostly in countries undergoing the transition to democratic regimes.
In addition, Mr. Soros was one of the early proponents of lifting the siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian war. He proposed a $50 million aid plan to Bosnia in 1993, but suspended the offer when logistical details bogged down in bickering.
More recently, Mr. Soros has given out or pledged nearly $15 million to help change the nation's drug policy. For example, Mr. Soros has advocated legalizing the medical use of marijuana, and has been critical of efforts to treat drug use as a crime rather than a medical problem.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "THE DETAILS: Restricting Immigrants"
Through changes in welfare legislation and in the immigration law, Congress has imposed new restrictions on illegal immigrants and on the use of public money for illegal immigrants and in some cases, legal immigrants.
 
PUBLIC ASSISTANCE Illegal immigrants will be ineligible for most public assistance programs financed by the Federal Government or the states.
 
They cannot receive grants, Federal contracts or loans, and will not be eligible for benefits under programs like the Earned Income Tax Credit, Supplemental Security Income, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, social service block grants, Medicaid or food stamps, housing, unemployment or financial aid for college.
 
Medical emergencies will be covered. Children who are illegal immigrants could attend Head Start or receive immunizations.
 
Under the welfare legislation President Clinton signed in August, most legal immigrants will be ineligible for many public assistance programs.
 
EMPLOYEE VERIFICATION PROGRAMS Pilot programs will be established in five states with high populations of illegal immigrants so that employers could voluntarily check the legal status of prospective workers through a Justice Department program.
 
Verification documents will be restricted so that employers must require prospective employees to produce a United States passport, alien registration card or other authorization issued by the Justice Department. Under the agreement, various other forms, like a certificate of citizenship or naturalization, an unexpired foreign passport or a birth certificate will not be acceptable.
 
EMPLOYER SANCTIONS The new immigration financing will allow for 300 more employees a year for three years to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. They are to be deployed to investigate the unlawful hiring of illegal immigrants and the smuggling of illegal immigrants.
 
DISCRIMINATION The burden of proof will be raised for prospective employees who claim hiring discrimination on the basis of immigration status, so that a job applicant will have to prove that rejection is a result of intentional discrimination.
 
BORDER CONTROL The number of border patrol agents will be doubled to 10,000 by 2001 and 2,700 detention cells will be added.
 
SMUGGLING Penalties for smuggling people into the United States will be increased for a prison term of up to 10 years.
 
FRAUDULENT DOCUMENTS Criminal penalties for fraud or misuse of government-issued identification documents will increase from 5 years imprisonment to 15 years.
 
REMOVAL OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS Anyone trying to enter the country without the proper documents will be subject to deportation. If someone seeking asylum is found to have no credible fear of persecution after an initial meeting with an officer, the person will be subject to removal after a hearing before an immigration judge. Such a hearing will have to take place within seven days, and there would be no additional appeals. Anyone suspected of terrorism will be immediately rejected.
 
Only one hearing will be held and notices of removal proceedings no longer will be given in Spanish.
 
Mandatory detention will be imposed on those ordered to leave the country.
 
EXCLUSION AND DEPORTATION Anyone who represents a terrorist organization will be deported or denied entry. Any former United States citizen who officially renounces citizenship to avoid paying taxes will not be permitted to re-enter the country. And any student who violated a special nonimmigrant status visa will be banned for five years.
 
SPONSORING LEGAL IMMIGRANTS For those who sponsor legal immigrants for citizenship, the income guidelines will be altered so that sponsors would have to earn more than 125 percent of the poverty level. (The poverty level, according to 1995 figures, was less than $15,455 for a family of four.)

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE WEST;
Democratic Tide Is Eroding G.O.P.'s Stronghold in West

SERIES: The Race For President: The West

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 30

 BODY:
George Bush fared poorly against Bill Clinton in the West in the 1992 Presidential campaign, and four years later, Bob Dole is struggling to head off a similar debacle, especially in California.
With Election Day a little more than five weeks away, most voters living in the great swath of America that stretches from the high Rockies to the surf of Hawaii seem reasonably satisfied with their lot at this point, particularly with the way the Western economy has recovered. Because of that, pollsters and analysts say, voters appear to be poised, unless the political situation changes, to give Mr. Clinton most of the region's 119 electoral college votes, 44 percent of the 270 he needs to win a second term. 
 If that happens, the 13 states of the West, a mostly Republican, conservative stronghold in Presidential elections until 1992, could be on their way to becoming a solid part of the Democratic base in election years to come.
The latest round of polls show that only voters living in sparsely populated Alaska, Wyoming, Idaho and Utah now seem firmly committed to Mr. Dole. And those states, less homogenized and less affected by outside forces than many other Western states, account for just 15 electoral votes. Nevada, with 5 electoral votes, is rated a toss-up.
But pollsters report that Mr. Clinton leads Mr. Dole in California, with its 54 electoral votes, as well as in Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, Washington, Oregon, Hawaii and, most surprising of all, Arizona, which last voted for a Democratic President in 1948. In many of those states, including California, the President's lead is in the comfortable range of a dozen or more points.
Mr. Clinton carried 8 Western states in 1992, an early sign that the growing and urbanizing region -- 9 out of 10 Coloradans now live in cities -- was beginning to loose itself somewhat from its traditional conservative moorings. Analysts say Mr. Clinton could win in the West by much larger margins this year.
Ross Perot, who ran strongly as an independent in many Western states in 1992, is hardly showing any poll strength this year. In Utah, where he captured almost 30 percent of the vote four years ago, helping to put Mr. Clinton into a politically embarrassing third-place finish, he is now running third, supported by only 5 percent of those polled.
"We feel especially confident about the West this year," said Douglas Sosnik, the White House director of political affairs. "It's now a major part of our base, particularly California and the Pacific Northwest. We're also more than competitive now in the Rockies. As with the rest of the country, people in the West just can't see much reason to vote for Bob Dole, not when Bill Clinton has both the economy and his legislative agenda on the move."
The evidence of the President's strength and Mr. Dole's weakness in the West can perhaps best be seen in the weekly compilations of polls from around the country put together by The Hotline, a national political newsletter. Most of the polls cited are done by independent survey organizations for news outlets.
The Clinton campaign managers, viewing the California polls, are so confident of victory that they have scaled back on buying television time in the state. Mr. Clinton has already put much time into California, visiting it 27 times in the last four years, and he has always said he must win here to be re-elected, given Republican inroads in the once solidly Democratic South.
"We don't see Dole closing in any of our polls, so we're not going to spend money we don't have to spend," said Bill Carrick, a top Clinton strategist from Los Angeles. "If Dole begins to move, then we'll begin to spend and counter. But we don't think a candidate who is pro-tobacco, anti-abortion, loves assault rifles and really doesn't spend any time in the region is ever going to move very much, not in California and not in much of the rest of the West as it exists today. There's a lot of talk about Dole getting out of California. Well, we're wondering when he'll get in."
Mr. Dole's running mate, Jack Kemp, kicking off a four-day swing through California on Friday, insisted that the race was narrowing. Then he sought to put aside the persistent rumors that Mr. Dole, like Mr. Bush before him, would shortly abandon California. The speculation has been that Mr. Dole would be forced to conclude that his campaign here was a hopeless, money-depleting quest in a state whose sun-worshiping, kicked-back voters seem unwilling so far to embrace an oft-dour septuagenarian from inside the Beltway.
"Rumor aside," Mr. Kemp said, his voice rising earnestly, "we are going to spend a lot of time in California, a lot of money. It is critical to our victory effort."
A more pointed, if less sweeping, argument for a continued Dole presence in the state came from Steven A. Merksamer, a Dole strategist and adviser from Sacramento, Calif., and a close Kemp friend.
"Bob Dole may be trailing now, but he isn't going to pull out of California because California history is on his side," Mr. Merksamer said. "Any number of Republican candidates down through the years -- Deukmejian, Bush, Wilson -- have come from more than a dozen points back to win at the wire, or finish even better. It's history you can't ignore. And it can happen again in 1996 because Bob Dole's solid message of fiscal and social responsibility eventually will cut with Californians."
But another veteran Republican analyst and consultant from Sacramento, Tony Quinn, is less sanguine.
"The problem is, ultimately, that Bob Dole just can't seem to connect with people out here in the West, particularly Californians," Mr. Quinn said. "He's just not one of us, not of us. He's a product of Washington, D.C., running in a region that tends to see Washington as the enemy. And on top of that, he's competing with a guy who not only has a good economy going for him but who's been out here in this state two dozen times or more, dumping Federal largesse everywhere there's been an earthquake or fire or closed defense plant.'
Mr. Quinn sees a strong possibility that Mr. Dole will not only lose in California and much of the West but that he will truncate his campaign in some states, leaving other Republican candidates on their own.
"There very well could be a big voter turnout problem for the party before this is all over," he said.
One measure of Mr. Dole's weakness and Mr. Clinton's strength in California can be found in Orange County, just south of Los Angeles.
The county has long been as hard-core Republican as any in America, and any Republican running statewide has traditionally relied on a solid vote there to offset the usually big Democratic vote in Los Angeles and San Francisco. But recent Orange County polls show Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole running neck and neck there. One pollster, Richard H. Hertz, of Bodega Bay, Calif., found that the strongly recovering California economy was the main reason for that.
"While voters are still concerned," he said, "they are considerably more optimistic about the nation's future and their own personal economics."
Elsewhere in much of the West, analysts and poll takers, both independent and partisan, say Mr. Clinton's strength has similar underpinnings -- and then some.
"Bill Clinton is more popular in the Northwest -- Washington and Oregon -- than he was 2 years ago, 12 months ago, or even 6 months ago," said Tim Hibbitts, a Portland pollster. "He's helped a lot by the lack of a strong opponent in Bob Dole and also by Dole's ties to Congressional Republicans who are viewed as too extreme."
In Arizona, which was last in the Democratic column when Harry S. Truman won the Presidency, Mr. Clinton's surprising lead over Mr. Dole is largely attributed to deep angst among retirees about whether overly zealous Republicans on Capitol Hill might try to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits.
Still, there are states where Mr. Dole has good things going for him politically, places where the Old West, not the New West, still dominates. Mr. Dole leads in Wyoming by perhaps 10 points or better.
"My feeling is that Dole will quite easily take the state," said Larry Hubbell, chairman of the University of Wyoming political science department. "This has got to be one of the most Republican states in the country, and there's a lot of anti-Washington and anti-Federal feeling."
But it is the New West, especially California, that has the most electoral-college clout now.
Ken Khachigian, Mr. Dole's chief California strategist and a veteran of numerous Presidential campaigns, argues that the former Kansas Senator is politically nimble enough to bridge the gap between new and old. "He can do it; he can do it," he insisted.
But Bob Mulholland, the chief political strategist for the California Democratic Party, says he sees the winner as Mr. Clinton, going away.
"Bob Dole doesn't surf," Mr. Mulholland said.

HEADLINE: Mexican Justice

 BODY:
President Ernesto Zedillo has promised to enforce the laws of Mexico fully and impartially, even with top officials of his Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. The future of political and economic reform requires the fair administration of justice. But Mr. Zedillo and his party have repeatedly delivered a good deal less than that.
The latest example came last week when a PRI majority prematurely terminated a congressional investigation into possible crimes or misconduct by Raul Salinas de Gortari, the brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
 The Zedillo administration can undo some of the damage by insisting that its attorney general vigorously prosecute the charges against Raul Salinas in the courts. But the administration's own record in prosecuting other politically sensitive cases is not encouraging. Unless Mr. Zedillo acts more boldly the culture of impunity will prevail, and continue to thwart efforts at reform.
Raul Salinas is now in jail facing charges of murder and illegal enrichment. But since his arrest on the murder charges 19 months ago, his case has moved slowly. The Government's attempt to prove that he masterminded the assassination of a top ruling party official has stalled. The corruption charges were brought later, largely as a result of Swiss and American investigations of Mr. Salinas's large offshore bank accounts. Mexican efforts to uncover the sources of his enrichment have lagged.
These investigations are highly sensitive, since they could involve some of the country's most prominent businessmen and politicians. The congressional inquiry into Raul Salinas's conduct as a top official of the Government's food distribution company was seen by many Mexicans as an attempt to force the pace of the wider investigation.
Mexicans now wonder if the multi-party congressional inquiry was shifted offstage to the closed world of the attorney general's office and the courts because it was drawing so much public attention to currently powerful figures.
By appointing an opposition party member as his attorney general, Mr. Zedillo initially raised hopes that his administration would aggressively prosecute politically sensitive cases like that of Raul Salinas. But that optimism has been dashed by the Government's repeated prosecutorial failures and omissions.
The Zedillo administration rejects its predecessor's conclusion that a lone gunmen murdered the former presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, but has yet to convict anyone else of the crime. It has failed to pursue high-profile criminal cases involving the governors of two Mexican states. That record creates little confidence it will take on the powerful ruling party interests involved in the Raul Salinas corruption case.
Unless the rule of law is applied equally to all Mexicans, neither democracy nor free and transparent markets can take root. That is the powerful lesson of the unraveling of Carlos Salinas's presidency. If Mr. Zedillo fails to apply it consistently, his own hopes for reform could falter as well.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Arafat's War Option

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Palestinians can choose between war against Israel or peace talks with Israel. They no longer can have both. Unless they learn that at the Washington conference called by President Clinton, the meeting will be simply a step toward one more Mideast disaster.
For the Palestinians, the use of the war option was a great success -- this time. They got immediate international support for their attacks on Israelis plus instant international condemnation of Israel for being in the way of Palestinian police bullets. 
 The Clinton Administration did not lead the pack but sent signals of displeasure with Israel. Mr. Clinton has called an Arab-Israeli conference in Washington for this week. Now it is his chance and responsibility to make the meeting worthwhile by clarifying reality for Palestinians: Their war option has expired.
If the United States allows the Palestinians to leave Washington still believing that they can play the war card again, it will be encouraging them to move along a road that is likely to end in another full-scale war between Arab and Israeli.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been doing his underreported best to negotiate with the Palestinians on building up their own economy and reaching an agreement on Hebron that would give control to them but significant protection to the Jews living there.
The previous Labor Government just let Hebron slide for months, afraid to deal with it before the elections, as promised at Oslo. But at least former Prime Minister Shimon Peres can pleasurably denounce the elected Government of his country and praise Yasir Arafat, the commander of the Palestinians who fired on Israeli soldiers. So be it.
No amount of domestic or international pressure will persuade Mr. Netanyahu's Government to permit Palestinian gunmen to push Israel step by step toward any agreement he considers a threat to its ability to survive as a free nation. The danger is that the Palestinians will again prove their talent for historic miscalculation.
War is the word for what happened last week. This was not intifada, one more furious uprising of unarmed Palestinian civilians against the Israeli forces that they used to see on their streets. Ninety percent of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza now live in cities controlled by the Palestinian Authority set up by the Oslo agreement and financed largely by international grants.
This time the stone-throwers were not only backed up by police using automatic weapons but had to go looking for Israeli soldiers at checkpoints outside of town, or search out Jews living among them where they might congregate -- like a synagogue or yeshiva.
It was a script. Mr. Arafat took 36 hours to organize police-backed riots against the opening of a new door to an ancient archeological tunnel, Then he turned the armed riots on. When he was good and ready, he turned them off.
If Mr. Clinton puts Palestinians on notice that the war option has been used for the last time, he will have bipartisan support for the meeting, which he certainly does not have now.
Bob Dole, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, have told him not to use the meeting to pressure Israel still further. In a letter to Mr. Clinton, the Speaker and the Senator said that last week's attacks did not exist in isolation:
"We urge that the roles of Iran, Syria, Hamas and Hezbollah in destabilizing the region be a key part of the agenda for this meeting. The U.S. must lead in forcing a multinational strategy to combat these sponsors of terrorism and enemies of peace. Without such a strategy any attempt to bring peace to the region is destined to fail."
Exactly. Mr. Netanyahu got serious advice from some of his cabinet members that the Palestinian armed force of about 40,000 would become larger, better armed and get more support from Arab dictatorships, Arab militants, Western appeasers, the whole nest of those who cannot forgive Israel for existing.
Mr. Netanyahu refused. But if Mr. Arafat again orders Israeli soldiers used as rifle targets, Mr. Netanyahu will not be able to refuse again for long, or maybe at all. So the Washington meeting will have meaning only if Mr. Clinton tells Palestinians that their war option is now a deadly mirage.

Netanyahu Seeks New Talks On 3 Major Palestinian Issues

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is convinced, he and his aides say, that the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, has already won an undeserved advantage in the battle for world opinion, but that Mr. Netanyahu is determined that world opinion would not dictate Israeli positions.
Mr. Netanyahu and his advisers laid out for reporters today an opening proposal intended to demonstrate that his Likud party Government has been unfairly cast as obstructionist in peace talks with the Palestinian Authority. 
He said he would call for high-level Israeli and Palestinian delegations to meet in continuous closed-door negotiations until they resolved three contentious issues: differences over Israel's agreement to withdraw its security forces from most of the West Bank city of Hebron, provisions to allow Palestinians to travel more freely from the West Bank and Gaza Strip to jobs in Israel, and a range of specific security issues including the fate of a proposed Palestinian-controlled airport in the Gaza Strip.
These three subjects were already identified as the main items on the negotiating agenda at Mr. Netanyahu's first meeting with Mr. Arafat earlier this month.
The talks, at a secluded location like the Egyptian resort of Taba on the Red Sea, "will continue until there is white smoke," Mr. Netanyahu told reporters, adding that he and Mr. Arafat should be prepared to attend periodically to prod their negotiators along.
But the offer was coupled with a demand for Palestinian restraint that advisers said was essential to hold the support of religious nationalists and security hawks who are part of Israel's governing alliance.
Israeli officials said Mr. Arafat would have to forswear further violence against Israeli forces and formally accept that continued attacks would give Israel license to retaliate strongly. The officials said they wanted the United States to declare that it also recognized this Israeli right.
"What I'd like to see is two things," Mr. Netanyahu said before he left for Washington, where he arrived this evening. "First a cessation of violence, and second a speedy resumption of negotiations to their conclusion, and to that effect I am proposing that the two sides meet right after the meeting in Washington in a locale to be determined and engage in continual negotiations until agreement is reached. This is the way to proceed."
At the same time, Mr. Netanyahu rejected making any concessions or gestures that would be perceived as a surrender to violence.
Specifically, they said, there would be no talk of closing the tunnel in Jerusalem that Palestinians cite as the immediate spark of the recent conflict.
Among the Israelis who flew to Washington with the Prime Minister, the recurring theme was that Mr. Arafat had deliberately provoked the confrontations that left scores dead to bring pressure on Israel.
The violence of the last three days, Mr. Netanyahu said, was "a fundamental violation of the agreements."
"Even Chairman Arafat knows he's pushed the rope to the end," Mr. Netanyahu said.
Dore Gold, the Prime Minister's senior foreign affairs adviser, said Mr. Arafat had used the opening of the tunnel to foment rioting. The Israelis contend that Mr. Arafat's strategy paid off, in that the West and Arab governments generally blamed Israeli stubbornness for the conflict. The United Nations Security Council condemned Israel for opening the tunnel -- and the United States pointedly abstained, declining to use its veto power in Israel's defense.
Mr. Gold said the Palestinian leader deserved to reap "no political fruit" from the Israelis at the Washington meeting.
"He already has his fruit," Mr. Gold said. "He'll be wined and dined in Washington. He has the U.N. vote and the U.S. abstention."
Mr. Gold described the Israeli position as a dilemma. On the one hand, he said, Mr. Netanyahu is under intense pressure from Western and Arab governments to make a gesture of conciliation. On the other hand, the violence has energized the religious and nationalist wing of his Government, for whom the sight of Palestinians shooting at Israelis was anathema.
Natan Sharansky, a Cabinet member traveling with the Prime Minister, said the right wing of the Government had pushed insistently for Mr. Netanyahu to use all available force against the Palestinian uprising and to use the occasion to halt peace negotiations.
In general, Mr. Netanyahu and his aides argued that they had been unfairly accused of stalling on the Palestinian front.
They said that the previous Labor Government had operated with what Mr. Gold called "a long line of credit" -- that Labor had been praised for incremental results -- while the Likud Government was under constant pressure to show quick results.
The aides said the West and the Palestinians and their Arab allies did not appreciate how difficult it had been for Mr. Netanyahu, given his dependence on hard-liners in his coalition, to do what he had already done, including meeting with Mr. Arafat, renewing negotiations and agreeing in principle to carry out the withdrawal from Hebron.
Mr. Sharansky said the Government had been nearing a decision on the timing of a withdrawal from Hebron, which was overdue under an agreement reached by the previous Government. Israelis say the withdrawal has become far more difficult because of fears fanned by last week's clashes.
The presence of Mr. Sharansky, the Minister of Industry and Labor, in the delegation was intended to bolster Israel's case that accusations of drift were unfair.
Mr. Sharansky said one of his tasks would be to point out to critics of the Likud Government that Israel had taken various steps to improve the economic plight of the Palestinians, including an increase in the number of work permits issued to them from 15,000 to 50,000 and negotiations on creating job-rich industrial zones abutting the Gaza Strip.
As a well-known former Soviet dissident, Mr. Sharansky was also on hand to argue to the Americans, as he had in the Israeli Cabinet, that giving in to force would only lead to disaster and a renewal of violence.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Pride of Puerto Rico Visible in Post-Season

BYLINE: By Claire Smith 

 BODY:
For a whole summer, the sounds of salsa underscored the growing influence of Latin America on the Mets and Yankees. That flavor will be even more palpable -- and distinctly Puerto Rican -- tonight when the American League West champion Texas Rangers and the A.L. East-winning Yankees begin their playoff series at Yankee Stadium.
The Yankees' Bernie Williams and the Rangers' Juan Gonzalez and Ivan Rodriguez, who grew up playing with and against each other in the boys' leagues around the baseball-hungry island, will be prominently displayed. 
 And their presence, along with that of Sandy Alomar Jr. of the Indians and Roberto Alomar of the Orioles in the league's other first-round series, will show that the contributions of this tiny island only 100 miles long and 35 miles wide did not end with Roberto Clemente, nor has it been totally eclipsed by the Dominican Republic.
And the contributions this season have been immense.
Williams, whose graceful approach to the game led his manager, Joe Torre, to liken him to Arthur Ashe, used a .305 average, 29 home runs and 102 runs batted in to help the Yankees win a division for the first time since 1981.
Rodriguez is the Rangers' 24-year-old catcher, whose skills and bat have allowed him to inherit the nickname Pudge from the former All-Star catcher Carlton Fisk. He and Gonzalez, the powerful right fielder who muscled 47 home runs and 144 r.b.i., were primary ingredients in taking the franchise to its first post-season appearance.
When they are introduced, when their images are beamed to Puerto Rico, "it will be huge," Rodriguez said with a smile as large as the uproar he predicts. Williams, flashing an equally big grin, said, "It'll probably be the most-watched playoff series in Puerto Rico in a long, long time."
Perhaps since Clemente last played a World Series game and launched a rich tradition these three players merely seek to extend. "In Puerto Rico, the No. 1 sport is baseball -- nothing is bigger, and a lot of kids are watching us," said Rodriguez, who hit .300 with 19 homers and 86 r.b.i. "They want to be like us."
"And that means a lot to me," said Williams, who played in Little League against the younger Rodriguez and teamed with Gonzalez at Vega Baja in a league named for Mickey Mantle -- the Hall of Famer who ruled the same center field ground Williams now patrols.
"Taking into consideration the size of the island and the fact that there have been a lot of good players to come out of Puerto Rico, it's certainly a great honor to be a part of the tradition of Puerto Rican players in the post-season," the 28-year-old Williams said.
Now, these players are not suggesting that Puerto Rico reigns supreme when it comes to sending major leaguers to the States. "Baseball in the Dominican is huge," Williams said. "It's big in Puerto Rico, also, but in Puerto Rico, the average kid will have so many more options."
Yes, Puerto Rican kids are still easily plucked by scouts; Gonzalez and Rodriguez both signed at age 16. But their hunger may not match that of Cubans, Dominicans and Mexicans, many of whom view baseball as the only avenue away from lands locked in poverty. As United States citizens, Puerto Rican children, by contrast, have access to economies and standards of living that are decidedly more American.
"That's a big point," said Williams, a pre-med college student before signing with the Yankees.
Still, the tradition exists in Puerto Rico, perhaps not as feverish, but as cherished. In listening to these three players, it is obvious why.
"I never saw Clemente in person, but I remember seeing him on tape, in the World Series, and what a great feeling it was," said Gonzalez, the 26-year-old whose popularity at home -- and penchant for charitable deeds -- are said to mirror those of Clemente, the Hall of Famer. Clemente died in a plane crash on Dec. 31, 1972, while attempting to fly supplies to Nicaraguan earthquake victims.
"Roberto Clemente was a very good player, but he also loved children and he died trying to help people," the 24-year-old Rodriguez said. "And that's what I want to do, to help people. That's why I have foundations, in Puerto Rico and Texas, for children with cancer."
Thus, Clemente lives, on the field, in these players' hearts. "We have to make that our job to make the kids growing up now remember what he was about, about the legacy he tried to make," Williams said.
Tonight, Rodriguez, Gonzalez and Williams will not only rivet the attention of an entire commonwealth. They will also make their mission all the more easy merely by stepping onto the field.

State Jobs, but Not on Paper

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
As one of the economy measures in Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's current budget, the state has stopped publishing a list of vacant Civil Service jobs. The list is available over the Internet, but two Democratic legislators say that is no help to many job-seekers who do not have access to a computer. Only 15 of the state's 400 libraries offer Internet access, the New Jersey Library Association said. 
 Dropping the printed job bulletins saved the state $100,000. But two Assembly members, Shirley K. Turner of Ewing Township and W. Reed Gusciora of Princeton, urged yesterday that the bulletins be restored.

HEADLINE: NYC;
Soup Kitchen Feels the Heat Of a New Law

BYLINE: By Clyde Haberman 

 BODY:
HOW to explain the sudden change? The Rev. William Greenlaw says that he can't, not really. All he knows is that for about the last six weeks, coincidentally or not, the period since President Clinton signed the welfare-overhaul law, lines have grown a lot longer at the soup kitchen he runs out of the Episcopal Church of the Holy Apostles, at Ninth Avenue and West 28th Street.
Before, Father Greenlaw says, he could expect a typical weekday to bring 900 to 1,000 "guests" to lunch at Holy Apostles, a huge soup kitchen, if not New York's biggest. Suddenly in mid-summer, the numbers jumped to between 1,100 and 1,300, reaching 1,475 one particularly taxing day in late August. Yesterday's head count was typical of this harsh new reality: 1,208, mostly single men, standing on a line that curled around the corner toward Eighth Avenue. 
 "It's clear that there are a whole lot of people who are coming to us for the first time," Father Greenlaw said. "Something is clearly going on. And the fear is that if this is happening before everything kicks in with this new law, what's going to happen when it all kicks in?"
What, indeed? It is a question that soup kitchens and pantries are asking all around the city, and winter still lies ahead. Even before the ballyhooed end to welfare as we knew it, they had been struggling to keep pace with a sharp rise in demand, the result of cuts in social programs at all levels -- Federal, state and local.
A YEAR ago, the New York City Coalition Against Hunger put the number of pantries and kitchens at about 800. Now, it counts 907. Food for Survival, the kitchens' central supplier, operating out of Hunts Point in the Bronx, says that it distributed 27 million pounds of food from July 1995 to June 1996. That was 35 percent more than in the previous 12 months.
"It's been one thing on top of another, like the Mayor's policy of forcing people off welfare," said Judith Walker, executive director of the Coalition Against Hunger. "The decline in the welfare rolls doesn't mean there's less poverty."
We will have to wait and see if the longer lines at Holy Apostles is a statistical blip or a disturbing early glimpse into the future, citywide. Other food programs around town do not report the same increase in demand over the last month or so. It is "awfully soon," Ms. Walker said, to be feeling such a heavy impact from a law signed by President Clinton only on Aug. 22.
Still, some of its provisions have already gone into effect, like denying food stamps to certain legal immigrants. And Holy Apostles is not that unusual. Kitchens like St. John's Bread and Life in Bedford-Stuyvesant and POTS (as in Part of the Solution) in the Bronx, are also suddenly seeing more down-and-outers showing up at their doors. The increases are just not as sharp as those at Father Greenlaw's church -- more on the order of 9 percent since mid-summer, Hossein Saadat, the executive director at St. John's, said.
"People fear to go to apply for entitlements," Mr. Saadat said by way of explanation. "The feeling with this new law now is, Why bother? So they're starting not to go, and they're coming to soup kitchens."
TOMMY McEWEN, the soup kitchen director at POTS, said the new law has reinforced a sense among the desperately poor that they had better tuck away whatever little money they have. "Most of my clients say they're trying to hold onto their dollars and take advantage of what's available for free," he said.
In the simple sanctuary of Holy Apostles, many who came yesterday for a lunch of tuna casserole and green beans recognized that much of America has grown tired of them. There would be no welfare law if that were not so. "A lot of society has pretty much written off certain people, like so much dirt under the rug," Edward Perry, an unemployed 45-year-old, said, adding that it was his first visit to a soup kitchen in three years.
As it happened, the soup kitchen served yesterday what it believed to be its three millionth meal since opening in October 1982. It took Holy Apostles six years to reach the one million mark, then roughly four years for each of the next two millionth-meal milestones. Common sense suggests, Father Greenlaw said, that he will get to four million in considerably less time.
It fell to Mr. Perry, more or less arbitrarily, to be designated Meal No. 3 million, a distinction that earned him nothing in the way of a special reward. "This is not a celebration," Father Greenlaw said. "It's an indictment."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Despite a Selloff, a Good Quarter for Stocks

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The 104th Congress will be remembered for overhauling the welfare laws, a higher minimum wage and two shutdowns of the Government. But to a select few investors who paid attention to minor legislation, it will also be remembered for creating a great investment opportunity.
That opportunity was in legislation that greatly expanded the powers of a lesser known semipublic agency, the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Association, otherwise known as Farmer Mac. That expansion, passed in February, led to a lot more activity for the organization, and to its first profits ever. And in the third quarter, it also produced the best stock in America: Farmer Mac's class A stock, traded on Nasdaq, leaped 292 percent. 
 For the rest of the market, the quarter's gains were less spectacular, but they were welcome just the same. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks ended the period at a record 687.33 points, after enduring in July its worst correction since the 1990 recession.
The Dow Jones industrial average flirted with a record yesterday, but closed a dozen points below the high it set last week. And there was strength in markets throughout much of the world. The Dutch market was the only European one to set a record close yesterday, but those in Britain and Germany set peaks earlier in September. Even France, whose economy is struggling with high unemployment, rose nicely, though prices there remain below their 1994 peaks.
The general good news for shareowners has its exceptions, such as a small decline in Japan, but over all much of the world seems to be moving more or less in tandem, paced by expectations that gradual growth in the industrialized world will continue and a belief that few acceptable alternative investments are available.
Still, the July selloff that decimated many technology stocks in this country, and produced the largest correction for blue chips in more than five years, has not been totally forgotten. The Nasdaq composite index is up 17.7 percent from the low it hit then, but remains 1.8 percent below the peak it had reached in early June.
And while the Dow industrials ended the quarter with a quite respectable gain of 3.9 percent, the Dow transports were off 4.7 percent and the Dow utilities were down 1.6 percent. Weak airline stocks, beset by traders' worries about higher fuel prices, were the leading culprits in the transport weakness; worries about competition hurt some electric utilities as well.
As for the bond market, the net movement in the quarter was almost imperceptible. The 30-year Treasury bond ended the quarter yielding 6.92 percent, up from 6.89 percent at the end of June. And the change in the three-month Treasury bill rate was even less. Yesterday's figure of 5.01 percent was down from 5.02 percent three months earlier. When stock prices were plunging in July, a fear of higher interest rates was cited as a factor; that fear failed to materialize.
Financial stocks, in fact, were among the best performers, though many would be vulnerable to a sharp rise in interest rates. The S.& P. index of financial stocks climbed 7.5 percent in the quarter to a record.
The lists of best and worst performing individual shares, as is often the case, showed investor actions at their best and worst. Farmer Mac may be a classic case of a small stock -- only 1.2 million shares are available to the public -- that slipped below the radar of most analysts.
Farmer Mac's best performing shares, the class A shares, are available only to financial institutions. But anyone can buy the class C shares, which, incidentally, will also be in line for a higher dividend, should the company ever pay one. The class C shares jumped 191 percent in Nasdaq trading.
The bank that wins the award for spotting -- and acting on -- Farmer Mac is Zions Bancorp, which in March agreed to buy 320,000 newly issued class A shares, at $8 each, from Farmer Mac. The price was then a 60 percent premium over the market price, but now it looks cheap. The shares ended yesterday at $23.50. Zion's shares didn't do badly either, rising 22 percent, to $88.50, in the quarter.
By contrast, two of the quarter's worst performers among stocks that began the quarter at or above $5 a share provide an example of how fast a small stock can go down if its chief sponsor walks away.
U.S. Bridge had barely celebrated its first year as a public company in August when the State Street Capital Markets Corporation said it could no longer make a market in its favorite stocks, of which U.S. Bridge was one. U.S. Bridge was down 88.6 percent, to $1.28 a share during the quarter.
Not far behind was Cable & Company Worldwide, another stock whose chief supporter was State Street Capital. It was off 75.6 percent. State Street blamed short-sellers, who had bet heavily that the companies were overvalued.
On the Big Board, the best performer, the Providence Journal Company. was up 91.1 percent and got there the old-fashioned way, via a takeover offer from A. H. Belo at a big premium to market.
But it is the second-best performer, Applied Magnetics, a maker of magnetic recording heads used in computer drives, that in some ways best sums up the quarter. Shares of Applied Magnetics leaped 72.6 percent, to $18.125 in the quarter. But they had been pounded in the July selloff of technology stocks, and are still less than their May 1 high of $21.75.

HEADLINE: Minimum Wage, Minimum Effect;
Politics Aside, Economy Is Shrugging Off Rise to $4.75

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 30

 BODY:
When Gloria W. Robinson, the top economic development official for the City of Detroit, was asked for the names of local companies that paid the minimum wage, she had to stop and think.
Finally, she suggested Ace-Tex Enterprises, which sells rags for wiping up grease and other gunk from factory floors. But even in Detroit, one of the nation's poorest cities, just 26 of the 200 workers at Ace-Tex will get a raise in the next 24 hours, when the minimum wage increases to $4.75 an hour from $4.25. The rest earn more now, having graduated from such jobs as stuffing boxes with rags to the more skilled work of making specially coated sterilized cloths. 
 While many members of Congress have trumpeted the minimum-wage increase enacted into law in August as a boon to American workers, it is, in fact, a non-event for most. The number of wage earners who will get an immediate raise will be minuscule -- just 4.2 million, or 3.3 percent of all workers. Their lives may improve, but the impact on the overall economy will be negligible. Many economists predict small job losses -- 100,000 to 200,000 at most over two years in a work force of 126 million. Because so few earn the minimum wage, the inflationary jolt will amount to one-tenth or two-tenths of 1 percent this year, economists agree.
"The whole issue is overblown," said Barry P. Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, who said the higher minimum wage was just as unlikely to lead to layoffs as it was to move families out of poverty. Mr. Bosworth said a second increase mandated by the new law, to $5.15 next September, would not change the equation much, either, though it will mean raises for 5.4 million additional workers.
In past years, when more people were paid the minimum wage -- and when that level of pay went further toward meeting a family's needs -- the economic ripple effects of an increase were greater. Now, though, even in Detroit, where unemployment at 9.4 percent is nearly twice the national rate, much of the economy has moved beyond minimum-wage levels. McDonald's pays its hamburger flippers here at least $5.25 to start.
In Detroit, as elsewhere, small businesses will bear the brunt of the new law -- and, if the comments of the managers of a strip of shops along Woodward Avenue are any guide, these people are taking it very much in stride. Many say they will bump up their employees' wages even if they don't have to in order to keep them ahead of the lowest-paid workers.
Some of the merchants on the decaying strip that was once the retail heart of Detroit grumble that prices will have to go up, and others worry that customers will complain. But none of the managers interviewed plans to lay workers off, or even cut back their hours.
Emily J. Webster, co-owner of Detroit Hardware, said she would give each of her six part-time workers a 50 cent raise, to $6.50 an hour, by January. She predicted the same would be true of the companies that supply her store with brooms and nails, and that higher prices would inevitably result. "It is just a chain of events," Ms. Webster said. "The manufacturers will raise their prices, the distributors will raise their prices, then the retailers will raise their prices."
But Alex F. Martin, manager of Sibleys Shoes across the street, shrugged off the wage increase as unimportant. "Business just has to go on," he said.
Rather than eliminate jobs, employers said they would adjust other aspects of their business equation to compensate for higher labor costs. "It will probably just cut out into the profits a little bit," said Tony C. Collins, manager of nearby Value Village, which sells secondhand clothes, books and toys and most of the 35 employees earn the minimum wage. "I don't think it will affect the business at all."
George Randall, manager of the Turkey Grill, where a smoked turkey sandwich sells for $3.89, said he would have to raise prices to offset the raises five of his nine workers will get as the result of the new law. He fears that some customers will be upset because his company's reputation is built in part on its reasonable prices. "I would just hope that they would accept it," Mr. Randall said.
If local businesses are figuring on small price increases but planning to keep their work forces intact, they are following the script laid down by economists. David L. Littmann, a senior economist at Comerica Bank, predicted a decline of only about 600 jobs in Detroit over the next two years as the result of the increase. "That's because times are about as good as they can be," he said.
For the workers on the bottom rungs of the economic ladder, however, the new law makes a real difference, even if it won't be enough to lift them up from poverty. At Ace-Tex, Sherry Wells, 32, a single mother whose $4.40 an hour will rise to $4.75, said that for her, it means that "you can look forward to your next paycheck."
"Things now are a lot higher," Ms. Wells said. "If you want to pay your phone bill, you just budget." As she used a machine to cut white cloth into two-foot-square strips, Ms. Wells explained that she planned to spend part of her raise on $8 haircuts for Darius, her 6-year-old son.
Ms. Wells, a high school graduate who had a year of college, is one of the lowest-paid workers at Ace-Tex's high-ceiling, brown brick building, which was designed early in this century by Albert Kahn, a famed Detroit architect. The building, surrounded by a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire, sits near a boarded-up factory and across the street from an abandoned house. In such dismal surroundings, it seems almost incongruous that Ace-Tex pays so many of its workers well over the minimum wage.
In the Detroit suburbs, it is even harder to find workers earning just $4.25. At McDonald's in Madison Heights, Mich., the manager, Michelle M. Zweng, said she had given no thought to the minimum-wage increase because her lowest-paid workers earn $5.25 an hour.
Nearby, at the Oakland Mall, clerks at the Kay-Bee toy store start at $6 an hour. Lisa D. Rytlewski, assistant manager at the Loop, a jewelry and ear-piercing store in the mall, said it was hard to find even part-timers willing to accept jobs that pay only 75 cents an hour more than the minimum wage. When told that jobs at the Loop start at $5 an hour -- the older college students just laugh, Ms. Rytlewski said.
In Washington, proposals to increase the minimum wage typically foster fierce debate, with business groups and many economists warning of the danger of mass layoffs and liberals arguing that the poor need more money to make ends meet. Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich, defending the latest increase, bristles at the notion that it would not make much difference to workers making the lowest wages.
"It is easy for commentators to pooh-pooh the significance of an $1,800-a-year raise," Mr. Reich said. "But when you are earning $8,500, that raise is far from insignificant."
While many members of Congress seemed eager to vote for the popular proposal in an election year, that is not the only reason the fight over the minimum wage was less vicious in this time.
The minimum wage in inflation-adjusted dollars has fallen over the decades, and with it, the fraction of all workers who earn it. "It used to be that every McDonald's worker was paid the minimum wage," said Diane C. Swonk, an economist at First Chicago NBD Bank in Chicago. Labor Department data show that the percentage of workers earning the minimum wage has fallen from 8.9 percent in 1980 to a fraction of that today.
But by the same token, the falling value of the minimum wage has kept those who earn it mired in poverty. The minimum wage would have to jump to $7.80 an hour to lift workers to the poverty level of $15,600 for a family of four.
"It was much more difficult to pass when the minimum wage meant something," Ms. Swonk said. This year, "everyone kind of sat back and yawned."
The Rev. Bill Cunningham, who runs Focus Hope, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping the poor in Detroit, said that society should pay more attention to training workers than to setting a wage floor. "The poor are really people without training and skills," he said. "They are not just people without jobs."
Indeed, at the low end of the wage scale, even full-time workers earning more than the minimum wage struggle to get by. Melonise T. Williams, 22, earned the minimum wage when she started work at Ace-Tex two years ago. The high school graduate now earns $5.03 an hour to stuff 50 pounds of finished rags into cardboard boxes and label them for shipping to factories.
Ms. Williams has managed to support her two young daughters -- 7-month-old Diamond and 3-year-old Sharae -- by living with her mother and eagerly working overtime. But even with the extra few thousand dollars provided by the Federal earned-income tax credit, ends don't quite meet for many of the working poor like her.
For baby formula, for instance, she relies on a Federal food program. The assistance "comes in handy because that stuff is high," Ms. Williams said. The brand she uses costs $6 for a 13-ounce can. Without the aid, Ms. Williams would work an hour and 12 minutes for a single can.
Whatever the debate in Washington, some Detroit-area executives and managers said they are actually glad the minimum wage is going up.
"The minimum wage is too low for employees," said Vinnie Johnson, chief executive of Piston Packaging, a Detroit company that makes cardboard boxes, and sorts and sequences parts for auto makers. "You can't survive on that." Mr. Johnson, a retired Detroit Pistons basketball player, said he starts all his employees at $6 an hour and moves them quickly up to $8.
"You want your employees to be happy," he said, "and if they put in a good day's work, they should be paid fairly for it."
Many workers earning the minimum wage have already learned that education is their ticket to the middle class.
Wanda L. Mitchell, 20, who serves frozen yogurt and soft drinks at Harry's, a soda stand in Oakland Mall, is one of the few workers at the mall who is paid the minimum wage. Her weekly check will rise by $14, to $131, starting Tuesday. It doesn't sound like much, but the extra $728 a year will help pay her tuition at Wayne State University in Detroit, where she is studying full time toward a radiology degree.
"I want to keep trying to go full time so I can get out," she said -- "so I can make more money."

Graph: "Diminishing Returns"
 The economic impact of increases in the minimum wage has diminished with the shrinking purchasing power of the base wage and the steady decline -- outside of recessions -- in the ranks of those who earn it. Still, large numbers of some subgroups in the labor force are paid the minimum, or less.
 Graphs track the minimum wage in nominal dollars and adjusted for inflation, since 1955. Also tracked is the percentage of hourly workers at or below the minimum wage, as a percentage of the total number of wage and salary workers. The latter graph runs from the late-1970's to the present. Other percentage figures are supplied for various subgroups in the workforce. (Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics)

CORRECTION-DATE: October 3, 1996, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the financier George Soros's pledge of $50 million to help legal immigrants in the United States referred incorrectly to his humanitarian assistance in Bosnia. He offered $50 million in aid in December 1992, suspended it in May 1993 in protest over Western inaction and resumed it in July 1993.

HEADLINE: New York Wines: Bigger and Better

BYLINE: By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
AS New York winegrowers harvest their grapes, they are benefiting from political and agricultural revolutions that have turned the state into a source of wines that often rival those from France and Germany.
In 1976, New York State had 19 wineries; today, it has more than 100. Its best wines are now based on Old World grapes rather than the native American grapes and French-American hybrids that once predominated. And sales, although still largely concentrated inside the state, are booming, many producers say. 
 In the two most important grape-growing regions, the Finger Lakes and Long Island, new wineries are opening, old ones are expanding their vineyards with European grapes, and owners are buying costly agricultural and cellar equipment. Change has been slower in the two other areas, the Hudson River region and the Lake Erie district, where fewer highly regarded wines are being produced.
There are no statistics on sales, and because most wineries are privately owned, the owners are reluctant to be specific. But judging from new plantings and beehive-like business activity in tasting rooms, many of the wineries appear to be profitable.
C. J. Britt, the senior vice president for agricultural lending at the National Bank of Geneva in Geneva, N.Y., verifies this observation. "The Finger Lakes wineries have become a potential source of new business for commercial lenders in the area," he said. "They are a tremendous growth opportunity for everyone here."
In 1995, the Yates County Chamber of Commerce found that nine producers in the Finger Lakes had total wine sales in their tasting rooms of $1.13 million in 1992, $1.65 million in 1993 and $2.24 million in 1994. In New York's wine regions, increased tourism has led to a surge in orders in recent years, producers say. The New York Wine and Grape Foundation, based in Penn Yan in the Finger Lakes, estimates that 900,000 tourists visit yearly.
On Long Island, wine estates are expanding. Most recently, Bidwell, in Cutchogue, invested $700,000 in upgrading its property, including $530,000 for a new tasting house that opened last summer, said Bob Bidwell, an owner. Sagpond, in Sagaponack, is building a new $2.5 million winery that is to open next year.
Are New York State's wines popular? It depends on who is asked. Morrell & Company on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, carries just three New York brands -- "an adequate supply for the demand I encounter," said Peter Morrell, the chairman. Sherry-Lehmann, a few blocks away, also has three. "Customers prefer to pay $7 for a Macon or St. Veran than $15 for a New York chardonnay," said Michael Aaron, the president.
But that's not so at McAdam Liquors, an East Side discounter that specializes in Long Island wines and promotes them aggressively. "We started selling a small number in September 1994, and now we offer everything we can get our hands on," said Bill Rudowski, the manager. The wines range from $7 to $35; the average price is $12.
Statewide, the biggest cluster of wineries, 52, is found on the shores of the principal Finger Lakes -- Cayuga, Seneca, Keuka and Canandaigua -- in a serene farm and vacation belt of awesome vistas and 1940's Americana. Long Island has 17; the Hudson Valley, 23, and the Lake Erie district, 7. The rest are spread across the state. Most offer tastings.
Prof. Richard P. Vine, who teaches enology at Purdue University and buys all the wines served on American Airlines, has judged New York wines in six contests run by the Wine and Grape Foundation, which was established in 1985 and sponsors the "Uncork New York" campaign. "In competitions nationwide, New York vintners are being judged by their peers to be among the best in this country," he said.
Wines like those of 10-year-old Palmer on Long Island, 11-year-old Millbrook in Dutchess County in the Hudson Valley and 5-year-old Lamoreux Landing on Seneca Lake are increasingly taking gold and silver medals in national competitions.
"The Finger Lakes are a good source of cool-climate whites," Professor Vine said. "Long Island merlot is competitive with better labels in Northern California and eastern Washington."
Lake Erie, in a sea of Concord grapes, is mainly grape juice country. In the Hudson Valley, the wide dispersal of the wineries has worked against forging a collective identity.
In the valley, Millbrook's chardonnay and cabernet franc are getting high marks, and the crisp seyval blanc still and sparkling wines at Clinton Vineyards (made from a hybrid grape) have been best sellers for years. In the Lake Erie district, consumers cannot get enough of the Johnson Vineyards Liebestropfchen, a late-harvest dessert wine made from the Delaware grape.
Taken together, a string of deregulatory laws, a cooperative State Liquor Authority and competition from California, Oregon, Washington and foreign producers have motivated New York growers to strive for world-class wines.
The vineyard revolution began in the mid-1950's in the Finger Lakes. It reoriented the industry toward wines made from European vinifera grapes like chardonnay and merlot and de-emphasized wines made from American juice-and-jelly fruit like Niagara and Concord and from French-American hybrids like seyval blanc and baco noir.
Other gains are due partly to the Farm Winery Act signed by Gov. Hugh L. Carey in 1976, which drove a wedge into the legacy of Prohibitionism and enabled farmers to set up their own wineries.
The fortunes of the state's wine industry, which dates to the mid-1800's, had plummeted because of an anti-alcohol mindset in Albany that, after Prohibition ended in 1933, discouraged production and consumption, and because of consumers' notion that New York wines were primarily sweet, heavy and simple at a time when dry and complex wines were coming into vogue.
John S. Dyson, Governor Carey's Secretary of Agriculture and Markets, helped engineer passage of the Farm Winery Act. He had not planned a career in wine, but in 1985 he founded Millbrook in a dairy barn; it is now the Hudson Valley's flagship winery. Armed with a degree in agricultural economics from Cornell University, Mr. Dyson became a disciple of Dr. Konstantin Frank, an iconoclastic viticulturist.
Defying the conventional wisdom that only native grapes and hardy French-American hybrids could survive the Finger Lakes winters, Dr. Frank proved that European grapes could flourish. Vinifera Wine Cellars, which Dr. Frank established in 1962 on Rhine-like heights over Keuka Lake in Hammondsport, is now run by his son, Willy, and has become one of the state's, and the East's, top wineries. Chateau Frank, on the same grounds, makes three sparkling wines that can rival prestigious ones from Champagne. A big Manhattan distributor, Paramount, recently took on Frank wines as well as Glenora, a 19-year-old Seneca Lake house specializing in sparkling wine.
Finger Lakes wineries are at a competitive disadvantage. Because of limited inventories and the six-hour trip to Manhattan, they cannot easily supply stores and restaurants that insist on next-day deliveries. Anthony Road and Hunt Country, estates run by Finger Lakes families, have jointly sold their wines in the Union Square Greenmarket for years. But most Finger Lakes wineries sell in their tasting rooms and in nearby markets like Buffalo, Corning, Rochester and Syracuse.
Since 1979, the sophisticated dry, semidry and sweet rieslings made by the German-born Hermann J. Wiemer have shown that Finger Lakes rieslings can equal those from Germany, Alsace and Austria. And critics are comparing the light-bodied chardonnays from the Finger Lakes to those from Macon and Chablis in France.
Other promising producers in the Finger Lakes include Standing Stone, a tiny three-year-old house, where David B. Whiting, 33, is turning out remarkable dry and semidry whites. His austere and elegant rieslings, chardonnays and gewurztraminers are sold in a plain white tasting room that was upgraded from a chicken coop.
Dr. Frank's Rkatsiteli, Fox Run's Ruby Vixen, Hunt Country's Vidal ice wine, Knapp's Pasta Red, Lakewood's White Catawba and Wagner's Delaware, Melody and Niagara can be treats. They are cash cows that subsidize the costly production of vinifera wines.
The Canandaigua Wine Company, the nation's second-biggest producer after Gallo, is a major player in the Finger Lakes as a grape buyer, but its Manischewitz kosher and Taylor Lake Country lines are not usually perceived as premium New York wines. The same is true of the Brooklyn-based Royal Wine Corporation, whose Kedem kosher wines are made in the Hudson Valley.
Bully Hill, with a 220,000-case capacity, is the biggest Finger Lakes producer of hybrid wines. Its high-end competitors deplore the low-end impression it makes, but they take seriously the under-$8 prices its 53 labels fetch.
Long Island was pioneered as a wine region in 1973 when Louisa and Alex Hargrave, ardent Francophiles, put vines into potato fields at their Hargrave Vineyard in Cutchogue on the North Fork. Today, Suffolk County's 17 producers and 1,600-plus acres of vines yield 150,000 to 200,000 cases a year.
The biggest, Pindar, a mini-Gallo on the North Fork, will produce 82,000 cases from the 1995 vintage.
On the East End, wine lovers can find not only Bordeaux-like merlots and cabernet sauvignons, but also barrel-fermented Burgundian chardonnays, charming pinot blancs and a few top-notch pinot noirs.
Although such outstanding North Fork producers as Bedell, Hargrave, Lenz, Palmer, Paumanok and Pellegrini have cajoled their way into some stores and restaurants in Manhattan, most still sell 75 percent or more of their wines out the front door. Although their wines have gained fans, most New York producers lack nationwide recognition, and few are willing to invest to distribute nationally. (A handful of premium wineries have customers outside the state, and the Wine and Grape Foundation's four-year-old export program has helped create niches in Canada, Sweden and Britain.)
"We don't yet have sufficient demand for distributors to justify the costs of adding our labels to their already heavy portfolios," said James Trezise, the foundation's president. "It's a chicken-and-egg situation."

Tastings, From Cayuga Lake to Cutchogue
FOLLOWING is a list of wineries whose products are among the best in New York State, along with a comment about what visitors will see at each. Prices are approximate. Local merchants are usually willing to order a half or full case from any winery. And most producers will fill credit-card orders for in-state buyers. Shipping to many states is illegal.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Finishes Mostly Higher Despite Monetary Union Spat

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly higher yesterday, overcoming a French-Italian spat over Europe's single-currency plan, which briefly bolstered the mark.
Traders attributed the dollar's strength to underlying demand for the currency, as well as a boost it received from a weekend meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers from the richest industrial countries, who called for a strong dollar. 
 "I think everyone seems fairly happy with the dollar," said Roger Chapin, foreign exchange manager at Bank One in Columbus, Ohio.
In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.5260 marks, from 1.5245 marks on Monday. The British pound weakened to $1.5645 from $1.5650.
The dollar slipped against the yen, from 111.40 to 111.33, as traders sold dollars to lock in profits from the currency's rally above the 111-yen barrier on Monday. Nonetheless, the dollar remains at its highest level against the yen since January 1994.
"The dollar's made a reasonable move up, and it's understandable that we'll do some consolidating at current levels," said Tom Hoge, vice president of corporate trading at the Bank of New York. "The dollar remains well bid and probably should go higher."
The dollar traded at its lows of the day during European dealings, when the mark strengthened after President Jacques Chirac of France publicly questioned whether Italy could meet the stringent requirements for joining the European Union's planned single currency in 1999.
While countries like France and Germany are trying to improve their financial conditions, he told reporters, "It may take a bit longer for those who are behind, like Italy."
Italian officials reacted furiously in what appeared to be the most serious instance of high-level bickering among key participants in the currency plan. Although the mark retreated later in the day, the French-Italian argument reflected "a potential bump in the road toward European monetary union," said Robert Katz of the MTB Bank Corporation in New York.
Others said the dollar's gains were tempered by National Association of Purchasing Management's report showing a manufacturing slowdown last month. Traders were awaiting the report on September unemployment Friday for more insights into the economy's direction.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Higher On 2 Reports

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday, as weaker-than-expected manufacturing and retail sales reports helped ease the concerns of investors that the economy might be growing fast enough to accelerate inflation, which would lead the Federal Reserve to push up interest rates.
The 30-year bond gained 18/32 , to a price of 9815/32 to yield 6.87 percent, down from 6.92 percent on Monday. 
 Larry Berman, a senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said that he had expected yesterday's National Association of Purchasing Management index of manufacturing activity to come in at 53; instead, the index fell to 51.7 in September, from 52.6 in August. A reading above 50 often signals an expanding economy, while a reading below 50 signals a contraction.
Adding to the day's positive trend for the credit markets was the weekly Redbook retail sales report for the period ended Sept. 28. It fell four-tenths of 1 percent, after declining three-tenths of 1 percent the week before. The slower sales renewed the confidence of market participants that inflation was not about to accelerate.
Elsewhere, traders said the market received a psychological lift in the afternoon after a report in the Australian Financial Review quoted Australia's Treasurer, Peter Costello, as having said that based on a recent conversation with the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, he had the impression that Mr. Greenspan did not see inflation as a near-term problem. Some traders may have taken that to mean that the Fed may not consider raising rates in November.
"I'm excited about how things are happening," Mr. Berman said. "Technically the market is reacting great. On a longer term we are seeing a strong base in the market, with the yield level on the long bond at 7.25 percent.
"So unless we see signs of inflation soon," Mr. Berman said, "I would say between now and the December Federal Open Market Committee meeting, we may be looking at the beginning of another bull market."
Maury Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., discussing the purchasing managers' report, noted that while the overall index of industrial sector business conditions slipped, there was a decline in the vendor delivery lead times -- a favorite of Mr. Greenspan -- and a modest rise in the prices paid component. "On balance," Mr. Harris said, "the mixed September N.A.P.M. report did not portray an overheated economy badly in need of a dose of Federal Reserve tightening of short-term interest rates."
In the municipal market, Denver led yesterday's $1.3 billion sale of municipal bonds with a $279.6 million offering through underwriters led by Lehman Brothers.
The offering, which is insured by the Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation, is rated AAA, and because of good investor demand underwriters were able to sell the securities at a higher price and lower yields. Series C bonds were priced to yield from 4.65 percent in 1998 to 5.85 percent in 2013, while the series D securities, which consist of two maturities, were priced to yield 5.875 percent for a bond due in 2016 and 5.83 percent for a maturity in 2025.

Elderly people and poor people who are chronically ill tend to fare worse in health maintenance organizations, which pay a flat rate for each patient, than in conventional insurance plans, which pay doctors for each service, researchers reported today.
The researchers, led by John E. Ware Jr. of the New England Medical Center in Boston, said that for average patients there was no particular difference between the outcomes of treatment by H.M.O.'s and fee-for-service plans. 
 But in today's Journal of the American Medical Association, they wrote, "Patients who were elderly and poor were more than twice as likely to decline in health in an H.M.O." as in a fee-for-service plan.
The researchers said their findings, based on observation of 2,235 patients in Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles, should send "a cautionary note to policy makers."
In the last few years many Federal and state officials and members of Congress have decided to direct poor people into H.M.O.'s to help save money for Medicaid. Members of Congress from both parties have also suggested that greater use of H.M.O.'s is necessary to shore up the finances of Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. Until last year, costs in the two programs were rising about 10 percent a year.
Over all, more than 60 million Americans are in H.M.O.'s. Nationwide, enrollment grew by an average of nearly 500,000 a month in the last three years.
The American Association of Health Plans, which represents H.M.O.'s, took issue with Dr. Ware's study. Karen M. Ignagni, president of the association, said the findings were at odds with recent research showing that chronically ill people who were elderly or poor had received excellent care in H.M.O.'s. The quality of care in such prepaid health plans is at least as good as that in fee-for-service plans, she said.
But Prof. Sara Rosenbaum, director of the Center for Health Policy Research at George Washington University, said: "The new findings are consistent with a long line of research showing that poor people with health problems tend to do worse in prepaid health plans. The results tell me that we are going much too fast in converting Medicaid to a managed-care program. We are going faster than H.M.O.'s can accommodate. Whether it's good policy is not the issue. The market may not be ready for these patients -- sick low-income and elderly populations."
Dr. Ware and his colleagues studied adults with chronic illnesses, including high blood pressure, diabetes and congestive heart failure. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 97, with an average just under 58. Slightly more than half were women. The researchers classified patients according to whether there was a change for the better or the worse in their "health status": what they were able to do in everyday life and how they felt physically or mentally.
The researchers followed patients for at least four years. Collection of data began in 1986 and ended in the early 1990's. Some H.M.O.'s say they have stepped up efforts to improve the quality of care in recent years.
The authors noted that chronically ill patients who are elderly or poor "account for a disproportionate share of health care expenditures and are therefore prime targets of cost containment."
Fifty-four percent of the elderly H.M.O. patients and 28 percent of the elderly fee-for-service patients experienced some decline in physical health, the researchers reported.
Low-income patients also fared worse in H.M.O.'s than in fee-for-service health plans, the researchers said. For poor patients who initially had some type of illness, 22 percent of those in H.M.O.'s and 57 percent of those in fee-for-service plans showed improvements in physical health.
For years, H.M.O.'s have emphasized preventive and routine care to keep people healthy. In recent years H.M.O.'s have asserted that they are just as good as fee-for-service insurance for patients who need specialty services like cancer care, neurosurgery and orthopedic surgery. Moreover, H.M.O.'s say they attract a true cross-section of the elderly, not a healthier group of patients, as Medicare officials contend.
Dr. Ware said that "patients who were younger, relatively healthy and relatively well off financially did at least as well in H.M.O.'s as in the fee-for-service plans."
Dr. Paul M. Ellwood Jr., the health policy analyst who coined the term "health maintenance organization" in the early 1970's, and Dr. George D. Lundberg, editor of the A.M.A. journal, assessed recent trends in an editorial accompanying the report.
"There is good reason to be hopeful" about these trends, which let consumers choose from many health plans, the editorial said. But it added, "We have no assurances that the competition of such plans in the current market will reward those who deliver higher quality care."
Indeed, the editorial said: "We have no evidence that the economic success of these plans is being affected by their clinical performance. Purchasers and consumers have not, so far, rewarded or punished plans based on quality."

HEADLINE: Apple Officer Sees Return to Profitability

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif. Oct. 1

 BODY:
The chief financial officer of Apple Computer Inc. said today that the company could return to profitability as soon as December as a turnaround plan improves Apple's gross margin.
"We are still confident we can return to profitability no later than March," the executive, Fred Anderson, said in an interview. "Could it happen sooner than that? Yes." Apple had previously said it would be profitable by the end of March. 
 Shares of Apple rose $2.44, to $24.625, in Nasdaq trading.
Apple has had three consecutive quarters of losses, its worst financial performance ever. It is struggling to recover from forecasting mistakes, manufacturing problems, weak demand and crippling management turmoil that scared off customers earlier this year.
But the company has already shown signs of a recovery. In the third quarter, Apple reported a narrower-than-expected third-quarter loss of $32 million, or 26 cents a share. The loss was reduced by a gain of $39 million, or 31 cents, on the sale of Apple's investment in America Online Inc.
Mr. Anderson also said today that more people were leaving the company on their own, and that Apple might not need to spend as much money on severance. Apple took a charge of $207 million to cover the costs of getting rid of 2,800 workers.
Apple started the fiscal year with 17,500 workers, Mr. Anderson said, and the company now has about 13,500.
The company is losing employees in some of the areas that needed to be cut, including manufacturing, he said. The losses are not indicative of a "brain drain" that would rob Apple of its most valuable workers, he said.

HEADLINE: Economic Signs Are Mixed As Manufacturing Slows

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
There were more mixed economic signs yesterday as a closely watched manufacturing report showed slower momentum but a forecasting tool reached another high.
The National Association of Purchasing Management's index fell to 51.7 percent in September from 52.6 percent in August. A reading above 50 percent is a sign of an expanding industrial economy. 
 The Conference Board said its Index of leading economic indicators rose two-tenths of 1 percent in August, its seventh consecutive gain, but on par with analysts' expectations.
Wall Street took the reports as positive, sending stock and bond prices higher.
On Monday, reports showed August had the highest level of new- home sales in more than 10 years and solid gains in personal income and consumer spending. Those surveys rekindled concerns the economy might not be slowing enough to avoid an interest rate increase when the Federal Reserve holds its next policy-making meeting on Nov. 13, after the Presidential election.
"I think the market has been kind of seesawing back and forth between a strong economy and a soft economy," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. "I think this pattern will continue until probably after the election."
Last week, the Fed decided not to raise interest rates to head off inflation, apparently believing that the economy was slowing on its own and not threatening a resurgence of higher inflation.
The purchasing managers' report said prices paid by manufacturers increased for the first time in four months, with its price index rising from 47.4 percent in August to 51.2 percent in September.
The decline in the overall N.A.P.M. index was unexpected. Wall Street had been looking for a slight gain to about 53 percent.
The purchasing managers' figures are closely watched on Wall Street because its survey is one of the first key indicators of September economic performance. The leading index, in contrast, relies on August data.
Elliott Platt, director of economic research at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation , said the purchasing managers' report tended to confirm the economy was advancing at a moderate pace. Inflation is generated by a fast-growing economy.
In addition to its reading on the manufacturing sector, the N.A.P.M. index indicated the overall economy had expanded for the eighth straight month. An index reading above 44.5 percent suggests overall growth.
Other components of the N.A.P.M. report, based on responses to survey questions of purchasing executives at more than 300 industrial companies: The production index fell to 54.1 percent, from 57.0 percent in August, and the new orders index rose to 56.3 percent from 55.6 percent.
"The increases in the price and new orders indexes and the decreases in the supplier deliveries, employment and production indexes give a mixed indication of the direction of manufacturing activity in September," said Ralph G. Kauffman, chairman of the N.A.P.M.'s business survey committee.
In addition to the rise in the index of leading economic indicators' August reading to 103.3, two sister indexes, the coincident and lagging indexes, also gained in August.
The index is designed to forecast economic activity six to nine months in advance. It is seen by economists, however, as most useful in forecasting the economy's direction rather than its pace.

HEADLINE: At Work, Injuries and Bitterness;
Labor Strife and Amputations Roil a Plastics Factory

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: SOLVAY, N.Y.

 BODY:
Valerie Yerdon talks in a flat voice with no hint of emotion, describing how she lost the middle finger and index finger of her right hand.
She was cleaning the side of a printing press with a rag when the press's high-speed rollers pulled in the rag, and her fingers along with it. 
 "They were so mangled there was no way they could be reattached," said Ms. Yerdon, a printing press technician at Landis Plastics, which makes containers for Cool Whip, Breyer's yogurt and Philadelphia cream cheese.
Thankful that she is back on the job, Ms. Yerdon, 32, declines to fault her employer. But many of her co-workers, along with some clergymen and safety experts, have harsh words for Landis's safety record and other unpleasant aspects of work there, like managers inspecting workers' mouths to check whether they are chewing gum.
In the last 15 months, police reports show, three other employees at the 200-worker factory have lost fingers on the job. According to factory records, during the last year, a fourth of the plant's predominantly female work force has missed work because of job-related injuries, including fractures and back sprains.
Not only that, the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration is investigating Landis for failing to report many injuries in its safety logs, as required by law.
"A lot of girls are scared to work there," said Kathy Saumier, who trains workers at the plant in this gritty village of 6,718 just west of Syracuse.
This is not at all what Solvay residents expected when three years ago, village officials and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo announced plans to build a plastics plant in Solvay. The factory provided hope for a village whose economy had been on life support since 1986, when Allied Chemical's huge, century-old soda ash plant, which paid 47 percent of Solvay's taxes, closed, and dismissed 1,400 workers.
According to state safety figures, the amputation rate at Landis is almost 100 times higher than at a typical New York factory. The most recent amputation occurred in August, when, on her fourth day of work, Wendy Bibbs lost her left pinky as she reached into a printing press to remove some trapped container lids. In June, Craig Roberts lost the tip of a finger while cleaning the drum of a printing press that unexpectedly started operating at full speed.
Lynn Golash, executive director of the Central New York Council on Occupational Safety and Health, said: "The accident rate is very high. There's no way it should be happening."
Stephen Ellis, the mechanical engineer who runs the plant, insists that Landis is continually taking steps to improve safety.
In a written response, approved by Landis's lawyers, to a reporter's questions, Mr. Ellis said, "The company made every effort possible during the design of its equipment, and the development of the guarding equipment, to insure a safe operation."
Discussing the amputations, he added, "In light of the variety of circumstances under which these four incidents occurred, and the different causal factors, the company does not believe its safety program is subpar. In a perfect world, we would not expect a single accident, and given our choice, none would have occurred."
The company announced yesterday that it has hired a consultant, Oshex Associates, to improve its safety performance.
Though Landis's factory floor is spotless, brightly lighted and full of shiny new injection molding machines, many workers call it a modern-day sweatshop, and safety problems are just part of it. Landis, a family-owned, Chicago-based company, has developed such a reputation as a renegade employer that every Thursday members of Syracuse's labor-clergy coalition pray outside the one-story ribbed-concrete factory, prompting company supporters to stage their own demonstration.
Landis gives demerits to workers, many of them single mothers, when they leave work to go to emergency rooms when their children are injured. To keep workers from chewing gum, which they fear might fall into yogurt containers, supervisors pat down workers' pockets and order them to open their mouths.
Ms. Saumier and several other workers said managers have told them that the entry-level jobs packing plastic cups into crates are for women and higher-paying technical jobs are reserved for men. Lorraine Baker, a packer, and other workers complained that their health insurance was canceled days after they were put on disability leave.
The National Labor Relations Board has charged Landis with breaking the law by dismissing and punishing workers who asked the steelworkers' union to organize the plant.
James Valenti, the steelworkers' official heading the unionization drive, said: "In my 20 years of doing this, I have never seen an employer that holds its workers in such contempt in so many areas: in safety, workers comp, sick leave, hiring, sex discrimination. It's total contempt across the board."
On nonsafety matters like discrimination, Mr. Ellis says union supporters are lying and distorting the facts. He also says Landis is a better employer than most, paying more than many nearby companies and offering an array of benefits, including a 401(k) plan and health and dental benefits. In addition, the company denies improperly terminating workers' health insurance or dismissing workers because they support unionization.
While giving a visitor a tour, Mr. Ellis said: "When people tell me I don't care when my employees get hurt, I take offense. I care about being part of the community. If all that these people say is true, I wouldn't be here."
Although Landis pays far less than what it promised local officials it would pay, which was -- $13 an hour plus $7 to $12 in benefits, Mrs. Baker happily gave up her $5-an-hour waitress job to work as an inspector-packer at Landis. The lure: an hourly wage of $6.50, rising to more than $8 after two years.
"They made it sound like paradise in there," Mrs. Baker said. "Boy, was I wrong."
She has been out out of work for 16 weeks, awaiting an operation for carpal tunnel syndrome. Ten-inch-long braces cover her wrists, which are often numb. Her injury, she says, was caused by turning thousands of stacks of plastic containers around each day to inspect for defects.
Her job, the most common at the plant, is at once high pressure and monotonous. She would remove plastic containers from the molding machines, twirl them around to inspect them, stack them into cardboard boxes and carry the boxes, weighing 25 to 44 pounds, to a conveyor belt 15 feet away.
The lifting takes a toll. Marcella Mauro has been out of work since she sprained her back two months ago when the top of a crate she was carrying popped open, and something popped in her back as she sought to stabilize the box.
As evidence of how Landis filled out its OSHA safety logs improperly, Mrs. Mauro noted that the logs said she missed no days of work because of her back injury. Photocopies of the logs, provided by a lawyer for the union, show that when Landis listed Valerie Yerdon's amputation in January, officials merely wrote "right hand," even though Federal rules specify that the word "amputation" should be used to describe such an injury.
The photocopies show that six months after Ms. Yerdon's accident, and only after a steelworkers' lawyer sought copies of the logs, Landis officials altered them to describe Ms. Yerdon's injury as "right hand mangled." Copies of the logs show that more than a dozen accidents last winter and spring had been omitted for months before being listed this summer.
"There was a deliberate effort to hide things from Federal regulators," said Mairead Connor, a lawyer for the steelworkers' union, which played a major role in bringing Landis's safety problems to light. State officials say the State Attorney General is investigating charges that Landis repeatedly failed to inform the Workers Compensation Board within 10 days of employee injuries, as state law requires. With government regulators beginning to look into Landis, its lawyers filed about 60 injury notices in August, some going back two years.
Mr. Ellis said, "While the union has accused the company of not submitting forms to the State of New York in a timely manner, the fact is every employee injured on the job received first-class medical care and lost-time compensation -- all at the company's expense."
Some employees blame the amputations on inadequate training and inadequate guard mechanisms in the printing presses to keep fingers out. Others say the machines operate so fast that the workers can not think straight, especially toward the end of a 12-hour shift.
Management's supporters have a different explanation. Terri Komuda, an administrative assistant, pointed to carelessness by workers who have little experience with machinery.
"At home, you know not to stick your fingers in a running blender," she said. "But sometimes you have freak accidents."
Rabbi Daniel Jezer, co-chairman of the labor-religion coalition, said such an explanation was blaming the victim. "The plant needs to be constructed in such a way," he said, "and training has to be done in such a way so that if you know you have a population vulnerable to accidents, management will build in safeguards to minimize the risks."
Auxiliary Bishop Thomas J. Costello of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Syracuse said what particularly disturbed him was Landis's demerit system, which penalizes workers who face family emergencies.
That happened to Linda Murphy, who received a phone call in May telling her that her 3-year-old, Charlie, had scalded himself when a pot of soup spilled off the stove.
She said: "I told my supervisor, 'I got to go to the emergency room. My son's burned.' " She said, 'This is going to put you in the danger zone.' "
Mrs. Murphy entered the "danger zone" because she had accumulated three demerits in April for missing three days of work with a kidney infection. At Landis, workers receive a demerit for each day they miss work, no matter what the reason. Workers who receive 10 demerits are docked 50 cents an hour for three months; those who accumulate 15 can be dismissed.
Bishop Costello called this system arbitrary and inhumane, but Mr. Ellis defended it as a no-fault attendance policy that allows workers nine absences a year.
Mr. Ellis said, "We believe fairness to our employees requires us to tell employees in advance the number of absences we consider satisfactory."
Assemblywoman Catherine T. Nolan, a Queens Democrat who heads the Labor Committee, has scheduled a hearing for Oct. 2 about the Landis situation.
"The kind of exploitation that people associated with the underground economy has moved into the mainstream," she said. "Government is cutting back on the number of people who enforce workers' comp and job safety, and if you don't put resources there, it can produce problems like this. We're in a climate that says, 'We have to do everything we can to free up business,' but there has to be a balance between that climate and protecting workers."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICAN;
Dole Stages a Dress Rehearsal for the Debates

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: KIRTLAND, Ohio, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Bob Dole turned his attention today to next Sunday's Presidential debate, staging his first full-run practice session in Washington and using a speech here to test themes for the coming encounter.
Mr. Dole's speech, at a rally in a Cleveland suburb, along with a 15-minute kaffeeklatsch with a local family before a small pool of reporters and photographers, marked his first public campaign appearance in three days, a reflection of the importance he has attached to preparing for the debates. Aides said Mr. Dole would maintain the unusually light public campaign schedule through most of the week before retiring to his Florida condominium for two days of full-time debate preparation. 
 After five days of studying briefing books and videotapes of President Clinton's debate performances, Mr. Dole participated in his first mock debate today. The setting, a 10th-floor conference room at his campaign headquarters in Washington, was equipped with television lights and lecterns. Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, a former actor, played Mr. Clinton, while Nelson Warfield, the campaign's press secretary, played the questioner, who will be Jim Lehrer of PBS.
Mr. Dole's speech here, to an audience of mostly college students, marked the beginning of an effort to set the stage for the debate on Sunday in Hartford, testing themes he would like to use against his opponent while continuing the customary pre-debate effort to play down his own debating abilities.
To that end, Mr. Dole used remarks and props -- including what he called a "Consumers Guide to the Debate" and a floor-to-ceiling chart of numbers spelling out the benefits of his tax cut -- to remind his listeners of promises Mr. Clinton made in the 1992 debates and did not keep as President. Those included pledges to cut taxes for the middle class and to balance the budget.
"Those were the promises he made the last time he debated before a national audience. You know the story from there. Did anybody get that tax cut in this audience? No! Are you going to believe him next time he promises a tax cut? No!"
In both cases, Mr. Dole led the audience in answering his question.
"I just want to say, if you're listening to these debates, ask yourself this question," Mr. Dole said, reaching his conclusion. "Would you buy a used election promise from this man?" The young crowd roared back with a full-throated: "No!"
And Mr. Dole suggested, again, that his debating skills paled compared with Mr. Clinton's, notwithstanding his 35 years in Congress, and that the public should thus not hold high hopes for his performance. "We're going to have a little debate on Sunday night," Mr. Dole said. "I'm going to show up, and he is so good, if I show up, I think I will win."
In praising Mr. Clinton's debating strengths, Mr. Dole, who in recent days has argued that Mr. Clinton was a politically consistent liberal, returned to his earlier criticism that the President is politically pliant, which, he said, made him that much more difficult an opponent.
"He doesn't care what he says," Mr. Dole said. " He'll say it today and he'll believe it. He'll say something else tomorrow and he'll believe that."
Mr. Dole spoke at the Lakeland Community College here, in a gymnasium whose walls were plastered with "Trust Dole" signs. The lectern was decorated with a slogan evocative of his tax cut: "You earned it. You can keep it."
It was not one of Mr. Dole's easier rallies. From the start, it was disrupted by scuffles in the crowd as supporters of Mr. Clinton hoisted up Clinton-Gore signs, only to have them ripped out of their hands by Mr. Dole's aides and supporters before they were escorted out by security officers. As they were walked past bleachers filled with Mr. Dole's fans, a corner of the gym was swept by boos, which Mr. Clinton's supporters encouraged by hoisting their ripped Clinton-Gore signs. The heckling was directed at Mr. Clinton's operatives, but it competed with Mr. Dole's speech.
And as Mr. Dole delivered his remarks, confetti guns that were supposed to fire at the end of the speech were set off inadvertently by Mr. Dole's advance workers, filling the air with confetti and colored streamers. Mr Dole, who has seen his campaign speeches interrupted by miscues before, continued speaking.
Mr. Dole also stopped by the home of a local family for what had been advertised as a coffee discussion. It lasted about 15 minutes, and it was marked by a number of silences. Mr. Dole attempted briefly to explain his economic plan and then, gesturing to a coffee pot on a picnic table near an above-ground swimming pool, sought to change the subject. "Is there coffee in that pot?" he asked. There was, and Mr. Dole requested some.
 "Plain, half a cup," he said.

HEADLINE: Speaking Up for Immigrants

 BODY:
At a time of rising attacks on immigrants as a blight on American life, it is certainly fitting for the Mayor of New York City to stand up for the values symbolized by the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's recent criticism of the new Federal welfare law, which cruelly cuts off basic social services even to legal immigrants, is welcome because it springs from much more than tradition and a spirit of charity. Mr. Giuliani rightly argues that punishing immigrants is self-defeating. It violates basic constitutional principles and overlooks the valuable economic and social contribution that immigrants make every day.
Recent waves of immigrants have rescued neighborhoods throughout New York City, brought an entrepreneurial spirit that has spawned new enterprises and provided a pool of labor that has let established businesses grow and thrive. Since large portions of the white middle class have fled to the suburbs or elsewhere in the last 20 years, the major reason the city has not declined in population is an influx of new arrivals from the Caribbean, Asia and the former Soviet Union. For the most part, contrary to popular conception, these immigrant groups are not on welfare any more than the native-born portion of the population. 
 Much of the attention paid to the recently enacted welfare legislation focused on the work requirements and time limits imposed on poor families. But the $54 billion in savings required by the new law over the next five years entails cuts in the food-stamp program for all recipients and a denial of food stamps and other benefits to legal immigrants, except those who become citizens or have worked in the United States for 10 years. Since those very same immigrants pay taxes and contribute their work and energy to their communities, it is morally repugnant to change the rules after they have come to the United States and leave them no recourse if they become disabled or their families break apart.
Since neither the city nor the state can afford to spend the hundreds of millions of dollars it might take to make up for the losses in Federal support, Mr. Giuliani will have to follow up his criticism by pushing the next Congress to reverse the parts of the new welfare legislation that punish immigrants. Gov. George Pataki has also spoken out against the provisions that hurt immigrants. If he joins with Mr. Giuliani and other Republicans, they could be especially effective because they also enthusiastically support the work-requirement part of the law.
Until now, Mr. Giuliani has avoided the role that some of his predecessors staked out as national urban spokesmen. Voters in New York City have not always looked kindly to mayors who spend much time tending to politics outside the city's borders. But it is in the city's interest for Mr. Giuliani to address these issues nationally. With his record of lowering crime and putting welfare recipients to work, he has the standing to speak up for the immigrant tradition.
No doubt the Mayor is playing this role knowing that it might help him in the election next year. The City Planning Department estimates that there are about 2.3 million foreign-born people in New York City. Many are voters, and many more are likely to become voters because of the boom in naturalization that has been spurred by new laws affecting immigrants. But like many children and grandchildren of immigrants, Mr. Giuliani is obviously also speaking from the heart on the subject. As the Mayor of a city that has always thrived on each new wave of immigrants and through them renewed itself as a place of energy, competition and cultural variety, Mr. Giuliani may well be able to tip the balance against the self-destructive and xenophobic attitudes that other politicians have courted in the last few years.

HEADLINE: British Labor's New Model

 BODY:
Only a few years ago, Britain's Labor Party seemed locked into a decline as inexorable as that of the coal mines and smokestack factories whose workers built its ranks. Now it has rebounded to a healthy lead in the polls based on a modernized, middle-class platform far removed from the old Socialist themes of nationalization, union power and unilateral nuclear disarmament.
Having lost four consecutive national elections since 1979, Labor is determined to win the next one, due no later than next spring. Tony Blair, a telegenic, media-savvy 43-year-old who became the party's leader two years ago, has modeled himself on Bill Clinton and tried to capture the broad center ground on social, economic and defense issues. 
 Labor's recovery is welcome. Strong competition is invigorating to democracy, just as it is in the marketplace. Labor's updated positions calling for a flexible mix of public and private ownership and more democratic decision-making serve Britain better than those they replaced. Other Labor views are vague but appealing campaign slogans whose real meaning will become clear only if the party takes power.
British politics was transformed in the 1980's by Margaret Thatcher. Breaking sharply from the aristocratic traditions of the Conservative Party, she won over much of the upwardly mobile urban middle class with an emphasis on markets, deregulation and self-reliance. But under her chosen successor, John Major, the Tories have stumbled and been riven by internal conflicts over Britain's proper role in the developing European Union.
Americans would find Labor's campaign platform, which has been on display at this week's party conference, familiar ground. In place of the old Socialist slogans are calls for combating crime, cutting taxes and assuring business profits. Mr. Blair urged his union allies to "forget the past. No more bosses versus workers. You are on the same side."
He made a direct bid for the middle-class voters Mrs. Thatcher wooed away from Labor, reaching out to small business and the self-employed with promises of tax relief, reduced bureaucracy and tight fiscal discipline. He identified Labor as "the party of law and order" and pledged to sustain a strong national defense.
Labor's clearest difference with the Conservatives is its more positive approach to the European Union. But even here the party is cautious, stressing Labor's commitment to national independence and opposition to joining a "European superstate."
Throughout the developed world, the center-left parties that regularly elected governments in the 1960's and 1970's saw voters defect in large numbers during the 1980's and early 1990's. Most have tried to rebuild their strength by modernizing their appeal, and it makes sense for British Labor to seek lessons from Bill Clinton's campaign successes.
Mr. Blair's success in broadening Labor's appeal seems real. The test now is whether he can hold this new base together in an election, and if Labor wins, in a new British government.

HEADLINE: Earlier, and Better, Education

 BODY:
A task force of the Carnegie Corporation has recommended that virtually all children in the United States be enrolled in a preschool program at age 3 to improve their prospects for success in school and, ultimately, in life. Unfortunately, the task force did not estimate the total cost of such a program or suggest who should pay the bill, so its proposal is less a call for immediate action than a sensible long-term goal that deserves serious attention from policy makers and parents.
Currently, about half of all 3- to 5-year-olds are enrolled in preschool programs, including Head Start, school-based prekindergarten programs, nursery schools and child care. The most recognizable model of a high-quality early-childhood development program is probably Head Start, which serves low-income children. The program helps inculcate educational and social skills in its young participants that can carry into elementary school. The children also receive health and nutritional services. At the same time, the program encourages parents' involvement and offers social services to families. 
 Most quality programs for preschool-age kids, whether run by private child-care givers or public entities, incorporate many of these elements. A report released earlier this year by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation's Center for the Future of Children emphasized the long-term educational and economic gains of good early-childhood programs. The report concluded that low-income children exposed to these programs have higher reading scores, are less likely to be held back a grade or put into expensive special-education classes and are more likely to graduate from high school than those who do not participate in them.
While such outcomes have been documented for low-income children, the Carnegie task force makes clear that all children would benefit from a good-quality preschool experience. The panel finds that the educational demands of a more competitive global society are higher than most American children are currently achieving. American youngsters are already falling behind students in many foreign countries by the fourth grade. With stronger skills coming into elementary school, they would probably do better.
The Carnegie task force recommends universal early-childhood development, but it has no universal prescription for how that should be achieved. What makes the most sense is to build on the range of programs that already exist, from Head Start to family day care, and simply expand them to cover the 47 percent of children who now have no preschool experience. That would allow each community to tailor programs to its own needs.
The task force estimates that 75 percent of the funding for existing early-education services is provided by families, but it leaves open for further analysis how much it would cost to cover all 3- to 5-year-olds and who should foot the bill. Even without a fixed number, this will undoubtedly be a multibillion-dollar, multi-year effort that should be shared among families and Federal, state and local governments. The task force has made a valuable contribution by highlighting the need for a firmer educational foundation for all the nation's children.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE RUNNING MATE;
Kemp Seeks To Narrow Gap With Women

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: TUCSON, Ariz., Oct. 1

 BODY:
From school choice to extra tax breaks to lower crime, Jack Kemp proffered a luxurious bouquet of pledges today in pursuit of the votes of women, who have tended to spurn the Dole-Kemp Republican Presidential ticket.
Speaking to more than 200 women at a Jewish community center in Tucson, Mr. Kemp promised that a Dole Administration would so reduce taxes that families could get by on one income, allowing mothers to stay home if they wished. He said that the capital gains tax would eventually be eliminated altogether and that the new tax code he and Bob Dole want to see written would help foster the new businesses that American women are increasingly founding. 
 "We will double the number of women-owned businesses," he told the receptive crowd.
Mr. Kemp even attempted to cast foreign policy in a feminine light, saying that a Dole Administration would apply the type of diplomacy that a mother would choose and not "bomb Baghdad without talking to someone," a reference to Mr. Clinton's decisions recently to bomb sites in northern Iraq.
With polls showing that American women -- even suburban housewives who traditionally vote Republican -- feel a lack of enthusiasm toward Mr. Dole, Mr. Kemp is scheduled to appear at a similar women's event in Connecticut on Thursday.
A Kemp campaign spokeswoman, Alixe Glen, said Mr. Kemp's courtship of women's votes was not a dramatic shift in policy, but added, "We do need to get our message out to the soccer moms and the suburban women."
Mr. Kemp painted the Republican Party as one of inclusion and compassion that wanted to help the poor by expanding the economy and moving social programs from Federal to local control.
He won applause by deriding he Department of Education as "the department of no education" and more when he declared, "We think the tax code stinks." He also won loud approval when he reassured a local woman who asked him whether a Dole Administration, in pursuit of lower, simpler taxes, would do away with the rule that allows homeowners to deduct the interest they pay on their mortgages.
"You can bank on it," he said in pledging that the mortgage deduction would be "absolutely sacrosanct" and that he would "personally tackle" any Treasury Secretary who tried to do away with it.

HEADLINE: Con Ed Offers To Hold Rates For Five Years

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
The Consolidated Edison Company yesterday proposed a five-year freeze on electric rates and radical changes in operations that would allow all customers to purchase power from other suppliers by 2003.
Con Edison is one of five utilities in New York State that were ordered by the State Public Service Commission on May 20 to file comprehensive plans by yesterday on how they would reduce electric rates and give customers more choice in buying power. 
 Although the commission urged the utilities to allow customers to begin buying from alternate suppliers by early 1998, the proposal by Con Edison would give only a small number, 5,600 of its three million customers, a choice by then.
The proposal for a rate freeze appeared to be an effort by Con Ed to show regulators that it had a plan to control costs, without following the state's timetable on offering a plan to give customers a choice of electrical suppliers. Regulators say that more choices will provide more pressure to keep costs in line, much as competition among long-distance companies has helped hold down telephone rates.
Eugene R. McGrath, the chairman of Con Ed, defended the utility's proposals, saying the company needed more time to explore the choice issue.
"A lot has to be learned," Mr. McGrath said. "We have to find out what kind of problems we're going to have with this."
Some customers, particularly larger commercial and industrial users, have been pressing the state to reduce electric rates quickly. The state has some of the highest rates in the nation, and some companies have threatened to move out of the state.
Con Edison's rates are exceeded by several utilities in Hawaii and by the Long Island Lighting Company. Lilco, which may be taken over by the state, was not required to file a plan yesterday for reducing rates.
The freeze proposed by Con Edison would lock in rates of about 13.5 cents a kilowatt hour. The national average rate last year was 7.2 cents a kilowatt hour.
Mr. McGrath said one reason rates were so high in the New York area was high local and state taxes on the utility, accounting for about 3.2 cents of Con Edison's costs.
Con Ed's proposal comes against a backdrop of across-the-board deregulation in the utility industry. Electric companies across the country are making plans to sell cheaper power as states like California open their markets to competition. And with New York and New Jersey having opened their markets for natural gas, the Brooklyn Union Gas Company agreed last month to lower its rates and then freeze them for three years to make itself more competitive.
The Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation, the New York State Electric and Gas Company, Orange and Rockland Utilities Inc. and the Central Hudson Gas and Electric Company have also filed proposals similar to Con Edison's for dealing with a competitive electricity market.
Niagara Mohawk Power, which has threatened to file for bankruptcy protection, was also exempted from the filing.
Under Con Edison's plan, customers would be able to buy electricity from competing suppliers. Con Edison, for a fee, would deliver the power to their businesses or homes over its transmission lines.
While the competition among power suppliers is expected to reduce electric rates for some customers, there are widespread concerns about reliability, about whether all customers would benefit equally and about whether outside suppliers could provide enough power during peak periods of demand.
In this competitive marketplace, most utilities are expected to sell or close many of their power plants, since customers would be buying power from suppliers that in turn would acquire it from the lowest-cost producers in many states.
Most utilities would retain their transmission systems and remain primarily responsible for delivering the power.
As a result, keeping the power flowing reliably will be a complex process, since many big changes have to made in tandem with others.
To show the complexity, Mr. McGrath displayed charts with more than 350 continuous steps that the utility would have to take over the next seven years to make the transition.
"We know how vital, how life-and-death critical, energy is to New York City, and we have to be very careful that we don't impact reliability." he said.
Mr. McGrath also said that Con Edison wanted to insure that one group of customers, like larger industrial and commercial users, would not be favored at the expense of others. In some states, like Michigan, utilities have given big rate reductions to industrial customers while increasing rates for smaller residential customers.
Currently, the average monthly bill for a residential customer of Con Edison is about $54.
To absorb the cost of flat rates, Mr. McGrath said, the utility would continue to reduce its work force of 16,100 by attrition. About 3,200 jobs have been cut in the last decade.
The proposals will be used as a guide by the Public Service Commission in its drive to deregulate the industry. As other states have moved ahead, the pressure has grown on New York to move faster.
California has moved the furthest, with the Governor having recently signed a law that will set up an elaborate system under which some customers will be able to buy electricity through a power pool by 1998.
The proposal by Con Edison would also enable the utility to form a holding company that could diversify into other power-related businesses.
Con Edison's proposal was praised yesterday by the Natural Resource Defense Council, an environmental group. Ashok Gupta, the energy economist for the group, noted that under its proposal Con Ed would continue to spend $50 million to $60 million a year on rebates and financing help for those who invest in lighting and appliances that use less energy. Many utilities, he said, have phased out such programs when cutting costs.
Larry Shapiro , senior lawyer for the New York Interest Research Group, said that his consumer group agreed with Con Edison that a gradual approach to more competition was the best course because of the uncertainty on how deregulation would affect consumers.
Among the issues, he said, is whether consumers who deal with outside marketers in the future would retain the protections they now have before a utility can cut off power in disputes over payment of bills.

HEADLINE: Chrysler Sets Sales Pace While G.M. Lags

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 1

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation's cars and trucks continued to outsell the rest of the auto industry while the General Motors Corporation reported another month of lackluster sales today.
Sales of Chrysler cars and trucks rose 22 percent in September, while sales at General Motors fell 2.1 percent from the period a year ago. Among the 10 auto makers reporting September results today, sales rose an average 4.9 percent over the period a year ago. 
 "Chrysler has gone through the roof," said Scott F. Merlis, the president of Merlis Automotive International, an independent automotive research firm based in Westport, Conn.
One reason, he said, is that Chrysler has had such success with its mini-vans and its Dodge Ram pickup trucks that those models have drawn customers into Chrysler showrooms, increasing sales of other car and truck lines as well. "When you get products this successful, there tends to be a halo over all products," Mr. Merlis said.
Robert J. Eaton, the chairman and chief executive of Chrysler, said, "The market continues to look very, very good for us."
Chrysler's car sales rose 17 percent last month, while sales of light trucks rose 24 percent. Analysts said the results were higher than expected. The company increased car sales slightly by offering rebates and discounted lease deals on certain models. Percentage calculations are based on a daily selling rate because there were 24 selling days last month but 25 selling days in September 1995.
At General Motors, car sales plunged 10 percent while truck sales rose 13 percent. Ronald L. Zarrella, the G.M. vice president in charge of sales, service and marketing, said sales should improve later this year when a number of redesigned 1997 midsize cars start appearing on showroom floors.
"Midsize models debuting in the coming months -- Pontiac Grand Prix, Buick Century and Regal, Oldsmobile Cutlass and Intrigue and Chevrolet Malibu -- give G.M. six all-new entries in this important segment," Mr. Zarrella said.
Three redesigned mini-vans will go on sale by the end of the year -- the Chevrolet Venture, Pontiac Trans Sport and the Oldsmobile Silhouette -- and those, along with a new model of the Cadillac, called the Catera, should further improve sales, Mr. Zarrella said.
Other auto makers reporting sales today were: Nissan, up 2.6 percent; Mitsubishi, up 18.5 percent; Subaru, up 15.8 percent; Isuzu, down 21.1 percent; Volvo, up 5.4 percent; Suzuki, up 70.6 percent; Kia, up 44.3 percent, and Land Rover, up 60.3.
The auto sales numbers provide one of the first glances at the performance of the nation's economy in September. Several auto executives and Wall Street analysts said that while the numbers showed some strength, they still suggested that Federal Reserve officials were correct in leaving short-term interest rates unchanged after their meeting on Sept. 24.
"From our vantage point, the economy looks very good -- we do not see any inflationary pressures," Mr. Eaton said. "We think the Fed did exactly the right thing," he said.
Auto analysts agreed. Mr. Merlis said, "There is no reason to believe there was any overheating."
Jeff K. Thredgold, chief business economist at Keycorp bank, said that the auto sales figures, taken with reports of modest declines in retail sales and slower spending plans by corporate purchasing managers, showed that the economy might have slowed enough so that an interest rate increase was not necessary. "The Fed probably made a good choice," he said.
Ronald A. Glantz, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., predicted that for the industry as a whole, the September sales rate would not pick up much from the sales pace earlier this summer. July and August combined turned in a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.1 million cars and light trucks, he said. He expects that by Thursday, when the Toyota Motor Corporation, the Honda Motor Company and the Ford Motor Company are scheduled to report their sales, the industry will turn in a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.3 million light vehicles.
"September sales certainly indicate that the economy isn't particularly vigorous," Mr. Glantz said. "Chrysler was stronger than I anticipated and G.M. was weaker."
Some auto dealers said sales were sluggish. Lou N. Kairys, president of Lustine Automotive Group in Hyattsville, Md., said sales at his chain of car dealerships were "significantly slower" in September.
"There's a real softening," said Mr. Kairys, who sells cars and trucks made by G.M., Nissan and Toyota. "You're starting to see some fallout from the people who have garnered all the credit they can possibly garner and now are facing the piper and paying for it."

HEADLINE: McCaughey Ross's Husband Is Expected to Buy Weekly Newspapers

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the investment banker who is married to New York's Lieutenant Governor, is expected to announce today that he is purchasing a controlling interest in a chain of weekly newspapers that extends from Manhattan to the East End of Long Island to Washington.
By the standards of high finance it is a tiny transaction, but it would give Mr. Ross control of a newspaper chain that each week reaches 650,000 people. Mr. Ross heads a group that will pour $2 million into News Communications Inc., a publicly traded company that owns 23 weeklies, many of them free, including Our Town on the East Side of Manhattan, Dan's Paper in the Hamptons, and The Hill, a scrappy newspaper devoted to covering Congress. 
 Mr. Ross said that he would become chief executive of News Communications and that his group would control about 22 percent of the company's stock, while Jerry Finkelstein, the founder of the company, would remain as chairman.
"I believe there is a real niche, indeed a real need, for papers like these that fill in the blanks left by the big daily papers, the electronic media and Internet," said Mr. Ross, who is senior managing director of the Rothschild Inc. investment bank. "It started out as a cottage industry and I believe it'll end up with big chains and a high degree of professionalism. At a certain point, most of the additional revenue generated by these papers will be profit."
Although Mr. Ross said the deal was a strong business transaction, one political consultant said it ultimately could benefit the political career of Mr. Ross's wife, Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross.
The consultant, Norman Adler, noted that Mrs. McCaughey Ross has been at odds with state Republican leaders, who have warned that she may not be on Gov. George E. Pataki's re-election ticket in two years. Mrs. McCaughey Ross, her friends say, has no intention of retiring from political life and may mount a challenge in 1998 to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. Coincidentally, News Communications owns The Independent Voice in Island Park, Mr. D'Amato's hometown.
"If you want to be in politics, it's very comforting to have an affluent husband with an imagination," Mr. Adler said. "It's at least one rung up, if not two, on the ladder of political visibility. Those papers are in a lot of middle- and upper-income communities, and that's where the voters are. If I were running in a primary I'd want my spouse to own a string of widely read newspapers."
But Mr. Ross denied there was a political aspect to the investment. He said that he and his group of investors, which includes Robert Nederlander, president of the Nederlander Organization, the Broadway producers, and Sy Syms, chief executive of the Syms Corporation, a clothing retailer, are in it only for the money.
"This is a business transaction," Mr. Ross said. "That's why Bob Nederlander and Sy Syms are in it. They believe we can make a very good economic transaction out of this. What's driving the deal is business. I don't think the owner is going to be writing the editorials."
According to the latest annual report filed by News Communications, revenues rose 33 percent to $18.1 million for the year ending Nov. 30, 1995. But the company suffered a net loss of $1.7 million, due to a jump in the price of newsprint and the high costs associated with starting several publications.
Mr. Ross said that he hoped the infusion of cash would allow the company to computerize its operations and create a joint advertising program for all the company's weeklies.
Mr. Finkelstein said: "I hope to conclude this deal with Wilbur, but I haven't had a board meeting. He's an excellent banker and he's going to do us a lot of good. I'm trying to get him to do a lot of work."
The newspaper chain was widely believed to have been borne of Mr. Finkelstein's political ambitions for his son Andrew Stein, though he has consistently denied it. In 1968, he contributed tens of thousands of dollars to his son's successful campaign for the State Assembly. By the mid-1980's Mr. Stein was the City Council President and a potential mayoral candidate.
During the same period, Mr. Finkelstein, the longtime publisher of The New York Law Journal, began piecing together his media empire. In 1985, he started The West Side Spirit, a weekly now known as Manhattan Spirit, and three years later he bought the first two papers -- Dan's Papers and the Montauk Pioneer -- in what would become a string of weeklies based in upper-middle-class communities.
Mr. Stein jumped into the 1992 mayoral race along with Rudolph W. Giuliani, who promptly accused Mr. Finkelstein of using the string of weeklies to tout his son's candidacy and lambast his opponents. Mr. Stein ultimately dropped out of the mayoral race and politics altogether. Mr. Finkelstein, however, continued his empire building, purchasing a string of eight weeklies in Nassau County in 1993 and starting up a glossy monthly magazine, Manhattan File, the following year. Both Mr. Finkelstein and Mr. Ross say they are still in an expansion mode.

HEADLINE: OPERA REVIEW;
For a First Night at the Met, Pavarotti in 'Andrea Chenier'

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Opera's fashionable first-night audience was a blessing to be counted on Monday. The house's production of "Andrea Chenier" is scarcely six months old, but what an unhappy affair it is. The three long intermissions provided the evening's principal satisfactions, I am afraid to say. One's heart sank every time the house lights went down.
The Met has given us some powerful productions in the past few seasons, so it is hard to understand its settling for something like this. Nicolas Joel and Hubert Monloup offer a "Chenier" that is pretentious, ugly and confused. Clubfooted symbolism prevails: an oversize mirror that tilts ominously toward doomed French aristocrats, wrecked timbers in the Revolution's aftermath, an economy-size guillotine projected in silhouette at the end. 
 To get a picture of Act I's chateau setting, imagine yourself entering a Howard Johnson motel while dead drunk. There is the looming, fractured mirror, the geometric lobby carpeting, the ghastly blue-and-gold drapery and a hideous sofa to stoke the fantasies of any upwardly mobile suburban housewife. Act III's courtroom is like the entrance to an American city hall. There is more, but enough.
Mr. Joel's staging takes confusion as its watchword. Large numbers of people are crowded toward the front of the stage, where they mill aimlessly. If a metaphor for the chaos of the times is intended, it is a clumsy one. Secondary principals are egged on toward caricature, Paul Plishka's Matthieu being particularly egregious. If one was seeking good taste on Monday, the audience was perhaps the best place to look for it.
Giordano's sweetly lyrical music aims to please and almost always does. It is a little fragile to be supporting momentous doings like the Terror, but there are such powerful moments as Gerard's "Nemico della patria"; Juan Pons sang it with a flat-out ardor that brought down the house.
As a story, "Andrea Chenier" is muddied by all the minor characters necessary to prod along the plot, but it enjoys the built-in symmetry of master-servant relationships reversed. Chenier is the poet caught between higher and lower orders. Maddalena is the frivolous aristocrat who finds dignity and love in the final execution scene.
This is an opera that can be celebrated more for its parts than its whole. Luciano Pavarotti has the principal one. Six decades have drained a lot of the color from his voice, but in the title role he holds up admirably well. The points of vocal stress are handled gingerly but they are handled. A 61-year-old tenor must by nature be a master of disguise; and so Mr. Pavarotti directs most of our attention to his powers of articulation, almost to the point of excess.
As Maddalena, Maria Guleghina lives for the moments when she can fill the Met with deafening soprano sound. Elsewhere she has little idea what to do with herself: the phrasing is confused, the sustained piano passages unsteady.
There were small pleasures. I was particularly taken by Stephanie Blythe's brief appearance as Madelon, a bereft mother of the Revolution. This is a dark voice of quiet authority. James Levine and his Met orchestra performed with relish. The brass playing at the final curtain provided a sliver of happiness to take home with us.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The states aren't examplars of how to balance budgets.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
'Most states are required to balance their books," proclaims "Plan for Economic Growth," the Dole-Kemp campaign document. "Bob Dole believes the Federal Government should be required to do so as well."
If Mr. Dole is elected, the Constitution may well be changed to restrict deficit finance to national emergencies. The House passed a balanced budget amendment in 1995. A parallel initiative failed in the Senate by just two votes, and there is strong support for the amendment at the state level. 
 But anyone who relies on the states' experience to project the impact on Federal budget-making is in for some surprises, argues Richard Briffault of the Columbia University Law School. His report, "Balancing Acts: The Reality Behind State Balanced Budget Requirements," to be published later this month by the Twentieth Century Fund, is a sobering analysis of the limited impact of seemingly tough legal restraints on Government borrowing.
"Most states balance their operating budgets most of the time," Mr. Briffault acknowledges. And most states -- the number varies from a few dozen to 49, depending on how the laws are read -- officially bar deficit spending. The closer one looks, though, the less binding these strictures appear.
Unlike Washington, states make a distinction between "operating" and "capital" budgets. Almost all permit the sale of bonds to finance long-term improvements -- schools, airports and the like.
That makes sense. Just as no one expects successful businesses to finance their growth entirely from internal cash flow, few expect states to pay for new roads the year the asphalt is laid. Trouble is, it's hard to nail down what constitutes a capital improvement.
In practice most states use special authorities, whose debts are not formally backed by the state's credit, to underwrite a mix of capital and operating outlays. The extent to which operating expenses are hidden in capital budgets is, in practical terms, impossible to figure out. But Mr. Briffault reports that slightly more than half of state spending came from authorities unconstrained by deficit spending limits in 1993 -- far more than even the most generous estimates of capital spending.
Moreover, when pressed, states resort to cruder gimmicks. Michigan altered its fiscal year to pick up an additional three months of revenue over the summer, when it was not obligated to make aid payments to school districts. West Virginia, New Jersey and several other states have fudged pension accounting, shifting more of the obligation to pay for retirement of civil servants to future taxpayers. New York sold the Attica prison to a public authority, leasing it back and using the cash to cover the operating budget. All told, the General Accounting Office found that about one-third of the state budget gap that emerged in the 1990 recession was covered with dubious fund shuffles.
Another widely used tactic to reduce budget woes, Mr. Briffault suggests, is to pass them on to local governments. It is no coincidence, he argues, that local taxes have risen faster than state taxes since the mid-1980's. In California, for example, localities were forced to make up some $7 billion in aid cuts between 1990 and 1994 as the state struggled with stagnant revenues.
On balance, the states do have a far better fiscal record than Washington. But Robert Reishchauer, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office, is not inclined to assign much of the credit to constitutional borrowing limits. After all, when it has been expedient, state legislatures played games with capital budgets, pushed obligations into future years or simply dumped fiscal responsibilities on local taxpayers.
Moreover, state budgets are fundamentally different beasts. Mr. Reischauer notes that state budgets are less sensitive to the business cycle than the Federal budget. Washington's tax receipts fall more and its obligations to maintain the safety net rise more during recessions, making the task of keeping the Federal budget in balance that much harder.
More important, states are unable to print money, making them fiscal prisoners of the private capital markets. When Washington runs a deficit, it can always make up the difference by selling bonds backed, ultimately, by the power to create money. When Albany and Sacramento run deficits, they must find private investors to lend them the cash.
Of course, states do have the power to tax to cover debt obligations. But this power is indirectly limited by competition among the states. Faced with higher taxes, businesses and high-income individuals have the option to go elsewhere.
The irony here, Mr. Reischauer suggests, is that all things considered the state experience with constitutional limitations on deficit finance may be no better than Congress's efforts to discipline itself. The Federal deficit, after all, has fallen from $300 billion a few years ago to around $100 billion now. Not many states can match that gain.

HEADLINE: Commercial Building Outlays Give Construction Slight Lift

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Record outlays for commercial buildings raised construction spending in August, but the increase was offset by a third straight decline in government projects and flat residential expenditures, the Commerce Department said today.
Spending on residential, nonresidential and public projects rose nine-tenths of 1 percent, to $562.1 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, the fourth increase in six months, the Commerce Department said. 
 Still, the advance, which was in line with analysts' expectations, failed to erase the 1.1 percent decline in July even though the July figure was revised from its initial 1.4 percent estimate.
And despite the August performance, many analysts believe construction spending in the third quarter will fall below the average during the previous three months.
"This is an important piece of the economy and appears to be swinging from a strong second quarter to a much weaker third quarter," said David F. Seiders, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders.
"Unless July and August are revised up and September comes in strong, it certainly will contribute to a slowdown in growth in the third quarter," he added.
The Federal Reserve has been expecting economic growth to moderate. Officials decided last week they did not need to slow growth with higher interest rates to keep inflation under control.
Paced by a 12.3 percent jump in construction of hotels and motels, nonresidential spending rose 3 percent, to an annual rate of $139.5 billion, the highest on record. Outlays in the category, which includes shopping centers, were up 6.1 percent.
But residential spending, 40 percent of the total, was virtually unchanged at a $244 billion rate in August.
Spending on single-family houses edged up just one-tenth of 1 percent, same as the July increase, as 30-year mortgage rates averaged 8 percent or more for the third straight month.
The single-family market is particularly interest-sensitive since a one- percentage-point increase in mortgage rates would add more than $100 to many monthly payments. Mortgages averaged about 7 percent last January.
Outlays for often-volatile multifamily projects such as apartments and condominiums rose 3.4 percent but failed to recoup the 14.4 percent loss a month earlier.
Government spending continued to feel the effects of budget cuts. It fell two-tenths of 1 percent, to an annualized rate of $138.7 billion, the third straight decline.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Reaches 2 1/2-Year High Vs. Yen and Gains on Mark

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose to a two-and-a-half-year high against the yen yesterday as Japanese investors expressed their preference for American investments over the low interest rates on Japanese financial instruments.
With the start in Japan yesterday of the second half of the fiscal year, traders said, more investors there are looking to buy foreign securities. To do that, they must generally sell yen for other currencies. 
 "The dollar is going to continue going higher," said Jack Griffin, currency-sales manager at Fuji Bank. "With the start of the new fiscal term, a reallocation of assets is being made. There will be continued Japanese investment into the U.S."
Fuji has seen substantial dollar purchases from Japanese life insurers, pension funds and investment houses this week, Mr. Griffin said.
The dollar also jumped to a three-month high against the German mark after the chairman of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, John C. Whitehead, said in an interview with NBC Desktop, a multimedia news service, that it could gain further against European currencies.
The dollar rose as high as 112.04 yen yesterday, its strongest since Jan. 24, 1994, and 1.5336 marks, its highest since June 25. In New York trading late in the afternoon, it was quoted at 111.90 yen, up from 111.33 on Tuesday, and at 1.5315 marks, up from 1.5260. The British pound rose to $1.5650, from $1.5645 on Tuesday.
Japanese monetary officials have held the discount rate at a record low, one-half of 1 percent, since September 1995, and no increase is expected by analysts any time soon.
Given that, Japanese investors "need to risk buying foreign assets to better manage their money," said Norihiko Nishino, manager for foreign exchange at the Nomura Trust and Banking Company in Tokyo.
The dollar increased against the mark after Mr. Whitehead said it could rise 5 to 10 percent more against European currencies.
Mr. Whitehead's Federal Reserve bank post is largely honorary. A former Deputy Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration, he is chairman of AEA Investors, a money management firm. The New York Fed's president, William J. McDonough, has influence over monetary policy.

HEADLINE: A Fragile Redwood Deal

 BODY:
A promising deal has been struck that could resolve a 10-year struggle to save part of what is left of northwestern California's ancient redwood groves. Some environmental activists argue that the deal gives away too much and can never be made to work, and in recent days they have stepped up their protests. Proving them wrong will require a lot more effort by Federal and state negotiators who have already invested heavily of their time. It will also require good faith by a company that is not known for environmental virtue.
At issue is the Headwaters Forest in Humboldt County, which contains thousands of acres of old-growth redwoods that provide habitat for at least three endangered or threatened species -- coho salmon, a seabird known as the marbled murrelet and the spotted owl. The forest is owned by the Pacific Lumber Company, acquired in a leveraged buyout in 1986 by Charles Hurwitz, a prominent Texas financier and savings-and-loan operator. To pay down his debt, Mr. Hurwitz has been cutting redwoods and other trees, but in recent years a series of lawsuits and demonstrations have slowed his operations and caused him no end of public embarrassment. 
 There are two parts to the plan. First, the state and Federal governments will pay Pacific Lumber $380 million in cash and government property in exchange for 5,600 acres of the company's most sensitive land, including about 3,500 acres of virgin, old-growth redwoods. This looks like a steep price but is, in fact, less than the value placed on the property by a Forest Service survey four years ago. These acres would then become a public preserve.
Second, Pacific Lumber has agreed to join with Federal and state officials to devise a "habitat conservation" and "sustainable logging" plan to protect endangered species on the rest of the land it owns, amounting to more than 200,000 acres, predominantly second- and third-growth redwood and Douglas fir. This plan would be the most ambitious public-private effort so far to protect an entire ecosystem, instead of protecting individual species within that system on a case-by-case basis under the Endangered Species Act.
There are powerful incentives here for Mr. Hurwitz to conclude the deal. He will receive fair compensation for the 5,600 acres of virgin redwoods. Further, if all sides can agree on a conservation plan governing the rest of Pacific Lumber's property, the company will effectively be relieved of species-by-species lawsuits, which can lead to injunctions that bring logging to a halt. That will give Mr. Hurwitz a level of economic certainty he does not now have.
Local environmentalists would like the state and Federal governments to buy 60,000 more acres, but Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who helped broker the deal, says that is financially absurd. They also worry that any overall conservation plan, no matter how tightly drawn, will not provide nearly as much protection for endangered species and their habitat as the present system that allows for species-by-species lawsuits. In short, they do not trust the company.
That is a plausible concern, and it places powerful obligations on Federal and state negotiators in the months ahead. They will need to recruit the best scientific minds, independent of company or political pressure, to devise the protection plan. They must also insist on the right to revisit the plan at regular intervals to see whether Pacific Lumber's logging practices are in fact protecting valuable habitat -- and to tighten the plan if they are not.
On paper, this is a bold and imaginative initiative. But turning it into a real victory for those who value what is left of the redwoods will take careful attention to detail and continuing pressure.

HEADLINE: Japanese Voters, Too, Get a Big Tax-Cut Promise

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Borrowing a leaf from Bob Dole's briefing book, a Japanese opposition leader tried today to stimulate his sagging campaign by calling for big tax cuts.
The opposition leader, Ichiro Ozawa, is desperately trying to win support in general elections to be held on Oct. 20. 
 Mr. Ozawa, who has had a reputation as a wizard at election strategy, called for a 50 percent cut in both the national income tax and the local tax, abolition of a property tax and a more modest cut in the corporate income tax. He also said the national sales tax should be left where it is at 3 percent, instead of being raised as scheduled next April to 5 percent.
"Japan's economy is now in a state of stagnation, of recession, and if we leave things as they are it will only get worse," Mr. Ozawa, leader of the New Frontier Party, said at a news conference this evening. "Therefore, we must change the structure of the economy, and to do that we must enliven the economy as a whole."
Promises of tax cuts are old hat in American electoral politics, but Mr. Ozawa's approach is unusual in Japan. Japanese grumble about high taxes as much as Americans do, but Mr. Ozawa already has a reputation among many voters for being tricky, and so it is not clear how voters will view his latest promises.
The written platform that Mr. Ozawa issued today gave few details of how the tax cut plan would work or how it would be financed. The platform was called "five covenants with the people," and it appeared to be modeled in part on the Republicans' Contract With America.
Mr. Ozawa is an admirer of many aspects of the United States and has long shown an interest in American politics. Similarly, he has often seemed to have more support in America than in Japan, for while many Americans hail him as a true reformer he is regarded by many Japanese as an untrustworthy titan of machine politics.
The Government of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, which is widely expected to win re-election, is taking the opposite approach of Mr. Ozawa: it is promising a tax increase. Mr. Hashimoto insists that the increase in the sales tax is necessary and will go ahead as planned.
The sales tax increase is unpopular with voters, and it is expected to be the major issue in the campaign, which formally begins next Tuesday and lasts only 12 days. But Mr. Ozawa's proposal for tax cuts may set off a broader debate about tax policy. Japan's ratio of all taxes to national income is 38 percent, 3 points higher than America's.
Mr. Ozawa sounded a bit like a supply-sider at this evening's news conference, saying that lower taxes would stimulate economic growth and in turn increase tax revenue. As a result, he said, Japan's budget deficit will not drastically increase.
"By enlivening the economy, we will increase tax revenues and partially pay for the cost of the cuts," Mr. Ozawa said. "And with administrative reform, we will reduce expenses."
Even Mr. Ozawa acknowledged that in the long run Japan needs to address its budget deficit, which in percentage terms is far greater than America's. As a result, he said that it would eventually be necessary to consider an increase in the sales tax.
Mr. Hashimoto and other members of the governing coalition had no immediate comment on Mr. Ozawa's tax-cut proposal. But Nihon Keizai, a newspaper that often reflects the views of business, suggested this evening that the plan was unrealistic.
"How is the party intending to reconstruct the already deficit-ridden public finances?" the newspaper asked. "The answer is uncertain."

HEADLINE: Central Europe Learns About Sex Harassment

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WARSAW

 BODY:
When Iwona, a 21-year-old computer operator, landed a coveted job with a multinational company whose presence in Poland she considered a hallmark of growing economic success, she hoped to rise through the ranks.
But her hopes were crushed. She says she was sexually harassed by one of the company's salesmen, who is also a Pole. She filed a complaint with her employer, the consumer product company Unilever. But the hearing she got was described by her lawyer as unfair, and when her contract came due in August, it was not renewed. 
 Women's rights advocates say such cases illustrate that sexual harassment is finally being raised as an issue in the former Communist countries of Central Europe.
The woman's case stood out not because of the harassment she says she suffered but because she stood up to it in a culture where women have long endured sexual harassment, accepting it as the norm.
In many Polish workplaces, the tone is set by a Playboy centerfold hanging on the wall behind the secretary's desk -- a practice that began under the Communists. The centerfolds have remained because male bosses want them there. Many women in those offices say even now that they see nothing demeaning about sitting in front of the centerfolds.
But increasing attention to sexual harassment in news reports is beginning to encourage some women to speak out. Poland's main Government television channel recently ran a prime-time docudrama about sexual harassment, followed by a discussion with a studio audience and telephone calls from viewers. The message to women workers was: if you take your case to court, you can win.
In fact, though, the region has weak labor and civil-rights laws, and they have been largely untested because so few sexual harassment cases have been filed.
But there are signs that some companies are taking notice. In a high-profile recent case in the Czech Republic, a manager at Komercni Banka, a major state bank, was dismissed after a secretary filed a sexual harassment complaint against him. In a case last year involving the same man, the bank refused to act.
And a case in Hungary drew the attention of the top executive of International American Products Ltd., a contracting company based in Columbia, S.C. After allegations by local women of sexual harassment against the company's American construction workers at a United States Army base in Taszar, the executive traveled there to investigate.
The executive, Doyle E. McBride, said after his investigation that the allegations were unfounded; the women withdrew their accusations, but women said they had been pressed into changing their story.
But for the most part, the average Central European woman, pressed by today's harsh economic circumstances and inured by decades of Communism when she had little recourse, remains unaware that there may be a way to fight sexual harassment, or even that she should.
An official of the Polish Government's office for women and family, Aleksandra Smejda, said she had not received any grievances "because unfortunately Polish women do not protest against such treatment."
Only 5 percent of those responding to a recent Polish newspaper poll said they had ever encountered cases of sexual harassment at work, a result that showed the women's resignation rather than lack of incidents, sociologists say. Similar results have been found in the Czech Republic and Hungary, where even the term "sexual harassment" is a new addition to the lexicon.
"We have a long way to go in raising the consciousness of women and men and making them realize what is not appropriate," said Urszula Nowakowska, director of the Women's Rights Center in Warsaw, a pro-bono group of lawyers that has taken up Iwona's case.
At a discussion during a visit to Warsaw last summer by Hillary Rodham Clinton, Ms. Nowakowska appealed to her to help by urging large Western corporations to drop what Ms. Nowakowska called their "double standard."
The corporations have failed to adopt here the policies against sexual harassment that they have established in Western Europe and the United States, Ms. Nowakowska said. In some companies, the text of a harassment policy set by the global headquarters is sent as a gesture to the Central European office, but it is rarely translated into the local language and rarely reaches the work force.
Even as awareness among women grows, Western companies are likely to be slow in introducing Western-style sensitivity training, a personnel expert said.
"Polish employees are much more afraid of making claims against their employer," said Jerzy Warman, a former human-resources manager at Price Waterhouse in Warsaw who now works in New York City's personnel department. "They are more afraid of losing their job or of slowing the speed with which they are progressing."
Mr. Warman said that given the high level of domestic violence in Central Europe, it would take time for women to feel comfortable about bringing suits. "If a woman is being beaten by her husband at home, it is unlikely that she would consider her boss making some bawdy remarks or slapping her back as inappropriate," he said.
Another barrier is the weak legal framework in Eastern European countries. Even so, with the idea of bringing the issue to public attention, Ms. Nowakowska is searching for a case to pursue under either civil law or labor law. A victory would galvanize women, she said.
A possible case involving an American company emerged earlier this year, but the woman bringing the complaint, a deputy director of an office, decided to settle out of court after seeking the center's advice, Ms. Nowakowska said. The woman, a Pole, had received excellent job ratings from her director, who was also Polish. Then the man insisted that she have sexual intercourse with him and threatened to dismiss her if she refused, Ms. Nowakowska said. The woman refused, and her job evaluations dropped and her company car was taken away.
The American company sent an executive to investigate the case, Ms. Nowakowska said. The company agreed to pay the woman a year's salary if she left, but stipulated that the company's name could not be disclosed, the lawyer said.
In Iwona's case, Ms. Nowakowska said, the young woman says the last straw came when the male supervisor came upon her in the office kitchen, pressed his body against her and groped her. In a letter to Unilever's personnel manager at the company's headquarters in the Netherlands, Ms. Nowakowska said her client had been explicitly told by a Unilever manager in Poland that her contract would not be renewed. Many Polish workers are hired on a contract for the first three months and then almost automatically given permanent employment.
The reason given by the Unilever manager was the filing of the complaint, Ms. Nowakowska told the company in her letter.
Ms. Nowakowska said she was gathering evidence for a possible court case against Unilever.
The chairman of Unilever in Poland, Tjalling Tiemstra, denied that the woman was unfairly dismissed. He said the case was handled according to Unilever's global guidelines. Thus, he said, all parties were given a "fair hearing," the facts were checked and a ruling was issued.

HEADLINE: On Second Thought, U.S. Decides Shipyard Subsidies Aren't So Bad

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
It took six years and endless arm-twisting for American trade negotiators to persuade Japan, South Korea and nearly every European nation to end one of the biggest forms of corporate welfare in the world: billions of dollars in government subsidies for shipbuilders.
The subsidies, American shipbuilders said, were making it impossible for them to compete and could cost thousands of jobs in shipyards from Maine to California. 
 But nearly two years after the deal was struck and ratifed by all but one of the signatories, and just as most subsidies were supposed to be cut off, the whole agreement unraveled in Washington. Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, only weeks from the election, realized that the United States would also have to cut off its subsidies to American shipbuilders.
Even the Clinton Administration, which was pressing Congress to ratify the accord until a few weeks ago, has played both sides of the issue. Last weekend, at a campaign appearance in Boston, President Clinton boasted that the budget agreement reached late last week included millions to "revitalize the Quincy Shipyard" in Massachusetts.
In fact, the revival effort in Quincy would have been greatly hampered if the agreement had passed Congress and gone into effect.
With no agreement in force, European nations have decided to continue subsidizing their industry, to the tune of more than $1 billion annually, 20 times what the United States spends guaranteeing loans for the sale of American ships. But the beneficiaries of those loans say they would rather continue the subsidy wars than live with the changes the agreements would force at home.
The collapse of the shipbuilding agreement is an example of how easy it is for Democrats and Republicans alike to talk about ending "corporate welfare," and how hard it is actually to do it. And it illustrates how an accord that would save taxpayers millions of dollars and level the playing field -- an objective both Mr. Clinton and Bob Dole say is at the core of their economic foreign policies -- can fall apart as soon as companies and workers discover that other nations expect the United States to make concessions as well.
It also raises serious questions about whether American allies can believe that the United States will put into effect the trade accords that its negotiators initial.
"In the past month the Congress has walked away from three international accords," said Senator John Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat who fought unsuccessfully to win passage of the shipbuilding accord. "We ditched the chemical weapons treaty, the agreement on tuna and porpoise fishing, and now this one. It sends a disturbing message to international trading partners that the U.S. will get you to sign a treaty, but there is no guarantee that Congress will get it done."
What killed the accord in the end was opposition from the same big shipyards that pushed the Bush Administration to negotiate it in the first place. Almost all of them are big military contractors who now fear that the same deal they once said was vital to their survival could now end any hope of Government subsidies as they struggle to become bigger players in commercial shipbuilding. And several of them are in politically volatile states.
The six biggest yards opposed to the agreement are Avondale Shipyards near New Orleans, the largest industrial employer in Louisiana; Bath Iron Works, the largest employer in Maine, and Electric Boat in Connecticut, both part of the General Dynamics Corporation; Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Miss., a division of Litton Industries and the largest private employer in the state; National Steel and Shipbuilding in San Diego, and Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia, part of Tenneco Inc. and the largest nongovernment shipyard in the country.
"These are big yards that got caught by the end of the cold war and suddenly they think they can get subsidies out of the Defense Department to stay in business," a senior Administration official said. "And so suddenly, they did an about-face."
The shipbuilders tell a different story. "This was a bad trade agreement," said Tom Bowler, who once ran the Navy's largest shipbuilding operation and is now the president of the American Shipbuilding Association, the lobbyist for the large shipyards.
The accord did not prevent South Korean shipbuilders from continuing to add capacity, he complained, and that has sent ship prices down sharply. And he contended that the accord did not end all forms of subsidies.
But the agreement went a long, long way in that direction, so far that the American shipbuilding industry was clearly divided. Smaller shipyards, which tend to be more efficient and far less dependent on military work, fought for the agreement's passage. Labor unions sided with the big shipyards, which employ roughly 90 percent of the 110,000 shipbuilders in the United States.
The idea behind the agreement was to get the United States into a market where it is currently a nonplayer: international shipbuilding, which the Government estimates will be a $250 billion business in the next decade. But with European governments paying upward of 9 percent of the cost of building every ship, American shipbuilders had no chance of becoming competitive.
Under the agreement all those subsidies would end, except for a few existing programs that would be permitted to run their course. Big government payments to revamp shipyards, like the $3 billion program in Germany to refurbish shipyards in the former East Germany, would be prohibited.
In short, America's competitors would have to give up far more than the United States would. The biggest Federal subsidies to American shipbuilders ended a decade ago, though the Transportation Department still offers 25-year loan guarantees for the purchase of American-made vessels. That program would be scaled back, but not wiped out.
The agreement would also have provided a way to fight the "dumping" of ships, or selling them below the cost of manufacturing them.
And somewhat remarkably, America's trading partners agreed to allow the United States to retain legislation that stipulates that all smaller ships, which ply the inland waterways, must be built in the United States. Such "home build" rules elsewhere are vigorously protested by the United States.
In return for allowing that rule to continue, the other nations were permitted to impose penalties against American shipbuilders under some limited circumstances. The big shipyards said that this was another reason the accord had to be defeated.
They got a lot of bipartisan help, including support from many in Congress who view themselves as internationalists and free-trade advocates. The accord's opponents included Republicans like Senators William S. Cohen of Maine, John Warner of Virginia and Thad Cochran of Mississippi. Democratic opponents included Edward M. Kennedy and John Kerry of Massachusetts, Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer of California.
The acting United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, said the odd life and apparent death of the shipbuilding accord were not a huge surprise. "In the past two years," she said, "the Hill has had no appetite for controversial trade legislation." Cambodia and Bulgaria have received upgraded trade status and there have been agreements linked to the Middle East peace accords, but, she noted, there has been nothing involving industries at the core of American competitiveness.
Then again, it is an election year. And so in Massachusetts this week, Democrats and Republicans are arguing about shipbuilding -- not the agreement, but who can take credit for saving the Quincy shipyard.

A Record Bull Market, Any Way You Slice It
With the latest rise in the Dow Jones industrial average of 29.07, to 5,933.97, the current bull market has become the biggest ever without a decline of at least 10 percent. Since the last such decline ended, almost six years ago, the Dow is up 150.9 percent. [Page D8.]

The Fed as Risk-Taker
The Federal Reserve, after two decades of hard work to establish its credibility, is now showing a slight shift in its tolerance for inflation. Some view its decision not to push up rates as entailing a risk of a slight jump in prices to make sure that the economy keeps cruising ahead. Market Place. [D8.]

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Fed's Hard-Won Credibility Allows It to Take Small Risks

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer 

 BODY:
What is credibility worth? For the Federal Reserve, it's worth all the economic pain from nearly two decades of hard work -- and more. And the proof is in the way the market has reacted to the central bank's decision last week not to raise short-term interest rates.
Based on polls before the Sept. 24 meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee, more than half of Wall Street's forecasters expected a quarter of a percentage point increase in the target rate for Federal funds. 
 Yet when the Fed left the target at 5.25 percent, bond prices did not fall as they probably would have in the past, making borrowers pay extra in higher interest payments. Instead, they rose and long-term rates fell. Since then, the yield on the inflation-sensitive 30-year bond has dropped to 6.84 percent from 7.02 percent.
Part of the drop was a reaction to new data since the Fed meeting indicating that the pace of economic growth was slowing even without the Fed lifting a finger. But a much larger part of the reason is that investors, speculators and analysts seem to have confidence that the central bank will not let inflation get out of the bag again.
"Nobody really believes that the Fed is always behind the curve anymore," said Louis Crandall, the chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates.
This credibility has been hard won by the Fed's last two chairmen. Paul A. Volcker served two four-year terms as chairman and started the crackdown on double-digit inflation in 1979. He was followed by Alan Greenspan, who is now in his third term and has presided over a five-year stretch -- the longest period since the 1960's -- of inflation under 3 percent.
Still, some analysts say that the Fed showed a willingness to shift its tolerance for inflation by not moving last week when faced with unemployment as low as 5.1 percent and signs that wage increases are finally creeping up.
Instead of risking a sharper economic slowdown to be sure that inflation does not bounce higher, they say the Fed is apparently willing to risk a little jump in prices to insure the economy continues to cruise ahead.
"If Greenspan had been as vigilant as he was in 1994, he would have raised interest rates in July," said David Jones, the chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. "I think he is showing a much greater willingness to accommodate growth."
John R. Williams, the chief global markets economist at Bankers Trust Company, agreed, "To a degree I haven't seen in the past, the Fed seems willing to roll the dice on inflation going up." He said, though, that bond investors did not appear to share his concern.
Mr. Crandall said, "The advantage of having credibility is that it lets you cheat when you want to."
In fact, growing Fed credibility has influenced Mr. Crandall, who said he thought the Fed should have raised the Federal funds rate, the interest charged on overnight loans between banks, in July. But he is still "confident that the current group is committed to containing inflation." He is sure, he said, that the Fed will move aggressively if new data, including the September jobs report due on Friday, raise the specter of higher inflation.
There are other reasons for the calm exhibited by the so-called bond vigilantes -- those speculators and traders, so feared in Washington, who once sold their bonds quickly on any hint of inflation or a whiff of weakness at the Fed.
One is that the risk the Fed is taking is not particularly great. The economy is not booming; the question is simply whether it is slowing quickly enough from the fast pace earlier this year. Worker compensation is rising, but just barely. Inflation is still in check and anecdotal evidence shows that companies are having trouble pushing their prices higher.
At the same time, interest rates today are nothing like they were in February 1994, when the Fed began a yearlong ratcheting up of interest rates. The Federal funds target is 5.25 percent now, not 3 percent, and the yield on the long bond is 6.84 percent, not 6.30.
John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said that investors and others had "bought the Fed's logic that the economic data is ambiguous enough that the Fed should hold off."
But Mr. Lipsky thinks the current slowdown is just temporary.
The most probable outcome, he said, "is a bounce-back in the fourth quarter that will bring the Fed back to the fore and an eventual snugging of interest rates."
Two longtime Wall Street commentators, Albert M. Wojnilower, senior economic adviser at the Clipper Group, and Henry Kaufman, the head of his own firm, said they believed there was less of a will to fight inflation today.
"It's the passage of time and lower inflation," Mr. Wojnilower said.
But even Mr. Kaufman, long known for his bearish views on inflation, is not particularly worried. "The Fed is somewhat behind the curve now," Mr. Kaufman said, "but it is not much more behind the curve than it was in the second quarter and in July."
Finally, there are a number of economists who are not worried because they were already convinced the economy was slowing on its own.
"There is no risk here in waiting," said Bruce Steinberg, manager of macroeconomic analysis at Merrill Lynch & Company. "The economy is slowing already and there is no inflation out there."
But even with its hard-won credibility, the Fed cannot simply rest on its laurels. The next hurdle will come when the September jobs report is released tomorrow morning. In July, the economy added 228,000 jobs; the figure for August was 250,000. Indeed, so far this year, the monthly gain in nonfarm payroll jobs has averaged 237,000.
To keep the contented content, the number is probably going to have to come in lower than that. Otherwise, the confidence in the Fed will get another -- tougher -- test.

Jersey City Gains Jobs

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
Of New Jersey's major cities, only Jersey City has shown substantial economic growth in the last three years, Rutgers University professors said yesterday. Their study found that jobs in Jersey City rose 17.6 percent between 1992 and 1995, said James W. Hughes, dean of the university's planning school, and Joseph J. Seneca, a professor of economics. Paterson and Trenton showed modest gains, with Newark and Elizabeth flat. Mr. Hughes attributed Jersey City's growth to the relocation of Wall Street back-office jobs.

D.C. Ends MetroStars' Inaugural Season

BYLINE: By ALEX YANNIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
The MetroStars' inaugural season in Major League Soccer is over.
Just when it appeared that their third and deciding playoff game with D.C. United would go into a shootout, United scored on a penalty kick with 64 seconds left for a 2-1 victory and a trip to the Eastern Conference finals. 
 Raul Diaz Arce converted the penalty kick to the delight of the Robert F. Kennedy Stadium crowd of 20,434. The fans had fallen almost silent three minutes earlier after Antony De Avila's goal tied the score at 1-1. Steve Rammel's goal in the 65th minute had given United a 1-0 lead.
Despite being eliminated, no one from the MetroStars had any complaints afterward. Rob Johnson had brought Marco Etcheverry down inside the penalty area, and the referee, Brian Hall, had no choice but to make the call. Unfortunately for the MetroStars, it came at the most inopportune time.
"There was no question about the penalty," said Carlos Queiroz, who coached the MetroStars for the last time. "Soccer is not a fair game. It's not fair to lose like that in the last minute."
Queiroz will leave for Japan in the next few days to take over Grampus Eight, which gave him a three-year contract for $6 million.
While the MetroStars did not question the penalty kick, they raised some doubts about Rammel's goal, thinking it might have come from an offside position.
Rammel scored from about a foot away. He just reached out with his right leg as he was standing virtually on the goal line to deposit the ball in the back of the net after it had bounced away from the MetroStars' Miles Joseph.
With United trying to protect its lead, the MetroStars pushed forward and tied the score when De Avila converted Roberto Donadoni's pass from 8 yards away.
"All in all, United deserved to win," said Charlie Stillitano, the vice president and general manager of the MetroStars.
Before he signs a new coach, Stillitano will have to secure the contracts of five players -- Peter Vermes, Tony Meola, Roberto Donadoni, Tab Ramos and De Avila, who are the bulk of the team's foundation.
Stillitano said he would soon interview prospective candidates to replace Queiroz.
"I'm going to Spain, Italy, Holland and Germany," he said. "All I'm going to say is that I have four people in mind. Two are employed and two are unemployed."

Mutiny Ousts Crew
 TAMPA, Fla., Oct. 2 (AP) -- Roy Lassiter scored two goals and Martin Vasquez added a goal and two assists as the Tampa Bay Mutiny advanced to the Eastern Conference finals tonight with a 4-1 victory over the Columbus Crew.
Lassiter's first goal, coming in the 41st minute, broke a 1-1 deadlock. The Mutiny forward added his league-best fifth playoff goal at 58 minutes. Lassiter had a league-leading 27 goals in the regular season.

HEADLINE: In a Well-Kept Part of Brooklyn, Crack Arrests Are Met With Concern

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
The Gold Star Pizzeria at Avenue O and West Third Street in Brooklyn sits on a corner virtually indistinguishable from those of dozens of family-owned cafes that dot the mostly middle-class landscape of Bensonhurst.
Its neighborhood is one of well-kept apartment buildings and two-family houses with yards and porches surrounded by plaster flower pots. Across the street yesterday, the smell of bread drifted from the Boccia Bakery and men talked outside Monte's Heros delicatessen. 
 On its surface, the corner might seem an unlikely nexus for the crack-cocaine trade, which has largely been a scourge endured by the city's poorer neighborhoods.
But in February alone, Federal drug investigators say, undercover agents went there four times to buy cocaine from young dealers, all of whom lived in the neighborhood and who had made the corner a common meeting place for transactions.
The dealers were working under the watchful eye of the Lucchese crime family, many of whose members also call the neighborhood home and who have long been believed to protect their streets from many kinds of crimes. But over the last five years, the young dealers had turned a handful of other unlikely street corners, building lobbies and cafes in Bensonhurst and Bay Ridge to the same purpose.
Their customers, officials said, were nearly always their own neighbors, young men also in their 20's, some of whom had even gone to the same high schools as the dealers.
As the news spread through close-knit blocks of Bensonhurst and Bay Ridge yesterday that more than 30 residents had been arrested on Tuesday and accused of selling cocaine for years, it was received with almost equal measures of shock and grim resignation.
While many said they found it hard to believe crack was being sold and smoked on their streets, they also said that their neighborhoods were in the midst of a sea change.
"The new generation here is different," said Gus Arena, 66, a retired corrections captain who has lived in Bensonhurst all his life. "This was always a working-class Italian neighborhood, never rich people. But people here used to work. They used to break their neck. Now, kids will defile their own neighborhood with drugs to make money."
Mr. Arena, whose father immigrated from Italy and worked as a bricklayer in Brooklyn, spoke on the corner of 21st Avenue and 74th Street, where mothers pushed baby carriages and elderly women sat on lawn chairs. In January, drug investigators said, drug dealers in a Ford Escort sold undercover agents $200 worth of cocaine on the same corner.
Like Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst has long been home largely to middle-class families, mostly of Italian ancestry, with a smaller population of Jews and a recent influx of Russians and Asians.
But like Bay Ridge, in which 10 percent of residents now live below the poverty line, it has seen its economy erode over the last decade, opening the door, some say, to the kinds of crime more common in poorer neighborhoods, like drug sales and petty thefts and muggings to finance drug habits.
Some officials involved in the investigation maintain, however, that the weak economy has little to do with the crack trade's migration to the neighborhoods. "We know many of the sellers came from stable middle-class homes and had no good excuse to do this, if there is a good excuse," one Federal agent said. At least some of the dealers came from families with some history of organized crime involvement, he added.
Benny Bonello, a 14-year-old Bensonhurst resident who waited out the rain with a friend at the Gold Star Pizzeria yesterday, told of the temptation to enter a life of organized crime and drugs when he commonly saw acquaintances only a few years older flashing wads of hundred-dollar bills and driving expensive cars.
"You see it and you know all the guys, but you just try to mind your own business if you know what's good for you," he said.
Behind him, the elderly woman who owns the pizzeria, who would not give her name because she said she feared the Mafia, cursed in Italian when she read the list of suspects, many of whose nicknames -- Jimmy Frogs, Mikey Flattop and Rags -- are well known in the neighborhood. When told they had been arrested, she she clapped her hands and said, "Good! Good! Troublemakers!"
The situation in Bensonhurst and Bay Ridge is also the result, law enforcement officials said, of the weakening of traditional kinds of protection that organized crime once provided to neighborhoods where its members are believed to live, like Bensonhurst and Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, and Belmont in the Bronx.
"They're really being forced into the drug trade to raise revenues that were once raised by gambling, prostitution and other rackets that have been cracked down on," said an agent of the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration who was involved in the yearlong cocaine investigation. "Their greed pushes them to the point where they are willing to peddle in their own neighborhoods."
The agent, who insisted that his name not be used, said that the investigation had developed "hard, fast evidence that this was an activity sanctioned all the way up the line by the Lucchese leaders, if not explicitly, then tacitly."
And Robin Waugh, a spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Administration, said that the investigation also suggested that the lure of fast money from selling drugs, especially crack, cuts easily across social and economic lines.
"When someone can make $2,500 in one night by doing this," Ms. Waugh said, "I don't think it matters whether it is a poor or a middle-class, working-class neighborhood, or what kind of family you came from."

 CORRECTION:
A picture of a graffiti mural on Thursday with an article about charges of drug dealing in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, was published in error, and the caption misstated the cause of death of the young man honored by the mural. According to the Medical Examiner's office, the man, John Joseph Vite, died of natural causes; his death was not related to drugs. The Times regrets the error.

HEADLINE: About Real Estate;
Single-Family Homes in a Mix, All Maintenance-Free

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Started a decade ago as a development that was to have more than 500 condominiums, Sterling Woods in Danbury, Conn., had progressed as far as 87 residences before the savings and loan debacle and a real estate recession shut down construction and sales in 1990.
Now the incomplete portion of the project, on Nabby Road in the northeast of the city, is being revived with new owners and a different concept. The plan, made possible by a change in Danbury's zoning, is to create a smaller mixed residential community of 77 single-family homes, 38 duplex houses -- two-family homes sharing a common wall -- and 239 condominiums. All will offer maintenance-free living. And while the residences of two to four bedrooms will be clustered in as many as 10 neighborhoods spread over 128 wooded hillside acres, 40 percent of the site will remain undisturbed. 
 The Building and Land Technology Corporation of Wilton, an active developer in the area, will build the $70 million project in partnership with the Spinnaker Companies of Stamford. The partners hope the revamped project will appeal to a broad range of house hunters, from first-time and move-up buyers to older couples.
It will rise in phases over the next five years, with the first 67-unit phase now under way. Prices are $150,000 to $280,000, said Carl R. Kuehner 3d, president of Building and Land Technology, which is returning to the project after selling its interest four years ago. Financing is coming from the partners' own equity and banks.
The partners bought the project with an already approved site plan last month for $4.5 million. The seller was Parcliff Associates in Manhattan, which had purchased it at an auction in 1992 by the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency created to dispose of failed savings and loan assets. Before that sale the corporation -- which had seized the property when it took over the failed Danbury Savings and Loan -- reached an agreement with existing owners that the old and new residences would be in independent enclaves. They will be separated from one another by buffers and each will have its own homeowners association and recreational amenities.
Danbury supported the development concept for the remaining portion of Sterling Woods from the start. Dennis I. Elpern, the city's director of planning, said the result was a project that would have less impact on municipal services and would preserve more of the hillside and woodlands. He said it would also provide an alternative type of housing that was not yet available in Danbury. He said he also thought the idea of having single-family detached homes in a community where someone else takes care of the maintenance "had promise." The idea "is slowly being accepted" throughout Connecticut, said Donald A. Hull, executive vice president at Consolidated Multiple Listing Service Inc. in Norwalk. "It gives buyers the best of two worlds."
Sterling Woods is moving forward as the sales picture in Danbury, as in other parts of Fairfield County, is showing signs of improvement. Condominiums, which were overbuilt during the boom days of the 1980's, have bounced back as the lack of new construction in the last few years helped whittle down available inventory, real estate agents said.
According to William Pitt Real Estate, based in Stamford, the average price of the 125 condominiums sold in Danbury this year was $105,000, up from $96,000 for the 103 sold during the same time in 1995. The average price for the 400 single-family homes was $219,000.
The rebounding market has rekindled developer interest in reviving stalled projects and starting new ones. Mr. Elpern, Danbury's director of planning, said projects under way, approved or planned, if realized, could produce 1,000 new residences in the city in the next few years. Much of it is attached housing, including two other projects together totaling 132 residences planned by Building and Land Technology.
The largest is Sterling Woods. Mr. Kuehner said the project's diversity of housing types in a natural setting and a prime location would attract buyers. The site is off Federal Road, a main retail corridor and close to Interstate 84. It also backs up to undeveloped land, part of the single-family neighborhoods that border the site on three sides.
"There is no other condominium project like this planned in the area," providing a ready market, Mr. Kuehner said.
Construction on the first 67 residences, designed in colonial style by E.D.I Architects of Dallas, began last month. The attached residences range in size from 1,400 to 1,600 square feet, with the duplex homes as large as 1,900 square feet. Prices are $150,000 to $190,000. The single-family detached homes, with 1,800 to 2,200 square feet, cost $230,000 to $280,000. All of the units have garages for one or two cars.
Among the amenities planned are a clubhouse, pool and jogging trails. The monthly maintenance fee is expected to be approximately $200, Mr. Kuehner said. He said sales were expected to start next week.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Takes a Breather Ahead of Today's Jobs Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar's rally paused yesterday for the first time in more than a week, reflecting in part a reluctance to bid the currency higher before a report today on United States employment in September.
"We're kind of on the sidelines, just on the off-chance there's something really unusual about this number," said John Beerling, chief currency dealer at the Norwest Bank Corporation in Minneapolis. 
 The dollar ended steady to slightly lower against most leading currencies, at least stalling a trend that has pushed the dollar to two-and-a-half-year highs against the yen and three-month highs against the mark over the last few days.
In late trading in New York, the dollar fell to 111.45 Japanese yen from 111.90 yen on Wednesday. The dollar also fell to 1.5313 marks from 1.5315 marks, the first time the dollar has ended lower against the mark since Sept. 24. The British pound was unchanged at $1.5650.
A Commerce Department report that showed factory orders tumbled in August tempered the demand for dollars, as did a Labor Department report that showed weekly unemployment claims remained at the highest level in three months. Both reports suggested the economy was decelerating, which diminishes the prospect that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its next policy-making meeting Nov. 13. Forecasts for higher United States rates have been an underlying element in the dollar's strength.
More clues to the economy's direction are expected today with the Labor Department's report on employment last month. While many currency traders expect the report to show a slowdown in job growth, which would suggest rates would remain unchanged, many were reluctant to speculate ahead of the report.
"We just don't know what to expect," said Debra Larsen at the New York branch of Commerzbank. "You don't know how the market is going to react."
Traders have attributed the dollar's strength partly to the prognosis for continued low interest rates in Japan and Germany, which have been struggling with economic sluggishness. Relatively high interest rates in the United States and the outlook for low inflation are seen as increasingly alluring to investors.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Analysts cheer the new direction at Hilton Hotels.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
LONG regarded as well managed but overly cautious, the Hilton Hotels Corporation has recently dispelled most doubts about its ability to react to opportunities with a whirlwind of acquisitions, buyouts and marketing alliances. And Hilton is hinting of more deals to come.
Financial analysts are already signaling their approval for what Hilton's new chief executive, Stephen F. Bollenbach, has done so far to rejuvenate the company since he signed on in February. 
 So far this year, Hilton has agreed to acquire the Bally Entertainment Corporation for more than $2 billion, a deal that when completed will make Hilton the world's biggest casino gambling organization. It agreed to buy most of the Prudential Insurance Company's interest in hotels that Hilton jointly owns with the insurance company in New York City, Washington, Chicago, San Francisco and Rye, N.Y. And it forged a strategic alliance with Ladbroke Group P.L.C., which owns Hilton Hotels International.
In addition to allowing each company to buy a fifth of the other, the alliance unites the ownership of the Hilton name in the United States and abroad, thus giving the Hilton Hotels Corporation a renewed presence in the international market.
"This has been a complete metamorphosis -- Hilton is changing right before our eyes," said W. Bruce Turner, an analyst for Salomon Brothers. "And they still aren't anywhere close to peaking, in either lodging or gaming."
While most of the publicity has centered on the Bally agreement, which will finally gain Hilton entree into the lucrative Atlantic City market, analysts say the payoff from the recent Prudential acquisitions is also likely to help Hilton's balance sheet.
Almost no big city hotels are under construction, those analysts say, therefore rates and occupancy should grow for at least the next several years. "Hilton should be able to grow cash flow by 25 percent a year," Mr. Turner said, "primarily because a lot of time there's not going to be any room at the inn."
Late last month Hilton carried out a 4-for-1 stock split, as part of its agreement to acquire Bally.
Joseph V. Coccimiglio, the gaming and lodging analyst for Prudential Securities, said he foresaw Hilton stock outperforming the market over the next 12 months.
Most analysts expect Hilton to earn about 24 cents a share after the split, and company officials said they expected earnings to meet expectations. Hilton's chief financial officer, Matthew Hart, said he expected the company to generate $1 billion in cash flow this year.
Hilton stock closed at $28.25, unchanged, yesterday.
Michael G. Mueller, the hotel analyst at Montgomery Securities, said he thought Hilton's acquisition of hotels in "downtown trophy markets" bode well for the company. "Those properties should appreciate significantly over the next decade, assuming even moderate economic growth," he said. "So now is a good time to be owning those hotels, while they have the wind at their back."
Mr. Mueller foresees Hilton growing at a 20 percent annual rate over the next five years. "Essentially," he said, "the company is raising capital at attractive rates at a time when financing costs are close to a historical low level, and reinvesting that capital in gaming and lodging businesses that generate high current returns and have attractive longer-term growth outlooks."
All three analysts said they were reassured by the appointment of Arthur M. Goldberg, chairman and chief executive of Bally, as president of the Hilton-Bally gambling operations. To Mr. Mueller, the appointment will make it easier for Hilton to exploit opportunities in markets other than Atlantic City. "He understands the gambling market, and is very entrepreneurial," the analyst said.
Mr. Coccimiglio of Prudential Securities said he thought Mr. Goldberg, who cut costs at both the corporate and casino level after joining Bally in 1990, would also be helpful in identifying areas where Hilton could realize its target of $60 million in operating cost savings.

HEADLINE: In America;
The Cities Climb Back

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
As Henry Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, sees it, the long and devastating "free fall" of American cities is over, and the difficult climb back has begun.
He may be right. 
 New York City has a good chance of ending the year with 1,000 murders or less, a terrifying statistic in most venues but a reason to celebrate in the Big Apple, which suffered through a record 2,245 homicides in 1990.
In Detroit, which came up with the quaint custom of burning itself down every Halloween, a genuine rehabilitation seems to be under way. There has been some modest job creation, an increase in home ownership, a commitment of $2 billion in private investments in the city's empowerment zone and a resurgence of the downtown area, which was in pitiful shape (especially at night) just a few years ago. A symbol of the renewed action in Detroit is the serious effort by the football Lions to arrange a return to the city. The Lions have been holed up for years in suburban Pontiac.
Chicago, Philadelphia, Kansas City, Cleveland -- all are making headway in the areas of employment, public safety, neighborhood revitalization and civic pride. Even Newark, N.J., comatose since the riots of 1967, appears to be waking up. Among other things, Newark's rancid high-rise public housing complexes are being demolished and housing more suitable to the human species is being built.
"Unemployment is down in the cities, crime rates are down, and some job creation is up," said Mr. Cisneros. "I'm not saying the cities have recovered, but they are recovering."
Slowly.
It's not that the Clinton Administration has been a champion of the cities; far from it. But since Bill Clinton became President cities have at least been able to get a hearing in Washington. And some members of the Administration, most notably Mr. Cisneros and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, have been passionate and eloquent advocates for cities.
This is a vast change from the approach of the Reagan and Bush Administrations. The idea then was to go Gerald Ford one better and tell all of urban America to drop dead.
Without some Federal support local efforts are doomed. In making the case for the Clinton Administration, Mr. Cisneros points to several things: to Federal support for anti-crime initiatives, including money to put additional police officers on city streets; to changes in public housing policies away from high-rises filled with the poorest of the poor to lower density, mixed-income dwellings; and to the creation of urban empowerment zones, which carry with them a whole load of Federal subsidies and tax benefits.
It is too early to gauge the impact of the empowerment zones, but the other efforts have been helpful. And cities have unquestionably benefited from the continued push to make credit more readily available through programs like the Community Reinvestment Act and the low-income housing tax credit. The Administration has steadfastly defended these programs from assaults by conservative legislators.
"What we've really seen is a credit revolution in the inner city," said Paul Grogan, president of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a nonprofit outfit that helps in the rebuilding of deteriorated neighborhoods. "There have been large rises in home ownership rates for African-Americans and Hispanics, and the availability of bank credit for all manner of activity has risen."
Most important, the cities have benefited from the overall improvements in the economy. The top 50 cities have seen their official unemployment rate decline by 2.5 percent over the past four years. In Detroit the decline was nearly 7 percent. In Cleveland, 4 percent.
More people working means more people buying and furnishing homes and paying taxes.
The flip side of the good news is that the burden of Federal budget-cutting continues to fall disproportionately on the shoulders of the cities. And the narrow, unfair and remarkably uncreative ways in which spending is being cut is sapping the nation's ability to invest in education, additional job creation, the infrastructure and the environment -- all areas that would benefit cities and the nation as a whole.
Nevertheless, good news is good news. It's heartening to see flowers emerging from the rubble.

HEADLINE: New Orders To Factories Fall Sharply

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
New orders to factories tumbled at the sharpest rate in three and a half years in August, the Commerce Department said today, as the economy's industrial sector lost some of its vigor.
Orders were down a surprisingly steep 1.9 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $311.1 billion -- the largest monthly decline since a 2.2 percent decrease in January 1993. Backlogs of unfilled orders weakened and inventories mounted. 
 The August decline more than erased a 1.7 percent July orders gain.
Another report today pointed to moderate growth. The Labor Department said new applications for jobless pay were steady last week at 340,000, the same as in the previous week, though a four-week moving average picked up for a seventh straight week.
"Both of these numbers support the view that the economy will be moderating for the balance of the year," said Lynn Reaser, an economist with Barnett Banks Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla.
Last week, a four-week moving average of jobless claims rose to 334,500 from 328,750 the week before, the highest reading since an average of 312,500 claims for the week ended June 10, 1996.
The August falloff in factory orders followed a revised 1.7 percent July increase that was previously reported as a stronger, 1.8 percent gain. Orders have fallen in two of the last three months, including a 0.7 percent June decrease.
Demand faded for both expensive durable goods like cars and airplanes and goods like food and paper products.
Durables orders dropped a revised 3.2 percent, to $166.8 billion in August, after a 1.4 percent July rise, while nondurables orders were down four-tenths of 1 percent following a 1.9 percent jump in July.
Previously, the department said durables orders had fallen 3.1 percent in August but it revised that fractionally.
"For the most part, these are relatively soft numbers which are more in line with an economy that is growing at a moderate, sustainable pace," said Joel Naroff, an economist for the First Union Corporation of Charlotte, N.C.
Mr. Naroff said a fall of three-tenths of 1 percent in August order backlogs and a second consecutive monthly rise in stocks of unsold goods "imply that manufacturers are not being overburdened by too much demand and will therefore not be pressed to raise prices."
The biggest factor in the durables orders decline was transportation equipment, as orders plunged 7.9 percent, to $37.9 billion, after declines of 1.5 percent in July and 1.3 percent in June.
The department said aircraft and parts were the major cause for the transportation slump in August, although new-car orders were also down from July.
Excluding transportation, August factory orders were still down 1.1 percent, the largest decline since a 1.5 percent drop in May 1993, after a 2.1 percent rise in July.
Weaker factory orders were anticipated in view of other recent signs of continued cooling in manufacturing activity.
On Tuesday, the National Association of Manufacturers said its September index of activity slipped from August.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Dip Ahead Of Job Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mostly lower yesterday, with the only increase coming in the longest maturity.
The report of a larger-than-expected drop in factory orders, which would usually tend to lead prices higher, was largely ignored as the market focused on today's monthly employment report. Few investors seemed willing to make large commitments ahead of the jobs number. 
 The 30-year bond gained 2/32 in price, to 9831/32 , for a yield of 6.83 percent, down from 6.84 percent on Wednesday, and setting another six-week low. But investors in most government securities apparently chose to take profits yesterday after the recent run-up in prices.
Yesterday's weekly report on jobless claims showed that the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits last week was unchanged from the previous week. The report covered the final week of the third quarter and set the stage for today's employment numbers, which analysts expect will show that 175,000 jobs were created in September as the unemployment rate rose to 5.3 percent from 5.1 percent.
However, the bond market is probably looking for the job-growth number to be weaker than the consensus of analysts. And the market will again pay particular attention to the hourly earnings figures. Analysts are predicting an increase of three-tenths of 1 percent in that figure, but some estimates are as high as six-tenths.
The market was also hurt yesterday by the dollar, which had provided support for bonds Wednesday but turned lower yesterday. Overseas buying did help support bonds early in the day.
Kim Rupert, an economist with MMS International, said: "The resiliency in Treasury securities seen so far continues to suggest the market will trade higher on as-expected data. The 30-year bond could challenge the August highs on friendly data, but will meet stiff resistance there. However, with so much talk of a friendly report, the market is very vulnerable to strong figures. A payroll number in the 240,000 to 250,000 range could be disastrous, alongside a rise in earnings and little change in the unemployment rate."
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said that while factory orders slipped 1.9 percent in August, that was not surprising in light of the 3.2 percent decline reported last week in orders for durable goods. Orders for nondurables also fell in August, but the dip of four-tenths of 1 percent only partly offset the 1.9 percent rise in July.
Mr. Fine said that while the growth rate in factory orders may be slowing, "the strong performance of housing-sector data in August implies sustainable economic growth in the months ahead, as housing is considered to be the leading edge of future economic activity and has yet to show any signs of significant decline."
He said that several factors were contributing to a healthy environment for the market with little threat of inflation in the near term. The index of leading indicators has risen for seven consecutive months and the industrial sector is showing steady growth with only modest price pressures.

Hallucinatory, sometimes funny large-scale wall drawings in which beautiful, obsessively rendered textures seem half the point expand upon the persistent tradition of high school notebook-cover doodlings (Roberta Smith).
 
SAL SCARPITTA, Trisha Collins Grand Salon, 83 Grand Street, SoHo (through Oct. 12). Although sculptures involving a sled piece and a wrapped car frame occupy center stage, this show's strengths lie in less characteristic works: a series of bronze wall pieces, out of Africa by way of Picasso, made from shoe trees, lasts and horns; some ink drawings of gyrating race car drivers, and the economical "Tub Leg Elk," from 1970, which testifies elegantly to hislong dedication to assemblage (Smith).
 
ANNIE LEIBOVITZ, James Danziger Gallery, 130 Prince Street, SoHo (through Oct. 12). The photographer's crisp sharp-focus style, which makes everything sit in three-dimensional space with uncanny perfection, if not glamour, remains almost frighteningly consistent across subjects from Olympians and movie stars to battered wives.

HEADLINE: Kohlberg Kravis Will Buy Kindercare for $467 Million

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Kindercare Learning Centers Inc., the nation's largest preschool and child care company, for approximately $467 million, or $20.25 a share.
Kohlberg Kravis made the announcement along with Kindercare and Oaktree Capital Management L.L.C., a Los Angeles-based company that manages a 52 percent stake in Kindercare that is owned by TCW Special Credits, a unit of Trust Company of the West. 
 The announcement was made after the close of financial markets. Kindercare's shares closed at $16.25 on Nasdaq yesterday, up 12.5 cents.
Under the terms of the agreement, Kindercare shareholders can either choose to receive $20.25 in cash for each of their shares or retain existing Kindercare stock. However, retained stock is subject to proration, and Kohlberg Kravis said that about 93 percent of Kindercare shares outstanding would be exchanged for cash, with the remaining 7 percent held by existing shareholders.
As manager of the TCW investment, Oaktree has agreed to retain a sufficient number of shares so that all other shareholders wishing to cash out will be able to do so.
After the merger, an entity controlled by Kohlberg Kravis will own about 85 percent of Kindercare, and the company's pre-merger shareholders will own about 15 percent.
In addition to the cash portion, Kohlberg Kravis will assume about $130 million of Kindercare debt.
Kohlberg Kravis said that after the merger Kindercare would be capitalized with $175 million in equity, of which $148.75 million would be invested by a Kohlberg Kravis affiliate.
All of the financing for the transaction is being arranged by Kindercare, Kohlberg Kravis and the Chase Manhattan Corporation. Kindercare also received a commitment from Chase that $300 million in bank debt would be available for future growth and acquisitions.
Kindercare, which was founded in 1969, operates nearly 1,150 preschool and child care centers in 38 states and Britain. It was taken private through a leveraged buyout arranged by Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1987. Saddled with large amounts of debt, the company struggled, and filed for bankruptcy protection in November 1992. It emerged from Chapter 11 the following March.
TCW Special Credits bought a 37 percent equity stake when Kindercare came out of bankruptcy. In April that interest was increased to the current 52 percent.
In its most recently completed fiscal year ended May 31, Kindercare, which is based in Montgomery, Ala., earned $21.7 million on revenues of $541.3 million.
Kohlberg Kravis said that TCW Special Credits, Oaktree and certain of their affiliates had agreed to vote in favor of the merger. The deal, which is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, is expected to close by January at the latest.
Analysts said the deal was attractive for both sides.
"It's a win/win situation for both K.K.R. and shareholders," said David Mann, an analyst at Johnson Rice & Company in New Orleans. "For shareholders to get more than $20 a share is more than I would have expected the stock to move in the near term."
Mr. Mann said that Kohlberg Kravis was getting a company whose future was "clearly looking brighter."
The decision to move into child care represents something of a shift for Kohlberg Kravis, which in recent years has made big investments in insurance companies.
Of its current holdings, the only company that is remotely related is the Merit Behavioral Care Corporation, formerly a subsidiary of Medco. Merit is the nation's largest managed behavioral health care company.
Clifton S. Robbins, a Kohlberg Kravis general partner, said in a statement that "we believe the child care industry is an important and growing sector of the economy fueled by strong demographic trends." He added, "K.K.R. intends to support the expansion of Kindercare through internal growth and acquisitions while continuing to promote industry-leading education and quality standards."
CS First Boston acted as financial adviser for Kindercare. Salomon Brothers Inc. advised Kohlberg Kravis.

HEADLINE: Peter Brennan, 78, Union Head and Nixon's Labor Chief

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Peter J. Brennan, a Depression-era house painter who rose through the construction trades, became one of New York's most prominent labor leaders for three decades and was Secretary of Labor from 1973 to 1975 in the Nixon and Ford administrations, died on Wednesday at the home of a daughter in Massapequa, L.I. He was 78.
Mr. Brennan died of lymphatic cancer, according to his daughter Joan Tetro, with whom he had lived since he became ill last July. 
 Ruddy-faced and white-haired, he was a blunt, colorful man whose Hell's Kitchen accent echoed his origins on the West Side of Manhattan. Mr. Brennan was a submariner in the Pacific in World War II. After the war, he fought his way to the top of the painters' union and then the unionized building trades in New York.
Except for his two years as Labor Secretary, Mr. Brennan was president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, an umbrella organization of unions with 250,000 members at its peak, from 1957 to 1992, when he retired.
He was also president of the council's 386,000-member New York State counterpart and was vice president of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the New York City Central Labor Council. He enjoyed wide popularity in all the craft unions and was a major voice in city and state political and legislative circles.
In 1970, with the nation in turmoil over the Vietnam War, Mr. Brennan leaped to national prominence by organizing a rally of thousands of construction workers near City Hall to show support for President Richard M. Nixon's policies and American soldiers fighting in Southeast Asia. A counterdemonstration by antiwar protesters led to a clash with the workers, and many of the antiwar protesters were beaten.
Mr. Brennan and other New York labor leaders who supported Mr. Nixon were invited to the White House. Mr. Brennan said he was gravely concerned about any concessions or show of weaknesses by the United States toward the Communists in North Vietnam.
In the months that followed, friendship between Mr. Nixon and Mr. Brennan flourished. In the 1972 election, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. proclaimed its neutrality, but Mr. Brennan, a longtime Democrat who had supported Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, organized labor leaders and unions in support of Mr. Nixon, who was re-elected.
Yesterday, Representative Peter T. King, Republican of Seaford, L.I., called Mr. Brennan a "man of courage" for "standing up to the antiwar protesters who tried to take over our streets."
He added: "More than any other individual, he was responsible for bringing the blue-collar labor Democrats into the coalition that elected Presidents Nixon and Reagan. The concept of 'Reagan Democrats' would not have existed if not for Peter Brennan."
A few weeks after his re-election, Mr. Nixon nominated Mr. Brennan as Secretary of Labor, and after Senate confirmation he assumed office on Feb. 2, 1973. Organized labor was delighted, for Mr. Brennan had often spoken out for raising the minimum wage and expanding its coverage, increasing unemployment benefits, creating more jobs and training and enhancing workplace safety.
But when Mr. Brennan presented the Administration's proposal for minimum wages that would rise in small increments over four years and would not be extended to state and local employees and domestic workers, George Meany, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and other labor leaders were outraged. A defensive Mr. Brennan called it a compromise that might have been worse, given the lengthening shadows of inflation, recession and unemployment.
As the current Labor Secretary, Robert B. Reich noted yesterday, new laws were adopted during Mr. Brennan's tenure to protect the pensions of millions of workers, and the employment rights of disabled people were greatly expanded. He was also credited with strict enforcement of occupational safety and health laws and improving benefits for workers displaced by import competition.
But Mr. Meany virtually ignored Mr. Brennan for the rest of his tenure. After Mr. Nixon resigned in the Watergate scandals and Gerald R. Ford became President, Mr. Ford decided to replace several of Mr. Nixon's Cabinet appointees early in 1975. He offered Mr. Brennan the post of ambassador to Ireland. Mr. Brennan declined the offer.
He returned to New York and resumed the presidency of the construction trades council, a post he held until 1992. Over the years, he was credited with helping to raise wages and to expand job and training opportunities in the construction trades.
But he was also criticized by some civil rights advocates, who accused the building trades of discriminating against members of minority groups and said Mr. Brennan had not moved swiftly enough to open training and apprenticeship jobs to black and Hispanic workers. Mr. Brennan insisted that he had moved as fast as possible in trades that were traditionally white and resistant to change.
Peter Joseph Brennan was born in New York on May 24, 1918, one of seven children of a unionized ironworker, who died in an influenza epidemic in 1921, leaving his widow to raise the family. Peter Brennan graduated from Commerce High School and went to work as an apprentice painter, becoming a journeyman with a coveted membership in Local 1456 of the Painters Union.
During World War II, he was in the Navy as a chief petty officer aboard a submarine in the Pacific, operating mostly out of Guam. After the war, he returned to the paint pots, but became increasingly involved in his union's activities. In 1947, he was elected business manager of the local.
Regarded as a tough negotiator and a rising young star in the construction trades, he became a protege of Howard McSpedon, president of the city Building and Construction Trades Council. In 1951, he was appointed as director of the council's maintenance division.
In 1957, when Mr. McSpedon resigned, Mr. Brennan was elected president of the building trades groups. For several months each year thereafter, he was in Albany, lobbying for pending legislative measures favored by the council.
Colleagues said he was respected by legislators for his directness and grasp of complex laws and political nuances. They said he often worked 12-hour days, meeting with building company managers to solve workplace problems, mediating quarrels among council affiliates, addressing public forums and maintaining relations with the council's allies in labor and politics.
Mr. Brennan also held a wide range of appointed positions, including memberships on New York State Urban Development Corporation, the state's Job Development Authority and its Workmen's Compensation Advisory Committee. He was also an official of the Police Athletic League and the United Fund of Greater New York, and was active in the Youth Council and the Boy Scouts.
His wife, the former Josephine Brickel, died in 1987. In addition to Mrs. Tetro, he is survived by a son, Peter Jr., of Massapequa; a daughter, Peggy Tritto of San Jose, Calif.; a brother, John of Westbury, L.I.; eight grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Pressures Time Warner to Transmit a Fox Channel

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration has thrust itself into the middle of a rancorous dispute between Time Warner and Rupert Murdoch by asking for permission to carry Mr. Murdoch's new 24-hour news channel on a public-access cable channel the city controls.
Time Warner immediately rejected the request. But city officials said they were not ready to give up, raising the prospect of a showdown between City Hall and New York's dominant cable television provider, whose franchise agreement with the city is up for renewal in 1998. 
 The city's unusual request came in a letter and several phone calls this week from Fran Reiter, the Deputy Mayor for Economic Planning and Development, to the president of Time Warner, Richard D. Parsons. City officials said they were supporting Mr. Murdoch's efforts to promote his fledgling news channel because it would mean jobs for the city, but experts said the city's involvement raised a host of legal questions.
Time Warner recently refused to carry the Fox channel, which is to debut on Monday, on its 1.1-million-subscriber New York City cable system, instead backing a rival service owned by NBC, a unit of General Electric, and the Microsoft Corporation. The News Corporation has threatened to retaliate by refusing to carry some Time Warner programming services on its television networks.
After a reporter inquired yesterday about the city's request, Time Warner issued a terse reply, saying in a letter to Ms. Reiter that such an arrangement would violate both Federal law and the terms of the company's agreement with the city. "It is therefore a request we cannot and will not consider," said the letter, which was signed by Peter R. Haje, the company's general counsel.
But city officials insisted last night that their request was legitimate and said they would meet today to consider their next move. The dispute between the News Corporation and Time Warner puts the Giuliani administration in a delicate political situation since both Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Parsons have been strong supporters of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
In her letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, Ms. Reiter said the city felt obliged to act because the News Corporation recently agreed to maintain its United States headquarters and base its news channel in New York, which would generate 1,475 new jobs.
But she said the company had informed the city that it "could no longer guarantee the creation of these new jobs" if the Fox News Channel was not carried by Time Warner.
Several communications lawyers said yesterday that the city's request could run afoul of Federal law. The Cable Act of 1984 prohibits city governments from using public-access channels for commercial programming and also forbids municipalities from imposing any programming requirements on cable operators.
"I would tend to think this won't fly," said one prominent communications lawyer, who declined to be identified. "It looks odd to have a government channel being used for openly commercial purposes."
Ms. Reiter was on vacation in Scotland yesterday and could not reached for comment. But her chief of staff, David Klasfeld, said, "In a city as large as this, it's important there be as many major sources of news coverage as possible."
Howard Rubinstein, a spokesman for Mr. Murdoch, said Mr. Murdoch would have no comment.
Mr. Klasfeld said the city could not order Time Warner to grant its request. But the company clearly would prefer to avoid a battle with the city over the issue, especially given that its franchise agreements are up for renewal in 1998.
As part of its franchise agreement with Time Warner, New York City has access to five channels in the upper range of the television dial, which are known collectively as Crosswalks. The channels show a mix of educational programs from the City University of New York, City Hall news conferences and information about public events. There are no ads.
In her letter, Ms. Reiter proposed placing the Fox News Channel on one of those channels. The News Corporation would pay the city for access to the channel and give unspecific support to other Crosswalks channels. In return, it would be allowed to carry commercials.
The News Corporation has said that gaining cable distribution in New York City was vital to the future of the Fox News Channel. The city's other big cable operator, Cablevision, which has about 400,000 subscribers in Brooklyn and the Bronx, will carry the channel.
The two other national news services -- CNN and MSNBC -- are both distributed in New York City on Time Warner's system.
Executives at the News Corporation said the company had enlisted the city's help in persuading Time Warner to reverse its decision. These people, who declined to be identified, said the company had pointed out to city officials that CNN was based in Atlanta and MSNBC was in Secaucus, N.J. Mr. Murdoch, on the other hand, has built a large studio for the Fox News Channel on the ground floor of an office tower in midtown Manhattan.
"Rupert could very well pull this network out of Manhattan, and put it in Secaucus, where MSNBC is," one executive said
In the same week that Time Warner rebuffed Mr. Murdoch's channel, it agreed to double MSNBC's distribution. MSNBC is jointly owned by NBC and Microsoft.
That decision angered Mr. Murdoch, who had reportedly offered to pay Time Warner $110 million for access to the company's 1.1 million subscribers.
Executives at the News Corporation noted that Time Warner was about to take control of Turner Broadcasting System, which owns CNN. And they have suggested that Time Warner was trying to diminish the challenge to CNN by favoring the weaker of the two competing all-news channels.
But people at Time Warner said that the company was simply honoring a pre-existing contract with NBC to carry a predecessor channel to MSNBC, America's Talking.
Privately, they have accused Mr. Murdoch of attacking Time Warner and its chairman, Gerald M. Levin, in the pages of The New York Post, which is also owned by News Corporation.

HEADLINE: Court Halts Sandblasting on Bridges Until Studies Are Completed

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

 BODY:
A state court has blocked sandblasting on all New York City bridges, pending environmental studies and public hearings, in a ruling that deepens a controversy arising from lead-paint removal on the Williamsburg Bridge.
The ruling by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court expands an earlier order halting sandblasting only on the Williamsburg Bridge, and addresses again the well-known health hazards of lead-paint residue. 
 While only a few words in the latest ruling by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court differ from the court's earlier ruling, the new decree has far-reaching effects. It is likely to stop sandblasting for weeks or even months, until the city complies with the environmental-review process or tries to fight the ruling before the Court of Appeals, the state's highest tribunal.
It is by no means certain that the city will get permission to go to the high court, or win there if it does, because this week's Appellate Division decree and the June decision that it modified were unanimous 5-to-0 rulings, from which there is no automatic right of appeal.
Nor was it clear yesterday how many of the 838 city-owned bridges were undergoing lead-paint removal as part of their maintenance. The Department of Transportation said it did not immediately know how many bridges were involved. Matthew J. Chachere, a lawyer for people who have been battling the sandblasting for several years, said he thought 20 or more spans might be affected.
Leonard Koerner, the chief of the corporation counsel's appeals unit, said yesterday that "obviously, the city is concerned," and that the city had 30 days to decide whether to agree to the environmental-review steps or to try an appeal.
The paint at the heart of a legal, political and social controversy was applied years ago, before the health hazards of dust and chips from lead paint became widely known. Doctors and environmental experts now agree that even tiny traces of lead paint can cause permanent harm, especially in children.
When the sandblasting on the Williamsburg Bridge began in the summer of 1992, it touched off an uproar. Residents on both the Brooklyn and Manhattan sides of the span complained that paint chips were raining on their yards, sidewalks and playgrounds.
City officials maintained that the sandblasting, part of an extensive refurbishing, was as necessary on the turn-of-the-century Williamsburg Bridge as it is on other spans. But neighborhood residents heard their worries validated by health experts, and they were not appeased by precautions that included a protective tent meant to keep paint chips from flying into the air.
The Appellate Division, in June, declared that the city had paid too little heed to community feelings, and it borrowed from the wording of a lower court ruling that "by all accounts, the project was a public relations and public health fiasco."
The latest court decision, issued with little fanfare this week, closes what Mr. Chachere called "an enormous loophole" that he said the city had used to its advantage.
In its June ruling, the Appellate Division had ordered the city to either conduct environmental studies or to issue a "negative declaration": that is, an assertion that the paint-removal work had no environmental significance.
While Mr. Chachere would not say so yesterday, it seemed clear from the text of arguments before the Appellate Division in early July that he was surprised, perhaps even baffled, by the court's wording in June.
Mr. Chachere argued in July that the court's invitation to the city to issue a "negative declaration" was contrary to the overall rationale of its ruling, in which the justices agreed with a lower court finding that the city had failed to adequately study the sandblasting's possible effects on the environment.
The city actually resumed sandblasting on the Williamsburg Bridge for a short time in July, while the Appellate Division was considering a change in its original language, said Mr. Chachere, who represents the Northern Manhattan Improvement Corporation. But the appellate court said it wanted the work stopped while it reconsidered its own ruling.
The lawyer said that this week's development -- in which the appellate court removed precisely the ambiguous language the plaintiffs had complained about -- vindicated their position.
Mr. Chachere and other critics of the sandblasting were quick to criticize the city anew yesterday. Conceding that getting rid of the hazardous paint chips "is an admirable thing to do," the lawyer said that "our position has always been that we want it done safely."
Assemblyman Joseph R. Lentol, a Brooklyn Democrat who is one of the plaintiffs against the city, said, "Not only has the city reneged on its promise to protect public health, but through outright refusal to abide by the law has also caused the unemployment of more than 100 bridge painters."
Asked why the Williamsburg Bridge blasting had caused such controversy when similar work has been done on other spans, Mr. Chachere said that in the neighborhoods on both sides of the Williamsburg, "the people were vigilant enough to see what was going on."

HEADLINE: Big Retailer Is Said to Bid For Barney's

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Dickson Concepts Ltd., a retail giant based in Hong Kong, has made an initial offer to buy Barney's Inc., several people close to the situation said yesterday.
While it is unclear how much Dickson Concepts is offering for Barney's, which filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act last January, the offer is said to be between $300 million and $400 million. The Hong Kong retailer has made its intentions known to Blackstone Group, the investment bank that is advising Barney's. 
 It is also unclear whether the price includes the company's Asian license, which has often been valued at $200 million, and is considered the tastiest and most useful chunk of the retail company. Also in question is whether the offer includes buildings owned by Barney's.
Left out of the loop has been Isetan Inc., the American retailer's Japanese partner with which Barney's has been fighting since the Chapter 11 filing.
Isetan's absence from any role in the deal appears to be the latest sign of a growing gap between that company and others on the creditors committee.
When Barney's filed for bankruptcy protection, it was under pressure because of a cash crunch and a dispute with Isetan, which paid for the construction of the three flagship Barney's stores -- in Chicago, Beverly Hills and New York -- and now says it is owed millions of dollars in rent for those buildings.
Bob and Gene Pressman, who own Barney's, have long argued that Isetan's bore the building costs in exchange for an equity stake in the business, and they sued their partner when they filed for Chapter 11 protection. Dickson's original offer apparently included alternate plans, both excluding and including a future role for Isetan.
Earlier this week, the creditors committee filed papers in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, seeking to become a co-plaintiff with Barney's in its claim against Isetan. The committee agreed with Barney's that the Japanese company should be considered an equity partner -- rather than a creditor -- and therefore not entitled to rent or $177 million from building loans.
"The litigation is about recasting the leases," said Lawrence M. Handelsman, the lawyer for the creditors committee. "The committee wants to intervene and participate." Bankruptcy Judge James L. Garrity is to decide this month whether to make a summary judgment on the rent issue.
A rift between Isetan and other committee members has deepened since July, when Isetan announced, without having consulted the rest of the concerned parties, that it was working with Saks Fifth Avenue to find a way to take over Barney's. Furious that Isetan would put its interest before those of the others, the creditors committee has formed an odd alliance with the very company that owes its members millions of dollars.
The greatest manifestation of this alliance is the co-plantiff position on the rent issue, but it has also resulted in shutting Isetan out of talks, not letting Isetan know the progress of Dickson's courting efforts and occasionally sending Isetan representatives out of the room during negotiations.
"Isetan tends to make life difficult because their attitude is that if you take the position that these are not leases, then you are their mortal enemy," said a person close to the talks who insisted on anonymity. "But at the end of the day, it will all get settled because the economics require that."
Barney's executives declined to comment, and lawyers for Isetan did not return phone calls yesterday.
The motives of the creditors committee are clear enough. Should Isetan be proclaimed an equity partner rather than a wronged landlord, Isetan could suddenly find itself in the same position as Barney's; when the cash is divided, creditors get preference, and those with equity interests collect only if there is money left over after the creditors are paid.
Further, the creditors committee obviously wants the richest acquisition offer available. That is not likely to be Saks's, given that the debt-ridden retailer would like to pay for Barney's with stock. Also, Saks may not want to battle with the rest of the creditors committee, which has hired the investment bank Peter J. Solomon Company to advise it.
"It seems that the battle lines have shifted," said Lisa Stern, an analyst at M. J. Whitman, which specializes in distressed securities. "Before, it was Barney's verses the creditors committee. Now, Isetan has angered everyone by appearing to be self- dealing."
Dickson Poon, chief executive of Dickson Concepts, has been looking into Barney's for several months, and his interests appear to make sense.
Dickson Concepts owns stores in Hong Kong, as well as Harvey Nichols, a London retailer whose upscale merchandise and sensibilities are similar to those of Barney's. It also has retailing rights across Asia, with a number of high-end brands. It recently agreed to pay $23.2 million for a controlling stake in the Hong Kong and Chinese arm of Seibu Department Stores, a big Japanese retailer that competes with Isetan. Barney's would give the company a foothold in the United States, where it currently has no presence.
"It makes a lot of sense for Dickson in many ways," Ms. Stern said. "Poon is a go-go young guy who would get along with Gene Pressman. And given what is going on in Hong Kong, he likely wants to get a big investment out of there and into U.S. dollars."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE DEBATE;
CLINTON IN NORTH, AND DOLE IN SOUTH, STUDY FOR DEBATE

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: BAL HARBOUR, Fla., Oct. 3

 BODY:
President Clinton and Bob Dole today headed into three days of secluded preparation for Sunday's Presidential debate, using their final campaign appearances to preview themes for the encounter: Mr. Clinton flaunted his domestic record, while Mr. Dole offered his toughest assessment yet of the President's foreign policy. 
 Mr. Dole, who has seen his campaign overshadowed by a week of Middle East fighting and peace efforts, sought to take back the spotlight in a swing through the South. Less than 24 hours after the disappointing end of the Middle East summit talks, Mr. Dole belittled the President's foreign policy record as a "string of failures dressed up for television as victories." He also suggested that Mr. Clinton had staged the summit talks with an eye to the November election.
The President moved in the opposite direction. Seeking to leave his troubled week of peacemaking behind him, he turned to domestic concerns. He was the host at a Rose Garden ceremony in which he signed into law bills to fight illegal drugs, keep track of sex offenders and provide college funds for the children of slain police officers. Then he flew to an airport rally in Buffalo, where he was greeted by shivering supporters gathered to hear him in the autumn chill. "This is a better country now," Mr. Clinton told them, rattling off statistics to support his point.
By nightfall, both candidates had settled into what will be their respective debate seminaries for the next three days. With a small army of aides and advisers, Mr. Clinton headed to the Chautauqua Institution, a 750-acre lake front vacation retreat, to study briefing books, stage practice sessions and, he hopes, play golf.
Mr. Dole flew to this South Florida resort community and went to his condominium on the 12th floor of the Seaview Hotel, where a first-floor ballroom had been set up to replicate the theater setting he will face this Sunday in Hartford.
Simultaneously, the Dole and Clinton campaigns began a new series of television advertisements, again geared to framing the debate. Mr. Dole's advertisement begins with an announcer saying, "How to speak liberal," and goes on to discuss Mr. Clinton's record of raising taxes.
Mr. Clinton's advertisement portrays the President as a social conservative as it links the former Senate majority leader to House Speaker Newt Gingrich and asserts that they were responsible for unpopular cuts in social spending.
Of the two candidates, Mr. Dole had a far more visible day on the campaign trail, intent on making up for attention lost as the President served as host for the Middle East discussions.
With the political stage finally clear, Mr. Dole offered his strongest and most encompassing critique of Mr. Clinton's foreign policy record to date. The speech was partly intended to raise doubts about Mr. Clinton's record and credibility heading into the debate. It also reflected increasing sentiment among Mr. Dole's advisers that he elevate foreign policy to the front of his campaign, even if it means taking the politically unconventional step of assailing American policy amid a crisis.
"Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration's foreign policy is, in my view, rudderless and illusory," Mr. Dole said at a luncheon at the Eastern Tennessee State University in Johnson City. "My concern today is not with the crisis of the moment -- it is not what is happening over in the Middle East -- but for the record of this Administration.
"In the last three years, you and I have seen a series of photo opportunities, treaty signing, staged handshakes and even military theatrics -- all designed to create the impression of foreign policy progress."
Mr. Dole argued that Mr. Clinton had inherited from President George Bush a powerful presence on the world stage, but had then "squandered American power."
"Let's face it: if President Bush had any strength, it was in foreign policy," Mr. Dole said. "The fact is that President Clinton inherited a strong, secure country at peace, and nearly four years later our friends no longer respect us, and our enemies no longer fear us, and no Administration in memory has so frequently deployed American forces to zones of conflict, and so casually undertaken the use of force."
Mr. Dole criticized Mr. Clinton's foreign policy effort around the globe and throughout the President's 45 months in office: from Bosnia to Northern Ireland, from North Korea to Cuba, from Somalia to Haiti. Mr. Dole was particularly harsh in his assessment of Mr. Clinton's most recent foreign policy endeavor, in Iraq, which he said has left the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, "better off today than he was a few weeks ago."
"For the first time in five years," Mr. Dole added, "Saddam is back in charge of northern Iraq."
Today's speech was keyed to Mr. Clinton's Middle East summit talks, which Mr. Dole suggested was politically motivated. "I was disappointed that President Clinton's statement did not include an unequivocal condemnation of recent violence," the former Senator said. "Frankly, it may be unclear to some what the President expected out of such a meeting, and some have suggested, I've seen, that he may have had on his mind Nov. 5," Election Day.
But Mr. Dole did not offer any suggestions on what Mr. Clinton might have done to affect the outcome. "Of course the Israelis and Palestinians will continue and must continue to negotiate, and as the summit demonstrated, the United States cannot impose a settlement," Mr. Dole said. "However, we can stand clearly in support of a peaceful resolution of differences between the Israelis and the Palestinians for a truly just peace."
Even with Mr. Dole's attempt to use the Middle East crisis as a springboard to discuss foreign policy, the attention of both campaigns was shifting to the Bushnell auditorium in Hartford this Sunday, where the debate will be held. And with these last public campaign appearances by the major party candidates -- Ross Perot, the Reform Party candidate, was excluded from the debates -- Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton used their speeches and television advertisements today to set public impressions and expectations for a debate that Mr. Dole's aides in particular view as vital.
The attack on Mr. Clinton's foreign policy was intended to reinforce Mr. Dole's position that the President is untrustworthy. Later today, in Atlanta, Mr. Dole returned to a refrain that he promised Mr. Clinton would hear this Sunday: that he is intellectually unprincipled and a political liberal.
"The American people have had too many years of double-speaking, and it's time for plain speaking, and Bob Dole is plain speaking," Mr. Dole said. "What I say, you can believe -- that's the big difference."
By contrast, Mr. Clinton, at his airport rally, offered the bouncy and happy rhetoric that has characterized his campaign stops, at least until this week's summit meeting.
"Compared to four years ago, there's a lot of good news," Mr. Clinton asserted. "Ten and a half million new jobs. Average family income is up $1,600 after inflation since we passed the economic plan that our opponents said would drive the country into the ditch."
The importance that Mr. Dole in particular attaches to Sunday's debate could be seen in where he chose to spend his day: in the South, a region where Republicans had expected by this point to be far ahead in the Presidential campaign. Polls in Georgia showed that in that state, as in much of the country, Mr. Clinton has a substantial lead over his Republican opponent.
Mr. Dole alluded to the debate several times today, telling a Hartford radio station at one point, "I haven't been this scared in a long time."

New York City Enters Fray In Rancorous Cable Feud
New York City has thrust itself into the middle of a rancorous dispute between Time Warner and Rupert Murdoch by asking for permission to carry Mr. Murdoch's new 24-hour news channel on a public-access cable station the city controls. Time Warner immediately rejected the request, raising the prospect of a showdown between City Hall and New York's dominant cable television provider, whose franchise agreement with the city is up for renewal in 1998. City officials said they were supporting Mr. Murdoch's efforts because it would mean jobs for the city. [Page B1.]

Little Progress In G.M. Strike
Negotiations between General Motors and the Canadian Automobile Workers union showed little progress after 15,000 assembly workers began walking picket lines. Jane Armstrong, a union spokeswoman, said negotiators met twice during the day, but were accomplishing very little. "Talks are continuing, but absolutely no progress," she said. [D2.]

Markets Pause Before Jobs Data
The stock market's record-setting advance paused, pulling most indexes lower as investors waited to see if today's employment report justifies an optimistic outlook on inflation and interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average, which closed at new highs on Tuesday and Wednesday, slipped 1.12 points, to 5,932.85. [D6.]

The bond market also waited for today's employment data and few investors seemed willing to make large commitments. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.83 percent, from 6.84 percent on Wednesday. [D16.]

Factory Orders Down Sharply
New orders to factories tumbled 1.9 percent in August, the sharpest fall in three and a half years, the Commerce Department said. [D4.]
 
Kohlberg Kravis to Buy Kindercare
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. agreed to buy Kindercare Learning Centers, the nation's largest child care company, for $467 million, or $20.25 a share. Kohlberg Kravis will also assume $130 million of Kindercare debt. [D3.]
 
Kodak in Talks to Buy Wang Unit
Eastman Kodak is in negotiations to buy Wang's document imaging software business. Analysts said Kodak would pay between $300 and $400 million for the Wang unit. [D3.]

Authentic Fitness Takes Charges
Authentic Fitness, owner of the Speedo trademark in North America, said it was abandoning the skiwear business, closing its outlet stores and restating second- and third-quarter results to add $18.8 million in reserves to cover potential losses. [D3.]
 
U.S. to Rescue Pension Plan
The Government announced a rescue plan for the battered pension fund covering 70,000 unionized workers in the men's suit industry. The plan, the first of its type involving an entire industry, is supported by the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees and by the Clothing Manufacturers Association. [D6.]
 
Ratings Pressure at WCBS
The abrupt dismissal of seven anchors and reporters from WCBS-TV illuminated the intense pressure for ratings among television stations competing in the enormously lucrative local news market. [B4.]

HEADLINE: TENSION IN THE MIDDLE EAST: THE PALESTINIANS;
A Shadow Over the Mideast: Arab Youths on a Short Fuse

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: AL AROUB, West Bank, Oct. 3

 BODY:
A group of teen-agers wearing old jeans and dirty sneakers clambered up to the rooftops early this morning to let the Israeli soldiers below know what they thought of the summit meeting that ended the night before in Washington.
Bottles filled with gasoline and topped with burning rags flew in graceful arcs toward the lonely ribbon of asphalt in this community, officially designated a refugee camp by the United Nations, in a zone still patrolled by Israelis. As the gasoline bombs rained down, a half-dozen Israeli paratroopers wearing helmets, hugging either side of the street, pointed their M-16 assault rifles, equipped with bulbous grenade launchers under the barrels, toward their attackers. 
 The young Palestinians, experienced street fighters, ducked, crouched and scampered to avoid detection until the troops let loose with a warning volley. The Palestinian youths melted away; no one was wounded and the confrontation ended as suddenly as it had begun.
Frightened families slammed their shutters tight. Children let out wails of fear. And the troops pulled back behind some trees, anxiously scanning the maze of concrete hovels for any movement. There was none. The refugee camp fell still and silent.
The mini-battle, recounted in detail by Israeli troops and camp residents minutes after it ended, could have been lifted from the six-year-long Palestinian uprising known as the intifada that started in late 1987. But, deep below the surface, the differences were profound and bode ill for any future conflict that might erupt if the faltering peace process sputters out.
The young men who carried out this assault have little schooling, no jobs, no hopes of getting any jobs and a future so bleak that confrontation has become a vocation. It would be easy to say they have become Islamic radicals; they all say they are believers. But in fact they seem to have little ideology, saying that they will back anyone, whether it is Yasir Arafat's 30,000-strong Palestinian police force, or the militant Islamic group Hamas, willing to kill Jews.
"The moment the Palestinian police opened fire on the Jewish troops last week they became our brothers," said Jamal Abu Mohammed, a teen-ager, as he stood at the edge of the camp. "Before that they had been Israeli rent-a-cops in Arab uniforms. But now they have proved that they are with us. We are all one now. We will together drive the Jewish occupiers from our land."
Al Aroub refugee camp, about seven miles outside of Hebron, is a squalid warren surrounded by a chain-link fence patrolled by Israeli paratroopers in red berets, several of whom said they did not particularly like their job. There are no trees, gardens, patches of grass or even flower boxes to offset the hard, dusty rocks and gray concrete blocks that make up the walls of houses that see six or eight people packed to a room. The camp, like the city of Hebron, remains under round-the-clock curfew, and the confrontation this morning ended any hopes of the 5,000 people trapped inside that they would get an hour to go buy food.
The six-year uprising of the late 1980's and 1990's, which finally drove the Israelis to negotiate a peace accord with Mr. Arafat, was carried out by young men whose parents had often proved docile and compliant under Israeli occupation. Many took to the streets in 1988 because they saw their parents, who had lost their homes and their businesses, humiliated day after day by the Israelis.
Those that began that uprising are now in their 20's. Some have joined the Palestinian police, others have started families and work at menial jobs. They can still recall, from before the previous uprising anyway, lives with stable homes, traditional ties, enough income to survive and the driving ambition that once made the Palestinians the best-educated Arabs in the Middle East.
All that has changed, especially with the loss of the hundreds of millions of dollars in remittances that once poured into the West Bank and Gaza from Palestinians who worked in the Persian Gulf before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
Now, a generation is growing up knowing curfews, shootings, closed borders with Israel and grinding poverty. Many had older brothers who were crippled or killed by Israeli gunfire and fathers who lost their jobs. Few spent much time in school.
"The old uprising was carried out to establish our own state," said Abu Ahmed. "But if the violence begins again, it will lead to a war where our goal will be to exterminate the Jews."
A year after self-rule was extended to parts of the West Bank and Gaza, nearly all Palestinians find themselves banned from Israeli territory, an edict that took force after a series of suicide bombings in Israel in February and March. The economy has ground to a halt. Palestinian cities lie ringed by Israeli tanks and armored vehicles, severing ties between 450 towns and communities. And Israeli troops have blocked off dozens of roads leading into Israel with concrete barricades.
Interviews here suggest that if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel refuses to push ahead with the Oslo peace accords, he will face a different foe than the one Israel grew accustomed to in the past, one far readier to die.
Most Palestinians interviewed today said Mr. Netanyahu had one last chance to salvage the peace process when talks begin at the edge of the Gaza Strip on Sunday. If that fails, they said, there will be no holding back the volcanic rumblings of hatred and frustration that fuel many young and desperate Palestinians.
"There is a terrible fury brewing here," said Hama Abu Ghoush, 32. "It frightens even me. We are hanging by a thread. If the talks on Sunday fail, if we are convinced that the peace process is dead, then it will kill all our hope for a better life. Many people, already depressed, are too tired to fight. But there is a whole generation with nothing more to lose. They want only vengeance and blood. All they are waiting for is the signal to start."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: Campaign Trail;
THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

 BODY:

What Campaign?
More evidence that ignorance is bliss: with the general-election Presidential campaign now six weeks old, a new study indicates that citizens in nearly a third of the 50 states have yet to sit through a Bob Dole or Bill Clinton stump speech or zap their way through a Presidential attack commercial.
Indeed, for most campaign purposes save the final counting of electoral votes, the states might as well be in Paraguay. 
 The Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, which tracks such matters, reports this week that the two campaigns effectively ignored 17 central and Southern states during September, neither sending their top candidate nor buying significant television advertisement there.
An independent check of the campaigns' activities since the August conventions draws a similar conclusion: in 15 states, neither campaign has scheduled a Presidential candidate's appearance nor bought much, if any, television time. The 15 include not just the expected states, like rock-ribbed Republican Alaska and solidly Democratic Hawaii, but those nominally up for grabs, like Oklahoma, Alabama and Indiana.
The explanation? "The general election in a Presidential campaign is run on the same principles as a battle in World War I: each side just rams at each other," Bill Knapp, a principal in the Clinton campaign's advertising team, said in an interview. "They're going to spend the bulk of their resources in a dozen states, and thus you're going to spend the bulk of your resources in a dozen states to blunt them." Nor will either campaign spend much time in states it has either locked up or conceded to the opposition.
That leaves a handful of mostly Southern states that both campaigns might claim in November but seem to have put aside for now. Mr. Dole holds a narrow lead in most of them and has more pressing uses for his money. The Clinton campaign, sitting on a hoard of electoral votes, has the luxury of addressing them later.
So to Idaho, North Dakota, Minnesota and most of the other 12 American Paraguays, hasta la vista until November, baby.
On the other hand, says John Buckley, the Dole campaign's communications director, "if you're a voter living in, say, Canton, Ohio, you're going to think you're being stalked by these two candidates."

Archeopolitics
The folks who run the White House political machine have long dismissed Whitewater as ancient history. Maybe they're right; the latest evidence from the campaign trail suggests that they have a doctoral degree in the field.
When Bob Dole trooped into Lancaster County, Pa., this week to speak at tiny Elizabethtown College, Mr. Clinton's opposition-research squad was already on the ground and firing live bullets. In telephone calls and press releases, both the Pennsylvania Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign charged that Mr. Dole had once voted against giving the school $387,750 to build classrooms and expand a library.
"Only in Bob Dole's world can he travel to Elizabethtown College -- the place where he voted against aid for its buildings -- and pose as a friend of students," the Clinton press release said.
Pennsylvania Democrats heaped scorn on Mr. Dole, quoting one of the school's students, Jennifer Shockley, in its release as saying, "Maybe Bob Dole thinks that because he voted against our school before we were born we wouldn't notice."
On closer inspection, it is doubtful that even Mr. Dole noticed. Mr. Dole cast his 'nay' vote almost 33 years ago, Nov. 6, 1963, on the Higher Education Facilities Act, an omnibus-consolidated-grab-bag-public-works bill loaded with what some critics might today call political pork.
Elizabethtown College's $387,750 was part of a $14 million allotment to the Keystone State. That, in turn, was but a sliver of the $1.2 billion that the bill allotted for various higher-education projects.
Bob Dole was a second-term Congressman in 1963, at the start of his political career. And Bill Clinton was in the Rose Garden that same year, shaking John F. Kennedy's hand.

Economists for Clinton
 Harry S. Truman used to joke that he wanted a one-armed economist, so he would never have to hear the word "on the other hand" from an economic adviser again.
Some jokes are timeless.
Bob Dole claimed the support of 100 prominent economists, including Nobel laureates, when he unwrapped his plan to slash income and investment taxes and Federal spending. Now The Economist, the British news magazine, has produced a survey indicating that a lot of other prominent economists do not agree.
The magazine polled 60 "randomly chosen" macroeconomists at major American universities last month, and most of the 41 who replied said they favored President Clinton's economic themes. Mr. Clinton's proposed tax cuts were endorsed by 46 percent of the economists, versus 22 percent for Mr. Dole ("neither" took second place with 32 percent). By a resounding 83 percent to 17 percent, the academics said they did not believe Mr. Dole's plan would produce a balanced budget without cutting Medicare and military spending.
Seventy-eight percent doubted Mr. Dole's assertion that he could pay for a fourth of his plan's tax cuts through swifter economic growth. And a mere 12 percent believed cutting income-tax rates and spending would give the economy a major boost. One Dole issue -- shifting from an income tax to a consumption tax -- did gain their favor, by 63 to 37 percent.
All told, the economists agreed 71 to 29 percent that a second Clinton term would benefit the economy more than a Dole Presidency. But there were strings attached: more than half said the best economic policies would emerge from a Democratic White House offset by a Congress at least partly in Republican hands.

HEADLINE: Daniel Ortega's Second Act

 BODY:
Few politicians seem less suited for a political comeback than Daniel Ortega. The dour leader of Nicaragua's Sandinista Front in the revolutionary 1980's, Mr. Ortega seemed allergic to charisma. His political judgment led him into such misadventures as visiting Moscow just before a Congressional vote on American aid to the contra rebels fighting his Government. The Reagan Administration's war on Nicaragua, compounded by Sandinista economic ineptitude, brought the country an inflation rate of 30,000 percent. Before he turned over the presidency to Violeta Chamorro in 1990, Mr. Ortega and other Sandinista leaders indulged in an ugly grab of property and houses. Yet despite all, he has pulled even with the front-runner in the current presidential race. Voting is later this month.
The leading candidates represent two extremes, and either winner would be destabilizing after Mrs. Chamorro's politics of reconciliation. No matter who wins, the election is proof that Nicaragua has come far. Mr. Ortega scheduled the country's first real elections, in 1990, when polls indicated he would win. When he lost, he surprised many by leaving office without a fight. Today few doubt that the elections will be free and the results respected. 
 Mr. Ortega's rival is Arnoldo Aleman, a conservative who boasts he is the favorite of the United States. As Mayor of Managua he received American aid for paving roads and other projects, and gained a reputation as a doer. He has authoritarian tendencies, and many poor people do not like the rich oligarchs who make up his circle of friends. His support has stalled at 40 percent.
Mr. Ortega has taken a sharp and not very credible turn to the center for this campaign. His vice-presidential candidate is a rancher whose land was expropriated by the Sandinistas. He has pledged support for a market economy. The Sandinista hymn, which contained the line "We fight the Yankee, enemy of humanity," has been dropped in favor of Beethoven's "Ode to Joy."
Most of his supporters are not nostalgic for the Sandinista years, merely desperate for change. The slums around Managua grow larger and bleaker daily. Crime is soaring. Former combatants still fight in parts of the countryside. The overwhelming problem is the economy. Mrs. Chamorro's Government conquered inflation, but its austerity program has led to extremely high unemployment.
Many Aleman backers hope that a victory by him will inspire investment back home by wealthy expatriate Nicaraguans in Miami. Many supporters of Mr. Ortega are hoping that he will put them in new government jobs if he wins. This hope of patronage on both sides reflects a widespread cynicism inspired by the frustrating divisions in Nicaraguan politics. There are 26 parties competing in the election, and the ballot is more than a yard long.
The ultimate rich outsider, of course, is the United States. This is Mr. Aleman's strong suit. Mr. Ortega says he wants good relations, but he will probably get no aid if Jesse Helms, who has blocked aid even to Mrs. Chamorro's Government, remains in the Senate. Regardless of who wins, Nicaraguans will continue to depend on remittances from relatives working in America. The Sandinistas told the Yankees to go home. Today, many Nicaraguans would add, "and take me with you."

HEADLINE: Protecting Farm Workers

 BODY:
A surprising aspect of American labor's new vigor is the resurgence of the United Farm Workers. After a two-decade slide from its heyday in the 1970's, a union made up of hard-to-organize transients -- many of them illegal immigrants -- grew at the fastest rate of any union last year. But the U.F.W. still claims only 26,000 members out of roughly 1.6 million farm workers. For those not in the union, conditions are as appalling as ever.
Until the minimum-wage increase this week, wages for workers harvesting some crops were at their lowest point in terms of purchasing power in decades. In direct violation of Federal and state laws, many workers do not have access to water or toilets in the field and are not paid benefits such as unemployment. Although they are supposed to make the minimum wage, farm workers' lawyers have documented numerous cases in which workers are paid only $2 or $3 an hour. 
 In the 1930's, farm workers, then largely black, were left out of the New Deal because President Roosevelt needed support from Southern senators. Only in 1963 did they get a minimum wage or Social Security, or coverage by health and safety laws.
Today farm work differs from most other labor in two important ways. Competition for jobs is fiercer. America already has too many farm workers, and with Mexico's economic crisis the flow of illegal immigrants rose, creating more competition for agricultural jobs. Most farm workers are Latino or Caribbean immigrants, many of whom are naturalized. About a third are illegal immigrants.
Farm workers' second big handicap is that belatedly won legal protections are often not enforced. Illegal immigrants seldom complain when mistreated. Only in California does the law permit farm workers to form unions. The few Legal Services lawyers who do farm workers' cases took a 33 percent budget cut last year.
One practice that allows many growers to get around the laws is the increasing use of labor contractors. Growers pay a crew leader a lump sum to hire workers at harvest time. They can then say that the crew leader is responsible for providing field water, toilets and all the payroll details.
The crew leader, however, is often merely a former farm worker who bought an old truck. He does not have the money or know-how to supply sanitation or handle Social Security. Often the grower does not pay the crew leader enough to give the workers minimum wage. Yet when farm workers have sued for wages owed them, the growers have successfully responded that they are not the employers, and pointed to the crew leader. Fortunately, a Federal court in Atlanta decided a case this July that may make it harder for growers to use this diversionary claim to escape payment.
Such abuse could be deterred by better law enforcement. The Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division has only three farm labor inspectors in Florida, and they also have to enforce dozens of other laws. In California, it would take the state's wage and health inspectors 150 years at current rates to visit every farm just once.
Farm workers should be able to unionize, consult effective lawyers and enjoy regular visits from a larger staff of inspectors. The only reason they were denied the legal protections other workers got in the 1930's is that they lacked clout. Today their powerlessness keeps the laws from being enforced.

HEADLINE: Sales by Ford Aid a Strong September for Auto Makers

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 3

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company reported today that sales of its cars and light trucks rose 7.3 percent in September, contributing to a stronger-than-expected gain for the auto industry last month.
Auto makers' sales in the United States over all rose 5.9 percent, bolstered in part by offers of cash-back discounts and subsidized leasing deals. 
 Sales of sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks led the way, rising 12.5 percent in September, compared with the comparable period a year ago. Car sales edged up 1.6 percent, helped by the discounts offered to customers.
Auto executives were optimistic about their prospects. "Inflation appears to be in check, consumer confidence is high, the economy continues to grow moderately and interest rates have stayed in a range that historically has supported good sales levels," said Bob Rewey, group vice president of marketing and sales at Ford. "All in all, the outlook for the new model year is a healthy one."
Still, some analysts said today that the strong sales this month signaled that sales would decline later this year. "We are starting to run on borrowed time," said Jack V. Kirnan, an auto analyst with Salomon Brothers. Sales have been strong so far this year, but the fact that auto makers must increasingly woo customers with discounts suggests that the market, left to its own devices, would be slowing.
"A lot of the pent-up demand has been exhausted," Mr. Kirnan said.
A slowdown would be consistent with other signs this week that the economy as a whole is growing moderately. On Tuesday, a September survey of corporate purchasing managers' spending plans showed declines from August levels. The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators was nearly flat in August, rising two-tenths of 1 percent. And there were modest declines in retail sales.
Today, Ford, the last of the Big Three auto makers to report results for September, said that its sales rose 7.3 percent in the month, compared with a year ago. Sales of Ford pickup trucks, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles rose 7 percent, while its car sales rose 7.7 percent in September. Percentage calculations are based on a daily selling rate because there were 24 selling days last month but 25 in September 1995.
Ford also won bragging rights to the nation's best-selling car for the model year, which ended Sept. 30, for its redesigned Taurus. Ford sold 378,144 of the 1996 model Taurus, while the Honda Motor Company sold 367,137 1996-model Accords and the Toyota Motor Corporation sold 354,035 Camrys.
For the 1996 calendar year the Ford Taurus is also ahead of the Accord and Camry. The Taurus has now held the title four consecutive years, both for model and calendar years.
 Ford's brand-new sport-utility vehicle, the Expedition, got off to a strong start in its first full month of sales. Ford sold more than 8,200 of the giant trucks, a company executive said.
Ford stock fell 50 cents a share, to $31.25, on the New York Stock Exchange today.
 Other auto makers said today that their sales increased. Honda said its sales rose 1 percent, while Toyota said its sales jumped 14.2 percent. Others reported results earlier this week.
The nation's largest auto maker, the General Motors Corporation, said Tuesday that its sales fell 2.1 percent while the Chrysler Corporation said its sales rose 21.9 percent from the corresponding period a year ago.
In September, auto makers sold cars and light trucks at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15 million. That is down from August's rate of 15.73 million, but up from July's rate of 14.21 million. So far this year, the industry has run at a clip of 15.1 million annual sales, about the rate that the Big Three predicted early this year.
That suggested slowing to some economists. "I think there is a little bit of softening in the market," said Thomas C. Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association.
Such a slowing could be good news for those in the market for a new car or truck. Analysts agreed with Mr. Webb that auto makers would likely need to rely on cash rebates and discount leasing deals if they want strong sales to continue. "It is going to be a buyer's market," Mr. Webb said.
Indeed, Ford announced on Wednesday rebates and discount leases on a number of 1996 and 1997 models, including the Taurus, Aspire, Probe, Mustang, Contour, Thunderbird, Ranger and Windstar, along with Mercury's Tracer, Sable, Cougar, Grand Marquis and Villager. Most discounts are scheduled to last the rest of the year.
Auto dealers said their customers were responding to earlier rebates, and that the fresh rebates would likely prove popular.

HEADLINE: Senate Approves Bill to Preserve Parks, Including Sterling Forest

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
The Senate approved a broad package of legislation on parks and public lands today, including financing to preserve the Sterling Forest on the New York-New Jersey border, after the White House promised to let an Alaskan company continue to cut timber in the Tongass National Forest for a few more years.
The legislation, the Senate's last major act before it adjourned for the election, passed the Senate on a voice vote after Senator Frank Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, dropped his objection in return for the White House pledge involving logging in his state. 
 The bill provides financing for a grab bag of parks, memorials and public land deals nationwide, including the Presidio in San Francisco, a tallgrass prairie preserve in Kansas, a ski development in Utah for the Olympics in 2002 and scores of other projects that were avidly sought by lawmakers of both parties from all over the country.
Among the biggest of these, if not in acreage or dollars then in the political weight of the local delegation that pressed all year for its approval, was the public acquisition of the Sterling Forest, a 20,000-acre tract about 40 miles northwest of Manhattan. The bill authorizes $17.5 million to help buy the land from a private owner who otherwise might have developed it.
For months, it had seemed that provisions like these, which few opposed, would become victims of their own popularity, dragged down as the bill was loaded with other provisions that were far more controversial. Last week the White House said it would veto the bill unless several provisions, including a 15-year extension of logging in the Tongass, were dropped.
The House complied, stripping the bill of those provisions and then overwhelmingly passing it on Saturday. Now that the Senate has passed the bill, the President is certain to sign it.
"Though not perfect," Mr. Clinton said in a statement, "this bill represents a great victory for the American people and proves what we can accomplish if we work together."
Before the bill passed, in negotiations that dragged out all week, the White House had to satisfy a final demand from Mr. Murkowski, who had taken advantage of the Senate's deadlines and rules to block the bill single-handedly. It did so by negotiating a separate deal, outside the legislation, governing logging by Ketchikan Pulp Company.
The company, a subsidiary of Louisiana Pacific Corporation, was given special access to timber in the 1950's in exchange for building a pulp mill to create jobs in the region. The company has said it plans to close down the mill, which the Clinton Administration has asserted would breach its contract and end its guaranteed supply of timber.
Under the new deal, the White House has now agreed to negotiate terms under which the company could continue to log for two more years after closing the mill, sending the wood to sawmills that employ fewer people but make more profit.
The two-year continuation will probably allow logging of hundreds of millions of board-feet of timber (it takes about 15,000 board-feet to fill a lumber truck).
The deal between Mr. Murkowski and the Administration was in jeopardy until the very end as the two sides haggled over the wording of the Administration's promise, made in a letter to the Senator from White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta.
The letter emphasized that the Administration was not willing to revise the forest regulations for the Tongass or in any other way exempt the logging by Ketchikan Pulp Company from environmental controls.
Mr. Murkowski said he was disappointed by the deal, even though the two-year extension would save a few hundred jobs, at least for the time being. "For my state, and my constituents, and those who will face unemployment, they will have some hope -- not as much as I would have wished -- but some," he said.
Environmental groups who wanted logging stopped altogether said that the agreement gave Mr. Murkowski and his timber ally time to seek further changes later, but that it gave the Administration an opportunity to bring decades of logging to a close relatively soon.
"This is a great opportunity for the Administration to pursue its laudable goal of canceling the K.P.C. contract and bringing a balanced management to the Tongass National Forest," said Charles Clusen of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a leading environmental group.
Still, it was clear that Mr. Murkowski had lost more than he had gained. Several other provisions involving Alaska were also dropped from the bill, although others remained.
For the New York metropolitan region, the most significant part of the package was legislation to authorize Federal spending of $17.5 million to acquire the Sterling Forest along the border of the two states.
The forest is the last large, undeveloped tract of woodland in the area and the source of drinking water for millions of residents of northern New Jersey.
For a decade, environmentalists, residents, politicians and developers have disagreed over what to do with the Sterling Forest site.
The current owners, the Zurich Insurance Group of Switzerland, agreed in June to sell the land to the Trust for Public Land and the Open Space Institute, provided a $55 million deal could be worked out by the spring of 1988. Otherwise, the company planned to develop a community of 13,000 homes, commercial and industrial buildings and golf courses.
New York and New Jersey both pledged major contributions to the effort to acquire the land, and now nothing appears to stand in the way.
"We hit the last-second shot for Sterling Forest," said Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, using a basketball allusion from his previous career but plainly thinking of his last day in the Senate.
The White House did not win on every one of its objections to the parks bill, which retained one provision it opposed that would ease restrictions against development on some Florida barrier islands' beaches and coastal areas and allow those areas to get Federal flood insurance.

HEADLINE: Scores of House Candidates Dancing the Texas Shuffle

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Texas has had plenty of raucous free-for-alls in its electoral history, perhaps most famously in 1961, when 71 candidates jumped into a special election to fill the United States Senate seat vacated by Lyndon B. Johnson, who had become Vice President. Amid the ensuing fratricide among Democrats, John G. Tower became the state's first Republican Senator since Reconstruction.
But for sheer political chaos, it would be hard to match this year's races for the House of Representatives, with contests in 13 of the state's 30 Congressional districts thrown into turmoil by a fracas over redistricting. 
 A sweeping court-ordered change in this fall's electoral process in all 13 of those districts coincides with Republicans' hopes to achieve a historic shift in control of the Texas Congressional delegation, which now has 18 Democrats and 12 Republicans. But whether it will help them to do so remains unclear.
The commotion began when the United States Supreme Court ruled in June in favor of Republican plaintiffs who argued that in drawing the state's Congressional districts after the last census, the Democratic-controlled Legislature unconstitutionally gerrymandered three of them on racial lines. A Federal appeals court in Texas then redrew those three districts and 10 adjacent ones.
Beyond that, the appellate judges, in a ruling recently upheld by the Supreme Court, threw out the primary results in the 13 affected districts, all in the Houston and Dallas areas, and decreed that there would be open elections there on Nov. 5, any candidate free to enter them. Some of those races are now jammed with candidates -- 11 in one Houston district alone -- and the winners may not be clear until December runoffs, required in any districts where no one captures more than 50 percent of the vote on Election Day.
The judges' approach was in distinct contrast to that of courts elsewhere, which, in ruling on other states where the Supreme Court had found unconstitutional districts, including both Carolinas, chose to minimize disruption by allowing this year's elections to proceed along existing district lines.
The most immediate result here has been confusion, although of a kind in which many political consultants take delight and from which some may prosper. If the national battle for control of Congress is tight, it is now possible that it will be resolved not on Nov. 5 but instead a month later, with the runoffs in Texas.
Because of the appellate judges' ruling, some Congressional candidates defeated in primaries earlier this year have suddenly risen from the political dead. And some who looked like shoo-ins, including at least two Democratic incumbents, Ken Bentsen in Houston and Eddie Bernice Johnson in Dallas, could find themselves fighting for their political lives.
In east Texas, Representative Steve Stockman, widely seen as one of the most vulnerable freshman Republicans in Congress, seems to have been given a lift by the ruling, even though the judges made only the smallest of changes in his district's configuration. If Mr. Stockman winds up in a runoff, he may be able, by energizing his conservative base of loyalists, to do much better in it than he would have done in a one-on-one matchup against his prime Democratic opponent, Nick Lampson, on Election Day, when the turnout is typically larger than for a special election.
Behind all these individual battles is the fight for control of the Texas delegation, which has proved to be "the toughest Southern nut for the Republicans to crack," said Richard Murray, a political scientist at the University of Houston. To become the delegation's majority for the first time in this century, the Republicans need a net gain of four seats.
But although it was once widely agreed that Republicans as a whole would be the beneficiaries of the judges' ruling -- indeed, it was a coalition of Democratic incumbents who went to the Supreme Court in the unsuccessful effort to overturn it -- -- it is now not at all clear that they will be able to make major gains.
"There was an expectation of dramatic change," said Bill Miller, an Austin political consultant who has worked with candidates of both parties. "You felt like these judges, Republican appointees, were really going to change the map and the Democrats could kiss it goodbye. All that was at play."
But the redrawing that the judges actually did proved far less dramatic, Mr. Miller and several other analysts say, and, among a number of those seeking re-election, may be offset by the strengths of incumbency.
Moreover, even as they have a strong shot at capturing the Fort Worth seat being vacated by Representative Pete Geren, a conservative Democrat, the Republicans are in danger of losing a district of their own that curves along the state's central Gulf Coast.
That seat became theirs only after the incumbent, Greg Laughlin, made a highly publicized bolt from the Democratic Party after the 1994 elections. Mr. Laughlin lost his new party's primary this spring (the district is not affected by the redistricting ruling, and so that result stands), and the Republican nominee, Ron Paul, a former Congressman and Libertarian Party Presidential candidate, is facing a strong Democratic challenge from Charles Morris, an Austin lawyer.
And other Republican opportunities outside of the redistricting fray may not materialize: while two longtime Democratic Congressmen are retiring in east Texas, long thought to be ripe conservative ground, neither of the Republican candidates for those open seats is currently considered a favorite.
Of the 13 seats affected by the judges' redistricting ruling, 7 are now held by Republicans, 6 by Democrats. Six of the districts are in or near Dallas (the 3d, 5th, 6th, 24th, 26th and 30th), 7 in the Houston area (the 7th, 8th, 9th, 18th, 22d, 25th and 29th).
Of all the deck shuffling, the change that has probably drawn the most attention is in the 25th District, represented by Mr. Bentsen, a nephew of former Senator Lloyd Bentsen. The redrawing took many of Mr. Bentsen's reliably Democratic areas out of the 25th and gave him in return conservative-leaning suburban areas in west Houston.
As a result, the district could go Republican, especially if Mr. Bentsen faces a moderate Republican challenger in the runoff. But it is unclear who will prevail in what has effectively become a primary-within-an-election to establish a Republican candidate among no fewer than eight running in the new district. A second-place candidate could make the runoff with as little as 15 to 20 percent of the vote.
Several of those candidates have taken an anti-abortion stand, and one could emerge with strong support from the religious right. On the other end of the spectrum, Dolly Madison McKenna, a businesswoman and former Republican nominee in the old district, who supports abortion rights, said, "A centrist, economically conservative and socially moderate, is the perfect candidate for this new district."
Mr. Bentsen, despite disagreeing vehemently with the redistricting ruling, points out that 75 percent of the district remains the same, with new constituents having the same values as the old. "Fiscally conservative, socially more moderate," he said. "I think I fit that pretty well."
In other races, Ms. Johnson, the black Dallas Congresswoman whose district, the 30th, was one of the three found to have been unconstitutionally gerrymandered, is facing two other Democrats, two Republicans and three independents, including a former member of her staff. She ran virtually unopposed in her two previous campaigns but may now be vulnerable, although her district still has a heavy Democratic leaning.
In Houston, another black Congresswoman, Sheila Jackson Lee, also saw her district, the 18th, challenged and redrawn, but she remains heavily favored to win.
The third challenged district was Houston's 29th, initially drawn by the Legislature with an eye toward electing a Hispanic candidate. There, the non-Hispanic incumbent, Gene Green, a Democrat, may not find his political fortunes hurt at all by the redrawing. The district is now about 45 percent Hispanic, down from about 61 percent before, and still leans strongly Democratic.
Several other incumbents have been inconvenienced, but not exactly threatened, by the redistricting order.
For example, Representative Bill Archer of Houston, the Republican who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, was unopposed before the judges acted and now has a challenge from two independents and a Democrat. But he is still considered the heavy favorite.

HEADLINE: Top Post at Rock-Bottom Wage;
Chief Executive Puts Stock-Only Pay to Ultimate Test

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Jerre L. Stead has every reason to wince when he sees headlines about the mega-dollar salaries paid to chief executives. He is, after all, a chief executive himself.
But when he signed on in August to take the top post at Ingram Micro Inc., a computer distributor, he positioned himself at the opposite end of the salary spectrum. He took a cash salary of exactly zero -- goose eggs. 
 In what may be the most daring pay package in corporate America, Mr. Stead will get nothing but stock options. His deal allows him to purchase 3.6 million shares of Ingram Micro's stock: 400,000 now, 1.6 million in four installments beginning in April 1998 and the rest on a schedule tied to goals for the stock price and company earnings. He could, in theory, own 2.8 percent of the Santa Ana, Calif., company in five years.
For years, shareholders and analysts have been preaching that corporate chieftains ought to put more of their pay at risk. Why should managers be rewarded so handsomely, they ask, if their performance is not up to par? The surest route to aligning the interests of chief executives with those of shareholders is to pay them heavily in stock options, pay experts say.
Although there are a few precedents -- most notably when Lee A. Iacocca joined the Chrysler Corporation and briefly took a pay package of $1 in cash and the rest in stock -- Mr. Stead will be the ultimate test.
"It's obviously very gutsy," said Graef Crystal, a San Diego-based critic of corporate pay practices whose annual lists of overpaid executives are a thorn in the side of the business elite. Under Mr. Stead's deal, "he makes zero unless the stock rises," Mr. Crystal said, adding, "If the C.E.O.'s of America would follow suit, I'd be back playing the piano."
Mr. Stead, 53, may well end up very rich, of course. But even now, his package, which was his idea, has one highly desirable byproduct. Ingram Micro, a $10 billion-plus division of the privately held Ingram Industries, is to go public this month, at an expected $14 to $16 a share.
"There's no question," said Robert Salwen, a compensation consultant in White Plains, that the pay package "will help the initial public offering."
"The first question Wall Street asks in I.P.O.'s is: 'What stake does management have?' " he said.
Even on this score, Mr. Stead's attention-grabbing deal stands out. Many companies going public pay managers little cash, loading them up instead with options that can often be exercised below the initial price. But "we like his package especially because his options are at the I.P.O. price," said Kathleen S. Smith, a principal at the Renaissance Capital Corporation, a new-issue research firm in Greenwich, Conn.
Still, Mr. Stead's rewards could be stunning. He and other Ingram managers would not comment because of regulatory restrictions on impending offerings. But John T. Thompson, vice chairman of Heidrick & Struggles, the recruiting firm that brought Mr. Stead and Ingram Micro together, pointed out that "if Jerre can triple the stock price in five years, he'll make over $100 million."
Mr. Stead's package is particularly striking when compared with some other recent deals. In August, for example, when Alex J. Mandl left the No. 2 post at AT&T to run Associated Communications, a tiny wireless telephone company with no revenues, he got a $1 million salary, a $20 million signing bonus, plus an 18 percent equity stake that may be worth more than $100 million if the company goes public.
Associated paid so much, analysts say, because Mr. Mandl brings both proven executive skills and credibility with investors, which will be crucial if the company goes public. But Matt Ward, a compensation expert at the Hay Group, a management consulting firm, called the deal "the ultimate no-risk package."
With some executives acting like free-agent athletes, "whether deals like Stead's will become more widespread is a tough question," said Donald B. York, managing director of Radford Associates, a Silicon Valley consultant. Everyone has daily expenses, so executives without big financial reserves will need paychecks.
Mr. Stead can gamble because he is worth about $20 million, including a nest egg from his most recent job, as chief executive of the Legent Corporation, a software company. There, his annual salary was $750,000 and he had options on 700,000 shares. When his tenure abruptly ended after six months last year, when Computer Associates International bought Legent, Mr. Stead cashed in his options for nearly $15 million.
Equally important, the future of deals like Mr. Stead's "depends on the risk profile of the individual," Mr. York said. "Are they a risk-taker or not" in their finances?
Risk-takers give up a lot of cash. William M. Mercer Inc., a consultant that has surveyed the 1996 pay packages of chief executives at 425 large companies, found that the average base salary was $450,000, while the average total pay, including bonus and options, was $609,300. Ingram Micro was willing to pay a new chief executive $1.5 million a year in salary and bonus, Mr. Thompson said.
Yet Mr. Thompson, for one, says Mr. Stead is blazing a trail. "The really savvy executives are looking for an opportunity to swing for the fences," he said. He sees it as a good sign when "an executive is open to this kind of package." Mr. Thompson is even now searching for a chief executive at one company, and "the two leading candidates are willing to take a no-cash deal."
So far, these newfangled deals generally occur at high-technology or entertainment companies, where the potential for growth, and big payoffs, is huge. But some pay experts say Mr. Stead's example might influence compensation elsewhere, too, simply because shareholders are agitating for changes in pay practices. Partly as a result, stock options and other pay-for-performance devices are spreading rapidly.
In 1995, the average stock option award to the chief executives of Fortune 500 companies jumped more than 35 percent, compared with 1993, while the average salary climbed 15 percent, said Judith Fisher, publisher of Executive Compensation Reports, a newsletter basedin Fairfax Station, Va. At the nation's largest 200 companies, she said, salary accounted for just 19 percent of the chief executive's total pay in 1994, down from 24 percent in 1992. The portion derived from options jumped to 44 percent from 37 percent.
In the last 10 years, use of options as compensation has jumped.
 Deals like Mr. Stead's might become more common if the evidence that they work grows convincing. But past results are mixed. Fifteen years ago, Mr. Iacocca did indeed revive Chrysler. But his token cash salary lasted just a year, too short to draw any conclusions.
More recently, since 1993 Nelson Peltz, chief executive of the Triarc Companies, has been taking $1 in salary. But his stock options from just 1994 and 1995 have a present value of more than $30 million, Mr. Crystal said.
Still, in a sense, Mr. Peltz has so far been working for nothing. Triarc, a diversified company with interests in food, chemicals and energy, has been outperformed by 93 percent of the 750 conglomerates that Mr. Crystal tracks. Its stock, now around $12, has not traded above Mr. Peltz's exercise prices, which range from $27.125 to $45. Nonetheless, said Brian L. Schorr, Triarc's general counsel, "we've not had any discussion about changing anything."
The best comparison with Mr. Stead may be Dennis R. Hendrix, who as chief executive of the Panenergy Corporation, a Houston natural gas company, from November 1990 through April 1995 took no salary or cash bonus. He was paid entirely in restricted stock: two grants of 300,000 shares each in 1990 and 1993, with the restrictions on selling being lifted on 25,000 shares each quarter. The stock, which traded at $11 in November 1990, is now around $35. Mr. Hendrix, who remains chairman, will by year-end own 600,000 shares, now worth $21 million.
Both Charles W. Duncan Jr., chairman of Panenergy's compensation committee, and Mr. Hendrix declined to comment. But in the past Mr. Hendrix has said that he asked for stock grants because they tied his fortunes to those of shareholders.
It seemed to work. According to Mr. Crystal's analysis, Mr. Hendrix has outshone rivals in the natural gas industry. One dollar invested in Panenergy in November 1990 would be worth $2.60 today, Mr. Crystal figured. By contrast, a dollar invested in Columbia Gas is worth 56 cents; in Consolidated Natural Gas, 96 cents, and in Pacific Enterprises, 83 cents. A similar investment in the S.& P. 500-stock index would be worth $1.89. Only one competitor, the Williams Companies, comes close; its value today is $2.58.
Despite that record, Panenergy has reverted to a traditional pay package for Mr. Hendrix's successor. Mr. Hendrix had asked for his stock deal -- "this was not something the board insisted on," a company spokesman said. In 1995, the new chief executive, Paul M. Anderson, got a salary of $455,417, a bonus of $333,540 and options.
Mr. Stead's package is riskier, though, for while Mr. Hendrix got stock grants, Mr. Stead must pay to exercise the options. Although Mr. Crystal estimated that Mr. Stead's options have a present value of about $24 million if the offering price is $14, they will be worthless if the stock does not rise.
If Mr. Stead does wind up wealthy, that could arouse the critics of lucrative executive pay. But at least his rewards will be related to performance. "The more the executive is willing to tie pay to performance, the better," said Robert H. Frank, co-author of "The Winner-Take-All Society" and an economics professor at Cornell University. "Tying pay to performance per se is not a bad thing, even though it has meant that pay has exploded at the top."
The design of Mr. Stead's package may also mollify critics who worry about corporate myopia. For a start, the options are parceled out over a five-year period, which should thwart any temptation to manage solely for short-term gains, said Mr. Thompson of Heidrick & Struggles.
The awards linked to performance goals will turn on accumulated earnings or the stock price over at least four months, not one-month or one-day pop-ups. Finally, Mr. Stead's option terms will be consistent with the options program used in paying other Ingram managers.
Mr. Stead's package has another attribute that should not be overlooked, Mr. Salwen, the consultant, noted, "It's very politically correct."
 The article misidentified the employer of Matt Ward, a compensation expert. He works for Watson Wyatt Worldwide, not the Hay Group.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 5, 1996, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption in Business Day yesterday with an article about the compensation of Jerre L. Stead, chief executive of Ingram Micro Inc., referred incorrectly to terms of his stock options. As the article noted, he will be allowed to make his stock purchases at the initial offering price, not at a reduced price.
An illustration with the article misstated the pay of a chief executive with a similar compensation package, Nelson Peltz of the Triarc Companies. As noted elsewhere in the chart grouping and the article, he is paid $1 a year in salary, not zero.

HEADLINE: HIGH ROLLING ON THE RIVER: A special report.;
An Oasis of Casinos Lifts A Poor Mississippi County

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

DATELINE: TUNICA, Miss., Sept. 28

 BODY:
Implausibly looming over the Mississippi Delta, the flat, black alluvial soil that brought forth cotton and the blues, are an Irish castle, a cowboy town, the Hollywood hills, a circus tent, a Tudor mansion and, biggest of all, something that its architects insist synthesizes Victorian-age San Francisco, the Wild West, New Orleans at Mardi Gras and a rain forest with a pagoda and some Greco-Roman columns thrown in, the whole tastefully outlined in pulsating purple neon.
For years, Tunica County had been the poorest place in the United States. Dead last by virtually every social and economic measure, Tunica was the worst-off county of the most poverty-stricken state in the nation. 
 But almost overnight, really by accident, a $1 billion-a-year industry plopped down in the isolated fields: gambling. The slot machine may well have more impact here than any device since the cotton gin.
Stretch limousines roll past the acres of white cotton bolls now in bloom, and there are more jobs in the county (about 13,000) than people (about 8,300). Three-quarters of the residents are black, many still living in sharecropper's tumbledown shotgun shacks. Welfare payments and unemployment rates have been cut in half, and the constantly repeated phrase here is that anyone who wants a job can get one.
The sheer numbers are staggering. The 10 casinos in the county, running 24 hours a day, are drawing 1.2 million visitors a month to these vast rural stretches. Four years ago there were 17 rooms in a rundown motel by the side of Route 61; by the end of this year there are expected to be 6,000 hotel rooms, most of them built by the casinos.
The newest, the Grand Casino, which opened to a crowd of about 45,000 people on June 24, represents an initial investment of nearly $500 million, spreading across 2,200 acres. With 140,000 square feet of "gaming" -- the term preferred in an industry where the word gambling is never used -- it is one of the biggest casinos in the country and the biggest between Las Vegas and Atlantic City.
Still, the Tunica casinos, which are all owned by major corporations with headquarters outside the state, are isolated enclaves that provide nearly every service, including free drinks and cheap buffets, to their patrons to keep them playing, and their impact on local life is still unclear. With a poorly educated and unskilled work force, only about 1 in 4 or 5 casino employees is from Tunica County, and there are so few commercial ventures that services like food and laundry, along with most of the employees, are from nearby Memphis and its suburbs.
Indeed, the town of Tunica (population 1,200) has been completely bypassed as the casinos leapfrogged north to the edge of the county ever closer to Memphis, 15 miles from where the new Grand is snuggled next to the Tunica border. The town is still a sleepy place, where the clock tower on the Planter's Bank shows the wrong time on all four faces and the part-time Mayor, Bobby E. Williams, a furniture dealer, locks up the brand-new brick town hall, built with gambling payments, before he goes to lunch.
"Tunica is just getting scraps," said Prof. Klaus J. Meyer-Arendt of Mississippi State University, who has been studying the casinos, which he compared to giant funnels sending money back to corporate headquarters. "But people there have never had even scraps, so they're grateful for anything."
Gambling taxes have swelled Tunica County's annual budget from $2.8 million before the casinos arrived to more than 10 times that amount. "Tunica wasn't smarter than anybody else," said County Administrator Kenneth M. Murphree. "Tunica was just more desperate."
The whole state was desperate in 1990 when the Mississippi Legislature met in special session to consider a state lottery, doomed in a state so socially conservative that it was the last to repeal prohibition, in 1966. Almost unnoticed, a legislator from threadbare Natchez offered a bill that would have allowed riverboat gambling in his district. Other counties bordering the river were added.
"Nobody ever took it seriously," said Charley Williams, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. "It never would have passed a statewide vote."
People call the new casinos "the boats," though the river cannot be seen from most of them, the result of a creative method to make them legally seaworthy. They are really huge buildings, surrounded by moat-like ditches, in which gambling is done over water.
Sponsors of the bill, Mr. Williams said, hoped to produce about 3,000 jobs on six gambling boats docked on the Gulf Coast or along the Mississippi River and talked about a possible $10 million a year in tax revenue. Instead, the Mississippi Gaming Commission says the state, now the third-largest gambling market in the country, after Nevada and New Jersey, took in $213,713,855.43 in taxes this year from an industry that employed 32,273 people, with perhaps another 20,000 people working in other jobs created by the industry.
The state had latched on to one of the fastest growing businesses in the country, with well over $400 billion a year now being legally wagered. As the current annual report for Circus Circus, one of the casino concerns operating here, put it: "Casino gambling is more than three times the size of the cinema box office in the U.S., three times theme parks, and almost three times professional spectator sports. The stakes, all of a sudden, have gotten big."
 
The History
Going Forward, Moving Back
For a century, the Mississippi Delta was shaped by two interrelated institutions: sharecropping and segregation. A tiny class of white plantation owners held poor blacks in economic serfdom, chopping and picking cotton, nearly always in debt. But, toward the end of World War II, machines were developed to harvest cotton and chemicals to kill the weeds. Blacks here and throughout the Delta fled northward in a great migration that changed the country, and by the late 1960's, black labor was largely superfluous.
Tunica County's population in the 1950's was about 25,000, more than three times what it is today. Despite the widespread poverty, there are more than a score of planter millionaires, and about a dozen old-line white families pretty much run everything.
Much has changed in the 30-odd years since Mississippi fiercely resisted the civil rights movement. The county sheriff, John Pickett, is black, as are many of his deputies.
Other things have not. The public schools, which up to two years ago ranked consistently last among the state's 154 districts, are all black. White students go to the private Tunica Institute of Learning. The races still live separate lives, many of the blacks in a section known until recently as Sugar Ditch for the open sewer then running though it.
Tunica County was such an undesirable site that hardly anyone, least of all the big gambling operators, noticed when the County Board of Supervisors, headed for the last 34 years by a wealthy cotton planter and catfish farmer, Paul Battle, opened the way to casinos by getting a legal notice published in newspapers. There were no organized objections to the notice.
In DeSoto County, just north of Tunica and next to Memphis, church groups demanded a referendum on gambling and residents organized and voted down the proposal.
Then, on Oct. 19, 1992, down a country road at an old dock called Mhoon Landing, a little band of entrepreneurs, including Ronnie and Ricky Schilling, brothers from Kentucky who owned an old barge that had been a floating disco in Louisville, opened the county's first gambling riverboat. It was called Splash, and it made local history.
The owners charged $10 just to get in, and people stood in line for three hours, sometimes in a driving rain, to gamble. Splash cleared $25 million in its first five weeks and the gambling rush was on.
"It shocked the world," said Mr. Murphree, the County Administrator. "It opened a lot of people's eyes that there was this kind of market."
Splash is gone now, along with three other early casinos, squeezed out when the big operators moved in. The Schillings are living in Fort Lauderdale.
"Came here in an old black Lincoln with everything they had piled in the back and left millionaires," said Brooks Taylor, publisher, editor and the main reporter of the weekly Tunica Times.
Splash left another legacy -- a way to get the "boats" on land. The original plan had been to put a yacht at the dock. But the Mississippi's current is powerful, and the river can fluctuate by 40 feet. So the owners dug a slip for a barge and protected it from the river with a cofferdam.
The law called for gambling vessels to float on the Mississippi River or its navigable tributaries. What this has come to mean is the flood plain of the Mississippi. The casino operators dug trenches inland and created ponds, floated in barges, then filled the trenches. The gambling floors of the casinos now sit atop the barges, making them legal "gambling boats."
 
The Casinos
Fierce Fighting For Customers
The casinos themselves are "somewhere else" architecture, conjuring up cowboys, old movies or some other adventuresome theme. But inside, they are remarkably similar, dominated by rows and rows of slot machines emitting constant ear-splitting clangs, operated by grimly silent customers, many steadily puffing cigarettes, feeding in coins from paper cups. A nickel slot makes the house about $100 a day, a $1 slot $221 and a $5 slot about $471 a day, the gaming commission says. There are 14,650 slot machines in the county's 10 casinos. Even the bars with the free drinks have video card games implanted in the counters.
At the Grand Casino, bulldozers are clearing the way for three hotels, two golf courses, a 90-acre lake and water park, a convention center, a child care center, parking lots, a mall and more in hopes of turning the site into what the tourist industry calls a "destination."
Competition is cutthroat, with the casinos offering complementary food, drink and hotel rooms and giving away boats and cars as prizes, as well as claiming better odds and more winning slot machines.
The market is not just the Memphis area, but the whole center of the country, because Interstate 55, running from Chicago to New Orleans, and Interstate 40, connecting both coasts, intersect there. There are excursion buses from countless communities, especially for retirees, and a special $99 air package from Atlanta. The cars, vans and recreational vehicles have plates from Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri and beyond.
Like a blackjack player splitting his aces, the county is putting the lion's share of its new tax revenue -- the state gets 8 percent of casino profits, Tunica County 4 percent -- into new roads, turning country lanes into four-lane connectors to Interstate 55 to bring more gamblers straight to the casinos. "Who ever would have thought we'd need roads?" Mayor Williams mused.
The crowds are blue-collar, often graying. But in a place where color was once so important, green is all that counts. Blacks with gold chains stand shoulder to shoulder with grizzled whites in faded Harley Davidson T-shirts, throwing their money on the gaming tables. The big-name entertainment is carefully calibrated between blues and country -- for example, B. B. King and Patty Loveless.
"Maybe," said a black waiter, "the casinos will drag this place into the 20th century."
 
The Change
Lining Pockets, Filling Others
Calverta Jackson, a 36-year-old black woman wearing her Bally Casino T-shirt, who was shopping in the Piggly Wiggly supermarket, is one of the local people who have found jobs that put shiny late-model cars in the driveways and replaced some of the shacks with trailer homes.
"I think it's the best thing that happened here," she said. "Many things have changed. You see people buying cars, their own property. They weren't able to do that. The casinos made all that possible."
Before the casinos, 19.8 percent of the population was on some form of welfare, said Jacqueline Pickett, the county director of social services; the number today is 10.3 percent, mostly elderly people. Unemployment fluctuates seasonally. In 1991, before casinos, the January rate was 26.6 percent and the July rate 13 percent. This year, the figures were 8.8 percent and 6.2 percent.
"The choices have opened up," Mrs. Pickett said. "The adults at the Piggly Wiggly can go for higher pay at the boats. There's a job available for everyone who wants to work. They're able to buy trailers, things they weren't able to buy. People just have a better prospect of living."
It has not been entirely smooth. Many people in the county had never worked steadily, and the casinos have to run basic training programs. "Some didn't respond to the kind of requirements businesses have," said Bill Baker, vice president for human services at the Grand, "like coming to work on time."
The people who made the big money were those, already rich, who owned the land. Shea Leatherman, whose family settled in the county when the hardwood forests were cut in the mid-19th century, hoped to get a few million dollars, the story here goes, for land that had been worth less than a million. When the operators of Sam's Town Casino offered him $20 million in 1993, he kept a straight face and settled for $25 million. The casino took in $128 million in its first year.
But at the Blue and White Cafe, lounge and gas station, a truck-stop landmark serving catfish and homemade pie at the edge of town since 1937, Wiley Chambers, the owner, is so mad he once chased out the publisher of a gambling newspaper that had free casino meal coupons.
Anticipating a rush of business, Mr. Chambers concreted the grease pit of his gas station, burying the hydraulic rack, to create a new lounge, only to find the casinos were giving away drinks. Another roadhouse, the Hollywood, which claimed to have originated french-fried pickle slices, a local delicacy, has closed down. Directly across Route 61 from the Blue and White, the area's first McDonald's is under construction.
"Straight down, that's where the casinos should go!" Mr. Chambers was shouting angrily the other evening, over a country song on the jukebox and a hard-fought pool game. "Out of here! All the locals go just to eat the cheap food!"
Heck Wiley, with a Bud and meaty tattooed forearms on the bar, objected, saying, "Where else could an ole Mississippi boy go to hear Merle Haggard and Patty Loveless?"

CORRECTION-DATE: November 5, 1996, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Oct. 4 about Tunica County, Miss., reported its transformation by casino gambling, from the poorest county in America to the home of a billion-dollar-a-year industry. The 2,500-word article was fully based on The Times's reporting and interviewing at the scene, but some avenues for the reporting were suggested by an article by John Brans ton in the July-August issue of Memphis, a Tennessee magazine.
Three brief passages in The Times closely reflected the phrasing of Memphis's article. These were references to the parallel between the slot machine's impact and that of the cotton gin; to the profit statistics per slot machine, and to Shea Leatherman, a farmer who found a windfall in selling land for a casino. Those three passages should have been attributed to Memphis.

Dollar Recovers After Dropping On Weak Employment Report

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar was hurt initially by a surprisingly weak employment report yesterday but eventually rose as stocks and bonds surged in the belief that the Federal Reserve would hold off raising interest rates.
The jobs report, which also showed a large jump in wages, divided currency traders. 
 "The market is more sensitized to inflation than it is to growth right now," said John Nelson, senior vice president at ABN-AMRO Bank. "As a result the wage number was probably more important than the nonfarm payroll number."
After earlier declines, the dollar rose to 1.5321 German marks in late New York trading from 1.5313 marks late Thursday, and to 111.80 Japanese yen from 111.45 yen.
The dollar rose despite lower interest rates, which make United States assets worth relatively less. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.74 percent, its lowest level since Aug. 9.
The dollar has rallied for most of 1996 as investors load up on American stocks and bonds, believing that a strong economy will keep interest rates relatively high.
With interest rates across Europe falling and yields in Japan at record-low levels, foreigners may increasingly ignore economic data. Their appetite for dollar-denominated assets should continue to fuel the dollar's rise even if yields on Treasury bonds did fall yesterday, traders said.
"Lower interest rates are a product of assets improving in value not a lack of economic activity," said John Barlow, senior dealer at Bayerische Landesbank Girozentrale. "It's more of a product of supply and demand for U.S. assets."
"No matter what the numbers were it doesn't really change the market sentiment," said Dorit Ronnen, foreign exchange trader at Bank Leumi Trust Company.
"Typically, when you see a number like that, they say 'O.K., the Fed is going to ease,' and the dollar would come off, but it didn't. The bond and stock markets are well bid and the dollar followed that."
The British pound cost $1.5640, down from $1.5650. Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday, were: 1.2576 Swiss francs, up from 1.2559; 5.1843 French francs, up from 5.1815; 1,521 Italian lire, up from 1,517; 1.3543 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3598.

HEADLINE: About New York;
A Civic Heart Is Sold Off In 'Bake Sale'

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
SEVERAL hundred bargain hunters filed into the auditorium at Police Headquarters, where the city was selling vacant lots and buildings on Wednesday. As the pony-tailed auctioneer recited the rules, Anna Vincenty turned around and whispered some last-minute advice to her friend Yolanda Garcia.
"Don't scratch your head," Ms. Vincenty said, no doubt savvy from sitcoms. "They might think you're buying." 
 Ms. Garcia smiled weakly and kept her hands on her lap. But when the bidding stopped on Parcel No. 99, the Bronx Borough Courthouse, she had enough reasons to scratch her head. The new owner, Gus Kitkas, said he wasn't sure what he would do with the granite and marble Beaux-Arts landmark he had bought for $130,000.
Ms. Garcia had plans once. She is a co-founder of Nos Quedamos / We Stay, a Bronx grass-roots organization that raised $1 million to turn the building into a town center. Until 1995, the organization had been negotiating a lease with the city. The building was the centerpiece of a housing and economic development plan that her group and local officials had drafted for their Melrose neighborhood.
But the money they had raised from foundations and government agencies was for renovation, not acquisition. Besides, why should the people who volunteered to help redesign their corner of the South Bronx spend money they don't have for a courthouse built with public funds?
They thought they had paid enough dues just by hanging tough during decades of arson, abandonment and planned shrinkage.
"People's investment of time also has a dollar value," Ms. Garcia said. "We spent four years trying to make our neighborhood good again. All of a sudden the City of New York shuts down the little guy. How much more is our community going to bleed before the city protects it?"
NOT that long ago, the city even honored them. In 1994 the Landmarks Preservation Commission and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani awarded a citation to Richard Kahan, the Urban Assembly's president, specifically for his work on the courthouse plans. The Urban Assembly is a nonprofit planning agency that has helped Ms. Garcia's group.
Like many involved in the project, Mr. Kahan was astounded by the possibility of the building being used for business by Mr. Kitkas, an electrical contractor. "This was to be the civic heart of the community," he said. "You couldn't have a worse use."
Actually, you could. Previous auctions have resulted in vacant lots being turned into illegal garages and by-the-hour motels. The city's short-term financial gains were offset by increased spending on police patrols and a drop in the quality of life.
"We have no consistent land use plan for New York," said the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, whose borough had been beset by some of the newly privatized properties. "There's no way to figure out how to get the highest return and the best use for our resources."
City officials insist that they can stop the sale if they feel the buyer is not responsible. "In general, we don't sell to Vinnie Bag O'Donuts," said Paula Young, the spokeswoman for the Department of Citywide Administrative Services.
The issue might become moot later this month, when lawyers for Nos Quedamos go to court to try to overturn the sale. City officials are confident that they will win. They said the auction was necessary to raise money for the city, even though higher priced properties were taken off the auction list after community pressure.
WHY wasn't the courthouse spared? Ms. Garcia thinks it's about politics, since her project is part of a larger plan to redevelop a 300-block area known as the Bronx Center. Mr. Ferrer has been touting the plan for years, hoping it will show the rest of the city that he has helped the Bronx rebound. He is also said to have plans on some new housing for himself. In Gracie Mansion.
The only people hurt, Mr. Ferrer said, are in the community.
"This is part of the municipal bake sale?" he asked. "This is a complete betrayal of the community and of the history and heritage of this city."
Ms. Young denied any machinations.
"It's one of those strictly-business-nothing-personal things," she said.
But the personal should count for something.
"What is a city if not a collection of personal elements?" Mr. Ferrer said.
Still, the day after the auction, Mr. Ferrer was in the Times Square subway station helping register new voters. Nothing personal.

HEADLINE: Canada Strike Could Close G.M.'s Plants In U.S. Shortly

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Oct. 4

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation has been quietly stockpiling auto parts in preparation for this week's strike by the Canadian Automobile Workers union, but may still be forced to begin closing factories in the United States by the end of next week if the strike continues, G.M. and union officials said today.
Dean W. Munger, G.M. Canada's vice president for personnel, acknowledged today that the company had accumulated some extra parts in preparation for the current walkout in Canada, which began on Wednesday night. 
 Yet some analysts may be right, said Tom Klipstine, a G.M. spokesman, in saying that American assembly plants will begin closing if the strike lasts 10 to 14 days. "I wouldn't disagree with anyone using those numbers," he said, noting that "a majority" of G.M.'s North American assembly plants use Canadian parts.
Union officials from several G.M. Canada parts factories said in interviews here today that G.M. had been running assembly lines nearly 24 hours a day since July in an effort to meet not only current strong demand for car and truck sales but also to create a buffer for a possible strike. Trish A. McAuliffe, the strike marshal at a car seat and interior door panel factory in Windsor, Ontario, said that workers there had been on 12-hour shifts and 6- or 7-day weeks for three months.
There were several signs today that G.M. will need its stockpiles. Negotiators met only briefly this afternoon before the Canadian union's president, Basil E. Hargrove, left town to spend the weekend at a series of strike rallies across Ontario. Talks were scheduled to resume on Monday, though Mr. Hargrove said he left his cellular telephone number with Dean Munger, G.M. Canada's top labor negotiator, in case G.M. wanted to revise its offer.
Mr. Hargrove told a rally of local union officials today that he would not stop bargaining until G.M. had agreed to the same terms that its rival, the Chrysler Corporation, accepted on Sept. 17. Those terms include a provision that any jobs eliminated through the purchase of parts from outside vendors be replaced with new jobs in the same community. The union also wants to stop G.M. from selling factories.
Mr. Munger said in an interview here that the union's positions were unacceptable.
"The inability to outsource is a serious concern to us because our plans are to improve our competitiveness," Mr. Munger said.
About 15,000 workers went on strike Wednesday night at several assembly plants in Oshawa, Ontario, and Ste. Therese, Quebec. Car-seat makers and trucking companies began laying off workers almost immediately, with at least 1,000 workers furloughed in the first day of the strike, according to a tally published today by The Globe and Mail newspaper here.
Several thousand more workers were scheduled to go on strike on Sunday night at an engine and transmission factory in Ontario, followed by another 5,000 workers at G.M. Canada parts factories next Wednesday night.
With one-sixth of the private-sector jobs in Ontario depending directly or indirectly on the auto industry, and with G.M. accounting for half the auto production here, economists here warned that a prolonged strike could eventually hurt the already limping Canadian economy. The Globe and Mail ran an editorial cartoon today showing an irritated Canadian beaver wearing a T-shirt labeled "economic recovery" and struggling to pull its tail out from under a cobwebbed G.M. truck with an "on strike" license plate.
Sam Gindin, the Canadian Automobile Workers' research director, said that the economy's problems resulted from job insecurity and stagnant wages and that the strike would aid the economy in the long run if the concerns were addressed.
In Washington, the Federal Reserve Board has apparently begun following the strike and any eventual spillover effects on the American economy, with a Fed staff economist calling the Canadian union for information, James O. Stanford, an economist for the Canadian Automobile Workers, said. "They were just calling us to get what the impact would be on the U.S. operations," he said.
Several members of the American central bank's Federal Open Market Committee -- which sets interest-rate policy -- complained last spring that a 17-day strike at two G.M. factories in Dayton, Ohio, had made it temporarily difficult to gauge the health of the American economy.
That strike closed all but two of G.M.'s 29 North American assembly plants and trimmed two-tenths of a percentage point from the nation's economic output in the first quarter, but G.M. was able to make up two-thirds of the lost production in the second and third quarters.

HEADLINE: U.S. Weighs Tougher Reaction to Burmese Crackdown

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is struggling to decide whether the intensified crackdown on political activity in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, amounts to the "large-scale repression" of the democratic opposition that, according to a new law, would trigger a ban on all new American investment there.
Some officials and Congressional staff members say the law, signed on Monday, requires immediate sanctions. 
 They say that laws and sanctions established in support of human rights only have credibility when they are used in clear circumstances, and point out that the Chinese and Nigerian Governments are gauging the Administration's mettle as carefully as the Burmese. The United States is the fourth-largest investor in Myanmar, after France, Singapore and Thailand. Most French and American investment is in the oil sector, with the companies Unocal, Texaco and the French company Total most heavily engaged.
On Thursday, President Clinton banned Burmese Government leaders from entering the United States. The decision, which is largely symbolic, was the Administration's response to the arrest last week of as many as 800 members of the National League for Democracy led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
The Burmese Government retaliated in kind today.
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and her party won elections in 1988, but the results were thrown out by the military, which seized power and tried to persuade her to leave the country.
Last weekend, for the first time since she was released from six years of house arrest in July 1995, soldiers prevented Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, from making a regular weekend speech to supporters.
Senior Administration officials and human-rights organizations believe the military government is now "trying to decapitate" the League and is putting Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi back under de facto house arrest.
Senior Administration officials say that they will discuss the matter at a meeting at the White House early next week, after watching what happens in Myanmar this weekend.
Officials who argue for patience or a delay in imposing sanctions say they want to coordinate pressure on Myanmar with Japan; the European Union, which is discussing the elimination of trade benefits; and with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which has just indicated that it may delay Myanmar's application to join unless its Government permits a more open society.
They suggest giving Myanmar a deadline for changing its course or facing sanctions.
But other officials believe that the American law is clear in requiring action. The law signed by Mr. Clinton on Monday embodies an amendment offered by Senator William Cohen, Republican of Maine, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, which was accepted by the Administration in lieu of stronger language demanding immediate sanctions offered by Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky.
Even this weaker language would impose a ban on new investment if the Burmese Government "has physically harmed, rearrested for political acts, or exiled Daw Aung San Suu Kyi or has committed large-scale repression of or violence against the democratic opposition."
"The United States has the leverage, but does it have the political will to use it?" asked Mike Jendrzejczyk of Human Rights Watch/Asia. "A visa ban is useful symbolic action, but if the Administration does not impose economic sanctions, its credibility on human rights will be seriously damaged."
A senior Administration official expressed the quandary this way: "The law is designed as a deterrent, so ideally we don't want to use it. But if it is to be credible, we have to be willing to use it."

HEADLINE: Responding to Burmese Repression

 BODY:
A new law went into effect this week requiring President Clinton to impose an American investment ban on Myanmar if its already repressive military regime extends its crackdown against dissent and democracy. The timing was exquisite. Myanmar, as Burma was renamed by its current rulers, is currently being shaken by the worst repression of the last five years.
The country's governing State Law and Order Restoration Council says that in the last week it has arrested nearly 600 members of the opposition National League for Democracy who were planning to attend a party conference. The league's leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, says the figure is closer to 800. To reach foreign reporters, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi had to sneak out of her house, which is now ringed by soldiers and barricades. The Government has also cut her telephone and stopped her regular weekend rallies. 
 The Burmese Government's actions have provoked an unexpected and welcome international reaction. The Philippines and Thailand, the two most democratic members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, persuaded that organization to delay Burmese entry indefinitely. Other nations, including Japan and Britain, are also considering limiting their trade with Myanmar.
Washington's sanctions bill prohibits all new American investment if the Burmese authorities harm or rearrest Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi or engage in widespread repression. These conditions have clearly been met. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi is effectively under house arrest, and the new crackdown is extensive by any standards.
President Clinton this week condemned the Burmese conduct and banned travel to the United States by Burmese officials and their families. The Administration chose not to apply the new sanctions immediately, but promises to take a fresh look at the issue as early as Monday. Officials argued that sanctions would be more effective if Washington can persuade European and Asian nations to restrict their own trade with Myanmar, although they are unlikely to join in full sanctions.
Recruiting international support is wise, and a few days' delay is acceptable. But the Administration should not wait for long to impose the ban on new American investment. The Burmese leaders are not likely to care much about the travel restrictions. Sanctions on Myanmar are now called for under American law, and should be employed unless the Burmese leadership releases hundreds more prisoners and allows freedom of movement to Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters.

HEADLINE: George Kubler, 84, Pioneer In Study of Pre-Columbian Art

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
George A. Kubler, a pioneering scholar of pre-Columbian and Spanish colonial art and one of the influential art historians of his generation, died on Thursday at his home in Hamden, Conn. He was 84.
Mr. Kubler looked for new and unstudied topics in art history and for ways to enhance and invigorate traditional art historical approaches by borrowing from social and economic history, among other disciplines. He was iconoclastic in studying the colonial architecture of Mexico and New Mexico in the 1930's when other American art historians mostly studied European art. 
Significantly, he became one of the first scholars to treat pre-Columbian artifacts not just as historical documents but also as works of Western art were treated, and as examples of a universal human engagement with form.
Although neither an archeologist nor an anthropologist, he recognized the functional aspect of the objects, which in some ways set them apart from Western art. To develop a means for interpreting what was expressive about their forms, he did not rely on specifically Western notions like genius and originality.
"The Religious Architecture of New Mexico" was his first book, published in 1940, and he later wrote a major survey on the art and architecture of Spain, Portugal and their American dominions. "The Kuchua in the Colonial World," his article on the persistence of indigenous culture in Peru during the years of Spanish rule, remains a basic text in ethnography. He also wrote on Mayan mythology, and his "Art and Architecture of Ancient America," a survey published in 1962, was one of the first attempts to tell the story of pre-Columbian culture through art.
The same year he published his most widely read book, "The Shape of Time: Remarks on the History of Things," a brief and elegantly written treatise that raised the still radical idea that art "can be expanded to embrace the whole range of man-made things." He studied the iconography of pre-Columbian art, treating its hieroglyphs and pictographs not just as linguistic signs but as creative visual forms as well.
He was born in Hollywood, Calif., in 1912, the son of an art historian, who died when he was 8. He moved with his mother to Europe. After she died, he was sent to a boarding school in Ohio, then went to Yale, where he received his Ph.D. in art history in 1940 as a student of the French art historian Henri Focillon. He joined the Yale faculty, became Sterling Professor of the History of Art, and except for occasional terms at Harvard and elsewhere, taught there until he retired in the mid-80's.
He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Bushnell Kubler; three daughters, Alexandra Kubler Merrill of St. George, Me.; Cornelia Kubler Kavanagh of Norwalk, Conn., and Elena Ann Kubler of Deer Isle, Me., and a son, Edward George Alexander Kubler of North Branford, Conn.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE SPOUSE;
On the Trail, Dole's Wife Seeks Votes Of Women

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Elizabeth Dole is on a one-woman mission to exterminate the "gender gap" that is plaguing her husband.
Like Sigourney Weaver battling the Alien, Mrs. Dole is fighting her heart out against huge odds. With the clock ticking toward Nov. 5, female voters still vastly prefer President Clinton to Bob Dole, the Republican Presidential nominee, and they could determine the election. 
 That has launched the determined Mrs. Dole into overdrive. With her May Queen smile firmly in place, she makes 20 to 30 public appearances a week, delivering her 50-minute speech in three or four media markets a day. Plunging into her audiences, she talks about her husband's human side, casting him as a regular guy who likes to channel surf and eat pizza but is also sympathetic to today's harried women and protective of the social safety net that Mr. Clinton says Mr. Dole threatens to yank away.
As she told Midwestern audiences on a three-city visit on Thursday, Mr. Dole has raised millions of dollars for people with disabilities, he has planned Thanksgiving dinners for inner-city children in Washington, and he likes "reverse birthday parties" where he and Mrs. Dole give gifts on their birthdays to residents of a senior center. He is so trustworthy, she said, "you can take his word to the bank."
Earlier this week, the 60-year-old Mrs. Dole even shed her custom-tailored business suit and high heels for jeans, a black leather jacket and boots and roared onto the Jay Leno show on the back of Mr. Leno's motorcycle. If she could convince late-night viewers that she was hip, the theory went, they might take another look at her husband.
"Rev it, baby," the cotillion-going daughter of the South instructed her host. "I've come a long way from Harvard Law School to biker chick."
In an interview later, she explained what she had accomplished on the show. "I had a chance to talk about my husband as a person," she said. "People don't really know him as a person. And it was a fun thing to do."
Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, a Republican pollster, put it more bluntly: "Republicans have been on a long, bad blind date with women and need to convince them to look beyond what is at the front door. Elizabeth Dole reminds us that not every Republican has three heads and horns. She teaches us that she loves Bob Dole, so we can, too."
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows male voters about evenly split between Mr. Dole and President Clinton, with 44 percent for Mr. Clinton and 40 percent for Mr. Dole. But it shows women lopsidedly favoring the President, with 56 percent supporting him to 30 percent for Mr. Dole.
Miss Fitzpatrick suggested that while the gender gap was years in the making, Mr. Dole had perpetuated it. She cited his disparagement of the popular Family and Medical Leave Act, for example, as "a colossal error in judgment."
"I wish a better culture had been created in courting the women's vote," she lamented. "But that it wasn't makes it more imperative that Elizabeth go out on her own, speak to women and double the territory."
Mrs. Dole covers twice the ground her husband does, both substantively in her speeches and geographically, as she keeps a fuller schedule. If her crowds are smaller than his -- although she drew 2,500 recently in Cedar Rapids, Iowa -- they seem more attentive, in part because her performance is so listener-friendly.
She abandons the lectern ("a barrier," she calls it), and roams among the people, locking eyes and touching sleeves. Her speeches have beginnings, middles and ends. They conclude, in lawyerly fashion, with summations. She uses topic sentences to telegraph where she is headed. ("Now, let's talk about the values that drive the policy decisions that Bob Dole has made.") If she mentions something that seems abstract, she invariably says, "Now, why is this important?" and proceeds to explain.
At every turn, she seeks to connect her husband's policies with real life. His favorite prop is a dog-eared copy of the 10th Amendment, describing states' rights; she never mentions it. In a pre-arranged bit of campaign theater here, she had witnesses stand and tell their stories -- about things like economic hardship and the loss of a child to murder. Then, through a gentle back-and-forth that ended with hugs and hand-holding, Mrs. Dole explained that her husband's tax cut proposal would benefit women, and that his appointment of tough judges and his insistence that criminals serve their full sentences would keep violent offenders off the streets.
While not all of her events are aimed at attracting women, two of her three 50-minute speeches on Thursday were. But, whatever the audience, her performance always wins Mrs. Dole rave reviews; it is less clear that it wins her husband any new votes.
"I'm a registered Republican, but I'm very ambivalent," said Deborah M. Lewakowski, 33, an accountant from Troy who heard Mrs. Dole speak to about 1,200 people, most of them women, here at the Women's Economic Club. "I'm a C.P.A., so I have very conservative leanings. But I'm also a woman, so I have very humanitarian leanings."
She added that "personally, I haven't suffered so bad over the last four years," referring to Mrs. Dole's description of a sour economy and stagnant wages that would improve under her husband's tax cut plan.
After Mrs. Dole spoke in Indianapolis, Mike McDaniel, the chairman of the Indiana Republican Party, hailed her presentation but questioned whether it would move voters in his reliably Republican state, where Mr. Clinton is running even with Mr. Dole.
"It's tough because we're a full-employment state right now, and people are working," he said. Asked if Mrs. Dole's warm reception was transferrable to her husband, Mr. McDaniel added: "It helps, but you can't do it with one stop on one day. She's trying to cover as much turf as she can, but I wish they would figure out a way to get her more involved, either in some of their advertising or whatever, because she is a tremendous asset to Bob Dole. She's got her act together. She knows what the story is."
A Republican strategist in Washington said that while Mrs. Dole was "a great campaigner, she's not on the ballot," and that the Dole campaign had made "modest to no gains in cracking Bill Clinton's lead" among working women. "Ultimately, for Dole to put together a winning coalition, these women have to come home," he said.
Some of them might -- if Mrs. Dole were on the ballot.
"She articulates her position better than he does," said Judge Mary Waterstone, 56, a Detroit District Court judge who heard her speak here. "He has done a good job leading the Senate, but I think she could do a better job of pulling people together -- men and women, minorities."
Mrs. Dole insists that all of her hard work is strictly on behalf of her husband, that she is not tilling the fields for any future run for office herself.
"I happen to be dedicated to my husband," she said in the interview. "I believe in him; I love him dearly. It is a privilege to campaign for him. I didn't leave the Red Cross to do anything other than be fully supportive, and that's my nature."
"I have absolutely no plans" to run for office, she said. "I'm not tilling the fields."

HEADLINE: When Gambling Calls the Shots

BYLINE: By Theodore Kulongoski and Peter Bragdon; Theodore Kulongoski, the Attorney General of Oregon, directed the Governor's Task Force on Gaming in Oregon. Peter Bragdon, a Portland lawyer, is a former assistant attorney general.

DATELINE: SALEM, Ore.

 BODY:
Imagine the public outrage if state governments began to rely heavily on liquor sales to pay for vital programs, raising revenue by encouraging people to drink more and even advertising new alcoholic concoctions on billboards.
Yet the public is strangely quiet when it comes to the aggressive promotion of and fiscal reliance on gambling, which, like drinking, may be harmless for most but is a severe problem for others. 
 States are increasingly using gambling to raise revenue. Last year, nationwide lottery sales hit $31.9 billion, up from $9 billion in 1985, and from them the 37 states running the lottery games added $11 billion to their coffers.
In Oregon, we are paying a price for our heavy dependence on gambling. Our 12-year-old lottery has helped create a rapidly expanding betting market in which gambling drives public policy, not the other way around. There are social costs, too, but we haven't assessed them because we failed to conduct any studies. A state task force has now recommended that we create an independent gambling council to help us make better decisions than we did a dozen years ago. Until then, perhaps other states can learn from our mistakes.
Last year, Oregon ranked sixth in the world in per capita wagering on lottery games. Besides "scratch" tickets and biweekly drawings, we use keno, sports betting and, most lucrative of all, video poker, introduced in 1992 and now in 1,800 bars and taverns.
Together, these games are expected to provide nearly $753.5 million, or about 9 percent, of our current $8.5 billion general budget. Only the personal income tax brings in more money. Last year, when officials realized that gambling revenues might be short by about $80 million, there was much hand-wringing about how to entice more Oregonians into betting on state games.
By now, Oregon officials know they can raise a lot of money simply by making their gambling operations more attractive or easier to use: by improving the visual appeal of a video poker game, for example, or speeding up the turnaround time of a video game to accommodate more bets in a shorter period.
The state's success in gambling has, in turn, spurred growing competition from the private sector. Oregon now has more forms of legalized gambling, state and private, than almost any other state.
Under the law, Oregon's nine federally recognized Indian tribes can offer forms of gambling already permitted by state law. In other words, when Oregon began to run video lottery games in taverns, it meant that Indian tribes could build casinos with hundreds of these machines. With six such casinos operating, Oregon now has a bad case of what is being called "level playing field syndrome," something akin to an arms race.
The state lottery and its retailers say that to compete with the private Indian-run casinos they must create better video gambling games. The race tracks, already annoyed by state lottery competition, complain that the lottery's new games will kill parimutuel wagering unless tracks are allowed to have card rooms and more than just a few of the state lottery machines.
Indian officials counter that if race tracks get the video betting games, it will cut into their operations and spur some tribes to add even more betting games. Bingo operators, in turn, insist that they need higher prize ceilings to compete with all of this.
Oregonians now joke that the Legislature should establish a Level Playing Field Committee to get ready for an endless stream of bills aimed at satisfying each segment of the gambling market. The truth is, any state that depends heavily on gambling for revenue will find itself under pressure to increase gambling.
Meanwhile, we have learned almost nothing about the social impact of all this. Oregon's video lottery games are thought to be particularly addictive, but until now the state has never tried to find out how many people are hooked. The Attorney General's office has heard from people who have squandered family resources, gone bankrupt or robbed their employers to get money to play. And the number of Gamblers Anonymous meetings in Oregon has grown to 34 per week, up from 3 a week before the gambling explosion.
The lack of information on these kinds of problems allows those who oppose gambling altogether to predict that parts of Oregon will soon resemble Atlantic City or be overrun by criminals and casinos preying on citizens. At the same time, proponents of even more gambling are able to dismiss any social concerns as unfounded. They look at the gambling revenues and point to the beneficiaries: schools, the environment, economic development. Gambling, they say, is good for schools. (Imagine if we said that liquor is "good," because we used it to finance kindergartens.)
Right now, we in Oregon do not know if we have created a monster. Nor do we know the real cost of state-run gambling, social and economic.
But we know we are going to pay the price. States that rush to raise revenues from gambling without thinking more than we did are playing a potentially addictive game of chance.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Surge as Drop in Payrolls Indicates No Rate Rises

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices surged yesterday after the September employment report bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates this year.
For many in the market, the employment report was more evidence that the economy was slowing slightly and that the Fed's policy of keeping interest rates steady was working. Traders focused on a surprising 40,000 drop in the nation's payrolls and were not discouraged by another element of the report that showed a strong rise in wages. 
 "We knew the bond market had been expecting a market-friendly jobs number today, and felt a negative surprise would probably be more harmful than a positive number would be beneficial," said Jack Ablin, director of fixed income at the Private Bank, a unit of the Bank of Boston. "We were a little cautious going in ahead of the number, but now feel good about the market and are looking for the long bond to lower its yield by 5 to 10 basis points each month."
The price of the 30-year bond rose 11/32 , to 1002/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.74 percent, from 6.83 percent on Thursday.
The yield on the long bond -- a benchmark for mortgages and other consumer and corporate rates -- is now at its lowest level since Aug. 9, when it was 6.69 percent.
The monthly employment report is the most important single indicator of the economy's performance, and previous reports this year have roiled the bond market with evidence of surprising strength. So traders were heartened by the unexpected fall in the payroll number.
Still, the gain in average hourly earnings -- up 6 cents, to $11.92 -- is likely to keep inflation concerns alive. But David A. Levy, director of forecasting at the Jerome Levy Economics Institute, Mount Kisco, N.Y., said the market's concerns over wage pressures and inflation were overblown. He said the yield on the 30-year bond could drop to as low as 6.25 percent by the end of the year and to 6 percent by the first half.
"There are only a few months out of the year that the monthly numbers are not skewed for one reason or another," he said. "When you take the last three months you see a trend. The average number of jobs added to the economy over the last three months has been 140,000 a month, compared to well in excess of 250,000 a month in the second quarter of this year. From quarter to quarter it is a marked deceleration. When you see a drop of that magnitude there has to be something to it."
Mr. Ablin of the Private Bank said he was not surprised that employment had continued in a slowing trend. At this rate, he said the yield on the long bond could be as low as 6.50 percent by Dec. 31. "You have to commend the Fed for keeping a steady hand on interest rates," he said, "or better, no hands."
The market now shifts its attention to a round of new inflation data, with the Producer Price Index and retail sales reports on Friday and the Consumer Price Index the following week on Wednesday.
Traders will also be concerned with the market's ability to absorb new supply. The Treasury auctions $26 billion of new three- and six-month Treasury bills on Monday, followed by a $10 billion auction of 10-year notes on Tuesday, and a $19.25 billion auction of one-year bills on Thursday.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the 10-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.47 percent.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Bears Lose 2 More Voices

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Uncle.
That was the word out of Morgan Stanley & Company yesterday morning as two of Wall Street's most visible bears doffed their painfully uncomfortable furs and donned bullish horns. 
 Since April, Byron R. Wien, the firm's United States investment strategist, has been predicting a 1,000-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average. For even longer, Stephen S. Roach, its chief economist, forecast a rise in long-term interest rates to 7.5 percent this year. But in the face yesterday of economic news that prompted yet another stock market closing high and a bond market rally, both finally did an about-face.
"The economy is fine, but our interest rate call isn't," Mr. Roach said in a memorandum to clients.
Mr. Roach said that he now thought that long-term rates would fall to 6.5 percent this year. That is a quarter of a percentage point below where they ended yesterday after a surprisingly weak September jobs report helped solidify a view that the economy was soft and inflation was in check.
Mr. Wien said that with the forecast of declining interest rates, his near-term outlook had flipped. "There is a 10 percent upside in the market," he said, "if interest rates go to 6.5 percent."
The switch by these prominent analysts could add to the very market sentiment that Mr. Roach said forced him to reverse his interest rate outlook. And it leaves very few bears -- those who think markets will drop -- still active as winter approaches. But it is also possible, as has been the case in the past, that when just about everybody thinks stocks can't fall, that is when the market reaches its top.
Economic fundamentals have not changed, Mr. Roach argued. The economy is stronger than current data indicate and eventually interest rates and inflation will move higher. But now, Mr. Roach said, he thinks that will not happen until next year.
Even so, Mr. Roach conceded that most investors were seeing things differently, choosing to focus on the current slowdown in growth, the fact that inflation is still in check, and economic news that could persuade the Federal Reserve to leave short-term interest rates unchanged at least through the end of the year.
Mr. Roach disagrees with that view, but said he could no longer resist the tide. "My job is to try to call the market," he said. "Markets are determined by fundamentals and sentiment and right now sentiment is overwhelming the fundamentals."
The decline in Mr. Roach's interest rate forecast, which Mr. Wien endorsed, moved Mr. Wien to throw in the towel on stocks, too. Instead of the risk of an overvalued market that would push stocks sharply down, lower long-term rates leave the stock market undervalued with the opportunity for a strong rally.
For all the force of their about- face, it was a bit grudging. "I am still worried about a major selloff," Mr. Wien said, "but not until sometime after the first quarter of next year."
And Mr. Roach is forecasting that interest rates will move higher next year, hitting 7 percent to 7.5 percent in the first half. But that is lower than the 8 percent he once thought.
"In my gut, I still think we've got the fundamental call on the economy right, with both growth and inflation likely to play out on the upside of market expectations," he concluded in his memo. "What we missed was the burst of investor euphoria."
So does this mean that the investors who have bet on lower interest rates and higher stocks are wrong?
"No," Mr. Roach said. "They have money to put to work and they want to believe in the perfect path of slow growth and no inflation."

HEADLINE: JOB MARKET WEAK AS ECONOMY EASES, BUT WAGES ARE UP

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
The job market weakened in September, confirming a slowing of the economy, as payrolls unexpectedly fell by 40,000 and the unemployment rate inched up, the Labor Department reported today.
But wages rose substantially for the second consecutive month, which is likely to prevent inflation concerns from fading. 
 Financial markets, shrugging off a 6-cent-an-hour rise in hourly earnings, rallied after the figures were issued, relieved that slackening growth would help keep borrowing costs from rising. Indeed, interest rates tumbled across the board and the Dow Jones industrial average vaulted 60 points to yet another record as it approached the 6,000 mark. [Page 41.]
Just a month before the election, the Clinton Administration attempted to put the disappointing drop in jobs in the best light. It focused on the higher wage figure as demonstrating that average workers were finally beginning to benefit from the economic upturn that has been under way since 1991.
"All recent indicators suggest that the economy will continue on a healthy and balanced course of low unemployment, low inflation and solid economic growth, with all Americans increasingly sharing in the benefits of that growth," the President's chief economic adviser, Joseph E. Stiglitz, said.
Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary, boasted that "we couldn't have a better overall picture going into an election."
The Dole campaign reacted by pointing to the drop in employment last month and deploring what it called subpar economic growth since the end of the 1990-91 recession.
"This Administration has a policy of low economic growth -- and there doesn't seem to be any plan for raising it," said Martin Anderson, an adviser to Mr. Dole who was a senior White House policy official in the first two years of the Reagan Administration. "That is unacceptable."
He said the Dole proposal for a 15 percent tax cut would generate more growth in the next few years than the Clinton Administration expects, and that even a modest improvement would make "an enormous difference."
Unemployment, which in August hit a low point for the 1990's, rose slightly to 5.2 percent in September from 5.1 percent in August.
The monthly job report -- the September figures are the next-to-last ones to be issued before Election Day -- provides the most important single indicator of economic performance.
After a period of confounding mixed readings, various gauges now clearly show that the economy's growth rate has slackened from the rapid 4.7 percent annual pace in the second quarter. Most analysts are estimating that the economy will advance at only half that pace or less for the quarter ended Sept. 30.
"Businesses are responding quicker and quicker to changes," said Mickey D. Levy, economist at Nationsbank Capital Markets in New York, noting that retail sales have been flat lately and factory orders down. "Production is now responding to the slowdown in demand."
The latest figures seemed to confirm the judgment of monetary policy makers at the Federal Reserve, who decided not to raise short-term interest rates last week because of the belief that the economy was slowing enough on its own.
Yet some analysts remained doubtful. "The extent of the slowdown seems very overstated," said John E. Silvia, chief economist at Zurich Kemper Investments, a Chicago mutual-fund group. "The Fed has to be concerned about the wage number."
Payrolls, which had been expected to expand moderately last month, contracted by 40,000 instead, the first decline since January. This figure, the item that usually gets more professional scrutiny than any other in the employment report, was marked by an unnerving and widespread drop of 57,000 factory jobs, and by a 67,000 drop in local education that was almost pure statistical aberration.
The drop in education jobs, part of an 81,000 shrinkage for all levels of government, reflected a failure of the department's adjustment process to keep up with the twin trends of starting the school year earlier and operating schools year-round.
As a result, many jobs held by bus drivers, cafeteria workers, sports referees and the like were captured in the statistical net during August instead of September, when the adjustment -- based on typical patterns from the past -- assumes they will appear. Unlike these support personnel, however, teachers are assumed to be employed while on summer vacation and do not distort the figures except as they may take more or fewer temporary jobs than normal.
The biggest factory declines were in industrial machinery and automotive and other transportation equipment, with factories now employing 331,000 fewer people than at the most recent peak in March 1995.
Job growth continued to slow in services, which expanded by just 54,000 despite a pickup in health services, where a 30,000 gain followed three small ones. Retail trade and construction both showed sluggish growth while finance and real estate were both virtually unchanged.
In all, the expansion of private-sector payrolls, averaging 126,000 a month for July, August and September, was exactly half as large as in the preceding three months.
"We're well off where we were in the second quarter," Thomas J. Plewes, an associate commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said after an agency briefing.
The Government's survey of households, on which the unemployment rate is based, showed a 313,000 increase in the number of people holding one or more jobs last month. But this fell short of a 455,000 expansion of the overall labor force, which includes everyone working or looking for a job. That is why the unemployment rate inched up, although the rise was too small to be statistically significant, the bureau said.
Current jobless rates, some analysts argue, are effectively at the lowest level since 1973 because of a change two years ago in the way the bureau calculates the figures.
The unemployment rate for adult men, which dropped a half-point in August, climbed three-tenths of a point last month to 4.5 percent, the same as for adult women, today's report also showed. The rate for blacks was unchanged at 10.5 percent while that for Hispanic people fell a half-point, to 8.2 percent.
Geographically, the Northeast, South and Midwest all registered jobless rates one-tenth of a point higher than in August -- to 5.2, 5 and 4.5 percent, respectively -- while the rate in the West was unchanged at 6.3 percent.
The department said it had identified what it called a "fairly minor" coding error involving seasonal adjustment that would require recalculation of the series from March through July, with revisions to be published Oct. 18.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE ORATORY;
Clintonian Speeches: A Guide for Listeners

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
In nearly four years as President, Bill Clinton has made thousands of speeches: short ones, long ones, big ones, little ones, good ones, bad ones. But in a way, he has made just one speech -- over and over and over again.
To be sure, the words change, and so do the ideas. Four years ago, Mr. Clinton spoke of providing health insurance to all Americans and expanding education and training to equip workers for a global economy. Now he talks of 48-hour hospital stays for mothers and newborns and uniforms for schoolchildren. 
 Yet in their architecture and their oratorical rhythms, in the topics they cover and the techniques they employ, the President's speeches are remarkably predictable. He seldom hews to any text but the one unspooling in his head, and the outlines of his arguments defy tidy diagramming, because he makes so many subpoints and ambles down whatever cul-de-sac may catch his fancy. He rearranges sections, and repeats some if the spirit strikes him.
Still, a survey of his recent stump speeches makes some patterns clear enough to construct a listener's guide and gazetteer to the spaces and places Mr. Clinton visits when he stands behind the bulletproof lectern that the Secret Service calls the blue goose, for the color of its top and its goose-neck microphone.
 
Glad to Be Here
Like all politicians, Mr. Clinton has his preferred preparatory rituals of greeting and gratitude. He thanks the local politicians on the platform. He thanks the band. "The colder it gets, the harder it is to play one of those instruments, I know," he told students in Buffalo on Thursday.
And he thanks the person who introduced him -- often a citizen chosen to exemplify the point he is trying to make that day -- in effusive and unvarying terms.
"Most of all I'd like to thank Sally and her mother, her daughter, and her granddaughter," he said of one woman who introduced him at an appearance with senior citizens in Sunrise, Fla., last month. "Didn't she do a good job? Let's give her another hand. I thought she was great."
If the introducer is particularly special, or has won particular applause from the crowd, Mr. Clinton will say the he is glad she is not running for any office against him.
In a world of endless airport rallies and undifferentiated photo opportunities, Mr. Clinton also goes out of his way to localize each speech, recalling a snippet of local history, praising the hometown sports team's latest triumph or mourning its defeat, celebrating the scenery or the weather and, in the South especially, larding his speech with regionalisms like "might oughta."
This is also the section in which Mr. Clinton plays off anything funny or diverting that has been said by previous speakers, as he did at a rock-concert rally for Senator John Kerry, who is locked in a tight race for re-election against Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts.
"Whoever said he didn't have a sense of humor?" Mr. Clinton asked the crowd at the Fleet Center in Boston. "Do you believe that Governor Weld would have the guts to stand up here and say he couldn't believe that we had all those people from the '60's play and everybody kept their clothes on? Next thing you know, John Kerry will be doing the macarena with Al Gore."
 
Why Me
Mr. Clinton gets down to business with a passage that begins, "Four years ago, I ran for President because . . ." The reasons vary slightly, but they usually include his desire to rebuild the American economy, restore the American Dream and bring together a country that is too often divided. Mr. Clinton does not claim to have accomplished these goals, but he quickly makes clear that he thinks he's made a good stab at them.
"I come here to tell you today we're in better shape than we were four years ago," he told a crowd in Houston. "And we're on the right track to the 21st century.
The President tries to prove his point with a battery of statistics: 10.5 million new jobs, record numbers of small businesses, record exports, the highest rates of home ownership in 15 years, welfare rolls down by nearly 2 million, child support collections up 50 percent, and his current favorite: the Census Bureau's recent report that median household income increased on average nearly $900 after inflation last year, the biggest increase in 10 years.
"I almost wept when I read it," he said in Fall River, Mass.
Naturally, Mr. Clinton takes credit for much of this good news, and recites his record on issues including cutting the deficit, signing the family and medical leave law, increasing Federal funds to help cities hire police officers and protecting the environment. And he puts flesh on the statistics by citing the stories of people he has met -- sometimes months or years ago, often that day.
In Houston last week, he told the tales of three people he had met shaking hands in Longview, Tex., that morning. The first was a Vietnam veteran with a child who suffers from spina bifida, who thanked Mr. Clinton for expanding Federal benefits to veterans to cover that illness. The second was a 34-year-old single mother of two who is paying her way through college by having served in the President's national service program, Americorps.
"And then I went on down a little more, and I met a lady who was really crying," Mr. Clinton said. "I didn't know what was the matter, she was obviously disturbed. And she said, 'I'm sorry that I'm so emotional, but because of the family and medical leave law, I was able to take a little time off from work when my husband was so sick with cancer, and I didn't lose my job.' "
 
The Best Is Yet to Come
After talking about what he has done, Mr. Clinton moves on to talk about all that he still wants to do. His goals range widely, from offering new tax credits for college education to having the private sector supply cellular telephones to neighborhood watch groups.
He wants to connect every classroom in the country to the Internet. He wants to balance the budget and "still protect our investments in education, in the environment, in Medicare and Medicaid." He wants to "mobilize an army of volunteers to work with parents and teachers to make sure that by the year 2000, every third grader in America can pick up a book and say, 'I can read this all by myself.' "
It is in this part of his typical speech, near the very end, that Mr. Clinton drops in whatever he wants to be the news of the day, outlining his latest proposal for inflation-proof Government bonds or drug testing for prison inmates.
But it is also here that Mr. Clinton sometimes gets lost in the underbrush of his own enthusiasms, veering wildly into meditations on the latest book he has read, musing on the wisdom of the Founding Fathers, the future of science.
If he is tired, his tongue may slip, as it did in Providence, R.I., when he bragged about having signed a bill to guarantee 48-hour hospital stays to end what he likes to call "drive-through deliveries," by saying he had signed a bill to stop "drive-by pregnancies."
In Houston, in a hymn to the nation's diversity that seemed unintentionally salacious, he said, "When I looked at the American Olympic team, it occurred to me that if they took their uniforms off, we wouldn't know where they were from."
Nothing ever seems more difficult for the President than wrapping it all up. Another clause always beckons. At a community college in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., last month, Mr. Clinton three times began sentences saying "Finally . . ." and twice promised to make just one last point before finally sitting down.
On occasion, however, he simply runs out of steam. "Well," he told a crowd in an Iowa farm field at a fund-raiser for Senator Tom Harkin last month, "that's it."

HEADLINE: Presenting the IgNobels, UnPrizes Satirizing Weak Science

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 4

 BODY:
What was surprising about the IgNobel Prizes this year was that the winners of two of them actually accepted them. Usually winners ignore the prizes completely.
The sixth annual spoof of science and the Nobel Prize, sponsored by the Annals of Improbable Research and held on Thursday night at Harvard University's grand Memorial Hall, has become a sort of scientists' Halloween, attended by hundreds of students and faculty members. 
 This year the event was broadcast on National Public Radio and on the Internet.
Ten prizes were awarded in fields ranging from physics and medicine to art and literature for achievements "that cannot or should not be reproduced."
Among the recipients who chose the traditional path of not acknowledging the award was Jacques Chirac, President of France, who was given the IgNobel Peace Prize for a series of atomic bomb tests in the Pacific Ocean while the world was observing the 50th anniversary of Hiroshima.
Nor did any representative of the major American tobacco companies show up to receive the IgNobel in medicine for their discovery, announced in 1994 before Congress, that nicotine is not addictive.
And the editors of the journal Social Text did not retrieve the award in literature, given for publishing a paper entitled, "Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity."
The author of the paper, a physicist at New York University, caused a furor after he announced that it was a hoax. The paper argued that reality does not exist.
But the award in public health was different. It went to Ellen Kleinst from Nuuk, Greenland, and Harald Moi of Oslo, Norway, for a report published in Genitourinary Medicine, a scientific journal. The paper was entitled, "Transmission of Gonorrhea Through an Inflatable Doll." One of the authors of the paper, Dr. Moi, showed up to receive the award.
The biology prize was also accepted by the winners, who sent a videotape from Norway. Anders Baerheim and Hogne Sandvik of the University of Bergen, Norway, were cited for their paper in the British Medical Journal and entitled "Effect of Ale, Garlic and Soured Cream on the Appetite of Leeches."
The authors said in their videotape that they were accepting on behalf of their research subjects, who were "in no position to accept for themselves." The Norwegian consul in Boston picked up the award.
The ceremony this year included not only the awards presentations but also an auction of plaster casts of the left feet of four real Nobelists in New England who cooperated in the casting: Sheldon Glashow, physics, 1979; Dudley Herschbach, chemistry, 1986; William Lipscomb, chemistry, 1976, and Richard Roberts, medicine, 1993.
The ceremonies also included a brief three-act opera about cockroaches and the destruction of the Earth, and a series of papers presented on biodiversity, including one essay defending bacteria and suggesting that hand-washing is a form of interspecies ethnic cleansing.
Other winners of IgNobel Prizes were:
Physics: Robert Matthews of Aston University, England, for his studies of Murphy's Law, which holds that if things can go wrong they will, and the fact that toast frequently falls buttered-side down. His paper "Tumbling Toast, Murphy's Law and the Fundamental Constants," was published in the European Journal of Physics.
Economics: Robert J. Genco of the University of Buffalo for his discovery that "financial strain is a risk indicator for destructive periodontal disease."
Chemistry: George Goble of Purdue University for setting the world-record time for igniting a barbecue -- three seconds. He used charcoal and liquid oxygen.
Art: Don Featherstone of Fitchburg, Mass., for being the first to create a plastic version of pink flamingos for the lawn. The award was given for the "ornamentally evolutionary invention," which the inventor said would "keep the archeologists guessing" when discovered at homesites in centuries to come.
Biodiversity: Chenosuke Okamura of Okamura Fossil Laboratory in Nagoya, Japan, for discovering fossils of an entire array of "mini-species" -- from dinosaurs to humans -- that were each less than one-hundredth of an inch in length. No monetary award comes with the IgNobel prize, but a statue and a few small gifts are included.
The chief sponsor of the prize, the Annals of Improbable Research, is a successor to a periodical that satirized scientific publications, The Journal of Irreproducible Results, which was published between 1955 and 1990. Cosponsors were the Harvard-Radcliffe Science Fiction Association, the Harvard Computer Society, and Tangents, a student mathematics bulletin.

HEADLINE: Campaign Debate Gives Hartford An Opportunity to Promote Itself

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 4

 BODY:
In the minds of city leaders here, when Bob Dole and Bill Clinton square off in their debate on Sunday, there will be one clear winner: Hartford.
For at least a few seconds, this city of 124,000 will be the focus of the world, as millions tune in and hear the magic words, "The Presidential debate, from Hartford, Conn." On that day, about 2,500 reporters will be in town for what may be the largest press event ever to take place here. 
 Many say it is a pivotal moment for this once wealthy city, which has fallen upon hard times. While neither Presidential candidate has seized upon the fate of America's cities as a campaign issue, the debate has become an opportunity for Hartford boosters to tout this city, despite its problems, as a beautiful New England town with a promising future.
Of course, the doubters who ask what the fuss is all about are many. The decline of the insurance industry and the loss of major banks that were based here still loom larger than any one-day event, and besides, some critics grumble, Clinton and Dole are not even addressing the core problems of declining urban centers.
"I think that both parties are getting away from cities to attract those angry white suburban men," said Steven Harris, a firefighter a lifelong Hartford resident. "No one talks about the cities anymore."
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Mayor of New York, shares that view. "So far, neither one of them has spent a great deal of time on urban issues," he said. "Hopefully, the substantive part of the campaign is about to begin, and we will hear a lot more about what they intend to do about cities."
And Hartford's problems are substantial. One of the nation's poorest cities, based on the percentage of people living below the poverty line, it shrank early in this decade faster than any other city in the nation, losing 11 percent of its population in the first four years.
Still, Hartford's triumph in being chosen for the debate over 40 other cites is being hailed as one of many signs that the city's fortunes may be turning around.
"What happens on Sunday could be critical to the success of Hartford," said Dan Papermaster, the 32-year-old lawyer who a year ago had the idea of bringing the debate here. "This is a chance to show that tremendous things are going on in Hartford."
Crime has dropped to its lowest level in a decade, tourist events over the last two years have drawn thousands of suburbanites back into the city, and the unemployment rate has declined slighlty.
Yet in some respects, this is an unlikely place for the debate. Over the last five years, the city has lost two of its largest hotels, leaving it with only 1,000 rooms in the downtown area. Many visiting reporters -- and even Bob Dole -- will be staying in hotels in surrounding towns, with some as far away as Springfield, Mass, 25 miles north.
But the Hartford region has responded to the coming event with an enthusiasm that harkens back to a time when Presidential candidates were routinely greeted by huge crowds and ticker-tape parades.
Banners on the highways welcome people to "the home of the Presidential debate." Planters holding chrysanthemums have been placed on downtown streets, and suburban towns have sent cleaning crews to help city workers, who are laboring overtime. Graffiti is being washed away, the windows of abandoned buildings are being boarded up, and volunteers are pulling weeds from little-used parking lots.
The staff at the Bushnell, the 1930 Art Deco-style theater where the debate will be held, has been working around the clock for 10 days, repainting doors, sweeping steps and appointing a "glass and brass" team to polish brass and clean windows. "The brass is shining like it never has in 66 years," Deidre M. Tavera, the Bushnell's associate managing director, said today.
Although some dismiss the attention as merely Hartford's 15 minutes of fame -- "Who remembers where the 1992 debates were held?" one city worker grumbled (St. Louis; Richmond, Va., and Lansing, Mich.) -- city leaders gush about the benefits of every brief mention of the city on network television.
The city's Congresswoman, Barbara B. Kennelly, called it "the most important event" in Hartford's 300-year history. An editorial in The Hartford Courant maintained that the debate "should put Hartford on the map."
The Deputy Mayor, Frances Sanchez, said: "People always claim nothing happens in Hartford. Now with this international and national attention, people will wake up. The problems in Hartford are not going to be solved in a weekend, but people are excited; our neighbors are excited."
The debate is emblematic of a new civic pride, and it was brought here through a concerted effort by citizens, business leaders and elected officials.
It was the brainchild of Mr. Papermaster, a former aide to Senator Christopher Dodd, who along with Evan S. Dobelle, the president of Trinity College, sold the idea to business leaders, ultimately raising $1 million. When officials from the nonpartisan Presidential Debate Commission visited here last October, they received a gala welcome replete with a bus tour, a lunch catered by one of the city's best restaurants and a meeting with Gov. John G. Rowland, Mayor Mike Peters and Mrs. Kennelly.
The promoters even had a Mark Twain impersonator on hand. Twain, a Hartford resident for 17 years, has become something of a city symbol.
In January, the commission awarded the city the Vice-Presidential debate, but all plans changed last month when the two candidates reduced the number of debates from four to three. At that point, Senator Dodd, the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, let it be known that he would not tolerate Hartford being dropped.
In a television interview on Sunday, Mr. Dodd said, "I weighed in very heavily with the Commission, with Paul Kirk, with Mickey Cantor on the Democratic side, to see to it that Hartford would be in the mix."
Mr. Kirk, a former Democratic Party chairman, is an official of the commission; Mr. Cantor, the Commerce Secretary, was representing President Clinton in debate negotiations.
As to whether Hartford's problems will be addressed in the debate, most politicians are not expecting much.
"They will go to one of the nation's most depressed cities and are likely to have a debate in front of the nation where they don't say a word about cities," said David Rusk, a former mayor of Albuquerque, N.Mex., and an urban policy consultant in Washington.
Urban experts say the negligible discussion of cities during the campaign stems from the declining role of the Federal Government in urban affairs as a result of budget cuts and from the candidates' electoral strategies, which emphasize the suburban vote and make urban policy a risky topic.
Mayor Giuliani pointed out that Mr. Clinton has yet to explain what he intends to do about the new welfare law, which Mr. Giuliani said is creating "real terrible problems" for cities. And Mr. Dole still must explain how he plans to take his philosophy of opportunity and empowerment and make it relevant to cities, Mr. Giuliani added.
"I think both of them have the opportunity to do that, but neither one has done it yet," he said.
Supporters of each candidate deny that they have ignored urban problems.
While the Republican Vice-Presidential nominee, Jack Kemp, told a crowd in New Haven on Thursday that Mr. Clinton had no plan to help urban residents escape poverty, he insisted that Mr. Dole's economic plan, with its tax cuts and tax credits, would do that. Republicans also note that Mr. Kemp's long-held advocacy of enterprise zones -- designated urban areas that would receive special tax credits -- is proof of Mr. Dole's commitment.
In turn, William E. Curry Jr., a domestic policy adviser to Mr. Clinton and a former candidate for governor of Connecticut, remarked, "Just because it's not a radioactive campaign issue doesn't mean we don't have a program." While accusing the Republicans of lacking any specifics in their urban proposal, he said Mr. Clinton had sent Federal aid and personnel to cities to fight crime and had established empowerment zones that channeled millions of dollars to urban areas, among other initiatives.
There are examples of Mr. Clinton's work in Hartford that he may point to in the debate, Mr. Curry said.
Still, some in this city, dissatisfied by the lack of attention so far to urban policy, have mobilized to pressure the candidates to talk about cities.
On Monday, a community group, Hartford Area Rallies Together, gave Mr. Curry a list of issues they hoped Mr. Clinton would examine. And on Sunday, they are holding a rally to draw attention to the need to create jobs here.

Stocks and Bonds Rally On Weak Employment Data
The Dow Jones industrial average shot toward the 6,000-mark as a weakening job market confirmed a slowing of the economy -- convincing traders that the Federal Reserve will not need to raise interest rates to contain inflation. Broader stock market barometers jumped to record levels as well, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index surpassing the 700-mark for the first time. 
 The Dow rose 60.01 to finish at 5,992.86, having come within 5 points of 6,000 in the last hour of trading. The blue-chip average has now rocketed back about 800 points, or more than 15 percent, from July's bruising selloff. For the week, the Dow was up 119.94 points. [Page 41.]
 
Treasury prices surged after the employment report bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates this year. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.74 percent, from 6.83 percent on Thursday. [38.]
 
The dollar followed the markets higher despite the expectation of lower interest rates. [40]
 
Wages Rise for 2d Straight Month
Despite an unexpected 40,000 drop in payrolls and a slight rise in the unemployment rate, wages rose substantially for the second straight month, which is likely to prevent inflation concerns from fading from the picture. Unemployment, which in August hit a low point for the 1990's, rose slightly, to 5.2 percent, in September from 5.1 percent in the previous month. Financial markets, though, shrugged off a 6-cent rise in hourly earnings, relieved that slackening growth would help keep borrowing costs from rising. [1.]
 
Shift on Air Crash Liability Limits
The Transportation Department has given tentative approval to a rule that would eliminate the limit on liability for damages in international air crashes unless the airline could prove it was not negligent. The current rule, specified by the Warsaw Convention since 1966, limits damages to $75,000 unless a victim's family can show that an airline was guilty of willful misconduct. [39.]
 
Pressure Increased on Time Warner
New York City has stepped up the pressure in its effort to persuade Time Warner to carry Rupert Murdoch's new 24-hour news channel, suggesting that a refusal by Time Warner could affect whether the city renews the company's lucrative cable franchises. [25.]
 
The Guiliani Administration has waded into a corporate grudge match that sounds like it was dreamed up in Hollywood. [26.]
 
S.E.C. Closes Denver Case
The S.E.C., as expected, closed its two-year investigation of Denver's sale of $3.9 billion in airport bonds without filing any charges. [39.]
 
I.R.S. Ruling Worries Airlines
The airline industry says an I.R.S. ruling could cost it more than $1 billion by 2004, if applied nationally. The agency ruled that a regional airline's costs for periodic engine inspections were capital investments to be depreciated over seven years, not an ordinary business expense that is deductible immediately. [38.]
 
Alcoa Earnings Fall 70 Percent
Alcoa reported a 70 percent drop in third- quarter profits, citing lower prices, higher materials costs and the cost of early retirements and layoffs. [38.]

HEADLINE: Dow in Surge Near 6,000 Spurred by Report on Jobs

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average shot toward the 6,000-mark yesterday as a weakening job market confirmed a slowing of the economy, convincing traders that the Federal Reserve will not need to raise interest rates to contain inflation.
Broader stock market barometers jumped to record levels as well, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index surpassing the 700-mark for the first time. 
 The Dow rose 60.01 points, to 5,992.86, having come within 5 points of 6,000 in the last hour of trading. The blue-chip average has now rocketed back about 800 points, or more than 15 percent, from July's bruising selloff. For the week, the Dow was up 119.94 points, or 2 percent.
That summer tailspin was instigated largely by worries that rising production costs would force the inflation-wary Federal Reserve to raise its key lending rates, slowing consumer spending and, perhaps, corporate profits.
Now those worries have abated. Indeed, the inspiration for yesterday's rally was a Labor Department report that payrolls fell by 40,000 and unemployment moved up to 5.2 percent in September from 5.1 percent in August, a seven-year low. Last week, the Fed heartened investors by leaving interest rates unchanged.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners, 1,803 to 726, on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was heavy at 463.9 million shares.
The S.& P. 500 rose 8.68, to 701.46, ending up 15.27 from last Friday, and the Big Board composite index rose 4.02, to 374.16 -- the fourth record finish for both indexes this week.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 14.47, to 1,247.56,, just a point and a half shy of its high set on June 5. The index was up 19.58 on the week. The Nasdaq market, where more volatile technology and speculative companies are traded, had lagged behind the blue-chip rebound from July's selloff, which dragged the Nasdaq composite as low as 1,008.
The American Stock Exchange's market value index, which is also dominated by more speculative shares, rose 7.29, to 579.89, but is still about 35 points from its May peak.
Among the Dow industrials, Bethlehem Steel fell 1, to 8 5/8; Union Carbide lost 3/4, to 45 1/4; Alcoa dipped3/8, to 60, and Caterpillar gave up 3/8, to 73 1/2.

How Dole Fell

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
To understand why Bob Dole's Presidential quest is D.O.A. at the first debate, don't listen to pundits or White House spin artists but to a conservative Republican strategist in his party's trenches. A 103-page campaign document commissioned by Americans for a Republican Majority -- the political action committee headed by Tom DeLay, the House majority whip -- tells everything you need to know about why the Dole-Kemp campaign has failed.
The document, first uncovered by David Corn of The Nation and now gaining wider circulation among journalists, was written by Frank Luntz, the pollster who helped Newt Gingrich mastermind the Contract With America that heralded the G.O.P. Congressional sweep of '94. Based on 2,000 hours of focus groups and other voter research in the two years since, the report is an in-house guidebook instructing state and local Republican candidates nationwide on how to run best in the less hospitable climate of '96. The national ticket is never mentioned, but Mr. Luntz's advice can also be read retroactively as an unintended yet devastating commentary on the Dole political game plan. In almost every instance, the Presidential campaign is marching in the exact opposite direction of the often commonsensical Luntz prescriptions. 
 Rightly obsessed with the gender gap, Mr. Luntz prefaces his advice by noting that "the average American" is "a 32.7-year-old white woman." Such an electorate, he argues, is "harshly anti-partisan" in the aftermath of the Gingrich Congress's revolutionary bombast. "Voters don't want to hear candidates call each other ideological names," he writes, adding that "the angry, indignant, inflammatory approach" is a turn-off. Yet what is the latest Dole-Kemp tactic? Try to find a Dole sound bite or TV spot this week that doesn't feature the angry, indignant, inflammatory cry of "Liberal! Liberal! Liberal!"
Similarly, Mr. Luntz argues that G.O.P. candidates must talk about the future, should not talk about abortion ("a lose-lose situation"), should distance themselves from corporations that voters consider "special interests," and should play to Americans' hunger "for a sense of community" in "the world beyond their families." Mr. Dole, by contrast, has focused on his (and the country's) past, has repeatedly stumbled into abortion, has flaunted his connection to tobacco money and has trashed the communitarian rhetoric of "It Takes a Village."
But the most telling insights into Mr. Dole's travails can be found in the many pages the document devotes to any campaign's topic A -- the economy. It was Mr. Luntz's '94 polling that persuaded the G.O.P. to list the balanced-budget amendment as the No. 1 item in the Contract With America -- reflecting its pre-eminent popularity -- and, unsurprisingly, the appeal of a balanced budget remains undimmed today. In his recommendations for '96, Mr. Luntz urges that candidates talk about tax cuts by linking them to fiscally responsible spending cuts. Indeed, he writes that candidates shouldn't even use the phrase "tax cuts" but substitute "tax relief" instead -- given voter cynicism in the wake of broken Bush and Clinton pie-in-the-sky tax-cut promises.
What Mr. Luntz proposes is entirely consistent with Bob Dole's own career-long record as a deficit hawk. Or former record. This summer Mr. Dole reversed course, choosing to build his candidacy instead around exactly the kind of tax-cut promise that Mr. Luntz predicted would leave voters incredulous. Worse, Mr. Dole is vague about what spending cuts would pay for it. "Trusting the People," the book in which he and Jack Kemp outline their economic plan, is far more specific about what spending is exempt from cutting (Social Security, Medicare, defense -- half the Federal budget) than it is about wielding an ax. The free lunch of supply-side economics, we're asked to believe, will cover any shortfall.
If Bob Dole had been true to his own economic convictions, he wouldn't now be trying to sell a 15 percent tax-cut plan few Americans are buying, and he wouldn't have enabled a Democratic President, however preposterously and disingenuously, to steal the balanced-budget banner from the Republicans. Frank Luntz's playbook for a G.O.P. victory this year, tellingly enough, more often reads like a description of Bill Clinton's campaign than it does of Bob Dole's.

HEADLINE: RITE OF ANGUISH: A special report.;
Genital Ritual Is Unyielding in Africa

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: MAN, Ivory Coast

 BODY:
Marthe Bleu is 12 years old, a shy, pretty girl with a heart-shaped face, dressed in flip-flops and a lacy white pinafore trimmed in pink satin. But already her body is taking on the soft, rounded shape of womanhood. And these days she wants more than anything to do what she believes stands between her and being grown up. She wants to have her genitals cut off.
In the lament of pubescent girls everywhere, she says that all her friends are getting ahead of her. Their parents have sent them into the woods where village women "cut what is down there," she said, gesturing to her lap. 
 After the rite, the girls are showered with gifts of money, jewelry and cloth. Their families honor them with celebrations where hundreds of relatives and friends feast on goat, cow and chicken.
"It is the custom, and I want to respect it," she said.
The tradition of female genital cutting is woven into the everyday life of the Yacouba people here, just as it is for hundreds of ethnic groups in a wide band of 28 countries across Africa. In Man, it is part of a girl's dreams of womanhood, a father's desire to show off with a big party and a family's way of proving its conformity to social convention.
The rising chorus of international condemnation of this age-old practice, voiced in recent years from the podiums of United Nations assemblies in Vienna, Cairo and Beijing, echoes only faintly in places like Man, a tourist town deep in the interior, surrounded by the craggy, cloud-shrouded Toura mountains.
On the coast, in the cosmopolitan hubbub of Abidjan, and in other parts of Africa, the debate about female genital cutting is slowly moving into the public arena. Only in the last few years have African nations even begun measuring the prevalence of genital cutting as part of national health surveys or in other research.
In the Ivory Coast and the Central African Republic, two out of five women have been cut. In Togo, it is one in eight. In the Sudan -- the only country that already had reliable national estimates -- it is 9 out of 10. In Mali, it is 93 percent.
"It looks like women in most countries are nearly as likely to undergo these procedures as their mothers and grandmothers," said Dara Carr, a researcher at Macro International Inc., the Maryland-based company that is assisting the countries in conducting the health surveys. "But there are some seeds of change."
In the Sudan, the prevalence of the practice has dropped from 96 percent to 89 percent over the course of a decade. And there has been a shift toward a less severe form of genital cutting. In Togo, a survey found that half of the mothers who had been cut wanted to spare their daughters. And while three-quarters of the women in Mali favor continuing the practice, a majority in the Central African Republic want to end it.
But what women want and what they have the power to accomplish are very different things. In most of the countries where tens of millions of girls and women have been cut, organizations have sprung up to combat the practice.
Like mosquitoes attacking an elephant, the small, ill-financed groups are struggling within societies where men rule women's lives, and old people, including old women, rule the young. There are, for example, Ivoirian laws against physical violence that could be used to stop the cutting, said Idrissa Fofana, a high-ranking official in the Justice Ministry.
But the Government has no interest in imposing them on unwilling families, antagonizing village chiefs and family elders who are pillars of society and guardians of tradition.
"If there was a complaint from parents that their child had been excised against their wishes, the Justice Ministry could pursue the case," Mr. Fofana said. "But if there is no complaint, we cannot disturb the peace of the family and the village."
Like most Yacouba girls in Man, Marthe Bleu is an eager initiate. But even if she resisted, her father, Jean-Baptiste Bleu, a trim, genial, neatly dressed waiter at a local hotel, would insist on her cutting.
"If your daughter has not been excised, the father is not allowed to speak at village meetings," he said. "No man in the village will marry her. It is an obligation. We have done it, we do it and we will continue to do it."
"She has no choice. I decide. Her viewpoint is not important."
The Bleus have not yet chosen who will cut Marthe, but not far from their home, through a maze of dirt pathways, lives Madeleine Douan, 47, one of the local excisers.
The tall, sinewy woman refused to show the ceremonial knife she uses, but brought out other accouterments of her calling: a long strand of metal bells and cloth sacks filled with bottle caps. While she cuts a group of 10 to 15 girls on the ground of the forest, other women shake the noisemakers, covering the cries of pain. Mrs. Douan herself sings traditional songs.
She introduced several of the girls she had recently cut. Natalie Sahi, 15, sat on the side of her thigh outside Mrs. Douan's windowless mud hut to avoid putting direct pressure on the wound. "I wanted it to happen," she said. "It's natural."
Patricia Vehgolou, 13, her hair neatly braided in corn rows, buried her face in her hands and would only giggle when asked if the cutting hurt. Mrs. Douan explained that the girls must swear before leaving the forest that they will not share the secrets of the rite with the uninitiated.
The purpose of the cutting, Mrs. Douan said, is to help insure a woman's fidelity to her husband and her family. "It's a tradition from antiquity," she said. A woman's role in life is to care for her children, keep house and cook. If she has not been cut, Mrs. Douan said, a woman might think instead about her own sexual pleasure.
 
The Origins
Pride, Tradition And Ignored Risks
It is not known when, where or why the practice of female genital cutting originated. Scholars believe that it started in Egypt or the Horn of Africa more than 2,000 years ago, before the advent of Christianity or Islam. It then spread west across the continent, all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, with the migration of dominant tribes and civilizations.
The practice knows no class or religious boundaries. Most prevalent among Muslims, it is also performed by Christians and followers of traditional African religions. The practice is more widespread among the illiterate, but it is also common among the educated.
The nature of the cutting, the reasons for it and the age at which it is done vary greatly by region and ethnic group.
The practice involves amputating some or all of the external genitalia -- the clitoris, the small genital lips and the large ones -- diminishing a woman's ability to experience sexual pleasure. It can also cause serious health problems, including hemorrhaging and infection.
Typically, the cutting is done by traditional village women without anything to dull the pain. But sometimes, when midwives or nurses are brought in to do the job, they apply a local anesthetic.
Many believe that cutting helps insure a girl's virginity before marriage and fidelity afterward by reducing sex to a marital obligation. Often, people follow the custom simply because it has always been done.
"Children are born and the parents do it," said Awa Kone, a Malian washerwoman in Abidjan, who plans to take her baby daughter, Kadia, to an exciser in the near future.
In the Horn of Africa -- Djibouti, Somalia, the Sudan and parts of Ethiopia -- the most severe and harmful form of cutting, infibulation, is practiced.
In this procedure, the clitoris and some or all of the small genital lips are cut away. Then an incision is made in the large lips so the raw surfaces can be stitched together, covering the urethra and most of the vagina. Only a small opening, as tiny as a matchstick or as large as a small fingertip, is left to pass urine and menstrual blood, said Nahid Toubia, a Sudanese surgeon who is an associate professor at Columbia University.
Infibulation comes with its own set of rationales. Some men say the artificial tightness heightens their sexual enjoyment. The smoothness of the scar is found esthetically beautiful. And the stitching itself forms a chastity belt of flesh.
There is a common thread to all forms of cutting. Economic realities underlie the practice. Women typically have no way to survive without a husband. Parents insist on the rite so their daughters are marriageable.
"People do know the health risks," said Ellen Gruenbaum, a medical anthropologist at California State University, San Bernardino. "They have seen people get sick. On rare occasions, a girl might die. But you will not change people's minds by preaching to them or telling them they're primitive. They undertake the risks for reasons important to them."
After the cutting, more pain lies ahead. Women who have endured the more extreme forms of the practice have particularly agonizing and complicated deliveries. The scarring narrows the vaginal opening and makes the flesh inelastic, doctors and midwives say. The pressure of a baby's emerging head often causes grave tearing of the vagina.
Women who bear a child in their villages without a doctor to widen the vagina surgically sometimes arrive torn and bleeding at the Maternal Health Center in Man. On occasion, the tearing goes up into the urethra and bladder, down into the anus, as well as side to side. The women must then be sent to a hospital in Abidjan for surgery.
Clautilde Yenon, a midwife at the health center, tried to think of a way to convey the excruciating damage. Finally, she had an idea. She picked up a sheet of paper and ripped it into jagged pieces.
 
The Policy
Official Reluctance To Oppose Custom
Ivoirian officials, working in skyscrapers that form Abidjan's sawtoothed profile, talked a good deal in interviews about the evils of genital cutting, but then conceded that their ministries have done little to put words into action.
The Ministry of Public Health is planning a campaign to educate people about the health consequences of the practice, often referred to here as excision and sometimes as female circumcision, but there is as yet no budget or staff to carry it out.
Narcisse Ehoussou, an obstetrician who heads the ministry's reproductive health program, told this story to explain the slow pace of change:
"A French doctor of public health once went to western Ivory Coast. He was horrified by what he saw, people with goiters on their necks. When he returned, he asked, 'Why don't you study this?' He was told, 'We don't study it because it is normal.' For women, excision is normal.
"You have to be patient in Africa. Just as it was difficult to convince people to accept family planning, so it is with excision."
It is not surprising that the Ivoirian Government is loath to take on genital cutting, despite the existence of laws that could be used to stop it. Like most African countries, the Ivory Coast is composed of many ethnic groups. Some practice it. Others, including that of President Henri Konan Bedie, the Baule, do not. There is generally great tolerance for differing traditions, and a reluctance to disturb the sometimes uneasy political balance.
"A judge's role is to maintain public order, but by combating excision, he would disturb public order," said Mr. Fofana, of the Justice Ministry. "We cannot impose the law suddenly. The law we have was inspired by the French colonizers. It does not take account of customs."
Such views aggravate Tomam Constance Yai, a speech therapist for deaf children and the Ivory Coast's leading crusader against genital cutting. "For our Government, violence against women is not a public disturbance," she said ironically.
Ms. Yai, whose grandmother was an exciser, founded the Ivoirian Association for the Defense of Women's Rights four years ago. It is a grand name for a small group of volunteers who fight ingrained cultural practices like forced marriage, polygamy and genital cutting.
With wily charm, Ms. Yai is pushing the Government to act, careful not to favor the aggressive prosecution of excisers or offending parents. Such tactics, she says, would only drive the practice underground. Rather, she wants to bring an educational campaign to the Government-controlled television stations, as well as schools, hospitals and clinics.
International pressure gives her group what little strength it has, she said: "If it were only our association, our Government would ignore us. They would say we're just a small group of foolish women."
So far, the pressure has mainly taken the form of verbal denunciations at United Nations gatherings. In Beijing, at the Fourth World Conference on Women, Hillary Rodham Clinton called it a human rights violation "when young girls are brutalized by the painful and degrading practice of genital mutilation."
Some human rights groups maintain that Western governments should link foreign aid negotiations with progress on the issue. But in the Ivory Coast, diplomats from the United States, which provides no direct aid to the Ivoirian Government, though it is supporting an AIDS research project, and France, the country's former colonial ruler and biggest aid donor, are reluctant to press the Ivoirian Government on the issue.
"It's a matter principally for local society to determine the extent to which these practices are to be tolerated," said Thomas G. Hart, a spokesman for the United States Embassy in Abidjan.
Emmanuel Gagniarre, a spokesman for the French Embassy in Abidjan, said: "This is a marginal problem. It's important, but to feed people is probably more important. I don't think it can be an issue when negotiations take place on aid provided to African countries."
 
The Ceremony
Sudden Agony, Then Celebration
In Man, a girl's rite of passage culminates in a day of joyous, enveloping pageantry. But the powerful pull of belonging to the group does not always overwhelm private doubts about the intimate consequences of the practice.
Jean-Baptiste Bleu, the waiter who plans to have his daughter cut, said he has slept with women who have not been cut and married one who has. A woman who has been cut is difficult to arouse, the sex often dry, he said. Yacouba men talk among themselves about how to excite their wives -- what places to caress, what words to whisper.
Without equivocation, he said, sex with an uncut woman is much better. "She is happy, joyous," said Mr. Bleu, who is 39.
Still, he believes the cutting is a duty. His daughters must endure the rite courageously, without showing their pain or fear, he said.
His wife, Yvonne, 31, said she will defer to his wishes, but she despises the practice because it deprives women of sexual sensitivity. "It is up to my husband," she said. "We live in Africa. The man makes the decisions about the children."
Several other women whose families rent rooms around the same courtyard as the Bleus pulled up a chair to join the talk. Not all were as emotionally torn.
Margarite Lou, 31, fondly remembered the celebration that followed the rite -- the lavish gifts, the applause of the villagers, the feast. And she lustily asserted that she very much enjoys sex, despite having undergone one of the more extreme forms of cutting. Even her scar is sensitive, she said.
Mrs. Lou dismissed notions that the cutting is harmful to a woman's health, passing on an old wives' tale. "It's easier to give birth if you're excised," she said. "There are no lips to close the opening of the vagina."
Twelve-year-old Marthe Bleu was then playing across the courtyard, as innocent of the bawdy talk that day as she is of sex itself. For her, womanhood beckons. And genital cutting is the portal she must walk through to enter it.
"I feel my friends are better than me because they have been cut down there," she had said earlier, her hands twisting in her lap. "It's very difficult, but I want to do it."

Chart: "CASE STUDIES: Census of an Ancient Rite"
The World Health Organization, advocacy groups and news accounts often cite the estimate that 85 to 115 million girls and women have been subjected to genital cutting, but these numbers are considered uncertain because there have been few scientific surveys. The rite is known to be practiced in 28 African countries. In recent years, large-scale surveys in six of these countries have produced the first solid data. Chart shows results of these surveys.

HEADLINE: U.S. REPORTS DROP IN RATE OF BIRTHS TO UNWED WOMEN

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
For the first time in nearly two decades, the rate of births among unmarried women declined in 1995, and for the fourth year in a row the teen-age birth rate dropped, the National Center for Health Statistics said today.
The out-of-wedlock birth rate dropped to 44.9 live births per 1,000 unmarried women last year, down from 46.9 births in 1994, a decline of 4 percent, according to a report by the agency, a division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
 At the same time, the birth rate for teen-agers declined to 56.9 births per 1,000 girls in 1995, from 58.9 births the year before, for girls 15 to 19.
Both the rates for out-of-wedlock births and for teen-age births are part of a general decline in the nation's birth rate. For the fifth consecutive year, the total number of births decreased and the birth rate of 14.8 births per 1,000 population was the lowest level in 20 years.
Analysts say about half of the decline in the out-of-wedlock birth rate stemmed from changes in reporting births in California, so that children whose parents had different surnames were no longer automatically considered to have been born out of wedlock. The analysts noted that 37 percent of the country's Hispanic babies were born to California residents last year, and so the reporting change resulted in fewer Hispanic infants' being counted erroneously as out-of-wedlock births.
Even with the change in reporting, the one-year drop in out-of-wedlock births and some related statistical markers is significant, analysts said.
"There is still a real decline," said Stephanie Ventura, a demographer with the National Center for Health Statistics and the author of its report.
While the drop in both the out-of-wedlock rate and the rate in teen-age births are its most eye-catching features, the report, "Births and Deaths: United States, 1995," included a wealth of data indicating that some of the nation's most troubling social trends appear to be abating, although only slightly in some areas:
*Homicide rates fell by 15 percent, when adjusted to factor in the aging of the general population. It was the largest decline among the leading causes of deaths in 1995, and the decrease was double that of the decline of 1994 against 1993, and continued the nationwide trend in lower homicide rates.
*Infant mortality rates reached a record low of 7.5 babies per 1,000 live births, a 6 percent drop from 1994.
*For the first time since 1987, when AIDS began to be listed separately as a cause of death and became the leading killer in certain age groups, the rate of death stayed steady. Still, the total number of deaths from AIDS reached a record high last year, 42,506.
*Overall life expectancy reached 75.8 years last year, tying the previous record high reached in 1992. Life expectancy for black males also rose, to 65.4 years, the highest level since 1985, when AIDS deaths and sharp increases in homicides began to afflict inner-city neighborhoods.
Today's report is another set of favorable figures coming from a Federal agency in recent days. Last week, the Census Bureau reported that for the first time in six years, inflation-adjusted family incomes increased, and that poverty rates registered their largest decline in more than 10 years.
As he did last week with regard to the income figures, President Clinton quickly seized upon today's report as evidence that his policies were beginning to bear fruit, even though the statistical report is based on 1995 data and some of the policies he cited were not in effect until this year.
In an advance copy of his weekly Saturday radio address, Mr. Clinton declared that stepped-up enforcement of child support laws, and a 1996 executive order requiring young mothers to stay in school or live with their parents in order to keep welfare assistance, have helped produce "progress" in turning around the epidemic of teen-age pregnancy and out-of-wedlock births.
"The American family is getting stronger and we are making responsibility a way of life," Mr. Clinton said. "Our economy and our society are on the right track."
But Bob Dole, the Republican Presidential nominee, said that if Mr. Clinton was going to take credit for the drop in out-of-wedlock births and teen-age pregnancy, then he should also take responsibility for the marked increase in drug use among teen-agers that has occurred in recent years.
"If Clinton admits that a strong voice from the White House can make a difference in changing teen behavior, then why has he been silent as a million new young people have started using drugs?" the Dole campaign said in a statement.
But others who have studied the issue insist that no one can say with certainty why the birth rates for teen-agers and single women are falling. The last drop was in 1976, when the out-of-wedlock rate was 24.3 per 1,000, down from 24.5 in 1975.
Demographers are awaiting the results of "The National Survey of Family Growth," a major study that will be produced this year by the Government for the first time since 1988. The study will include data on sexual activity, contraceptive use and other issues that could shed light on declining birth rates.
There is evidence from previous reports by the National Center for Health Statistics that sexual activity among teen-agers has waned, analysts say.
"While we don't have firm data yet for the middle of the 1990's, it seems that the big increase we had in the proportion of girls and guys who were sexually active as teens seems to have leveled off," said Jacqueline Darroch Forrest, vice president for research at the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit organization that does research on sexual issues and favors abortion rights.
And there is also evidence of an increased use of longer-lasting birth control methods, like Norplant, which is implanted under the skin and lasts for five years, and Depo-Provera, an injectable hormone that is effective for several months. Experts say condom use is also growing, primarily because of AIDS.
Yet conservative analysts do not attribute part of the decline in teen-age sexual activity to increased use of contraceptives. Instead, they say, the drop is influenced by increased abstinence among teen-agers.
"There is a new wave of virgins," said Gracie Hsu, a policy analyst with the Family Research Council, a conservative organization. "They are proud to be pure. They are boldly claiming their purity."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE VOTERS;
For Philadelphia Blacks, Clinton Is 'the Lesser of Two Evils'

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Derrick Rhamad is the kind of voter the Republicans say they have been dreaming about to help them retake the White House next month. He is a 32-year-old black bank investigator, who advocates boot-strap capitalism and a strong military. He denounces "welfare dependency," high taxes and soft-on-crime liberals.
He is a volunteer coach for his 9-year-old son's Little League football team in Philadelphia's integrated, middle-class Mount Airy neighborhood, and he admires Jack Kemp, the former professional quarterback and current Republican Vice-Presidential candidate who has been aggressively reaching out to black voters on behalf of the party and its Presidential nominee, Bob Dole. 
 "I'm a Republican," Mr. Rhamad said proudly the other evening as dusk fell fast and cool over the practice field. "I like Jack Kemp a lot, but I don't like Bob Dole. I'm voting for Clinton this year."
Yet Mr. Rhamad, and more than a dozen other black voters interviewed on the streets of Philadelphia who said they intended to vote for Mr. Clinton, showed little enthusiasm for their choice. Many said Mr. Clinton was their pick by default and through fear of what a Republican in the White House might do to the social safety net at which even the Democratic President has been hacking away. One called Mr. Clinton "a Reagan Democrat." And the phrase on the lips of almost everyone comparing him to Mr. Dole was "the lesser of two evils."
Camille Edwards, a 27-year-old social worker, said she was especially upset with Mr. Clinton for signing the welfare legislation because it will lead to more crime. "People will be robbing left and right just to eat," she said. "Nobody is going to allow their children to starve." Nevertheless, she said, she would vote for Mr. Clinton hoping he "will act more like a Democrat" in a second term.
"I don't think Clinton is the black man's friend by any means," Ms. Edwards said as she shopped along Germantown Avenue with her friend, Vanessa Walker, a 31-year-old nurse's aid. "He's kind of like Abe Lincoln who freed the slaves almost by accident."
Ms. Walker was much more enthusiastic about the President. "Clinton. Clinton. Clinton," she said. "A lot of people are registering to vote because if Bob Dole gets in, we are going to catch hell."
Still, most of the voters interviewed said they thought that the welfare system needed reform, and that too many people had turned welfare into "a way of life." But although most had jobs, from college professors to a laundromat manager, all expressed concern for the millions of Americans who were homeless and hungry, and the millions more who were just slightly better off.
"Dole wants to cut, cut, cut," Mr. Rhamad said, his coach's whistle dangling around his neck. "He's too much like Reagan. We need more programs for the kids, more places for them to go to get off the streets. But Dole wants to cut too much out."
Not one voter said they would support Mr. Dole, certainly not 70-year-old Ozell Liggett, who, like Mr. Dole, is a veteran of World War II. Mr. Liggett said he thought the former Senator was living too much in the past, reaching back with his proposed 15 percent tax cut to revive the "voodoo economics of Reagan."
"Dole also talks too damn much about his war wounds," Mr. Liggett added. "I have war wounds too. I got hurt at Guadalcanal but I don't talk about it all the time. That was 50 years ago."
As for Mr. Kemp and his overtures to black voters, Mr. Liggett, who has voted in every election since he got out of the Army in 1946, said he was not impressed. Politicians, he said, will say almost anything to win.
"They always talk black around election time," he said.
Oscar Pettigrew, 23, said he would vote for the first time in November but would not be happy about it.
"I don't like any of the candidates," said Mr. Pettigrew, who works at his mother's day-care center in the Germantown section of Philadelphia. "But I'm going to vote for Clinton. At least he tries to do a little something, even though he really hasn't done anything for the black community."
Mr. Pettigrew, who said he knew he was lucky to have a job when so many people his age were out of work and desperate, said he could not think of a political leader on the scene that he admired or would vote for without reluctance. He said he did not trust the Government, especially after recent news reports, based on articles in the San Jose Mercury News, alleging that the C.I.A. might have been involved in supplying crack in Los Angeles in the early 1980's to help pay for the United States-backed contra war in Central America.
"The best leader I ever saw," he said, "is my father. He says we can't wait for the Government. We have got to do it ourselves."
Philbert Young, 38, who owns a landscaping business, agreed with Mr. Clinton's decision to sign the welfare legislation "because a lot of people want to make welfare a way of life." But he said he would vote for the President holding his nose.
"Politicians are all talk," he said.
Anthony Monteiro, a professor of sociology at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science, said in a telephone interview that he is tired of voting for the lesser of two evils.
Mr. Monteiro said he will not vote for President this year but will vote in his Congressional race. He said he has been leery of Mr. Clinton for years because of the President's rightward shifts. But it was Mr. Clinton's signing of the welfare legislation "that pushed me over the edge."
"That bill will throw one million children into poverty," he said, his voice raising on the other end of the telephone. "Clinton has literally become a Reagan Democrat. And Dole is a Reagan Republican. I don't think there is a lesser of two evils in this race. There's just evil."
For Linn Washington Jr., a journalism professor at Temple University, the choice between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole boils down to which man "am I going to oppose."
"I'm going to oppose the conservative movement in the country as symbolized by Bob Dole," Mr. Washington said. "Don't get me wrong, Clinton has not excited me at all, either."
With two children in college, Mr. Washington, 45, said he thought Mr. Clinton was more sympathetic than Mr. Dole about his major concerns -- education and taxes.
"The man has a good heart," Mr. Washington said of Mr. Clinton. "But his head is too focused on being re-elected instead of leading the country. He has pandered much too much."
Back at the park in Mount Airy, where the football players were practicing in the falling night, the sound of colliding shoulder pads floating over the damp field, Pat McBride leaned on a green fence to watch her son, Michael.
Mrs. McBride, 44, is a welfare case worker. She was tired, but her husband, Keith, a firefighter, was at work, so she had to come with her son to practice. She said many more children, especially in cities, desperately needed sports and other programs to keep them from the street and its many temptations and dangers.
"I think Clinton cares more about the little people," she said. "But it's still a question for me of the lesser of two evils. I don't like that he signed the welfare bill. A lot of my clients don't want to be on welfare. They have no choice. With all the downsizing going on, jobs are hard to find."
"That's what the election should be all about," she said, gesturing to the field. "Making the future better for our children. I just hope the politicians understand that."

HEADLINE: A Dominican Leader Receives an Official Embrace

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

 BODY:
As he rushed between appointments yesterday, Leonel Fernandez Reyna took a moment to reminisce about his days as a grocery delivery boy on the Upper West Side. He even managed to come up with a name: Mr. Meyers, the owner of the store where he worked on Amsterdam Avenue, between 95th and 96th Streets.
There was no need for him to say how far he had come. This soft-spoken Dominican immigrant came to the United States with his parents at age 7, returned to his native country as a teen-ager, became a lawyer and politician, and returned to New York City this week for his first visit as President of the Dominican Republic. "It's coming home," Mr. Fernandez, who is 42 and a divorced father of two young children, said on a sidewalk in midtown Manhattan. New York City, he said, "has always been part of me." 
 He has returned, though, on very different terms, with a reception by the city's political and economic elite that he said has astonished him. In the last three days, he addressed the United Nations, hobnobbed with business people, was lauded by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and was courted by three potential candidates for mayor, receiving attention that reflects the growing clout of the half million or so Dominican immigrants in the city.
Unlike other visits, this has been much more a tour of the halls of power than a reunion on the city streets, where he is popular among Dominicans because he shares the experience of being an immigrant here. As of last night, he had not visited his old elementary school, Public School 75, or popped into Coogan's Pub in Washington Heights, which he said this week was his usual first stop from the airport.
"I haven't had the time," Mr. Fernandez said, in his perfect English. "It's very much official business, what I have been doing."
But then, like a good politician remembering the source of his power, he halted for a second and said he did, in fact, expect to visit with ordinary Dominicans sometime before he leaves tomorrow.
"I definitely will do that -- today or tomorrow," said Mr. Fernandez, who took office in August. (His aides said later that he expected to make a trip to the headquarters of his party, the Dominican Liberation Party, in Washington Heights today.)
Most Dominicans interviewed said they would not be too concerned if Mr. Fernandez attended more to affairs of state on this trip. He is, after all, still very much in his honeymoon period, a youthful politician with a boyish face and mustache who has begun to reinvigorate his nation's politics after replacing Joaquin Balaguer, who is 89 and now blind. Despite a furor over his raising his salary to $6,000 a month from the $150 a month his predecessor earned, he is seen as a vibrant, charismatic leader.
He has also made specific efforts to reach out to the estimated one million Dominicans who live in the United States. Last month, after Congress passed legislation aimed at depriving legal immigrants of various public benefits, Mr. Fernandez urged Dominicans who are eligible to become United States citizens -- reminding them that they would not lose their Dominican citizenship.
"It will be an opportunity for them to actively participate in politics," he said. "There will also be more concerns for Dominican interests." He added another reason: One-third of the income in the Dominican Republic is provided by the roughly $1 billion that Dominicans abroad ship annually to relatives at home.
The move was popular among local Dominicans, who have been signing up for citizenship in record numbers, according to city officials. That was part of the reason that Ligia Guzman, who works for the Federal Immigration and Naturalization Service, pushed her way in to shake Mr. Fernandez's hand after a ceremony at City Hall.
"Dominicans here were considered people who were not worthy," said Ms. Guzman, who moved to the United States 35 years ago. "We were treated like money machines. This President is not like that. He's willing to fix the problems."
Even though Mr. Fernandez has not spent much time in Dominican communities on this trip, he has run into Dominicans everywhere. At a press breakfast at the St. Regis Hotel on Thursday, one of the waiters was Fausto Franco, a 35-year-old native Dominican who is now a United States citizen. At the City Hall reception, Imelda Rodriguez, 27, carried plates of smoked salmon on rye.
"He's young and we need someone with new ideas," said Ms. Rodriguez.
Mr. Fernandez arrived in New York on Wednesday afternoon, as part of an annual celebration of Dominican culture at events around the nation. He promoted his agenda on several fronts. He has met with business groups to spur investment in tourism and in state-owned businesses he is trying to privatize. He became the first Dominican President in more than a decade to address the United Nations.
He had meetings with Mayor Giuliani and John Cardinal O'Connor. At a ceremony with members of the City Council, he received three proclamations as two potential Democratic rivals in next year's mayoral race, City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi and the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth Messinger, praised him.
"I just didn't know I was going to be the object of so much honor here," he said.

HEADLINE: New York Legislature Needs Reform, Not Raises

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Although the title of your editorial "Sneaky Pay Raises" is right on, the premise that New York state legislators, the second-highest-paid state legislators in the country after California's, deserve a pay raise is highly questionable. 
 If merit is the basis for a pay increase, this group would be in line for a pay cut. This year's state budget was the latest in history. The population of the state continues to stagnate, while our economic base and national political clout decline. Our taxes are among the highest in the nation, yet our basic services and funds for education are shrinking. Add to their accomplishments the creation of a state work force demoralized by several years of wage freezes and heavy layoffs, and the proposal that these legislators deserve a raise indicates the depth of their contempt for the views of the citizenry they supposedly serve.
As you note, the Legislature hasconsistently opposed opening up the political process (only reluctantly passing reforms for the primaries this year). If one reform in particular, the right to citizens' initiatives, were in effect, no doubt one of the first initiatives would be to submit to voter approval any legislative pay raises and the questionable practice of representatives paying themselves extra for committee assignments.
One can reasonably venture that the vast majority of New Yorkers strongly oppose the raises as well as the underhanded manner in which they are being advanced. Only Gov. George E. Pataki stands in the way of the Senate and Assembly's avarice and cowardly tactics.
Let's hope that rather than supporting their sneaky money grab, he will assert the will of the people and restore some semblance of government integrity by vetoing the pay raise.

HEADLINE: PLAYOFFS;
Rogers Is the Enemy In His Own Backyard

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Tex., Oct. 4

 BODY:
Kenny Rogers lives two minutes from the Ballpark in Arlington, close enough to see dozens of tents snaked around the stadium for fans waiting to purchase possible Rangers World Series tickets.
It is close enough to hear the chilling sound of Juan Gonzalez's batting practice and to hear the whispers: The Rangers do not like him anymore. They want to punish him. 
 As a Yankee, Rogers knows he is the enemy in the town that was his baseball home for the first seven years of his career. He knows he will be booed and expects it.
Players shuffle from team to team like rental cars these days, so allegiances fizzle faster than an economy car on empty, even for a pitcher who is fifth in Rangers history with 70 victories.
"Sometimes, I still have to catch myself when I'm talking about the Yankees and the Rangers," Rogers said before Game 3 on Friday. "I'll say 'us' for Texas and 'we' for New York. It's weird."
While Rogers rocked on a chair in the visiting clubhouse, sweating after a workout, it was obvious he felt confusion about facing his former teammates in Game 4 Saturday.
"I'd like to prove something to them," said Rogers, who is 16-6 with a 3.32 earned run average in his career at the Ballpark. "I'm sure it's the same thing with them. They want to beat me worse than other pitchers. I was with them, so I'd like to prove something. You want to prove you're a capable player like you know you are. Hey, I know I did a good job for them."
It would be ironic if Rogers -- who signed a four-year, $20 million free agent contract with the Yankees last Nov. 21 and said, "I wanted to play for a winner" -- is the obstacle between the Rangers and the A.L.C.S. on Saturday.
The Rangers offered Rogers $17.5 million and then read Rogers's comments; they even taped them on the wall in spring training for motivation, and they went on to win their division title.
Saturday will be a day in which someone gets redemption. "I've thought about it," Rogers said.
In a season in which Rogers once threatened to tear up his $20 million deal after he was temporarily moved to the bullpen, a season in which he has labored with inflammation in his left shoulder since April and has constantly incurred Torre's wrath, Rogers's next hurdle involves foiling the players who used to sit next to him in the clubhouse.
Or else.
"I've got to block it out," Rogers said. "To say I don't think about that would not be honest. It's a different feeling. It's something you had. Those guys were behind me and I know them so well. It should be a little easier to get more comfortable."
A broad smile spread across Rogers's face as he talked about being happy about the Rangers' success. For now, the Rangers are more popular than the Dallas Cowboys, which never happened when he played in Arlington.
Even though he is part of the post-season spectacle in his hometown, Rogers feels odd.
"It's weird, a weird feeling," Rogers said. "When it's the organization that you grew up with, it becomes you. I felt comfortable with everything about the Rangers. This is the way I always thought it was going to be for the Rangers."
Except Rogers is wearing a different uniform.

HEADLINE: The Ups and Downs Of U.S. Capitalism

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Harvey Mallement (letter, Sept. 27) needlessly castigates Russell Baker for a colorful comment about those who "convert human misfortune into good numbers for Wall Street." Contrary to Mr. Mallement, this comment does not disserve the nation and its history. Capitalism and Wall Street are not identical. 
 Mr. Mallement is correct that many great achievements can be attributed to capitalism, but many bad things are part of it, too: child labor, unemployment, poverty. That is why we have a "mixed economy," with legislation and other factors placing limits on "pure" capitalism. In fact, no country anywhere has ever had unrestricted capitalism.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: STATE BY STATE -- New Jersey;
Dole Hopes Whitman's Magic Works for Him

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: HACKENSACK, N.J., Oct. 3

 BODY:
Christine Todd Whitman is the Republicans' good-luck charm. In Michigan, in Florida, almost everywhere, party operatives inoculate themselves against discouraging polls and apathetic voters by recalling the New Jersey Governor's stirring last-minute escape from what seemed sure defeat in 1993, largely on the strength of a pledge to slash taxes.
If it worked for her, Republicans say, bravely whistling their happy tune, it can work for Bob Dole -- at least in New Jersey, a swing state with an aversion to high taxes. 
 "You can't transpose it 100 percent," the Governor said cautiously one afternoon this week in her Newark office. "There are parallels. Jim Florio, whom I beat, had said he wouldn't raise taxes and did it anyway. Bill Clinton promised a middle-class tax cut and raised taxes instead. Like Dole, I ran way behind for weeks. I think I was 10 percent behind on the final weekend."
Mrs. Whitman chose not to enumerate them, but there are important differences as well. She was fresh, upbeat, winning on television; Mr. Dole says he is "the most optimistic man in America," but he neither sounds it nor looks it. He carries more political baggage than she did. More important, perhaps, Governor Florio, a flawed campaigner, was very unpopular; President Clinton, a campaign virtuoso, is better liked.
"This tax-cut gambit was just as desperate a ploy for her as it is for Dole, maybe more so," said Michael Aaron, the political correspondent for New Jersey public television. "But it was so much nicer and more persuasive, coming out of her mouth. She hadn't spent years saying spending cuts first, tax cuts later, the way he has. Remember, too, the whole idea has been discounted a bit in New Jersey; we've had our tax cut, and it hasn't transformed our lives."
The biggest problem for Mr. Dole, Mrs. Whitman conceded, is the unpopularity of his (and his party's) stand against abortion, which is hurting him with Republican and independent women in suburbs across America.
Just as Republican Presidential candidates persuaded blue-collar suburban men to abandon their party loyalties and become Nixon or Reagan Democrats, Mr. Dole is driving away middle-class suburban women, turning "soccer moms" into Clinton Republicans.
For electoral purposes, New Jersey consists largely of two conglomerations of suburbs, one adjacent to New York City and one adjacent to Philadelphia, connected by a turnpike and a railroad. So the problem is acute here.
"Dole is talking about issues that matter to women, issues like the economy, education, crime," said the Governor, herself an advocate of abortion rights. "But they don't hear him. If you're a Republican and you're not pro-choice, you tend to get filtered out."
Representative Robert G. Torricelli, 45, an ambitious, intensely partisan Democrat who is seeking the Senate seat being vacated by Bill Bradley, also a Democrat, agrees with that.
"Christie Whitman won because of taxes, yes, but first she had to cross the threshold test that applies in New Jersey," he said. "She had to show she was a social moderate on issues like gun control, abortion and the environment. I don't see any way that Senator Dole can possibly cross that threshold."
His own polls, Mr. Torricelli said, show him with a slight lead over his Republican rival, Representative Dick Zimmer. The margin, he added, results entirely from disproportionate support by middle-income suburban women.
There is a threshold test for Democrats, too, showing that they are not big-spending liberals. "It was no accident," Mr. Torricelli conceded, that he was one of 22 House Democrats who voted for the Republican tax-cut bill this year, or that he pressed a cut in capital-gains taxes on the White House. He also brags that some of his speeches have been drafted by Jude Wanniski, a New Jersey Republican, supply-side economic theorist and supporter of Jack Kemp.
But Mr. Torricelli voted, as Republican television commercials note, for the tax increase of 1993.
With 15 electoral votes, the nation's ninth-largest bloc, New Jersey is important for Mr. Dole, especially because big states like California, New York and Illinois seem beyond his reach, and he trails in battlegrounds like Ohio, Michigan and Florida. But here, too, Mr. Clinton is leading in polls by 10 to 15 percentage points.
Television, the underdog's friend, is of limited use in New Jersey, because reaching the bulk of the state's voters that way means buying time on New York and Philadelphia stations, only a fraction of whose viewers live in New Jersey. Much of the cost is "wasted." So Mr. Dole will tour the state on Monday and Tuesday by bus, hoping to stir up some enthusiasm and to generate a substantial turnout, in Republican strongholds like Bergen and Morris counties.
"We think it is a competitive state for us," said Dean R. Armandroff, the director of Mr. Dole's campaign in New Jersey.
An unspoken reason that a vigorous Dole campaign is needed here is the races for the Senate and the House, several of which are competitive.
Mr. Zimmer, who is running even or close to it in public polls, might win even if Mr. Dole loses. The state has a long history of ticket-splitting, with Senator Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat, winning in 1988 when George Bush carried the state; Mr. Bradley winning in 1984, when Ronald Reagan scored here, and Clifford Case, the state's last Republican Senator, winning in 1960 despite John F. Kennedy's victory here and nationwide.
But if he is to buck a Clinton tide, Mr. Zimmer will need to turn out Republican voters. Stephen Falmore, a professor at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, who advises Republican candidates, warned that "the public, including Republicans, is not really engaged in this campaign yet, and we don't know whether they ever will be, which makes it hard to predict."
Not that Mr. Torricelli and Mr. Zimmer have not given the voters a show, or tried to. Politics is never ballroom dancing in New Jersey, but this year's Senate campaign is particularly nasty. This week Mr. Zimmer embraced charges that Mr. Torricelli had improperly aided the daughter of a Korean fugitive from United States courts, a former legal client. Mr. Torricelli has attacked the sources of Mr. Zimmer's campaign contributions, especially the tobacco industry, charging that the Republican "has chosen cigarette money over children's health."
If Mr. Torricelli fits uncomfortably into a liberal pigeonhole on some issues, Mr. Zimmer is an unconventional conservative. A hard-liner on fiscal questions, he chose as his campaign consultant Arthur Finkelstein, who specializes in branding opponents as too liberal. (Shortly after Mr. Dole hired two Finkelstein proteges, he began denouncing Mr. Clinton as "liberal, liberal, liberal!")
A graying, understated 52-year-old, Mr. Zimmer is nonetheless highly rated by some environmental groups, he supports abortion rights and he once ran the New Jersey office of Common Cause, the leftish advocacy group. Little-known statewide, he said his big problem was "letting people know that I'm the greener candidate and that I'm a Republican who has always been solidly pro-choice."
In their drive to retain control of the House, the Republicans hope to hang on to the district Mr. Zimmer represents, which cuts across the state from Princeton to the Atlantic. But two abortion-rights supporters split the primary vote, allowing a little-known foe of abortion, Mike Pappas, to snatch the nomination. Mayor David M. Delvecchio of Lambertville, the Democratic nominee, has mounted a vigorous challenge, but he is no more familiar to voters than Mr. Pappas.
The Republicans are also struggling to avoid a loss by Representative Bill Martini, one of their 1994 freshmen. His main difficulty, local politicians say, is not his opponent, Mayor William J. Pascrell of Paterson, but a voting record, shaped in part by the Contract With America, that is considerably more conservative than his district. This race is rated one of the closest in the country by Congressional Quarterly, and it could be tipped one way or the other by the Presidential race in the state.
So could the contest for Mr. Torricelli's seat. Centered on Hackensack in Bergen County, it includes a significant part of heavily Democratic Hudson County. Nevertheless, the Republican nominee, Kathleen A Donovan, a former Bergen County Clerk, has been holding her own in the polls against the Democratic candidate, Steve Rothman, a surrogate.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
A Little More Room At the Inn? Yes and No.

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
AFTER 56 consecutive months in which the hotel occupancy rate exceeded that of the same month in the previous year, the United States lodging industry finally experienced a downturn -- dropping to 73.9 percent this July from 74.1 percent in July 1995. Those are the latest figures available from Smith Travel Research, which tracks U.S. lodging industry performance.
But before anyone supposes that the hotel industry is about to return to the red ink of the late 1980's through 1990, when a glut of hotels and a weak economy resulted in rooms routinely being sold at deep discounts, keep in mind that the 0.2 percent drop from last July to this is statistically insignificant. And despite that modest dip, average room rates this July rose by 7.4 percent over July 1995, to $71.44, the biggest monthly increase since the early 1980's, an era of double digit inflation. 
 What's more, there has been no falloff in occupancy or room rates in such major tourist destinations as Orlando, Las Vegas, New York, San Francisco, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles or San Diego. As many travelers learned to their regret, for much of this year most of the desirable hotels in those cities have been at or near capacity. Orlando occupancy, for example, has been up almost 6 percent this year through July and room rates have been up 5 percent. New York occupancy has risen 4.9 percent through 1996 despite a 9.4 percent increase in room rates, to an average of $140.82 -- far higher than runner-up Oahu Island, at $107.92, and third place San Francisco, at $103.83.
"Our four New York properties have been very, very busy almost the entire year," said Gordon Lambourne, a spokesman for Marriott. "Even the Marriott Marquis, which has almost 2,000 rooms, has had high occupancies throughout the year, especially on weekends and most holidays."
Not all Hawaiian properties have fared well, but many in tourist-rich Oahu have had a much stronger 1996 than expected. ITT Sheraton's four properties on Waikiki Beach were fully booked in January, February, June and August. John C. Brogan Sr., a senior vice president in charge of operations at Sheraton's seven Hawaiian hotels, said that the surge in business over the first three quarters of this year, specifically in Waikiki, had boosted Sheraton's overall Hawaiian revenues 8 percent over the same period last year.
Atlanta's performance, by contrast, appears to have been mixed. While people descended on the city for the Summer Olympics in August, many of them apparently stayed with friends or relatives -- even in hotels in surrounding states. Although many visitors began arriving in July, Smith Travel reported that occupancies in the city fell 0.3 percent that month.
While lodging figures are not yet available for August -- a month in which Delta boarded 2.1 million passengers in Atlanta, the most any airline has boarded during any one month at any airport -- many Atlanta hoteliers have already complained that occupancy fell below expectations. The saving grace for the city's hotel industry is that room rates soared 72.6 percent in July, to $116.46 -- an increase, tourism officials say, that probably accounts for much of the drop in occupancy.
In addition, occupancies this year in New Orleans, Minneapolis and Phoenix have fallen between 6 and 7 percent, although all three cities boosted room rates -- 11.1 percent in the case of Phoenix, whose average room rate inched past the $100 a night mark (to $100.59). Greater Washington occupancy was also off slightly through July, down 0.6 percent. Hotel officials attribute most of that to fallout from the Federal Government shutdown late last year, as well as from snowstorms that paralyzed the region early this year.
Although Smith Travel Research has warned of a gradual decline in occupancies beginning this fall, as demand catches up with the recent modest growth in room supply, others foresee continued strength for the U.S. hotel industry.
PKF Consulting, a San Francisco-based international firm specializing in the hospitality industry, forecasts that from now through 1977, United States hotels "will achieve the strongest combination of growth in occupancy, revenues and profits since the 1940's." Not only that, but if its projected $102.28 average daily room rate in major cities next year holds up, it will be the first time that rate will have surpassed $100.
As for New York, visitors without hotel reservations this fall, especially around the holidays, and much of next year, will probably do well to fuhgeddaboutit. The occupancy rate in the city is expected to surpass 80 percent this year, Mr. Fox said, and continue to climb in 1997 -- a performance he attributes to a limited number of new hotel rooms over the next few years, a cheap U.S. dollar that keeps domestic travelers in the United States and attracts foreign visitors, and an improved image reflected in the city's lower crime rate.
In addition, New York is becoming a more desirable destination for conventions. "Meeting planners are beginning to respond to the reduction of the rooms tax," Mr. Fox said.

HEADLINE: The View From: The New Haven Green;
A Short, Fresh Take on Topics of the Day, and Free, Too

BYLINE: By MELINDA TUHUS 

 BODY:
BREVITY and clarity have been raised to an art form in the half-sheet flyers passed out on the southeast corner of the New Haven Green every Thursday at noon.
Every week a handful of dedicated activists produces 300 leaflets on a timely topic and gives them to all takers. The tracts are not religious, nor are they the rhetorical screed so often encountered in publications of both the political right and left. 
 They are, simply, information and opinion offered on various issues of peace and justice, usually ending with an invitation for the reader to do something -- write or call an elected official, communicate with a company accused of abusing its workers, attend a rally. Every week at the bottom of the flyer is the name of the tiny band responsible for the effort: Peace & Justice News & Views.
With few exceptions, they've been out on the four corners of Church and Chapel streets every week for six years. There have been other groups who have leafleted their fellow citizens on the green previously -- often including many of these same individuals -- notably during the Vietnam War. But this particular effort, says Sally Joughin, a member, began in August 1990 during the buildup to the Persian Gulf war. It was then called Coalition Against War in the Gulf, and it retained its name until 1995, long after the troops came home and the yellow ribbons faded.
They kept the name for so long, she says, to demonstrate their belief that the war was not in fact over -- either in Iraq, where a tight United Nations trade embargo was depriving millions of food and medicine or at home, where American taxpayers are still paying military-related costs and G.I.s who served in the war are suffering from mysterious illnesses.
"One thing that's unique about this group," says Marge Van Cleef, another member, "is that we have a new leaflet every week."
And they are timely. Ms. Joughin said she stayed up half the night in order to hit the streets with the group's views on the Connecticut Supreme Court's historic desegregation decision in Sheff v. O'Neill right after it was released in July. The headline called the decision "an opportunity" to put backing behind regional schools open to all students, wherever they might live and whatever transportation might be involved.
They've written lots of flyers about military spending. A recent one criticized their Congressional representative, Rosa DeLauro, for voting for more money in the defense budget than even the Pentagon had requested. "Already," they wrote, "the U.S. spends 20 percent more on the military than the next nine countries in the world combined -- and six of them are our allies. . . . Clearly the threat to our security is not military, but social and economic: our social services and infrastructure are crumbling while excessive contracts are being handed out to military contractors."
They've also written about the ongoing danger to civilians of millions of unexploded landmines around the world; condemned the United States embargo of Cuba, and supported Yale University's striking workers.
They've handed out pie charts explaining where Federal budget money goes; called for a new trial for Mumia Abu-Jamal, who is on death row, and agitated against the dumping of toxic sludge in Long Island Sound.
Sometimes they localize a leaflet being promoted by a national organization on a peace and justice topic. Sometimes they pass out other local groups' leaflets if the issue is urgent. Other times, people write from their own experience, as when one member attended the Labor Party's founding convention last spring in Cleveland.
Each flyer is laid out with attractive headlines and graphics, and it is neither printed in tiny type nor run out to the margins of the paper in order to fit in more words. Over the years, the group, of necessity, has become expert at expressing itself succinctly.
"We used to hand out a full sheet," says Ms. Joughin, "but we were low on money once and we started making it a half-sheet. Then we noticed that people read it on the spot."
"We've also learned," she adds, "not to try to say everything in one leaflet."
A rotating committee of one takes responsibility for writing each week's flyer, getting input from other members before making copies. Copying costs were covered for awhile by a small grant from a private foundation; when that ran out, Ms. Joughin, a piano teacher, held a fund-raising concert at her New Haven home.
Most members of the group are retired, work part-time or have flexible work schedules, enabling them to spend many hours a week on their avocation.
They used to put a phone number on the flyers, but no one called, so they took it off. They say they have no idea if anyone follows up on their suggestions, and they don't even have extended conversations with passersby when they do the leafleting. So what keeps them writing, producing and distributing their flyers week, week after week?
"As far as a gauge of our effectiveness," says Paula Panzarella, "during the Gulf War, New Haven did not look like Hamden or North Haven" -- two adjoining towns where pro-war sentiment often turned ugly and sometimes violent. "There were not as many yellow ribbons and not so much venom. I think that was partly due to the role of the activist community. We put the idea out there that it's okay not to go along with the chauvinism."
Or, as Ms. Van Cleef put it, "We provide an alternative analysis to fill in some of the gaps in what people are not getting in the popular media. Many facts are left out of the mainstream news media."
Ms. Joughin feels that, "If people read our flyers, the next time they hear something on the news they will say, 'Oh, yeah, that's what those people were leafleting about,' and maybe they will see the news in a new light."
That was exactly the reaction of one regular, Robbie Potter of New Haven, who takes a flyer whenever she spots the group. It is, he says, "stuff I don't see elsewhere. It gives me food for thought."
A downtown office worker who usually takes a flyer on her lunch hour said, "The group serves as a public conscience on these issues. It's really encouraging that there are still committed people out there."
Ms. Joughin says the two questions they get asked the most about their leafleting are, "Is it religious?" and "Who pays you?"
"People can't believe we would do this week after week just because we believe in it," she said.

HEADLINE: Long Island Q&A: Lawrence Waldman;
Giving Recognition to the Entrepreneurial Spirit on the Island

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN 

 BODY:
AS a managing partner of Long Island's largest accounting concern, KPMG Peat Marwick, Lawrence Waldman founded the Entrepreneurial Spirit Awards. The awards, created to foster business development on Long Island, recognize the 50 largest privately held companies on Long Island, based upon total revenue, and the 25 fastest growing privately held companies, based upon revenue growth over the prior year. They will be presented tomorrow for the 10th year by KPMG Peat Marwick and Hofstra University.
A graduate of Hofstra with a master's degree in business administration, Mr. Waldman was president of both the East Williston Board of Education and the Nassau County chapter of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants. He serves on the boards of the Sid Jacobson North Shore Jewish Community Center, the Long Island Philharmonic, the Jewish National Fund and the Long Island United Way. 
 Mr. Waldman, 49, was honored last year by the Family Service Association. He lives with his wife, Joan, and their two children,-- Daniel, 20, and Craig, 17, in Roslyn Heights.
Q. How have compiling these lists helped you to promote Long Island as a place for business opportunity?
A. When we talk about economic development on Long Island and bringing companies here, what is the best thing we can tell them? That we have companies here that grow and prosper and do well. It's not to tell them that we have high electric rates or traffic. Everybody has that. But what do we have? We have a highly educated work force, a very industrious work force. We are sitting in the middle of the largest marketplace of the whole world. This is the financial and cultural capital of the world, and there's no better place to vacation than on Long Island.
Q. How did this program come about?
A. It was in 1984-85 that we were seeing growth in our practice here and economic growth all over Long Island. Yet we daily get bombarded in the local press and everywhere you look about how difficult it is to do business here. So I sat down and said why don't we come up with something that shows what Long Island is really all about.
Q. And you decided to concentrate on only the private companies?
A. Yes. Everybody knows about public companies. You hear about them every day; they put out press releases. So we went to the private companies, which are really the majority of companies out here and employ the majority of people. And we then asked Hofstra University to co-sponsor it and do some academic research as to why these companies have been successful, considering that you do have high electric costs and difficult transportation. It's tough to attract people sometimes because of the costs that are around here.
Q. How many companies were nominated the first year?
A. About 200 companies.
Q. And which company led the list of 500?
A. King Kullen. And No. 50 that year was Austin Productions. From 1 to 50 there were lots of names you knew and lots you didn't. What's really surprising is that there were a lot of big companies out here that were very successful and nobody knew they were here.
Q. What did Hofstra do with the winning list?
A. It interviewed about three-quarters of the C.E.O.'s to find out the common ingredient. Why, in the face of all the high costs and negatives, were these companies becoming successful? And Hofstra coined the term in its first research paper, entrepreneurial spirit. It said there are a lot of people here who are highly educated, highly motivated. We sit in the biggest marketplace in the whole world and there are lots of ideas going back and forth and they are willing to take risks. And that's why we named the lunch the Entrepreneurial Spirit Awards Luncheon.
Q. What has Hofstra's role been over the years?
A. To continue to do research every year on those companies to determine how many new jobs came about, how much revenue growth there was and how productive the companies were to Long Island. They found that given the whole composition of companies, these companies tended to be higher performancers, which you would tend to expect.
Q. Has the program changed over the years?
A. As companies found out about it, the bar kept going up. And more and more companies said it was a good program that they would like to be involved in. Some companies have put on their letterhead and on their stationery, "Long Island top 50 company" or "Twenty-five fastest growing company."
Q. How many companies participated this year?
A. Well over 300. In the beginning, some people used to call up and say, "Why should I do this? What does this do for me?" I'd say I didn't know if it did anything for them today but that it does something for the business community and the community that you live in, so why wouldn't you want to show it off?
Q. What was the reaction of some of the small, rapidly growing companies to your list?
A. In the second and third years they decided not to go in. They looked at the list from the first two years and saw that the smallest company had revenues of $30 million, so they thought they would never get in. But there are companies that are fast growing and also prove the point about Long Island. So in 1988 we started the list of the 25 fastest growing companies based upon percentage growth. So now we have a new group that comes in and says its revenues last year were $1 million and this year they are $3 million, or $10 million and now $20 million.
Q. Have you had companies move from the fastest growing list to the top 50 list?
A. Yes, in fact we have had some companies make both lists at the same time. A notable example is 800-Flowers. When they started out in this program, they were at the bottom of the top 50 list. In 1991, they were 45th. That same year they were No. 1 on the list of the 25 fastest growing companies. Now, 800-Flowers is No. 10 on the top 50 list.
Q. What do you find in terms of a common thread among the fastest growing companies?
A. That list seems to change year in and year out, based on what's going on. We had several years in the late 80's in which eight or nine of the companies were involved in environmental services. If you remember at that time the state and Federal governments were passing laws about what you had to do environmentally. So companies like Tyree were on the fastest growing list and then made it to the top 50 list. That's a local company that is now expanding internationally with environmental services.
Q. What has Hofstra found in examining the top 50 companies over the years?
A. It found that they had C.E.O.'s who started companies and were willing to take a risk to become very successful. Risk taking was one of the important factors in starting a company and growing because people who don't take risks don't get to throw the dice and come up with some big idea.
Q. Is there a field that is now particularly attractive?
A. We have found that software companies over the last few years, what you might call high-technology companies, have emerged on the fastest growing 25 list because that's what's happening.
You have Computer Associates out here. It's not on the list because it's a public company, but there are many companies that are doing this, such as Sheridan Software. A few years ago, you didn't find software companies on the list. They were out there but probably not as productive. I guess there's a big push to make Long Island a biotech center and sooner or later I think we'll start to see those type of companies. he fastest growing list tends to reflect the economic cycles and the economic ideas of what's going on. There's no one industry that is better than any other. If you're in business, you do a good job, know what you're doing and adapt to the world as it is, you're successful.
Q. What other companies are on the fastest growing 25 list?
A. Financial service companies. Long Island sits outside of New York City, the big financial capital, and we find that there have been a lot of financial service companies here.
Q. Are any of these companies likely to go public?
A. Many who make the fastest growing list and to the top of the top 50 list end up going public. You know what happens, you start a company, you need more capital, you get bank loans and then you say you have to go public. Snapple was the most famous that was ever on our top 50 list. In 1992 it was No. 18 and the following year it went public.
Q. Any other companies you can recall?
A. Career Horizons, a temporary service firm in Woodbury. It was growing and on the list for many years because temporary services were rapidly growing. Then they went public.
Another company is the Quantum Restaurant Group. They went public and changed their name to Morton's because one of their major subsidiaries is Morton's of Chicago, a very good steakhouse. They started in the top 50 companies in 1990 or so and it's founder, Allan Bernstein, has always been a very strong supporter of this program.
Q. Any companies that were a flash in the pan?
A. Lots of them. There are lots of companies that have a rapid growth spurt and then either don't adapt to the marketplace or positioned well enough to continue growth. Nothing can kill a young company more than growth.
If they don't plan for it and they expand and their capital runs out or their management team is turns out to be too short, it's very quick. The marketplace is very deadly when it works against you. It's very favorable when it works for you. We had lots of companies on the fastest growing list that never made it; we have more that made it.
Q. What's the key to success besides the willingness to take risks?
A. The ability to manage and to understand that you have a good idea and can make it work. And that always comes down to management, always comes down to people and being able to put the right elements in place so that you can continue to grow, so that you'll have enough capital to grow and let your idea adapt to the marketplace.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property;
Kansas City Is Rediscovering Its Downtown Area

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN 

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo.

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH Utilicorp United was a loser in its recent fight to merge with Kansas City Power and Light, it should find some consolation come mid-November when it moves into a new corporate headquarters that is the latest crown jewel in the rebirth of this city's downtown.
The 10-story, 200,000-square-foot building at 20 West Ninth Street features state-of-the-art energy, communications and environmental capabilities appropriate for an international energy company with interests stretching from the heartland to New Zealand and Australia. 
But the $35 million renovation/restoration project also features, and preserves, the brick and brownstone exterior, the two-ton bronze eagle over the entry and the Italian granite atrium flooring of a Neo-Italianate building designed by McKim, Mead and White and built 108 years ago.
Always known as the New York Life Building (it was one of six buildings put up by the insurance company as speculative office space in the region late in the last century), it was considered the first "skyscraper" here and had the city's first elevators.
Bringing the New York Life Building back in all its glory as Class A office space has added glitter to the spectacular turnaround in downtown Kansas City, which along with its smaller sister across the river, Kansas City, Kan., has suffered more than most cities from the effects of suburban sprawl.
It is not an isolated phenomenon. For while there is no sign of slowing in the suburban growth, a combination of committed business people and an incentive program called Tax Increment Financing is transforming this city's downtown into an inviting cityscape where Post-Modern and Neo-Classical skyscrapers blend with restored and renovated Victorian low- and mid-rise buildings.
Almost every downtown block has construction under way, and the biggest headache is creating enough new parking space for employees of the businesses that are expanding or moving in to fill the new or renovated office space.
In addition to the New York Life Building, the projects completed or in construction since the transformation started gathering momentum four years ago include a 97,000-square-foot, five-story corporate headquarters for DST Systems Inc., a fast-growing processor of mutual fund accounts, and a 300,000-square-foot building across the street used by some DST personnel and office tenants; more than one million square feet of renovated and restored space in turn-of-the-century buildings and Victorian mansions; a 158,000-square-foot headquarters for Investor's Fiduciary Trust Company, which is expected to be followed by a second building the same size; the renovation and addition of 51,000 square feet of new space to the 50-year-old 162,000-square-foot Centennial Building and the renovation and addition of 30,000 square feet to the 43-year-old, 50,000-square-foot Hereford Building.
ON the drawing boards, but well along, is a plan by UMB Financial Corporation to build a 130,000-square-foot technology and operations center and 600-space parking garage on the east side of downtown near its Grand Avenue headquarters and the three-block Civic Mall now under construction, which will include a new Federal Court complex and a park stretching from the courthouse to the existing City Hall.
Stan Durwood, chairman of AMC Entertainment Inc., has saved for his hometown his most ambitious plan yet -- an entertainment complex with a 30-screen movie theater, live performance theaters, restaurants and stores. He has received approval from the Tax Increment Financing Commission -- but not yet the City Council -- for $185 million in public financing for the $400 million project.
All of these projects have used, or contemplate using, the incentive program known as Tax Increment Financing. Under Missouri law, the program permits the rebate of up to 100 percent of the increase in property taxes resulting from construction or renovation, and up to 50 percent from an increase in economic activities taxes -- sales, utility, corporate profit, food and beverage and individual-earnings levies.
While the restoration and renovation of the New York Life Building by Hugh Zimmer of Kansas City, a longtime developer of office parks and other commercial real estate here and elsewhere in the Midwest as well as in the South, is the single most glittering element in the rejuvenated downtown, DST is responsible for the overwhelming majority of the new construction and renovation completed since 1992.
DST, a spin-off from an old-line local company, Kansas City Southern Industries, and its affiliate firms now have about 5,000 employees spread out in eight buildings in addition to its new corporate headquarters. And it has effectively turned part of downtown into the kind of campus setting many companies enjoy in new suburban complexes.
J. Philip Kirk Jr., chairman of DST Realty, which DST created to oversee the fulfillment of its real estate needs, said that until tax-increment financing came along it had been difficult to amass a number of properties and to create the common environment that developers seek to protect their investments.
Much of the redevelopment work was done in what Mr. Kirk termed a "strategic" alliance made up of DST, a group of not-for-profit organizations needing new office space, and Bob Graham, real estate adviser to Joe Jack and Michael Merriman, members of a local family involved in insurance and investments. The effort took off after they obtained approval from the city in 1992 for a tax-increment-financing plan covering buildings in about 20 square blocks on the west side of the 150-square block downtown area.
MUCH of the area was along Broadway, once the heart of Kansas City's garment industry, where many empty buildings stood as silent witness to the offshore flight of clothing manufacturing. Immediately west of Broadway was the Quality Hill district of decaying Queen Anne mansions and once-fashionable apartment houses. A number of buildings were of architectural or historic significance. The oldest building in the DST project area was built in 1874, the newest in 1951.
The old garment-district buildings, most of them four or five stories tall with huge windows, have been converted to office space, and the new DST corporate headquarters sits among them. Some of the old mansions and hotels on Quality Hill have been turned into a campus for 16 not-for-profit agencies -- among them, the American Cancer Society's Western Division headquarters -- which now share meeting rooms and other facilities.
While the degree to which architectural history has been preserved pleases most local residents, the project has not been without its battles over historic preservation. Mostly they centered on the efforts of DST Realty and other developers to create enough parking space. .
"In an urban setting," Mr. Kirk said, "you have to figure out how some of these buildings that have become obsolete can be adapted and saved. Too rigid a historic preservation agenda becomes like hardening of the arteries.
"To make things work you have to have parking downtown -- that's the only way businesses will locate here. So it becomes a question of whether you take down some buildings to create parking or leave them all empty. I'm happy if I can save two out of three."
The Tax Increment Financing Commission estimates the cost of the DST projects at nearly $81 million, of which $37.6 million is eligible for reimbursement over a 23-year period as taxes are collected. Mr. Kirk, apparently including some planned renovations that are not yet formally in the city's documents, estimates that investment will eventually reach $125 million, with $45 million of it reimbursable.

HEADLINE: Region's Economic Mood Turns a Corner

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
THE list of Long Island woes has become familiar: High taxes, high electric costs, traffic congestion and the loss of military jobs and contracts have combined to sap the vitality of one of the country's richest regions.
If something wasn't done soon, the cry went, Long Island risked becoming a ghostly place of failed businesses, shuttered downtowns and desperate home sellers yearning for lower living costs in North Carolina. 
 But in the fall of a Presidential election year, a time for taking stock, a far different picture is emerging, of a regional economy that has always benefited from residents' vast personal wealth, where the median family income towers over the national average.
Indicators that times are good for the rich and the fully employed are apparent, if not always applauded, from western Nassau to the Hamptons.
After shedding nearly 90,000 jobs at the start of the decade, Long Island has recouped nearly two-thirds of those jobs and is producing new ones at a moderate rate, said Dr. Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association. She said 12,000 jobs, including 9,200 in services and 5,200 in retailing, were added in the year that ended in August.
When the former Grumman Corporation and other military contractors that accounted for most of the job losses faltered in the late 1980's, many experts said that the expansion of lower-paid service jobs would not offset the damage.
Now, despite only partial diversification of the military contractors into civilian markets, experts voice a consensus that the Island has survived those losses.
"We not only survived that," Dr. Kamer said. "We are now doing very well."
She said the less cyclical economy was now based on small businesses, high technology and sophisticated services.
The president and chairman of the North Fork Bank, John A. Kanas, said the end of the reliance on military industries was "the best thing that ever happened to Long Island."
Mr. Kanas estimated that of 110,000 jobs lost in layoffs in the industry, 85,000 had been regained elsewhere.
"The difference is we lost those jobs 5,000 to 10,000 at a time, but they came back 5 to 10 at a time at a much wider array of smaller businesses," he said. "Lots of little businesses replaced a lot of huge ones, and that forms a more stable foundation for a Long Island economy that is gong forward."
Record gains on Wall Street have been creating new wealth for investors and bolstering companies like Computer Associates of Islandia, a leader in technology. The company's stock sold for about $14 a share at the end of September 1993. Last week it was above $50.
Stock profits, low interest and inflation rates and a guarded sense that corporate shrinkage among banks and other businesses has run its course have produced a spending mood for items large and small, economists said.
Residential real estate is no longer in the doldrums, particularly for upper-end new and existing houses, agents say. In locales like Manhasset agents report strong sales helped by a surge of young families that can pay prices that rarely dip below $400,000.
In Southampton an explosion in construction of highly priced second homes alarms advocates of farm and open-space preservation. They said the threat to the town's rural character had never been greater.
Islandwide, residential building permits by year's end will total 44 percent higher than in 1995, according to Dr. Kamer.
County governments, flush with sales-tax revenues that reflect a shopping culture, appear to have moved beyond annual budget crises and fiscal strains. Public schools, spared deep cuts in Albany, survived the budget votes with few casualties.
Even the widely disdained Long Island Lighting Company found allies in its effort to stop the Public Service Commission from immediately reducing rates by 5.2 percent. The cuts, the Long Island Association and others agreed, imperiled service that although costly was at least reliable.
As the dust settles from setbacks of the late 80's and early 90's, it becomes apparent that traditional bastions of wealth remained unaltered.
In the summer Worth Magazine listed the 300 wealthiest towns in the country, giving a reminder of the depth of that affluence. Villages in the five towns area of western Nassau and on the North Shore crowded the top 50. Four villages -- Hewlett Bay Park, Hewlett Harbor, Kings Point and Oyster Bay Cove -- were in the top 10.
But in a regional economy where only the rich, the professionals, the highly skilled and hard-working two-income families seem to prosper, relative affluence is widespread.
The race for disposable income continues to spur retailers. Across the Island, predictions of a strong holiday shopping season have large retailers in a bullish mood.
"So far the signs are terrific," a vice president at Fortunoff in Westbury, Arlene Futterman, said. "We have more people coming in early this year than ever before."
"Long Island is really picking up," a vice president of the store, Louis Fortunoff, said, adding that sales were particularly strong for high-priced jewelry.
At Roosevelt Field in Garden City, with 2.2 million square feet the largest regional mall in the eastern United States, ceremonies last week helped open 50 new stores.
Significantly, the owner of the mall, Corporate Property Investors of Manhattan, eschewed discounters in favor of retailers like F.A.O. Schwarz, A/X Armani, Polo Ralph Lauren, Laura Ashley, Kenneth Cole and Nordstrom.
"These are stores that are new to Long Island or this area," said Deborah A. Flattery, the mall marketing director, who suggested that no luxury retailer had ever gone broke counting on "the desire of women to shop in malls on Long Island."
"We have always tried to supply these avid shoppers with something unique," Ms. Flattery said.
To the east, at one end of the Long Island Expressway in Riverhead, the Tanger outlet center continues to exert a magnetic pull on bargain hunters. The success of the center has led to a groundbreaking for Tanger II nearby.
The residents of an adjoining apartment complex and other neighbors said they were overwhelmed by the obliteration of the woods to make room for the stores.
More open space is vanishing in Southampton, where permits for new building have been surpassing the pace in neighboring Brookhaven, which is large than Nassau County.
Edwin M. Schwenkof Southampton, said he had left his position as executive director of the Long Island Builders Institute in dismay over rapid development in his hometown.
"What's happening here is a reflection of what's happening on Wall Street," Mr. Schwenk said. "Wall Street is as hot as a firecracker, and these people who are making a killing are coming out here, and money is no problem for them."
Mr. Schwenk advocates a transfer tax on expensive houses and properties to finance the preservation of open space.
To the west, congestion on major roads continues, frequently because of major work like adding a fourth lane to Exit 57 on the Long Island Expressway. Only people who are out of touch with the tempo of late-20th-century Long Island are shocked by the gouging of swards that once buffered the roadway.
Road work, other large construction projects and the explosion of second-home building east of the Shinnecock Canal have revived the construction trades, where high jobless rates of five years ago have given way to almost full employment.
"We haven't seen it like this in a long time," said John M. Kennedy, the president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Nassau and Suffolk Counties.
Mr. Kennedy said construction workers who left in leaner times "to tramp all over the country looking for work" were returning. He said a $212 million Federal courthouse being built in Central Islip was "like plasma for us."
The 23-courtroom building, with plans to add 39 courtrooms in future years, is a major advance for the growing legal establishment. At the Suffolk County Bar Association, membership has risen, from 1,000 to 3,400 since 1980, according to Jane LaCova, an executive assistant at the association.
Sales of luxury cars, which plunged in harsh weather in January, are another sign. "New- and used-car sales have been strong, and there is considerable interest in new Jaguar and Porsche products," said Thomas G. Lederer, a vice president at Sportique Motors Ltd. of Huntington. "I can't necessarily attribute these trends solely to a healthier economy. But we do sense more confidence in Long Island's business future."
But the picture is not upbeat for everyone. The executive director of the Community Programs Center of Long Island, Paul Arfin, said he was seeing signs of growing distress among middle- and low-income families with children.
Mr. Arfin said calls that asked about day-care programs were increasing, with many callers who were looking for work or had found a job, but who were discouraged by child-care costs that could run from $100 to $200 a week.
He said the problem was compounded in Suffolk because of a waiting list of 1,500 for child-care subsidies. The county suspended the program when state aid ran out in May, 1995, and it has been unwilling to "put local tax dollars into the mix," Mr. Arfin said.
"If the working poor who now receive some assistance lose it and have to go on public assistance," he asked, "what have we achieved?"

HEADLINE: Rentals Thrive in a College Town With Big-City Airs

BYLINE: By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
IN a dusty industrial corner in this small city on the Charles River, two 22-story rental buildings are rising in what is Cambridges's largest market-rate apartment project and the largest residential development under way in metropolitan Boston.
The 435-apartment development is in an area of East Cambridge that saw a burst of building in the 1980's, followed by a sharp downturn as the real-estate market sagged in the early 90's. Now, on the last rag-tag strip of riverfront available for development, Congress Group Ventures Inc., based in Cambridge, has undertaken a $70 million project called Museum Towers. The developer is also building a 159,000-square-foot office building on the site for a single tenant, E. F. Group Inc., a Swedish company that operates language schools and student travel agencies. 
 The land is in a 70-acre industrial section of the waterfront called North Point, served by Interstate 93 and the McGrath Highway and within sight of Boston's Museum of Science, for which the apartments are named. Not far off is Kendall Square, the home of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the scores of technology-based companies it has spawned.
Dean F. Stratouly, the chief executive of Congress Group Ventures, which will provide $15 million to develop Museum Towers and finance $55 million with a construction loan from the Fleet Bank, explained that several factors had coalesced to make this a propitious time to build rental housing.
For one, government agencies will spend $80 million to install roads, utility lines and a riverfront park in North Point. Moreover, in comparison with the hot housing market of the late 1980's, it now costs less to buy land, go through the permit process and design and build a project because of reduced fees for professional and construction services. Lower interest rates, meanwhile, make it less expensive to borrow money.
A Museum Towers apartment that will now cost $150 a square foot to develop would have cost 20 percent more 10 years ago, Mr. Stratouly said.
Furthermore, the development comes at a time when, as a result of a statewide referendum held in 1994, Cambridge, Boston and Brookline have been ordered to end their 25-year-old rent-control system. The referendum has led to the decontrol of many apartments already, with a formal end of control for all apartments to take place by Dec. 31.
Since the referendum, residential rents have risen substantially, as has investor interest in Cambridge. "The removal of rent control has been a huge factor in encouraging the development of Museum Towers," Mr. Stratouly said.
With no limit on gross revenues from residential property, values and rent rates throughout the city have increased by 30 percent to as much as 200 percent since the two-year phase-out of rent control began in January 1995, according to Sally Powers, the city assessor.
WHILE rent control applied only to certain housing built before 1976, its abolition has engendered a more favorable financial climate.
"The financial markets were concerned that rent control might someday be extended to include new buildings," Mr. Stratouly said.
About two miles south of the Museum Towers site and a few blocks west of the river, another large rental project has received initial city approval. What will be called Worthington Place is now a complex of five historic industrial buildings near Kendall Square.
They will be renovated into 186 apartments at a cost of about $23 million.
The developer, MB Associates of Boston, signed an agreement to buy the property early this year, according to Steven J. Rioff, chief executive of the company. Construction is to start in February and be completed by June 1998, he said.
Both Museum Towers and Worthington Place will cater to the roommate market by featuring two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartments that will rent for about $2,000 at Museum Towers and $1,600 at Worthington Place.
In the Central Square area, Cambridge Designs is developing small projects that are more typical of the kind of new housing that has been available here since the late 1970's.
That company is renovating a carriage house on Elm Street in a transitional neighborhood behind Central Square. It is dividing the building into four 3,000-square-foot lofts that will be marketed for about $400,000 each and one apartment to be sold for about $100,000.
Recently, Cambridge Designs completed the renovation of a four-unit rental building on Blackstone Street between Harvard and Central Squares. The three-bedroom, 1,400-square-foot apartments have rented for approximately $2,300 each, about twice the price they would have fetched before 1994, said David Aposhian, chief executive of Cambridge Designs.
He easily leased the rental units during the 1996 rental season, which runs through the summer here. Demand for apartments outstripped supply despite rising rents.
"Cambridge is a perfect place to live," Mr. Aposhian said. "It's a small town with big-city comforts but the market has become wildly unstable."
JUST an eight-minute subway ride from Boston, this 6.5-square-mile city with 92,000 residents and a charming historic district is traversed by all of the metropolitan area's major highways. It has recreation, restaurants, nightclubs, museums and theaters for films and live performances.
Every academic year, its population doubles with students from M.I.T., Harvard, Lesley College and other schools and research institutes. It has long been a popular location for young professionals and in recent years, suburban empty-nesters have been moving into luxury apartments and buying condominiums here.
"It's almost scary," said John M. Angier, manager of the Cambridge office of the real estate company Hunnemen/Coldwell Banker. The amount of rental commissions his office has taken in so far this year is up 200 percent from a year ago. "Always a good rental market," Mr. Angier said, "Cambridge just keeps improving."
Even the values of condominiums and single-family homes have risen beyond the peak level of 1988, according to Allan N. Weiss, president of Case Shiller Weiss Inc. which analyzes market data.
The prices of single-family homes sold through the first half of the year are up 9.5 percent from 1988 and 29.5 percent from the low of 1991. Condominium sale prices are up 11 percent and 19.5 percent respectively, based on prices adjusted through time using a repeat sales index, Mr. Weiss said.
Walter F. Loughlin, vice president of Leeder Management, which owns and operates 117 rental apartments near Harvard Square, said the appraised values of its two apartment buildings had risen 35 percent. That mirrors the increase in their rental rates.
In such a market, it is no wonder that Mr. Stratouly of Congress Group Ventures persevered through an approval process of almost three years to develop the five-acre North Point parcel he bought in 1987. Moreover, he recently agreed to pay more than $15 million to buy what he called a "significant portion" of the remaining 65 acres of North Point for mixed-use development.
The desirability of the Cambridge rental market minimizes the financial risk of his investment. As Mr. Stratouly said, this city sells itself to potential renters. "Cambridge offers a cosmopolitan air and all the advantages of living in Boston, with less density and less expense," he said.

HEADLINE: A Huntington's Mohegan Mission

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
NEXT Saturday the Mohegan Indians of eastern Connecticut will open a big and opulent casino in Montville, near the banks of the Thames River, hoping to emulate the success of the Mashantucket Pequot casino in Ledyard, on the other side of the Thames, that has become the most successful one in the world.
Like the Pequots, who were once nearly obliterated in a massacre in Colonial times, the Mohegans also faced extinction in Connecticut, but at a later date and not by being slaughtered by white settlers. They faced the very real possibility of being shipped out of the state to the Far West by the Federal Government. 
 The story of the Mohegan survival is also the story of Sarah Lanman Huntington, a young white woman. What she did for the Mohegans has never been forgotten by them and in the past few months, they have been able to pay her back a little by a gift that might be entitled "To Sarah with love."
The bond between Miss Huntington and the Mohegans goes back to the early part of the last century, to the city of Norwich where she lived, and early displayed that she was a most unusual person.
Young ladies of prominent families of the time -- and she certainly fit that description -- were expected to be content with learning about needlepoint and motherhood. Not Miss Huntington. She became a social activist for an impoverished and declining tribe of Indians.
These were the Mohegans, the people of the mighty Uncas of Colonial times, now reduced to about 100 people living in the woods in Montville, only six miles from Miss Huntington's family home in Norwich. Despite the relatively small distance, the Indian reservation was a frontier. The woods were so deep that Miss Huntington could only find the Indians by following the sound of their axes biting into trees.
But once she had discovered them, they became her cause. Miss Huntington, the granddaughter of a Revolutionary War general who was also an original trustee of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, had entertained thoughts of becoming a missionary. The Mohegans became her unofficial mission, close to home.
She was not, however, the stern, uncompromising missionary of popular conception. In one of many letters she left behind she described herself as a "missionary in heart" to the Indians. And she did give her heart to them. She found Indian children to be delightful and anxious to learn. She found older people receptive to her, although sometimes suspicious that she might be just one more white person working a scheme to take more of their land, and dignity.
It just wasn't so in her case. She identified with the sufferings and successes of the Indians. In one letter she described the delight of being with the Mohegan children -- "a little Indian girl behind me on the horse and half a dozen other children following on foot, talking as fast as their tongues would do. I was perfectly delighted with my situation . . ."
Another time, she described sitting with an older man who was dying. She rejoiced with the friends she had found and she mourned when one of them was sick or had died.
For her work with the Indians, she received less than concerted acclaim from the Yankees of Norwich. In one letter to a friend, obviously answering the criticism of a citizen of Norwich who felt she was acting below her station in life, Miss Huntington wrote that she would like to ask her detractor, "If the Savior had any regard to his 'station,' when he left his throne for a dwelling among our wretched race?"
Criticisms only seemed to make her more enthusiastic about her mission. She started a school for children and adults on the Mohegan reservation. Then, when Eastern Indian tribes were threatened by the Federal Government with removal to the West, allegedly because they were "uncivilized and un-Christianized" and therefore a continuing menace to white settlers, Miss Huntington acted quickly.
She sponsored the building of the Mohegan Congregational Church on land donated by three Mohegan women and paid for by money she solicited. The church, to show conclusively that the Mohegans were Christians and therefore presumably civilized, was dedicated in 1831.
The Mohegans were never again threatened with being taken from the land that had been theirs long before white settlers came. And the church is still there, tucked into the woods, a monument to Sarah Huntington.
Miss Huntington's connection with the Indians came to a halt soon after the church became a reality. She married a missionary, Eli Smith, and went with him to Syria. In September of 1836, she was in a shipwreck in the Mediterranean Sea near Cyprus. Five days later she was dead from exposure. She was 32 years old.
All she left as tangibles after her short life were a bundle of letters, assembled and published in 1845 by the American Tract Society as "Memoir of Mrs. Sarah L. Huntington Smith," and an oil painting, believed to be her wedding portrait. The intangible she left was the affection and respect of the imperiled Mohegans.
And this year, in a manner of speaking, Sarah Huntington returned to Connecticut for one more good deed. It was in connection with the Samuel Huntington house.
Since Colonial times, the Huntington name has been one of the best known and most respected in Connecticut, dating to 1633 when Simon Huntington left Norwich, England, to take his family to America to start a new life. He died of smallpox during the voyage. When the ship landed at Boston his widow, Margaret, disembarked with their five children, four boys and a girl. From this difficult beginning the Huntington family grew and prospered. In 1852 a Huntington family association was formed. Today, it has some 2,000 members spread across the country, all tracing their roots to the five children of Simon and Margaret Huntington.
The most famous Huntington has always been Samuel, a leader in the Revolutionary War era. He was one of four Connecticut men to sign the Declaration of Independence. He was also President of the Continental Congress when the Articles of Confederation were ratified and the Colonies officially became the United States, making him, so some maintain, the real first President of the United States. When he died 200 years ago, in 1796, he was serving his 10th one-year term as Governor of the new state of Connecticut.
The home where Samuel Huntington was born in the town of Scotland in 1731, basically unchanged since then, was acquired by a trust sponsored by Huntington family members two years ago with the provision that the trust raise $160,000 to repay the town government, which had acquired it.
Until recently, with the deadline approaching, the trust was far short of its goal and the Huntington house was listed as the most endangered historical building in the state by the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation.
Then something rather marvelous happened.
Channing M. Huntington 2d, who had established the trust to save the house, appealed for help to Senator Christopher J. Dodd, and Senator Dodd and his staff started to get in touch with others who had the means to insure the home would be saved for the trust, and for the public as a museum.
The Norwich Savings Society agreed to give the trust a mortgage on the property and also forget the first year's interest. The Hartford developer David T. Chase, whose daughter-in-law has roots in the Huntington family, contributed $25,000.
But the biggest commitment was made by the Mohegan Indians -- an initial $25,000 to insure that the trust would receive a matching grant of $50,000 from the Connecticut Historical Commission, and then $25,000 each year for the next three years, in effect guaranteeing the mortgage.
Senator Dodd described the response as a "little miracle."
"I felt we owed it to the Huntington family," said Jayne Fawcett, vice chairwoman of the Mohegan Tribal Council. "Sarah Huntington saved us."
Mrs. Fawcett acknowledges that the "enforced Christianity" of the time, represented by the church that Sarah Huntington built, has always been a sore point with some Mohegans. "But we will always be grateful to Sarah." Besides, she said, the church has been from the start a mixture of Christianity and traditional Indian worship.
It was also the church that proved to be a vital factor for the tribe late in this century, Mrs. Fawcett said. Without the church, establishing that the tribe had a continuing presence in Connecticut to the present day, the tribe would have been unsuccessful in its petition to operate a gambling casino in the state, she believes.
With that casino, the Mohegans, now about 1,200 strong, are expected to become a major factor in the economic life of the area, able to support non-gambling enterprises and to sponsor all sorts of social benefits for the tribe. And, said Mrs. Fawcett, she is convinced all this would never have happened without Sarah Huntington. "The difference one person can make," she said.
One recent day, Mrs. Fawcett finally got to meet Sarah Huntington, or at least her portrait, close up. She had been unaware that a portrait existed, or that it was at Park Congregational Church in Norwich.
But there, indeed, was Sarah Huntington, a young woman, strong-featured but plain, with not a hint of decoration on her black dress. "She's not a beautiful woman but she's a handsome woman and there's a warmth in her face," said Jayne Fawcett.
Senator Dodd's "little miracle" reference might well apply to the portrait itself.
Its location had been mentioned casually in a book published in the last century, but when the Rev. H. Donald Smith became minister of the church a decade ago, the picture was not there.
Then late in the summer of 1995, he said, he received a letter from a woman in New Haven, saying she had something that belonged in his church. He drove to her home and was given the painting of Sarah Huntington, along with a copy of her memoir. She offered no explanation, he said, outside the fact that she was closing up her house. He did not press the issue.
As he later pieced it together, the Huntington portrait was one of many oil paintings discarded years ago because the Norwich building inspector considered them a fire hazard. Sarah Huntington's painting became the property of an art dealer in Mystic and eventually of the woman in New Haven.
It was she who decided the painting should go back to where it belonged, to a Congregational church in a city where Sarah Huntington was born and raised, and from which she walked out to the woods one day and found her mission in life.

A Home Development Is Under Way, 14 Years Later

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
AFTER 14 years of negotiation and litigation, earthmovers are preparing to turn 200 wooded hillside acres in Roxbury Township into a large residential community.
The $100 million project, Poet's Peak, is to be built over the next five years on Mooney Mountain in western Morris County by the Bukiet Building and Management Company of Clifton. It will use its own equity and bank financing to build 315 single-family homes, not the 700 town houses originally planned. 
 The project underscores the state's slowly improving housing picture and the changes developers must make to stay ahead of consumer preferences. But the time it took to reach this point also shows how complex the development process in the state can be.
In an attempt to distance it from projects of the past, the 15 neighborhoods that will be carved from the woodlands off Mooney and Mountain Roads will be linked by pedestrian walkways and have access to public open space. The homes will have 2,000 to 3,300 square feet of space, sit on lots of from 7,500 square feet to 1.5 acres and have varied architectural designs -- from Victorian to Norman and colonial -- to recall a community that evolved over time, said Joseph J. Bukiet, the president of the company. Prices are expected to be $239,000 to $363,000.
Among the issues involved in the Roxbury project were the adequacy of water and sewage lines and the time-consuming state and local approval and regulatory processes -- the latter long a lament among builders.
Bukiet acquired the project, subject to approvals for the 700 town houses, for $3.5 million. But the town was slow in providing water and sewer to the project and development was further complicated when Roxbury came under a state-imposed moratorium on sewer hookups until it upgraded its sewage treatment plant. That work was completed in 1990 and the ban was lifted. The project, however, did not get the sewage hookups needed to move ahead, so Bukiet sued the township. Under a 1993 settlement, Roxbury agreed to amend its waste water treatment plan and to construct water lines and a pumping station to service the project.
Over the last two years, the plan was amended and the construction of the services is to begin soon and be completed in May. In turn, Bukiet lowered the density of the project to its current scale and switched to single-family homes, which Mr. Bukiet said were more marketable.
Gary A. Webb, the township manager, said the lower-density project would have much less of an impact on the community, its municipal services and narrow roads.
IT is also one of several projects that will help Roxbury meet its obligation under the state's Mount Laurel doctrines, which require municipalities to provide housing opportunities for people of all incomes. In response to a suit filed against Roxbury and other Morris County towns by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which ended in a settlement in 1984, the township rezoned for 375 low- and moderate-income units, much of it in high-density town houses, including Bukiet's town house project. Bukiet, rather than build its share of the affordable units, contributed $1.6 million to Roxbury's Affordable Housing Trust Fund, used to finance the construction of such housing.
Despite the delays Mr. Bukiet said his company continued to invest in the Roxbury site -- with, among other expenses, carrying costs and legal fees -- because its natural setting and location make it ideal for housing. It is accessible to Routes 46 and 206 and Interstates 80 and 287 and to the corporate offices alongside them.
The project is proceeding at a time when sales activity in the county, as in the state, has increased as buyers respond to higher but still reasonable mortgage interest rates, stable prices and a strengthening economy. Figures from the Morris County Board of Realtors show that 1,069 existing single-family homes were sold in the second quarter of this year, up from 954 the same time in 1995.
"Morris County has also seen a surge in new construction, which has been slow in the past few years," said Karen N. Smith, manager at the Roxbury office of Weichert Realtors. New homes in western Morris County, which includes Roxbury, cost $209,000 to over $350,000, Mrs. Smith said. Single-family homes remain the housing of choice with those priced to $250,000 drawing the most buyers, she added. "But it all depends on what they are looking for," she said.
According to a recent survey of 3,800 home shoppers by the National Association of Home Builders, today's buyers demand that new homes have at least 2,200 square feet. The survey shows that buyers also want a large kitchen open to a family room and features like nine-foot ceilings and two-car garages -- all of which are incorporated in the homes at Poet's Peak. Burton Appel, based in Union, is the architect.
Gopal Ahluwalia, director of research at the Washington-based builder group, said, "consumers refuse to accept the cookie-cutter designs of the past." They want homes in developments with walking trails, park areas and community centers, he said, adding that builders must respond to remain competitive.
"Everyone understands that it is time to move beyond the simplicity of the 1950's big subdivisions to something more interesting," added Barry Poskanzer, a Ridgewood-based architect. That could mean arranging streets in various patterns to create housing clusters and preserve open space, or blending houses with other uses.
ARCHITECTURALLY, developers are using housing styles like Victorians and design features like porches and shutters to evoke a sense of community. That is the case in Toms River, where Continental Properties of Brick Township is building 28 Victorian-style homes off Route 166 to fit in with those in the surrounding neighborhood and in the historic downtown, a half-mile away. The homes, from 1,640 to 1,803 square feet, cost $125,000 to $181,000.
Baker Residential of Pleasantville, N.Y., is constructing 115 houses at the edge of Cranbury's historic village that are designed to blend with the area's 19th-century character. The homes range from 2,708 to 4,573 square feet and sell from $355,000 to $440,000. In Raritan, the Kalian Companies of Red Bank is building a community of 243 Victorian-style town houses meant to echo the look and character of neighboring Flemington's historic Main Street. The town houses, with 1,700 to 2,100 square feet, sell for $149,000 to $189,000.
As for Poet's Peak, it has been designed to foster a sense of community and to respect the environment, said Thaddeus S. Dudek, a principal at the Parsippany office of Schoor DePalma, an engineering and design firm. It developed the land plan for the project, which last year won awards from the New Jersey Planning Officials and the American Society of Landscape Architects.
The site features open fields, mature woods and rolling hills and is bordered by hundreds of acres of undeveloped land owned by the township. Bukiet has donated 58 acres of its site, including wetlands, which under state law cannot be developed, to the township land. Clusters of woodlands will be left around and between the rest of the site.
The 15 neighborhoods will each have 5 to 20 homes designed to follow the contours of the land.
They will sit on different size lots and will be placed at varying setbacks from the streets, which will bear literary names. The place itself has no literary relationships; the name was chosen by the builder.
Eight different models -- each with three elevations -- including some with porches will be offered.
As a result, Mr. Bukiet said he expected the project to draw a broad group of buyers. He said pre-construction sales would start in the next four weeks.

HEADLINE: Pioneers Wanted; East River Views

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:

2BR, HI FLR, AC, OVRSZ WNDWS, SPECTAC RV VU, INDOR PRKNG, HLTH CLB, TENNIS, ADJ TO PARK, 5 MIN TO GRND CENTRL. $25,000.
NO, that's not a misprint: $25,000, give or take a few thousand, will be the asking price for the well-appointed two-bedroom apartments going on sale this December in a mixed residential-commercial development inspired by Battery Park City. Smaller apartments in this unsubsidized 42-story co-op will go for much less -- under $10,000 for a studio lacking a gonzo view of the East River.
What's the catch? One risk for buyers is that if Queens West doesn't take off they may be stuck with apartments they cannot sell. The site, a largely abandoned industrial swath of the Hunters Point neighborhood of Queens directly opposite the United Nations, is plainly a reach for prospective buyers accustomed to a Starbucks on every corner. And the commercial developers -- a group headed by the Mellon Bank Corporation -- want to break through qualms about living in Queens West by transferring much of the initial risk of ownership from co-op purchasers to the Federal Housing Administration. 
 The developers have arranged for F.H.A. insurance on a mortgage for the co-op building, the first such deal by the Federal agency, which allowed them to obtain the long-term financing to go forward. In order to entice buyers to move into the first building the developers have set prices low, deferring, in effect, the bulk of their hoped-for profits to the buildings that they intend to put up subsequently. Apartment buyers will own their homes after their first payment, but will be responsible for paying down the building's mortgage -- for that apartment purchased for $25,000, the share is estimated at $140,000 -- as part of their monthly maintenance. The bargain-basement prices for buyers is their reward for being pioneers as well as the savings developers are passing along from their innovative financial arrangement.
Indeed, the developers are gambling that the financing, which will make it possible to buy apartments for less than the down payment on comparable space in Manhattan (but leave the co-op with a giant mortgage to service), will more than compensate for the psychic perils of being a pioneer.
If it works as well as the sponsors hope, the "low-equity" financing strategy could influence national housing policy. For it neatly dovetails with the wishes of liberals, who look for the most housing bang from a Government buck, as well as those of conservatives, who emphasize the virtues of owning over renting. Low-equity finance could "create the bridge to homeownership" for cash-poor families in high-cost markets, said Nick Retsinas, the head of the Federal Housing Administration.
The development of Hunters Point, which Queens Borough President Claire Shulman calls "the best site in the City of New York," has been in the works for a decade. In the mid-1980's a group of developers bought or optioned some five and a half acres of land along the East River, with the idea of building condominium apartments with conventional private financing. The city and the Port Authority as well as the state, now represented by the Empire State Development Corporation, had bigger ideas. They planned a mini-city with 2.4 million square feet of office space and 225,000 square feet of commercial space along with 6.4 million square feet of mixed-income housing. But what seemed a no-brainer in the go-go real estate market of the mid-1980's looked like an impossible task as the decade ended in recession.
The city and state hung in, approving a master plan in 1990 that includes 28 acres of open space with a Battery Park-like esplanade by the river. The master plan guiding the development along more than a mile of East River waterfront includes 20 sections, 16 of which have been earmarked for residential development and four for commercial projects, including office buildings and a hotel. New York City is currently investing $30 million in roads, sewers and parks, along with renovating two huge abandoned cargo gantries, as "industrial sculpture."
And the Board of Education has committed to having an early learning center -- kindergarten through second grade for 300 children located in the first residential building -- ready in September 1997. "Everybody is on board," notes Fran Reiter, the deputy mayor for economic planning and development: "Projects this exciting and of this scale only come along a handful of times each century."
Perhaps most important, private development efforts maintained momentum. The developers of the residential building that is now going up raised additional seed capital by expanding the equity partnership to include the Dreyfus Corporation (now part of the Mellon Bank Corporation) and two Japanese corporations.
But something had to be done to make the apartments attractive to potential buyers in a market that had left banks, insurance companies and pension funds wary of all but the safest projects. The developers -- whose partners include Trotwood Corporation, a subsidiary of Mellon, real-estate pros such as Worldwide Holdings and William Zeckendorf Jr., James Wolfenson and two Japanese companies -- toyed with asking the state to approve tax-exempt bonds to finance the first building. But use of this indirect subsidy would have put strict limits on who would be eligible to buy apartments, as well as how much individuals could profit from their resale. And it would undermine the effort to transform Hunters Point into a neighborhood as desirable as choice locales in Manhattan.
THIS left only Washington as a possible source of financial guarantees that would reduce private lenders' risks to acceptable levels and allow the developers to obtain the long-term funding they needed. Ordinarily, the Federal Housing Administration only insures multimillion dollar mortgages for big rental buildings. But the developers noted a way around the convention: there is no law against using Government insurance to obtain private financing, and then quickly convert the finished structure to a co-op. After dealing with the initial shock of being asked to do something for the first time, the F.H.A. became an enthusiastic supporter.
The mortgage insurance for the building, approved in 1995, permitted the building's developers, M.O. Associates (the initials stand for Manhattan Overlook) to borrow $85.6 million from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Housing Investment Trust at attractive rates. The initial two-year construction loan -- a loan which carries little risk, in any case, because it is formally backed by the very deep pockets of the building contractor, Lehrer McGovern Bovis -- is at 8 percent. Thereafter, it becomes a 40-year, self-liquidating mortgage at 7.75 percent.
Now comes the juicy part. Rather than reduce the size of the mortgage with the proceeds from sales of the finished co-ops, M.O. Associates will sell the apartments for what amounts to a developer's fee and leave the co-op with the full F.H.A.-insured mortgage. In effect, the developer is using "wholesale" financing as a substitute for "retail" bank mortgages obtained by individual apartment buyers.
There is no magic here. With most co-ops, shares in the building largely represent equity, and purchasers usually go to banks to raise large sums to purchase them. Here, apartment ownership will require little cash up front, but it will saddle owners with proportionately more debt. However, the arrangement does generate an obvious marketing advantage for the developers -- think of the astoundingly low asking prices -- as well as some genuine financial advantages to apartment buyers.
For one thing, it eliminates the fees and red tape associated with obtaining an individual co-op loan from a bank. For another, it permits greater financial leverage than many middle-income families could otherwise obtain. For example, the co-op shares in an average apartment -- a $25,000 two-bedroom, one-bath unit -- will carry roughly $140,000 of the co-op's mortgage debt. Buyers will be free to reduce their cash outlay still more by borrowing any or all of the purchase price from other sources, including banks.
And while the co-op will have the discretion to reject applicants who lack adequate financial means to cover the monthly maintenance, the developers say they intend to bend over backward to attract New Yorkers now priced out of the Manhattan co-op market.
In the case of that average two-bedroom apartment, an annual income of $52,000 is deemed adequate. "We believe the apartments should be accessible to the firefighters, schoolteachers and cops who work in the city," explained Herbert J. Sturz, president of the Trotwood Corporation, which oversees the investment for Mellon.
Another selling point is that it will cost far less to own an apartment in Queens West than to rent comparable space at market prices in middle-class Manhattan neighborhoods. Consider again the average (two-bedroom, one-bath) 765-square-foot apartment. Monthly maintenance charges, including the paydown of the building's mortgage, are estimated to be $1,295. Because so much of the maintenance will be for mortgage service, that maintenance will be 75 percent tax-deductible. So for a middle-income New Yorker in a combined Federal-state-city 35 percent tax bracket, the after-tax maintenance will run to $955. Figure the after-tax interest income lost on the money that goes into the $25,000 purchase price at, say, 5 percent annually, which comes to $104 a month. Grand total: $1,059 a month.
The developers have also attempted to head off potential buyers' fears of the possibility of sharp rises in projected maintenance charges. At Queens West, the unusually high financial leverage that necessitates high maintenance charges from day one also guarantees that costs will rise far less rapidly than the rate of inflation.
Payments on the self-liquidating mortgage, which initially represent three-quarters of the monthly charge, are based on a fixed interest rate for 40 years and thus do not grow over time. So even if other costs -- energy, repairs, building services -- rose at a distressing 8 percent annually, total maintenance would rise by just 2 percent a year.
The co-op will eventually have to pay New York City real estate taxes when its as-of-right exemption begins to phase out in 20 years and disappears entirely in 25 years. But here, too, the developers have devised a way to shield apartment owners from future shock. For the first 20 years the mortgage payments will be greater than the amount needed to liquidate the principal in 40 years, making it possible to reduce mortgage payments thereafter by the estimated real estate taxes.
Arguably the biggest selling point for buyers, though, is the asymmetry between the potential risks and potential gains of ownership. In the worst-case scenario -- say, a nasty recession that knocked the stuffing out of the New York housing market -- the big building could become an orphan. While the city is committed to providing the riverside promenade as well as crucial infrastructure and the early learning center under any circumstance, development of a residential neighborhood with shops and a vibrant street life -- the master plan eventually envisions more than 6,000 apartments -- might be postponed indefinitely.
WHAT'S more, co-op owners would lose their entire initial investment in the (improbable) event the cost of competitive apartments elsewhere in the city fell below the after-tax maintenance costs at Queens West. And if some apartment owners default and their apartments are left standing vacant, the remaining owners would be left with proportionately larger maintenance costs. In the worst-case scenario, the co-op itself could stop mortgage payments, leaving ownership in the hands of the F.H.A., without any additional liability to individual apartment owners.
But the potential capital losses are more limited than in, say, a mature neighborhood of Manhattan, where a real estate bust that cut apartment values by 20 or 30 percent would cost owners of comparable two-bedroom apartments a lot more than $25,000. By contrast, if New York housing prices and rents remain reasonably strong and the Hunters Point development is completed as planned, pioneer owners could see their equity rise many-fold. It would hardly be unreasonable to find that, once Queens West has achieved critical mass with thousands of middle-class residents, an apartment purchased for $25,000 would sell for $150,000. Comparable units in Chelsea and the northern fringes of the Upper East and West Sides of Manhattan currently sell for more.
To limit absentee ownership that could undermine the fragile sense of community in the big building, a minimum of 70 percent of the initial owners will be required to designate it as their primary residence. To deter speculation that would increase turnover, Queens West will exact a stiff penalty of 50 percent of any profit from secondary sales in the first two years. This "flip tax" will be phased out thereafter, disappearing entirely after 10 years when the neighborhood will presumably have matured.
In the end, of course, this intricate financial package will not induce potential buyers to put down roots if the apartments don't mesh with their tastes. And here, the developers have walked the line between amenity and cost containment.
Location is plainly Queens West's best and worst feature. The river views -- 90 percent of the apartments have them -- range for good to jaw-dropping. And transportation could hardly be more convenient. The Vernon-Jackson station on the Number 7 subway line is two blocks away, and just one stop to Grand Central. Private ferry service to 36th Street in Manhattan is now available three blocks to the south at rush hour, and should become more frequent once Queens West is open for business. There will be secure indoor parking available (at market price -- perhaps $150 a month) to every resident.
Along with the early learning center the building will have a health club for residents, complete with two tennis courts on the deck of the garage (but no swimming pool, since a large public pool is planned for the Queens West complex). Some 13,000 square feet has also been set aside for commerce -- a restaurant, perhaps, or a few convenience stores. However, until more buildings go up, residents will have to leave the neighborhood for much of their shopping.
This first building, designed by Cesar Pelli, the architect of the World Financial Center, is more distinctive than the postwar slabs lining Manhattan's residential avenues. The interior space, designed by Peter Claman, will also have some flair. Windows are considerably bigger and ceilings, at 8 feet 4 inches, a bit higher than is typical in new construction. Room sizes are generous by current ungenerous standards with standard one-bedrooms between 620 and 697 square feet, two-bedrooms between 734 and 849 square feet and three-bedroom apartments with terraces between 1,037 and 1,115. And, of course, few apartment buildings can boast of a riverside esplanade outside the front door.
No matter how attractive the apartments may be, pioneer living isn't for everyone. Meredith Kane, a lawyer at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and a former director of the home ownership program in the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, notes that Queens West "is certainly not for people who want to live in a place that looks like the neighborhood they grew up in." The best candidates, she suggests, are "young families in search of more space" and "those in New York with their first job who want an easy commute to Manhattan."
Richard Kahan, the former chairman of the Battery Park City Authority and president of the New York State Urban Development Corporation, warns that, in the early stages of development "this won't be a great neighborhood for the elderly." The big winners, he says, are likely to be "the bargain hunters -- the people for whom ownership outweighs the inconveniences of being first."
WHILE the developers are not eager to share specifics, they acknowledge that the first building has, by default, become a loss leader. They don't expect a profit even if the first building sells out completely.
However if the apartments sell briskly, M.O. Associates will move quickly to obtain conventional financing for three additional buildings on the land they control in Queens West, selling as many as another 978 units -- the maximum allowed in the master plan -- at more generous profit margins.
If the development succeeds and the low-equity purchase financing being used in the first building is judged to have made the breakthrough possible, its boosters say, it may well be imitated by developers in other neighborhoods and other cities.
That would certainly please Mr. Retsinas at the Federal Housing Administration. "One of F.H.A.'s primary roles is to help the pioneers," he explains.
Mr. Sturz, a former chairman of the New York City Planning Commission, would like to see the low-equity finance formula applied to low-to-moderate income housing. He envisions co-ops built on abandoned or donated inner-city land, with financing subsidized with tax-exempt bonds. This, he calculates, would make it possible to sell multibedroom units for less than $10,000 and to service the mortgage for substantially less than market-rate rents. "I'm thinking about housing that would be affordable for a family making $30,000," he said.
For the moment, though, the name of the game is selling the first 522 apartments at Hunters Point -- and selling them rapidly, once the formal offering plan is accepted by the New York State Attorney General's office, which is expected to happen in December. A quick sell-out would probably allow Hunters Point to shed the stigma "pioneer neighborhood," a prospect pleasing to boosters of the city's boroughs beyond Manhattan.
"Why," asks Gov. George E. Pataki, "should people in New Jersey get the best views of Manhattan?"

HEADLINE: Once Upon a Time, When High Schools Were Palaces

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
NINETY years ago, an enormous Beaux Arts building went up on a hill overlooking the Hudson River. It had Corinthian columns, terrazzo floors and a vestibule lined with English marble. It could have passed for a palace, or at least a palatial estate.
But it was neither. It was, in fact, William L. Dickinson High School, the first public secondary school in Jersey City. It was the pet project of Mayor Mark Fagan, a "New Idea" Republican who was elected in 1901 and wanted a "handsome, substantial" school building that would be "a good advertisement for the city." 
 He also wanted the high school, named after the city's first Superintendent of Schools, to be open to the communityidea is catching on again today.
"Cities were building these massive public buildings, democratic in design, to show how egalitarian Americans were," said Barbara Petrick, a social studies teacher at Dickinson who is the school's unofficial historian. "They wanted to make the point that whether you were destined to be a workman or a professional, everyone was entitled to this kind of education."
When it opened in 1906, Dickinson had a 2,000-seat auditorium used not just for school functions but for political debates, plays and concerts. Helen Keller lectured there, and Presidents Taft, Wilson and Roosevelt all held political rallies under the stained-glass ceiling. A branch of the Jersey City Public Library opened in Dickinson, which also housed one of the state's first night schools.
Enrollment climbed quickly after Dickinson opened, and by 1910, it had more than doubled to more than 2,000. The city was also becoming an industrial hub, so in 1912, an addition was built that doubled the school's size. The new section had industrial and vocational classrooms, a foundry and a print shop.
Ms. Petrick said the school cost $1.5 million --an exorbitant sum for a school in those days -- most of which came from railroad and business-tax revenues, which increased under Mayor Fagan.
"The money was available because the city's business economy was at its most prosperous," she said.
The architect was John T. Rowland, a Jersey City native who also designed Jersey City Medical Center, the Jersey Journal building, the Labor Bank building and more than two dozen other schools. In 1933, he designed a $630,000 annex to Dickinson that housed a swimming pool, gymnasium and cafeteria.
In the 1980's, Ms. Petrick said, the overcrowded school was covered with graffiti and crumbling. But a $30 million renovation is under way, and so far the roof and facade have been repaired, the graffiti and several smokestacks removed and a sprinkler system added. Ms. Petrick said the school, with 2,700 students, is in better shape than many newer ones.
"It's built like the Rock of Gibraltar," she said.

HEADLINE: To Build a School

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: LEMINGTON

 BODY:
NEW JERSEY'S newest elementary school crouches among the fields here, barely visible from the road. It is long and low, with wide hallways and classrooms around a grassy courtyard. But the things that set the Copper Hill School apart from older schools -- a geothermal heating system, for example, and 40 miles of wiring to support a sophisticated computer network -- are invisible to residents of this town, who are footing the $14 million bill.
The design of Copper Hill contrasts sharply with those of schools built in the past, when educators, architects and New Jersey taxpayers -- who have the power to defeat school construction plans in bond referendums -- had different priorities. It is subtle and practical, from the earth-colored concrete facade to the heating system that does not use fossil fuels to the extra rooms for adult education and day care. The fanciest feature is the computer network, which will connect every room to the Internet and allow students to communicate with others around the state and the world. 
 In comparison, schools built in the first half of the century were more interesting to look at, with pillars, gabled roofs and stone carvings that created an aura of grandeur. In the 1950's the postwar baby boom caused an explosion in school construction, with little thought given to design or curriculum needs. In the 1970's the oil crisis made efficient heating a priority, and many schools were built with no windows.
These days, everyone involved in school design agrees that programming needs, not just for students but for the community as a whole, should be the top priority. But since school budgets in New Jersey are always tight, tough choices must be made. Through numerous public meetings, school officials eliminate possibilities that might be seen as excessive. Stages are often vetoed, for example, as are swimming pools and most kinds of ornamentation.
"You have to stay on a flexible, functional design, or it's probably not going to be accepted," said Scott R. Spiezle, whose Trenton architectural firm designed Copper Hill. "In other states, I have seen schools with waterfalls, huge aquariums, gorgeous design elements. But I don't believe the public in New Jersey is willing to pay for these things."
What the public is willing to pay for these days, architects and school officials say, are spaces that will accommodate residents of all ages, at all hours of the day. In cities and suburbs, school buildings are becoming community hubs where the elderly can use the library, middle-aged adults can take evening classes and children of working parents can stay for after-school programs. If a new school offers perks for the whole community, they say, it might appeal to childless residents who would otherwise fight it.
"We are undergoing tremendous changes in the nature of family and community life," said Roy Strickland, director of the New American School Design Project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Schools should be thinking about providing services for everyone from very young children to older adults, from early morning into evening."
With enrollments climbing fast in much of the state -- Flemington and the rest of Hunterdon County, in particular, are experiencing a population boom -- school designers are making buildings flexible enough to accommodate growing class sizes and untraditional schedules. For the many school districts that are considering year-round classes, air-conditioning is no longer optional. Some new schools have folding walls between classrooms, and others have separate cafeterias and gymnasiums, to accommodate lunch periods that start as early as 9:45 A.M.
Meanwhile, technology is changing the most basic elements of school design. Fluorescent lights, which cause glare on computer screens, are being replaced with softer, indirect lighting. Libraries are becoming "media centers," with less space allotted for shelves and more for computers, which can store every reference book and periodical on CD-ROM. Teacher lounges are now known as "work spaces," and along with sagging couches, they have computers, conference tables and phones with voice mail.
To complicate the planning process, new schools must comply with dozens of state and Federal mandates, a fire code and energy-efficiency ratios. Ceiling height, space between desks and wall thickness are strictly regulated, and plans must go through several stages of approval. All of these requirements, along with the directive to spend frugally, make it easy to overlook what is perhaps the most important question of all: What kind of impression will a new school make on the people who will spend their formative years there?
Certain details will linger in their minds long after they move on: the feel of the brick facade when they lean against it; the color of the classroom walls; the way sunlight filters through the windows and sounds echo through the halls. Mr. Strickland of M.I.T. says architects need to make schools more comfortable for the children who spend long hours there.
"If you look at the plan of a nicely designed house, there are large spaces for shared activities, as well as more private alcoves for people to be alone," he said. "Schools need to become more homelike."
 
ORIGINS
Wood and Spitoons
Historians say the first school in New Jersey was built in 1662, in a Dutch settlement that is now part of Jersey City. By the early 1800's, dozens of one-room schoolhouses were scattered around the state.
But towns did not start using tax dollars to build free public schools until the 1840's, when special acts of the State Legislature allowed some localities to raise money for school construction. Newark, Camden, Jersey City and Bridgeton were among the first to have graded public schools, which were typically made of brick and shaped like boxes.
The first public high school opened in Newark in 1855, and others followed in Paterson, Plainfield, Orange and New Brunswick. In 1876, the State Constitution guaranteed a free public education for every child, with a State School Fund to help with the cost. But until the turn of the century, tiny schoolhouses were the norm, and many were in poor condition.
"The floors are broken through, and the children cluster in the corner during rain storms, and shiver as wintry blasts whistle through," wrote Charles Morrow, the schools superintendent in Wantage, Sussex County, in 1864. "Floors answer for spitoons and they are well used by teachers and pupils; furniture rude and sadly cut up."
Such problems were so widespread that in 1865, the State Superintendent of Schools circulated designs to help towns build more durable schools. By 1874, the Superintendent's annual report included suggestions for 23 types of school buildings, with simple square classrooms, desks bolted to floors,and bell towers that held ventilation shafts.
By the turn of the century, schools were being modeled after other public buildings, like city halls and post offices, with facades in Greek Revival, Queen Anne and other traditional styles. The top floor was usually an assembly hall, and the others held only classrooms. Gymnasiums did not become common until the 1920's, and libraries and cafeterias came even later.
In 1996, 64 of New Jersey's 2,300 school buildings are more than a century old, which means that thousands of children are making do with archaic floor plans, outdoor gym classes and lunch hours held in basements or wherever they will fit. But it also means, school officials say, that the older buildings are much more durable than their midcentury counterparts.
In Fairview, Bergen County, 250 elementary school students still attend Public School No. 3, built in 1908. The district recently spent $1 million to replace the windows, heating system and lighting, and the third-floor assembly hall has been converted to classrooms. The basement serves as a cafeteria and rainy-day gym, but the rest of the school remains untouched.
"That place is built like a fort," said Patrick Caufield, the business administrator, adding that the inside walls are two feet thick and the brick facade has never needed a facelift. "It's not going anywhere."
 
BABY BOOM
Sprawling Conformity
By the 1950's, suburban school districts were in dire need of extra space, and they were building dozens of new schools every year. These Baby Boom schools were built quickly and inexpensively to accommodate new neighborhoods in counties like Middlesex, Monmouth and Somerset. Unlike their predecessors, they were usually sprawling, one-story buildings, with flat roofs, painted cinder block walls, and wings that could fit dozens of classrooms.
Fifty percent of the nation's public schools were built in the 1950's and 60's, including hundreds of New Jersey's suburban schools. More than 400 elementary schools were built in New Jersey from 1953 to 1962. Instead of brick, facades were often made of glass and metal panels, and windows were trimmed with flimsy aluminum. Roofs were flat, and layouts were often so confusing that it was (and still is) hard to find the main entrance.
"The suburbs back then were homogeneous environments with homogeneous families," said Mr. Strickland, the M.I.T. professor. "Boards of education were responding to that with homogeneous schools, plunked down smack in the middle of the community."
Inside the schools, though, some of the innovations of the 1950's and 60's were important. Desks were no longer fixed to the floors, and many elementary classrooms had library nooks and art corners. School libraries were more common, as were classrooms equipped for industrial arts and home economics.
Many postwar schools had classrooms painted in colors that many students now consider mind-numbing; washed-out greens and yellows seem to have been especially popular. But at the time, they caused mild excitement. A 1958 article in a New Jersey newspaper praised the "color engineers" who designed Watchung Hills Regional and Millburn High Schools. In the former, one classroom had typewriters in "sea-foam green," "desert sand" and "sapphire gray." In the latter, even the administrative offices were painted in ever-so-subtle pastels.
When the principal and his assistant inspected their new offices, the article said, "they found the walls a dreamy blue, the sample swatches labeled 'Wedgwood.' "
Pablo L. Jordan, a Raritan architect who has designed schools for 30 years, said many schools built in the 1970's "took color too far in the other direction," with walls painted orange and red. Now, he said, the trend is toward muted colors again, although sleepy yellows and greens remain unthinkable, Mr. Jordan said. Schools that have kept those colors have higher vandalism rates than those with taupes, beiges and grays, he said.
Starting in the late 1960's, when forward-thinking educators were calling for open classrooms and team teaching, some school designs verged on wacky. Some New Jersey schools built in that period were circular, with wide-open spaces instead of separate classrooms. Architects say those schools are partitioning up their inside space now, but the oddly shaped classrooms that result can cause problems. Today's taxpayers do not suffer such eccentric designs gladly, and for good reason, Mr. Strickland said.
"A lot of it," he said, "comes down to common sense."
 
NEW AGE
Community Clubhouse
James Gamble, the principal at the Copper Hill School, could not agree more. He offered suggestions for the building several years ago, with input from parents, teachers and other administrators. Technology was the top priority, he said, followed by rooms for community use.
As for the building itself, the school district wanted what Mr. Spiezle, the architect, calls "basic finishes": concrete-block walls, drop ceilings and vinyl floor tiles. The building looks nice, Mr. Gamble said, but he was more eager to talk about the front hallway, which is wide enough to drive a school bus through.
"We had a carnival in the hall a few weeks ago," he said. "There were a few hundred people milling around. In the hallway!"
Mr. Pease, the Raritan architect, says wide halls provide an extra common space, which is crucial when enrollment is up and space is tight. It also makes a school more comfortable, he said, as do courtyards with benches, and alcoves where students can relax.
"We're doing more areas for students to enjoy themselves," he said.
Although many educators are calling for smaller, more intimate schools, the numerous New Jersey towns that face enrollment booms do not have that option. Copper Hill has room for 900 students, and it is already up to 650. In Warren County, the tiny town of Pohatcong is building an elementary school big enough for 1,000 students, because its population is expected to triple over the next decade.
But large schools can be subdivided into smaller "pods" that feel more intimate, architects say. At Copper Hill, the kindergarten classrooms are isolated in an octagonal wing, with a separate playground and a common area in the middle. The gymnasium has a folding wall that can create smaller spaces, as do several classrooms.
The school has some distinctive touches, but each serves its purpose. Skylights in the hallway allow natural light to filter in, and pillars out front support a pavilion that shields students from rain.
But if school buildings are going to serve as second homes and community clubhouses, perhaps the most meaningful details will be contributed by the people who spend time there. At Copper Hill, some classrooms have soft throw rugs, rocking chairs and couches. Already, the concrete walls are replete with essays that reveal students' hopes, dreams and favorite foods.
And the other day, when a noisy group of budding athletes did jumping jacks in that wide front hallway, the echo was just about right.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK UP CLOSE;
New Signals in Cable Deal

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
Since 1993, Chinese immigrants who have Time Warner cable television service in Queens and Brooklyn have enjoyed access to Chinese-language programs provided 24 hours a day by the Chinese Communication Channel. But a dispute between the company and Time Warner may jeopardize some of their favorite shows.
Barry Rosenblum, president of Time Warner Cable of New York City, said the company had decided to replace Chinese Communication, which is seen on Channel 78, with Sino Television of Manhattan after it failed to honor contractual and financial obligations, a charge Chinese Communication disputes. 
 "They owed us $480,000 for over a year and we just don't feel they have the financial strength to continue," Mr. Rosenblum said.
But for many Chinese, the decision is seen as part of a never-ending power struggle between factions sympathetic to China or Taiwan. Although the owners of both companies are from Taiwan and say they maintain neutrality, Arthur Liu, of Sino Television, is seen by many as more sympathetic to China, and Chinese Communication, a corporation with headquarters in Flushing, more sympathetic to Taiwan.
Those who support Chinese Communication fear that Sino will increase the amount of mainland programming on Channel 78. Its current fare includes Taiwanese opera, a Chinese-produced soap opera, movies from Hong Kong and CNN Headline News, tramslated into Chinese. Mr. Liu, who still does not have a contract with Time Warner, says a programming schedule has not yet been set. Sino is entitled to buy the rights to most of the shows that have been offered by Chinese Communication, but Mr. Liu has said that mainland programming would cost him only about a third of what he would pay for Taiwanese or Hong Kong programs.
Mr. Rosenblum said his company's decision was purely economic. In 1993, the Chinese Communication Channel leased the station for $60,000 a month. But several months into the operation, the company asked Time Warner to reduce the rate, citing the lack of advertising revenue. When Time Warner refused, Chinese Communication began withholding payments.
Under an agreement reached last fall, Chinese Communication was to become a premium channel by January 1996, and would share a subscription fee with Time Warner. The agreement also stipulated that if Chinese Communication paid its debt by last December, Time Warner would forgive its obligations from January 1996 to August. But the channel never went premium.
Raymond Wang, executive vice president of the Chinese Communication Channel, blamed Time Warner for the dispute and said his company had sued it to remain on Channel 78.
A spokeswoman for Time Warner, Harriet Novet, said she would not comment on specific charges before the case went to court. It is to go to trial in mid-October. JANE H. LII

HEADLINE: So English. So Stylish. And, Yes, So Expensive.;
From the Looks Of It, It's the Year of the Cat

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
FEW of the many cars that I test-drive each year, except for some oddities like the AM General Hummer and the Oscar Mayer Weinermobile, actually stop traffic. But the 1997 Jaguar XK8 created such a stir wherever we went that I feared it might literally result in bloodshed.
As I waited to turn onto a busy street, drivers of three cars in a row stomped on the brakes and stared. This happened on my first day with the stunning new Jaguar, and the scene was repeated often during a weeklong test drive. Once, after meeting a lovely British roadster of the same royal blue as my XK8 coupe, I watched in the rear-view mirror as the passing driver twisted his head for a second glance. I was afraid he was going to rear-end the car in front of him. 
 The XK8, available as a coupe or convertible, replaces the recently retired XJS, the British company's longest-running and best-selling sports car. But the XK8 is far more modern, benefiting greatly from the deep pockets and the manufacturing and technical expertise of its parent, the Ford Motor Company. Indeed, the XK8 would not exist were it not for Ford's purchase of Jaguar in 1989. Likewise, another venerable British sports car maker in dire straits, Aston Martin, has regrouped under Ford and developed a rarefied cousin of the XK8, the DB7.
Jaguar's adoption had raised fears that its new models would be thinly disguised Fords, with another grand old name turned into little more than a marketing tool. But my week with the XK8 left me convinced that this sporting, sophisticated automobile is supremely worthy of the snarling-cat emblem on its hood.
In designing this beauty, Jaguar designers set out to link the XK8 to past Jaguars but not to build a nostalgic replica. "The heritage of good design is like DNA," Jaguar's styling director, Geoff Lawson, has said. "It must be traceable through history, but not necessarily an exact duplicate."
During my fling with the XK8 coupe, Jaguar aficionados scrutinized its styling cues the way people examine the family traits of newborns. "She has her mother's nose, but her father's eyes," they seemed to say.
The oval grille opening, the prominent headlamps, the styled wheels and the manner in which the fenders swell to meet the hood recall Jaguar race cars of the past, like those that won the 24 Hours of Le Mans each year from 1954 to 1957. The XK8's long, lean body -- at 187 inches, a full 10 inches longer than a Mercedes-Benz SL -- along with its low-to-the-ground profile and extended hood, invite comparisons with many classic Jaguars. The front and rear are reminiscent of the E-type, the work-of-art sports car that first appeared at the Geneva Motor Show in 1961; a convertible version was added this year to the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, only the third automobile to be so honored.
As sexy as its lines may be, my favorite part of the XK8 is the interior. This is surely the most sumptuous cabin of any car I have driven. I reveled in its rich, warm ambiance. Words like "exquisite" and "sensuous" come to mind. A slab of highly polished burled walnut stretches across the instrument panel from door to door. The same lustrous wood alternates on the steering wheel with the creamy Connolly leather used for the upholstery. The shift knob on the familiar Jaguar J-shaped gear selector also is polished wood. The XK8's gauges, including an analog clock, are deeply recessed into the instrument panel.
The seats look splendid, and they are splendidly comfortable. Simple in design, they narrow toward the top, providing excellent lateral support but giving the shoulders free movement. The steering wheel tilts and telescopes electrically, and multiple power seat adjustments make it easy to find a comfortable seating position.
Driving the XK8, I envisioned myself behind the wheel of a two-seater, even though there is a rear seat -- with absolutely no legroom -- and a trunk far larger than those of any roadster, or any of its coupe competitors, for that matter.
Looking out across the elongated hood, I had a commanding sense of the road, yet a safe separateness from the harsh outside world. The XK8 has the safety equipment one expects in a luxury automobile, including pre-tensioners that tighten the slack of the lap and shoulder belts in a crash.
Just as significant as the car's style is what's under its long hood: Jaguar's first V8 engine, replacing the XJS's in-line 6 and V12. The 4.0-liter engine -- developed by Jaguar, not Ford -- is rated at 290 horsepower and is paired with a five-speed electronic automatic transmission. The fifth-gear overdrive helps to raise the fuel economy to 17 city and 25 highway, and indeed the Jaguar's mileage is high enough to avoid the Federal gas-guzzler tax.
Standard are anti-lock brakes and an "automatic stability control" that adjusts power to slipping wheels. Traction control, which adds automatic braking when wheels spin, is optional.
The powertrain produces the powerful performance of a sports car with the refinement of a luxury car. And the XK8 is on par in every way -- acceleration, top speed and braking -- with the very competent competitors in its class. Yet it is substantially lighter than its counterparts from Mercedes and BMW, making it feel more nimble.
With a base price for the coupe of $65,480, including shipping, and about $5,000 more for the convertible, the XK8 is indeed costly, but it does seem worth every penny. Its chief competitors cost tens of thousands of dollars more.
For all its greatness, the new Jag has its quirks and flaws. The ignition switch is so low that the key fob dangles against the knee. The steering seemed slightly off-center. The front and rear defrosters leave much to be desired. With four occupants, the windows remained cloudy for the entire early-morning drive to and from pre-school.
And the quality of the fit and finish could have been better on the early-production test car. The anchor for the rear seat belt broke, revealing an ugly tear in the upholstery underneath, and the lid covering the front dual cup holders, in the shape of a heart, didn't fit as it should have.
But I'm willing to overlook the XK8's minor flaws. It stole my heart.
On the last day I had possession of the Jaguar, I longed for a few more hours. The open road beckoned. I closed the door -- the windows automatically raised the last quarter-inch to lock into the top seal and shut out the madding world. Speeding across twisty country roads in midday with the XK8 enticing me to push it harder, I felt as if I were skipping school. The day was glorious; the Jaguar was divine.
 
INSIDE TRACK: A sleek feline worthy of its impressive pedigree.

GRAPHIC: Photos: The United States will account for 60 percent of the 12,000 sales that Jaguar anticipates for its XK8 in the car's first year. Four out of five American buyers are expected to opt for the convertible, left, which costs about $5,000 more than the coupe. (Jaguar Cars)

How Much To Pay for Security?

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to auto insurance, one of the more perplexing decisions is whether to buy coverage against theft and vandalism.
Unlike liability insurance, protection against theft and vandalism is not mandatory. So the key question becomes: Does it make economic sense? 
 Especially in urban areas, like New York, plenty of car owners have decided it doesn't because of the high cost. But they know they are at risk of losing a valuable asset. And people who do pay for the coverage lament the costly premiums.
Now Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is up for re-election as New York Mayor next year, has taken up the cudgels on behalf of car owners, exclaiming that since his police force has driven down auto theft by 51 percent, the cost of comprehensive coverage, which includes theft and vandalism protection, should take a similar dive. State insurance officials say premiums have declined somewhat, but not as much as thefts because most New Yorkers don't carry comprehensive insurance in the first place and the benefits are thus not accruing to insurers.
But the Mayor is unrelenting. Last Thursday, he told a State Senate hearing in Manhattan that the cost of comprehensive simply must become more affordable. Right now, it can cost 10 times more in New York than in rural America.
Whether or not the Mayor succeeds in his insurance campaign, car owners debating the usefulness of theft coverage will find they fall into one of three categories. If they have new, expensive cars, they can hardly think of doing without comprehensive coverage. If the car is financed, as is usually the case, the lender requires such coverage to protect his investment. Meanwhile, owners of real clunkers routinely skip comprehensive coverage because the car's value is so little.
The decision becomes tricky for the owners of cars that have been on the road for a few years. As a rule of thumb, Consumer's Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports, recommends that car owners consider dropping comprehensive coverage on cars that are four or five years old and that have a replacement value of, say, less than $10,000.
"Often you'd do better with an older car by setting up a kind of self-insurance fund," said Bill Ahern, an analyst for Consumer's Union, "just putting into a money market the money you'd be paying in annual premiums. In places where comprehensive is expensive, you might end up setting aside the value of the car in four or five years. If you'd bought insurance and nothing happened to your car, the money would just be gone."
Across the country, three-quarters of car owners buy comprehensive coverage. Mr. Ahern says many probably could do without it. Car owners usually go over their insurance needs with an agent when they take out a policy, he said, and automatically renew every year without making adjustments.
"As the car ages, people should be asking, 'Do I really need the comprehensive?' " he said. "But they don't look at the policy again."
Only 38 percent of motorists in New York buy comprehensive coverage. In the cities of New Jersey the rate is even lower: 20 percent.
A big reason that urbanites don't buy comprehensive coverage, said Sean Mooney, an economist at the Insurance Information Institute, is that after paying the high cost of the required insurance, they don't want to dig further into their pockets. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and most other states require car owners to buy liability insurance, which pays for injuries or damages to other drivers and their cars. Drivers in the three-state area are also required to have insurance that pays for injuries to themselves or people in their vehicles.
New York ranks among the most expensive areas in the country for both the required and the optional comprehensive insurance, Mr. Mooney said.
"It's the bumper-car factor, the density of traffic," he said. "The more cars you have, the more accidents you have. That means more damage to people and cars and, therefore, higher insurance rates."
Furthermore, medical care and auto repairs cost more in urban areas, while city people tend to sue more than others. Some city people simply opt to drive old clunkers that they consider unlikely to be stolen.
In Brooklyn, a 35-year-old man might pay more than $1,400 a year for the mandated auto insurance for a five-year-old Ford Taurus, valued at about $8,000. To buy comprehensive coverage, he would pay as much as $2.000 more a year, gaining protection against theft and vandalism, as well as fire and damage from falling trees and hail.
John Calagna, a spokesman for the New York State Insurance Department, and Mr. Ahern advise against buying comprehensive in such cases because the premium represents such a high percentage of the car's value.
In rural California, where auto theft is much less common, the comprehensive portion of an auto policy may seem a steal at a cost of as little as $200 a year. "But you may actually be throwing your money away," Mr. Ahern said, "because the odds of having your car stolen there are so low."

 BODY:
A State Supreme Court judge has rejected the rent increase Metropolitan Life imposed last year for the 147,000 defective windows the company installed three years ago at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, the sprawling middle-income projects it owns on First Avenue between 14th to 23d Streets. Justice Herman Cahn last week ordered the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal to re-examine Met Life's application for a rent hike based on the $30 million it spent on new double-paned windows, which began to implode shortly after their installation in the two complexes, which together have 110 buildings. "This victory bolsters the notion that people shouldn't have to pay for broken and defective merchandise," said Jack Lester, an attorney representing the tenants. Metropolitan Life says it plans to appeal the decision. In the meantime, residents will not have to pay the estimated 6 percent rent increase. 
 Two Lower East Side cultural centers won a reprieve last week when the city-owned buildings they occupy were taken off the auction block. The city had planned to sell the abandoned Gothic schoolhouse at 107 Suffolk Street, which houses the Clemente Soto Velez Cultural and Educational Center, and a building at 605 East Ninth Street occupied by El Bohio Cultural Center. The centers rent the spaces from the city. "There was a tremedous outpouring of support by the community and elected officials," said Jack Deacy, a spokesman for City Hall.

From Beer to Prozac, Perks Abound

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS 

 BODY:
SURE, there is a health plan for employees at Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc., but it probably doesn't make anyone feel better on the way out the door at night. That is what the ice cream is for: three pints, fresh from the freezer, free, for everyone, every day.
That's a lot of ice cream. Some employees just can't eat it all, but have found another way to tap its value. They barter their pints around town, in South Burlington, Vt., for haircuts or baby-sitting. 
 This kind of perk, tantalizing to 12-year-olds, works well with adults, too. Everyone knows about the serious, obvious perks -- airlines let employees fly for next to nothing, department stores give minimum-wage clerks a discount on clothing and such. But it is often the small displays of company largess that make employees feel as if they are getting something for nothing. Depending on whom they work for, employees may receive everything from free hamburgers to free Prozac.
For starters, there's free beer. Anheuser-Busch employees receive vouchers for two cases a month. It's the same at Pete's Wicked Brewing Company in Palo Alto, Calif., brewers of Pete's Wicked Ale, and at the Boston Beer Company, which makes Samuel Adams. But these two also show some small-company flexibility: at Boston Beer, said Lucy Sholley, a spokeswoman, "if someone has a party they can get a few extra cases."
Pete's encourages employees to go to what a spokeswoman, calls "local beer events"; they can be reimbursed for a taxi home, too.
Robert Mondavi, the Napa Valley winemaker, gives each employee a case of wine at the end of every quarter, and the wine tastings at work "are so regular I don't even consider them perks," said Susanne Bergstrom, a spokeswoman. Workers with desk jobs can go out at harvest time to learn about picking and crushing, and, Ms. Bergstrom said, "some employees have gone on group trips to Europe, to visit Bordeaux and stuff."
Rubbermaid Inc. gives employees "rubber bucks" for a job well done. The bucks can be redeemed for goods at company stores. ("You can never have enough Servin' Savers," said Lorrie Crum, a spokeswoman for the company.)
At the Gap, employees who have babies receive a package of items from Baby Gap stores. Workers at Benjamin Moore & Company get paint at wholesale prices, and starting next year the company will select two employees and send crews to paint their houses for free.
"I think paint is one of the great things in life," said Eileen McComb, a spokeswoman for Benjamin Moore.
At Eli Lilly & Company, employees can get free Prozac: The health plan covers 100 percent of prescription drugs made by Lilly, while requiring a 20 percent co-payment on others.
And in this service economy, free stuff isn't everything. At the Great American Backrub stores in New York, the company's product, a massage, is free to the employees.
Rodale Press, publisher of Runner's World, Prevention, Organic Gardening and other health-related magazines and books, dispenses free health and fitness. At the gym on the company's campus in Emmaus, Pa., employees can choose from 25 classes, including aerobics, ballroom dancing and yoga. The company charters buses to take its runner-employees to races, pays their entry fees and puts them up in hotels if necessary.
For one big race in Manhattan, Rodale provides carbohydrates in the form of a seven-course dinner at the Supreme Macaroni Company. Workers can also rent bikes, fly-fishing equipment, snowshoes, scuba gear and in-line skates at $2 to $5 for a weekend.
THEN there's food. Domino's workers can order pizza at 35 percent off and receive a discount in the cafeteria at the company's headquarters in Ann Arbor, Mich.
Out in the franchises of McDonald's, most operators allow workers one small sandwich for a short shift, one big sandwich for a full shift. But McDonald's employees at the company headquarters don't get to eat free. They have to pay retail at the on-site outlet at the company campus in Oak Brook, Ill.
At the headquarters of Subway sandwich shops in Milford, Conn., employees eat free, getting, well, Subway fare, for both breakfast and lunch in the cafeteria.
"We don't just eat all day, so here's another thing," said Michele Klotzer, a spokeswoman. "Fred DeLuca, our owner, is a big movie fan, and once a month we go to a local movie theater, each employee and a guest, and see a recent film." This month, she said, it will be the new Tom Hanks movie, "That Thing You Do!"
Not all company perks can be easily shared with a friend.
Along with all the fitness-related perks, Rodale Press employees receive compost. The company sends wastepaper from its cafeteria to the town's leaf-composting facility, which allows Rodale employees to pick up the product free.
"I know it sounds funny, talking about compost as a perk," said Bob Martin, a company spokesman. "But if you're doing your yard, you know, you need tons of that stuff, and it adds up."

First-Rate Returns on Third-World Bond Funds

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON

 BODY:
CAN emerging-markets debt stage a three-peat?
Fixed-income mutual funds that specialize in Brady bonds and other debt of third-world nations were top performers in this year's second quarter, and they led the taxable fixed-income category again in the third, with double-digit advances. The reasons for that success, though, make it increasingly unlikely they can continue to outperform. 
 "These are bonds, not stocks," said Barton M. Biggs, global market strategist for Morgan Stanley. "It's statistically impossible for this asset class to do in the future what it's done in the recent past."
A torrid rally in third-world debt has seen the interest-rate premium that investors have demanded over United States Treasury bonds shrink to about 6 percentage points, on average, from 19 points at the market's nadir in March 1995, according to Mr. Biggs. With bond prices varying inversely to yields, values have doubled since the low, with 40 percent of those gains coming in the last 12 months.
To have them double again, investors would have to decide that third-world bonds were more secure than United States Government debt. That likelihood is zero.
But many experts say further advances are more than just possible.
"I wouldn't expect that the party's over," said Jim Forest, associate editor of the Bond Fund Report in Ashland, Mass. The devaluation of the Mexican peso, which precipitated the market's collapse in December 1994, was so unexpected that it sent investors reeling, and the result was a selling panic. But subsequent events have demonstrated resiliency in a number of underdeveloped nations, making their debt seem much less risky than it appeared a year ago, he said.
"It's a bit too early to give up on emerging-markets debt," said Simon Treacher, who manages $850 million of such securities for Morgan Grenfell Investment Services Ltd. in London. "The demand side is increasing. I see more and more interest in investing in emerging-markets debt as an asset class."
Emerging-market debt occupies a small and little-known corner of the fixed-income market, with a total market capitalization of about $180 billion, according to Morgan Stanley. Issuers are clustered primarily in Eastern Europe and Latin America. To overcome concerns about credit quality, currency translations and political risk, nations like Mexico and Argentina typically offer high long-term yields, on the order of 8 percent to 11 percent, according to Salomon Brothers Emerging Markets Research.
About $140 billion of this market, or more than three-quarters, is in Brady bonds, the United States-backed debt securities created at the end of the 1980's as part of the restructuring of Mexico's overwhelming foreign debt load. Mounting concerns about Mexico's debt problems prompted the Treasury, under then-Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, to step in to offer United States guarantees.
This assurance that principal would be repaid provided the foundation that led to the market's recovery, and Brady bonds have been used in other emerging markets since then. The bonds now represent, for instance, 83 percent of the portfolio of Bear Stearns Emerging Markets Debt Portfolio.
Unlike the bank loans they replaced, Brady bonds are "legal securities, which means liquidity goes up dramatically," said Ed Vaimberg, who manages a total of $60 million in two Bear Stearns emerging-market debt funds.
"They've become a very effective way for a broader array of investors to enter these countries," he said.
But liquidity isn't the only positive this market has enjoyed in the last year. Mexico itself has begun retiring Brady issues early with lower-yielding, uncollateralized debt of its own.
"We're seeing improving fundamentals in many of the countries, most of which have strengthened their economic reforms," said John Carlson, who manages a total of $670 million in seven emerging-market fixed-income funds at Fidelity Investments.
The return of confidence to the market is nowhere more obvious than in Russia. Its Vnesh series of restructured debts -- named for the Vnesh Ekonom Bank -- have doubled in the last year, despite the political uncertainty of the Russian elections earlier this year and, now, the health of President Boris Yeltsin.
Venezuela and Panama have also been leaders in price appreciation, leaving many larger nations, like Mexico and Argentina, with room to catch up, Mr. Carlson said. The two smaller economies have benefited from successful local financial reforms, said Mr. Vaimberg, and the movement of funds into these smaller markets has also had an outsized impact.
The state of the global economy is also favorable to emerging-market debt. With interest rates low in the United States, Germany and Japan, "typically money flows down the credit spectrum and out the yield curve" to the highest yields, Mr. Carlson noted.
For domestic investors, emerging-market debt also has an advantage in portfolio diversification over junk bonds, which are its rival for high yields. Corporate junk is closely linked to the business cycle, but the fortunes of emerging-market bonds are tied more directly to interest rates. In a recession, junk bonds can drop along with their issuers, whereas government bonds tend to rise in price as interest rates fall.
The debt of emerging-market countries can even diversify an equity portfolio, having performed quite differently recently than third-world equities. Much of the debt is denominated in United States dollars, so there is no foreign currency risk, Mr. Vaimberg noted, and many of these nations have policies intended to bring down inflation, which push up interest rates and hurt corporate earnings in the short run.
Emerging-market debt, Mr. Biggs said, "is disconnected from everything."
FINALLY, many emerging-markets specialists say the sector's small size will be a big plus as more investors discover it. "What we like about Brady bonds is that they are limited in size," Mr. Treacher said. "As more money chases the dragon, there isn't going to be any more supply." Indeed, if Europe achieves monetary union, the effect will be even fewer choices for fixed-income investors, as distinctions among the bonds of Germany, Italy and Spain are erased.
Volatility is likely to remain the signature characteristic of this market, however. "If you can't stand the heat, you shouldn't be in this kitchen," said Mr. Forest of Bond Fund Adviser. "But if your goal is to hold a diversified portfolio, having an allocation to these markets can reduce your overall risk."

HEADLINE: Too Loose? Or the Way to Go?

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW 

 BODY:
IN the last few years, New York City has become a hub of school reform, with the addition of more than 60 new public schools, the largest expansion of the system in half a century.
The vast majority are small high schools that in the words of the pioneers have "dropped the bucket." The bucket is full of educational conventions: 40-minute classes, standardized tests and an age-old curriculum that would have them teach "The Scarlet Letter" in 10th grade and "The Red Badge of Courage" in the 11th and race through thousands of years of history in a few semesters. 
 Now, with all the talk -- in Albany and elsewhere -- about more rigorous standards and a national curriculum, the political climate is decidedly unfriendly for unconventional schools.
"There's something eerie in the air," said Deborah Meier, who founded a movement that spawned dozens of alternative high schools. "There are more kids in poverty, fewer services to back them up, more difficult conditions in the schools, and we've decided we'll make them all take the 'tougher' curriculum. If that is going to produce more learning, somebody has a theory of human nature I haven't bumped into before."
It is still unclear exactly how the new push for higher standards will affect the alternative schools, but many progressive educators are nervous. Ms. Meier, who said she was frustrated by the slow pace of reform in the city, announced last week that she wanted to start a school in Boston.
Alternative schools still give basic state examinations in reading, writing and mathematics, but are exempt from giving examinations in subject areas like social studies and science. Now Albany has decided that starting in 2000 all public high school students must pass the more rigorous Regents examinations to earn a diploma. Unless the alternative schools can prove their alternative assessment techniques are as rigorous, they may be forced to join the Regents-dominated culture of the traditional schools.
The Regents exams themselves are changing to reflect a more open-ended style of testing that in some cases mirrors what some alternative schools are already doing to evaluate their students. For example, some of the Regents exams being phased in slowly over the next few years will assess collections of student work, or portfolios, and require students to perform tasks rather than answer multiple-choice questions.
The largest crop of small high schools emerged under the former Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, who, in an attempt to make high schools safer and smaller, turned to an alliance of city educators and secured financing from City Hall and the Board of Education. In September 1993, the Annenberg Foundation donated $25 million to the new schools.
Despite that support, progressive educators say they have always been at odds with the educational establishment.
"New York State is a top-down, examination-driven system, more than any other," said Stephen E. Phillips, superintendent of alternative high schools and programs. "There's an inherent clash in this state, and progressive education has never really been supported. Everybody will say, 'It's wonderful what you are doing with this new curriculum, but where are your Regents results?' "
He added: "One of the big myths in terms of curriculum is that if the teacher covered it, the kid got it. There's an assumption that if I had a lesson on Pearl Harbor, that something beneficial happened."
Among the new high schools, even those that belong to the same reform networks, there are stark differences in how they approach education. For example, included in the 38 city elementary and high schools that belong to the Coalition of Essential Schools, a national reform network based at Brown University, there is the Manhattan Village Academy, which follows a fairly traditional curriculum, and University Heights High School in the Bronx, which utterly rejects it.
City education officials have said that attendance has improved at the smaller schools, many of which were carved out of troubled larger high schools, and that they are substantially safer. They often attract students who struggled in traditional schools and who might have otherwise dropped out.
Because the schools are so new and typically shun the types of tests that traditional schools use to measure performance,
the academic results are still sketchy.
"There has to be some way to gauge the effectiveness of these schools," said Diane Ravich, a senior research scholar at New York University who supports a common curriculum for all schools. "I believe in small schools. But they have to have standards, and they have to be prepared to say, 'This is what we're doing' and then be prepared to be judged as to whether or not they have done it. You can't just give them public money and say, 'We'll trust you, here's the money and goodbye.' "
 
Take the Regents
Here are 10 of the 48 multiple choice questions from the June 1996 United States History and Government Regents Exam. The Regents exams set the academic standards for high schools and drive what is taught in traditional schools. Alternative schools can give the exams, and some do, but many reformers view them as obstacles to the learning process. The exams also have essay questions.

 1. "The only representatives of the people of these colonies are persons chosen therein by themselves; and that no taxes ever have been, or can be constitutionally imposed on them but by their respective legislatures."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
Will Fund Investors Prove to Be Faithful or Fickle?

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
WHEN Raymond DeVoe, market strategist for Legg Mason Wood Walker, visited Japan in 1989, he heard the same story at least two dozen times. "Everyone talked about how different Japanese investors were," he recalled last week. "They were in for the long term, and nothing would be likely to make them sell their stock investments."
Seven years later, the Japanese stock market is down 40 percent, and the amount of money in the Japanese version of mutual funds has fallen more than 90 percent. Instead of holding onto their stock funds, Japanese investors have cashed out, even as the Nikkei index rallied nearly 20 percent in the last year. 
 Now, with billions of dollars flowing each month into American mutual funds, United States fund investors are being characterized as the Japanese were several years ago. Americans will not flee their stock funds, the argument goes, because they know their historical performance and because they are investing for the long term.
As fresh evidence, some Wall Street analysts point to the most recent quarter, when cash poured in despite a downturn in stock prices in July.
But such a conclusion ignores several recent cases of investors' fleeing individual funds -- among them Fidelity Magellan, Strong Discovery and Van Wagoner Emerging Growth -- when performance did not live up to expectations. In addition, investors in Charles Schwab & Company's mutual fund marketplace quickly pulled money out of funds in July when the market's long bull run appeared threatened.
A longer view, too, shows that American fund investors, like their Japanese counterparts, have abandoned an entire asset class when performance lagged. Equity investors in the late 1970's and government bond investors in the last two years have continued to sell even after those investments returned to decent returns.
To be sure, there is little in the performance of equity funds in the third quarter to give investors much reason to flee. According to the fund trackers at Morningstar Inc., in Chicago, the average United States stock fund gained 2.55 percent in the quarter and 12.5 percent in the first nine months of 1996. International funds, by contrast, lost an average of a half of a percent in the quarter, lowering the year's returns to 9.6 percent.
Few on Wall Street expect the performance of the stock market to waver substantially the rest of the year, which means that fund companies are likely to continue to reap strong cash flows. But there is plenty of evidence that a significant portion of the people now flocking to mutual funds are an untested, if not unstable, group.
According to the Federal Reserve's quarterly "Flow of Funds" report, released last month, mutual funds held $1.25 trillion of equities at the end of June, up from $233 billion at the end of 1990. That means 80 percent of the money now invested in stock funds was not there during any significant downturn -- like the crash of 1987.
"That's really kind of mind-boggling," said Melissa Brown, quantitative analyst at Prudential Securities. "Most of the money invested in mutual funds has not gone through a bear market, so we really don't have a historical framework to determine whether individuals will stay put if we see a prolonged correction in the market. My guess is that they won't -- that they will be much more likely to pull their money out than the common wisdom would suggest."
David Kim says he will not be one headed for the exits. A 30-year-old investor who makes his living reading scripts for movie studios in Los Angeles, Mr. Kim made his first stock fund investments in July, moving about $7,000 from a Schwab money market account into three funds.
Looking at how his funds have performed so far, as well as at their one-year performance, Mr. Kim wants to invest more, particularly in Stein Roe Capital Opportunities, which has gained 49.6 percent in the last 12 months. He plans to do so by taking a cash advance of $1,500 on a credit card and using it to buy more fund shares.
Once he has the money in hand, Mr. Kim plans to transfer his card balance to a new credit card, which offers a low introductory interest rate of 5.9 percent for the first year. After a year, when the introductory rate expires, he intends to cash out of the fund or, if possible, roll over the loan to another card with a low rate.
Mr. Kim said he recognized that he could lose money, but the risk does not bother him. "I think that given the general upward trend of the market, the idea makes sense," he said. "I will give it three to six months, and if the fund is consistently going down over that time, I will cash out and pay off the principal." Thus, while he thinks the long-term prospects for stocks remain bright, Mr. Kim might jump in and out of the market at times.
Certainly, Mr. Kim does not fit the profile of the "average" mutual fund investor as compiled by the Investment Company Institute, a fund trade group. In July, the institute reported that, based on a random survey of 1,165 households, the average fund investor is middle class, 44 years old, has financial assets of $50,000 and bought his first fund shares before 1990 -- none of which would suggest that fund companies need to worry about the willingness of shareholders to move in and out of positions.
But fund companies could be fooling themselves if they do not recognize that they have an increasing number of shareholders like Mr. Kim. Investors certainly have demonstrated a growing interest in the ability to move assets quickly between traditional long-term investments -- stock and bond funds -- and cash accounts. So much so, in fact, that last year Charles Schwab instituted rules to discourage fund shareholders from making short-term trades.
Still, Schwab investors, who make up 8 percent of all mutual fund assets and 18 percent of those in funds sold without brokers, made net withdrawals of $754 million from domestic funds in July, part of a selloff that caused some concern. But nearly as much went back into those funds in August, which some analysts say is a credit to the great stabilizing factor among fund investors -- the retirement plan.
With a greater portion of today's fund investors putting money in tax-deferred plans, they probably will not cash out their investments entirely and buy consumer goods because of tax penalties. And investors love stock funds because equities have been the best long-term investment, said Avi Nachmany, an analyst at Strategic Insight, a New York consulting firm.
"There will have to be a great change in the societal climate to convince people that not only are there short-term risks in stocks, but long-term investment does not resolve those risks," he said. Mr. Nachmany does not foresee that happening anytime soon.
If it does happen, even 401(k) investors will find it easy to turn on a dime and move their money to what they see as the safest haven. In previous downturns, corporate pension managers oversaw the retirement money of millions of Americans; today the investors make the decisions.
Companies like Fidelity Investments, the largest provider of 401(k) retirement plans, allow investors to switch investments 24 hours a day, by telephone. In the case of one high-profile Fidelity fund, plenty of investors have made use of that service this year.
Roughly half of the $51.7 billion in the Fidelity Magellan fund, the country's largest mutual fund, comes through 401(k) plans -- presumably making those assets more stable than those of the average fund. But in the five months ended in August, as the fund fell 1.25 percent in value, investors withdrew $3.7 billion.
Numerous smaller funds have also suffered cash outflows, according to AMG Data Services, which reported a $4 billion outflow from equity funds in one week in mid-July. From mid-June through late September, the Wasatch Aggressive Growth fund suffered 15 consecutive weeks of net outflows, measuring $34.8 million, or 10 percent of assets. The Founders Special fund lost $38 million, or 9 percent of assets, to outflows, and the Strong Discovery fund saw $45.5 million, or about 7 percent of assets, leave the fund.
In each case, the withdrawals were on top of losses caused by the July market downturn. Even at the popular Van Wagoner Emerging Growth fund, which was flooded with money when it started last spring, more money flowed out than came in from mid-June through mid-September.
Using bad performance as an excuse to cash out is a basic element of investor psychology, said Kenneth Safian, an economist and investment analyst in White Plains. The same rules that governed behavior when individuals did most of their investing through individual stocks drive the actions of fund investors, he says.
The crash of 1987 was neither the first nor the worst period of redemptions by shareholders of American mutual funds. In the 96 months from November 1971 through October 1979, investors made net withdrawals from equity funds in every month but one, according to data from the Investment Company Institute. Not until November 1981 did investors put together two consecutive months of net inflows to stock funds -- even though the Standard & Poor's 500 rose in five of the six years from 1975 through 1980.
That experience parallels the cascade of withdrawals from Japanese mutual funds in recent years, said Steven Leuthold, president of the Leuthold Group, a market analysis and money management firm in Minneapolis. "The fact that the redemptions continued after the Japanese market started back up shows how human nature responds," he said.
American investors reacted the same way to a downturn in the bond market that started in early 1994, when the Federal Reserve embarked on a series of interest-rate increases. Since then, government bond funds have seen withdrawals in each month, despite a strong bond rally in 1995.
When it comes to stock funds, investors have not made net monthly withdrawals since September 1990. "When that much money comes into the market, any subsequent outflow will cause a big jolt to the market," Mr. Safian said. "It doesn't mean that all individuals will liquidate their fund holdings, but enough will to put a shock in the system."
SOME fund analysts do not buy the Japanese example. Mr. Nachmany, of Strategic Insight, said that, unlike stock funds here, Japanese investment trusts were marketed as trading vehicles with time horizons of a year or less. And he dismisses the notion that Americans' withdrawals from bond funds the last two years would be repeated at stock funds, pointing out that bond funds were not as widely held in retirement accounts.
If investors follow the course described by Mr. Nachmany, equity funds are not likely to suffer, and history will not be repeated. One investor who will not throw money blindly at stock funds, however, is Mr. Nachmany, who has a conservative penchant. "I always find reason to be in a money fund or in a balanced fund," which invests in both stocks and bonds, he said. "But I'm a terrible investor."

HEADLINE: AT THE GATE;
For Sabre Group, Some Long-Term Reservations

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
THE AMR Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines, will soon offer stock in Sabre Group, its successful airline-reservation business. But while the offering may be a good short-term buy, the prospects are less clear for the long-haul investor.
AMR expects to raise about $434 million with the issue, offering 20.2 million shares at an expected price of $20 to $23 a share. The proceeds will be used to repay debt to AMR and to finance Sabre's operations and expansion. AMR will retain an 84 percent interest in the company, along with 98 percent of the voting power. 
 Sabre's main attraction is a rare one among initial public offerings: the company dominates its market. More than 40 percent of all airline bookings through travel agents in the United States last year went through Sabre, making it by far the largest domestic distributor of travel arrangements, according to travel industry analysts and the offering documents.
Domestic and foreign airlines have formed several competing consortiums to try to imitate Sabre's success. Amadeus/System One is a joint effort of Air France, Continental Airlines, Iberia and Lufthansa, for example. But neither it nor any of the other ventures do nearly the volume of AMR's operation, analysts say.
Through Sabre, travelers can book reservations with more than 350 airlines, 55 car-rental agencies and 190 hotel companies. The company's pioneering system, which was founded as an in-house operation in 1960 and went commercial in 1976, includes more than 29,000 travel agency locations in more than 70 countries. The network's scope is so large, said Mark Basham, who analyzes new issues for Standard & Poor's, that Sabre is "a very important part of the transportation system in the U.S."
The company's dominance shows up on the bottom line, and that's why Mr. Basham -- who often favors companies with the largest share of their markets -- recommends the stock. In 1995, the company's earnings increased to $225.9 million on revenues of $1.53 billion, compared with earnings of $197.2 million on revenues of $1.41 billion the previous year. That's 15 percent annual earnings growth.
Sabre's size should also be a big advantage as it embarks on its ambitious growth plans. It hopes to push into Asia and to increase its European and Latin American presence. It has a business-consulting operation, too, and wants to expand that service into railroads, financial services and other industries that -- like airlines -- require the tracking and updating of large amounts of data. Sabre also plans to commit more than $100 million during the next five years to upgrading its technology and making other operating improvements.
Sabre stock seems reasonably priced, too. At its expected offering price, the company would be selling at 15.5 times its estimated earnings for the current fiscal year. Since there are no other stand-alone airline-reservations companies, Mr. Basham suggests that Sabre be compared with concerns like First Data, a $4 billion company that processes credit-card transactions. At Friday's close, First Data's stock was trading at 32 times earnings. The comparison is rough because the companies are in different industries, but Sabre's price level does not look unduly high.
There are factors, though, that could bring Sabre some turbulence.
For one, Sabre's market dominance is not assured. "Competition to attract and retain travel-agent subscribers is particularly intense," the company says in its S.E.C. filing; Sabre would be "materially adversely affected" if a large number defected to competitors. And even without such losses, competition might compel Sabre to lower the fees it charges agents, also hurting the bottom line.
Airlines can now sell tickets on the Internet without travel agents, and it is unclear whether Sabre will dominate the new turf of on-line reservations the way it dominates its traditional business. Although Sabre recently introduced an on-line system, it faces formidable competitors like American Express and Microsoft, which announced an alliance in July to provide an on-line corporate reservations service.
Another challenge for Sabre -- and a threat to travel agents -- is ticketless purchasing, said Robert Mescal, an analyst with New Issues, a newsletter of the Institute for Econometric Research in Deerfield, Fla. In this fare system, travelers make telephone reservations directly with the airline and present an identification card at the gate. The procedure never requires a paper transaction.
And while Sabre generates lots of cash, unlike many new issues it cannot count on the money raised in the initial offering to help it fight these battles. That is because about 85 percent of the $434 million raised will be used to pay off Sabre's debts to AMR.
Sabre still dominates its field, and Mr. Mescal knows it. But he is less certain that the company will, in the long run, remain profitable enough to make the big investments necessary to prevail against all this competition. "I am limiting my interest to five years," he said.

HEADLINE: Forget Pearl Harbor

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW 

 BODY:
THE eight teachers walked into a hot and stuffy classroom on the fourth floor of University Heights High School in the Bronx and, as always, they were in for a pressure-cooker afternoon. They took their seats at a round brown table, arranged their favorite books, videos and photocopied packets in a stack in front of them and began to wrestle with the question: What should the students know?
"This is our chance to grab them, entice them and seduce them," said Evelyn Birnbaum, one of the teachers. "If we lose this one, it's going to be hard to get it back." 
 Time was running out for the humanities team, in charge of devising a plan to teach English and social studies to 300 students. They had two hours to decide what to cover during the first six weeks of the school year, but it was already the second day of classes. They knew they would spend the year teaching a course called "Is Power Good or Bad?" But the plan was vague, the nitty-gritty still to come.
There was tension at the table. It started with the reading list -- one teacher had written out her selections, calling it a bibliography of revolutionary writers. The list contained some urban high school staples -- Richard Wright's "Black Boy," "The Autobiography of Malcolm X." But another teacher wanted more classics, less ideology. Machiavelli made it -- something from "The Prince," but what about Locke? Hobbes? A new teacher was a little jarred by some of the violence in the readings; one began with a rape, another with a gang rape.
Then there was Theodore Daniel, a social studies teacher by training, who was quiet during the meeting but said later that he thought it was ridiculous to study power without looking at the American Revolution. As a matter of fact, so far the team's curriculum included no history at all.
"I'm struggling," said Mr. Daniel, who just began his second year at University Heights. "I don't want to shortchange anybody's kid."
Mr. Daniel and his colleagues teach at an alternative high school because they share a belief that the old way of doing things is not working. They teach at University Heights, one of the growing number of alternative schools in the city, because they believe that the thousands of students who flounder at traditional high schools struggle because the schools fail them. They joined the ranks of the reformers because they wanted to be free of a rigid educational bureaucracy that would force them to cover Pearl Harbor, the periodic table, Shakespeare and other staples of the traditional American high school curriculum.
But, as a month with the humanities team at University Heights revealed, the frontier of reform is frazzled. It is a high-stakes journey of clashing agendas, compromise, exhilaration and frustration. What was perhaps most striking about the discussions in Room 425, was that the teachers at one of the city's most radical alternative schools, in the University Heights section of the Bronx, are as divided over what to teach as the warring factions in the raging national debate over academic standards.
Sometimes the teachers struggle within themselves. Mr. Daniel, for one, lives with a constant internal conflict about how to engage the teen-agers while making sure they know certain things, like spelling and American history.
"We've turned the bucket over," said Mr. Daniel, who is 34 and lives a kind of double life: he also teaches night courses in economics -- traditional style -- at Park West High School in Manhattan. "We're talking about a radical departure. We went really far. At one point, I wondered if we had gone too far, and I argued that we should come back."
One day Mr. Daniel and a colleague, who teach a course together, handed back essays their students had been asked to write on the power of guns. Mr. Daniel had circled grammatical errors in red ink on the papers he graded, but his partner had simply written "revise" on his. Mr. Daniel is adamant that mistakes should be corrected, but his partner was practicing a theory shared by other teachers that focusing on grammar would stifle the students' creativity.
"Some teachers don't like to hear the word 'grammar,' " he said. "Some teachers have completely swallowed whatever this new vision is. But we can correct grammar, we can put a little more emphasis on content and we can still call ourselves alternative. I don't think that sits well with everyone."
Over the last month, as the humanities team planned and improvised, struggled and debated, each member took on a specific role in the group. Some pushed ideology; others wanted to talk logistics. Mr. Daniel, who is from St. Kitts and Nevis in the Caribbean, was never confrontational during the meetings, but he would consistently mumble a mantra: "What about economic, social and political power?"
No one questioned that the school's theme this year, "Power: What it is good for," was a good one -- meaty, controversial, political. It seemed an ideal way to weave together the different subjects. The math and science team could develop a unit on solar power, the services and health team would look at the question "can the power of one make a difference?" and planned to link the high school students with elementary school children they could tutor and mentor. For the humanities team, there were Presidential elections to study and a widely publicized police brutality case to investigate, and the students had shown a strong interest in the plight of Mumia Abu-Jamal, a black radio journalist on death row for the 1981 killing of a Philadelphia police officer.
For all the teachers, there was also the obvious hook of a curriculum on power, which some teachers refer to as the "objective reality" of the school: the students, black and Hispanic youths from some of the city's poorest neighborhoods, are often powerless in the system.
 
 
 
A Freedom in Approach; What the Critics Say
 At the core of the school's philosophy is the belief that the way to engage students who were turned off by traditional schools -- many had a history of poor attendance and low grades -- is to make the curriculum relevant to their lives. They might look at the history of the Bronx and skip much of American history, or teach the novels of Sandra Cisneros and Toni Morrison and ignore the literary canon. They teach one subject, or theme, in depth, rather than covering many, and often choose controversial topics.
"We want our kids to be able to pose questions, as well as solve problems," said Kiran Chaudhuri, who has taught at the school for five years, "so we frame things as provocatively as possible. You need to start where the kids are. One of our primary purposes is to help them make sense of their own lives."
But critics of that approach say that it deprives students of the opportunities provided at traditional schools. Teaching current events at the expense of history, for example, is shortsighted, they say.
"I know that people say history is one damn fact after another, but the world didn't begin yesterday," said Diane Ravitch, a senior research scholar at New York University. "It sounds to me like this is something that's good enough for the ghetto kids, but not for the middle class kids. Some of these schools are experimenting with the children of the poor. The real challenge to the alternative school is to take the traditional content and make it exciting."
Some alternative schools continue to teach a traditional high school curriculum, but University Heights, which opened 10 years ago on the campus of Bronx Community College, took a decidedly radical route. At University Heights, there are no individual subjects. The teachers are generalists: a math teacher can give a class on history, an English teacher might instruct a lesson on physics. There are no bells, no clocks, no tests and no grading, although sometimes students request grades. Students in the high school, ages 16 to 21, are not separated into grade levels. The school also has a middle school that enrolls about 60 students.
Students graduate when they have demonstrated mastery of five "domains," or measurements of achievement that students and staff have agreed on. The domains are communicating, crafting and reflecting; working together and resolving conflicts; recognizing patterns and making connections; taking responsibility for myself and my community, and critical thinking and ethical decision making.
Often, it seems that teaching at University Heights is a constant experiment, educational improvisation in which the response of the audience -- the students -- is crucial to how the curriculum writers proceed. That, too, is part of the philosophy.
"Curriculum, at its best in our school, gets made in the classroom, through teachers and students collaborating," said Ms. Chaudhuri.
 
HB>From Scribbled Notes To the Classroom
 The humanities curriculum, a plan that will guide the teaching of English and social studies for the year, began to take shape in late August. The team got together and scrawled some notes on a white sheet of paper that included these potential lessons: "How powerful am I?", "Oct. 22 police brutality protest" and "news story -- analyze power." They met several more times before school started to brainstorm and, in keeping with the commitment to "start with the student," agreed to begin with a unit on personal power.
But by Sept. 5, the second day of school, the students were back and, several teachers were still unsure exactly what they were supposed to be teaching. "I feel like I'm flying by the seat of my pants," Miguel A. Garcia, a humanities teacher, said that day as he walked down the fourth-floor corridor between classes.
Later that day, at the curriculum planning session in room 425, the team met to plan the unit on personal power, which they had decided would focus on the role of the individual in the family and in society but would also include a look at violence. Not everyone was happy with the violence section. While some felt it had plenty of relevance to students living in tough neighborhoods, others thought that was exactly why they should not study it. Give the students a break from all that, they thought.
Hazel Joseph-Roseboro, a soft-spoken 24-year-old English teacher who grew up a few blocks from the school and graduated from University Heights, had decided Toni Morrison's "The Bluest Eye," was ideal for the unit because it touched on the family power structure. Ron White, the new teacher in the group who used to be a stockbroker, said he saw the literary merits of the Morrison book but was troubled by the rape scene at the beginning of the story. "It concerns me that we're grabbing attention in this way," he said. "Is this the only way we get students involved?"
Ms. Chaudhuri, the English teacher who had written up the reading list, was interested in getting the students to write personal memoirs. "Let's get the kids to find the politicizing moments of their childhood," she said.
Mr. Garcia, who wears his long gray hair tied back in a ponytail, was slightly uncomfortable with the reading list because there were no classical works on power, and he was frustrated because his eyeglasses were broken. He had to leave the session early, and rushing out of the classroom, he turned to the group, squinted and said half jokingly, "Put Homer on there."
They laughed, and he did not say then that the absence of classics on the reading list was bothering him. When Ms. Chaudhuri learned later that he was concerned about it, she sounded annoyed and said, "He used the word 'classics'?"
Mr. Garcia was not the only one who sometimes found himself yearning to teach something that might make more dogmatic colleagues bristle. Mr. White, a former stockbroker who later went to work in a homeless shelter before going into teaching, had never taught in an alternative school before. Mr. White, 54, said that when he discovered his students did not know what a contraction was, he had the urge to teach a basic grammar lesson.
"You know -- nouns, verbs, adjectives -- I was reluctant to say it," he said. "And I'm almost apologetic for saying this, but I feel that I'm a product of a really great traditional education. When you say that, though, you better be pretty thick-skinned."
He continued: "I think these kids will graduate from high school without really knowing about the Civil War or World War II or the Berlin Wall or the Vietnam War, about how government works -- the Senate, the House of Representatives, who becomes Speaker of the House.
"When I graduated high school, I had this general information so I could play 'Jeopardy.' But after all is said and done, what is the purpose of an education? To help us cope in an increasingly sophisticated world. It's about relationships, and we'll talk about that and maybe they'll be able to relate better in their families. Maybe they'll be more responsible citizens. Maybe they will see the importance of voting," he said.
Mr. Garcia, who has a background in business and acting and a master's degree in Spanish from N.Y.U., described his brief stint at a traditional high school as "horrendous" because it was so large.
In his five years at University Heights, he said he has been "satisfied, even through the ups and downs," but lately, he said he has begun to worry that the curriculum has veered too far from the mainstream. "I would like to see some things that do not subordinate everything to an ideology. I'd like them to read classics, I'd like them to have classes," he said, emphasizing the word as if it were a foreign concept.
"We are certainly taking a different road," he said. "And we'll see where we go with it. I hope that we can iron a lot of these things out and come up with something good. It's exhausting and frustrating to be constantly racing toward something new."
 
 
 
Doubts, Confusion And Working It Out
 Mr. Garcia could often be heard during the curriculum planning sessions over the past month asking the group, "What is our purpose?" And often, that question was never answered clearly. What was called collaboration among teachers often seemed more like group therapy and, like counseling, sometimes the sessions did more to open wounds than to heal. Often, teachers left the meetings confused and frustrated about a lack of direction, or over having to give up subjects they wanted to cover.
"I'm feeling a little down," Mr. Daniel said on Sept. 3, after the team had met. "I don't know exactly where this is going."
On Sept. 11, Alan Hilliard, the teacher who was leading the planning meetings, began the session by saying: "I've been hearing some concerns that people are feeling out there, by themselves. We don't seem to have a firm thing going on. And I think Ron needs some support."
A few minutes later, Mr. Garcia, still struggling with the broken eyeglasses said, "Can I ask the purpose? Is it that we gather here to come up with a unified curriculum for all of us to share?"
Paul Allison, the school's director of curriculum and assessment who was sitting in on the meeting, said, "You can do your own thing, but if you do, it's got to be better than what we've come up with."
Mr. Hilliard said, "Of course, individuals can put a twist on this."
Mr. White said, "I was doing my own thing."
Mr. Daniel said, "I really want us to look at economic, political and social power."
Ms. Birnbaum said, "I'm not sure what social power is."
Ms. Joseph-Roseboro said, "I thought we were talking about social justice."
Mr. Farnham said, "Don't forget our essential question, 'Is power good or bad?' "
Mr. Daniel said: "I feel I'm being robbed. This is overwhelmingly an English curriculum."
Over the first several weeks of school, the teachers generally followed the topic of personal power, hammering out the details in the teams of three that teach two-hour seminars. Mr. White did teach his grammar lesson and reported that it was well received -- by students and colleagues. Ms. Joseph-Roseboro did not get a chance to teach "The Bluest Eye" but felt satisfied with her lessons on essay writing.
As for Mr. Daniel, he twice approached the humanities team with a complete social studies lesson, one he had worked up on the United States Constitution and another that would have the students investigate "powerful people," like Nelson Mandela, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. or George Washington. The team wanted to postpone those topics and stick to the focus on personal power and writing, but they promised to add more social studies later, he said.
"I decided to play nice boy and go along with them," Mr. Daniel said. "But if I need to, I'll rock the boat."
When the trial of a police officer accused of murdering a Bronx man began -- a seemingly perfect opportunity to teach the students about the judicial system and the city -- Mr. Daniel reluctantly organized a trip to the court. He feared that without a lesson on the law, the activity would seem out of context.
"It didn't go very well," he said. "They just didn't have a grounding in the legality of the courtroom. They kept saying the judge was being rude and I kept trying to get them to identify the symbols of power in the courtroom. It was a dilemma because I was mindful that this was a case they were interested in, but they weren't ready."
Did Mr. Daniel give up on the American Revolution? "Not one bit," he said. "I'll get to it, and this is where I may have to depart from the team."
The other week, the team members met to decide what to teach for the rest of the semester. First, they debated whether the next unit would focus on the Presidential elections (some argued over whether voting makes enough of a difference to use it in the curriculum), more police brutality or, as Mr. Daniel suggested, the power struggles of other nations. But right up until the final moments of the one-and-a-half-hour meeting, they still did not know.
Then, with 10 minutes to go, Ms. Birnbaum said, "I don't know if this will work, but what about New York City?"
There was a silence. Then teachers started to nod. New York City seemed to be able to satisfy all the agendas at the table. They could teach history, immigration, economics, religion, cultural institutions and New York writers. The students, the teachers hoped, would be interested in their own city. Then there are the sweatshops, the workfare debate and, as one teacher pointed out, October is the "month of resistance," and there were nonviolent protests coming up.
"I'll go for it," Mr. Daniel said. "New York is the mecca of history."
He paused and added: "So I guess there's some method to the madness. New York gave us everything we wanted."
Ms. Birnbaum said: "I love New York. Let's end this meeting."

HEADLINE: No Time for Fashion;
As the Way of All Flesh Goes South

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE C. R. WHITE 

 BODY:
WOMEN, particularly baby boomers whose acquisitiveness in the last two decades brought boom times to the fashion industry, are revising their values: they're not cutting them to fit this year's fashions.
This attitudinal shift is related largely to the changing bodies and psyches of baby boomers, who have been a significant part of the market. Women are investing less in clothes and more in the real fabric of their lives -- children, health care, careers, vacations and financial security. The trend is also in part a reaction against a fashion industry that, in recent years, has become its own worst enemy, casting about with peculiar trends like grunge, transparent shirts and an endless parade of styles from decades past. Pants, a kind of white flag sent up by designers unable to fathom customers, are ubiquitous in fall catalogues and store advertising. 
 "The reason fashion missed the boat is that everything was too tight," said Carol Farmer, president of C. F. Associates, a trend research company in Boca Raton, Fla. "It was body-shaping fashion that was not respectful of a boomer body. What does the baby boomer want? Certainly not polyester doubleknit, the stuff we grew up in."

 
 
Comfort Over Style
 As boomers have aged, spending on apparel has decreased and more goes to services, said economist Carl Steidtmann, in his recent report for Management Horizons, the research arm of Price Waterhouse L.L.P. Apparel spending peaked in 1978 with baby boomers between the ages of 15 and 24, he said. Those consumers are now 33 to 42.
In a 1994 survey by Management Horizons, which tracks buying patterns and shopping attitudes, consumers said they cared less about fashion and more about value than in the past. The study also found that consumer spending on apparel has fallen steadily for the last 16 years. Though some designers are adjusting by offering more relaxed, inexpensive clothes, and there has been a slight but uneven increase in sales since last year's dismal Christmas, demand overall is sluggish.
Giorgio Armani, profiled in New York magazine last month, declared fashion finished. The system, he said, had broken down. Mr. Armani is correct: Women no longer follow the dictates of designers or fashion editors, the traditional disseminators of the message.
But fashion magazines, bent on pushing never-too-rich, never-too-thin fantasy while readers have moved toward a relaxed reality, share some responsibility for women's lack of interest in fashion. The disconnect between editorial content and advertising, flights of fancy and the real world, is evident in most of the magazines.
What message was to be gleaned from the cover of the September issue of Vogue, with two models draped in semi-transparent, mustard-colored slip dresses? Inside editorial pages displayed expensive, overwrought concepts like matadors and bullfighting. Even when allowing for magazine-speak about playing to readers' aspirations, the images looked out of touch next to advertising showing the new, uncomplicated and moderately priced clothes available in stores.
Vogue's biggest September advertisers were fragrance and cosmetic companies like Revlon and casual, less expensive clothing retailers like Lee Jeans and Tommy Hilfiger, which bought a record 22 pages. As for the top-of-the-line retailers, most put their money on accessories.
While fashion falters, other industries are capitalizing on women's mature shapes as well as their new mood. The travel business offers more adventure trips and family-oriented vacations. Women's participation in adventure travel rose from 54 percent in 1985 to 63 percent in 1995, according to Kathryn Cooney, president of Overseas Adventure Travel, a trade group based in Cambridge, Mass. At Woods Women Inc., a travel society in Minneapolis specializing in women's travel, participants have jumped from 400 in 1986 to 1,100 so far this year, said Denise Mitten, executive director.
Spas are marketing themselves as stress relievers rather than the weight-loss centers of a decade ago. Women's use of commercial gyms jumped 108 percent, to 3.6 million, between 1987 and 1995, according to the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association.
Publishers are churning out "The Celestine Prophecy," "The Tenth Insight" and other books meant to help boomers plumb their spiritual depths. Car companies have introduced dozens of sport utility vehicles in the last three years, the better for boomers to express their rugged individualism.
Even the number of nail salons nationwide has shot upward. Seven years ago 900 nail technicians were registered with the Korean Nail Salon Association in the New York, Westchester and Long Island area; today 6,000 are.
 
 
 
Dividing a Smaller Pie
 As the many baby boomers turn 50 this year, biology is shaping women's response to fashion. Clothes that promote sexual attraction and reproduction are, it seems, fundamentally different from those suited to cocooning and reaching maturity in a career or relationship.
A decade hence, a new wave of young people 15 to 24 years old -- today's baby boomlet -- may spark a surge of interest in fashion again, said Mr. Steidtmann of Management Horizons. Meanwhile, women's complacency, if not inertia, about fashion is likely to continue.
Women have not stopped buying clothes, but the industry will have to adjust to dividing a smaller pie as fashion moves to the outer nebulae of its customers' lives.

HEADLINE: Word for Word/U.S. Army Training Manuals;
Be All That You Can Be: Your Future as an Extortionist

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
THROUGH the 1980's, the United States Army trained Latin American police and military officers in techniques that the Pentagon now acknowledges were "clearly objectionable and possibly illegal": torture, extortion, censorship, false arrest, execution and the "neutralizing" of enemies.
These lessons appeared in some of the Army's training manuals, manuals that were used at the School of the Americas, a military academy at Fort Benning, Ga., and that were distributed in Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala and Peru to help governments threatened by leftist rebellions. 
 The Army compiled the manuals in 1987 using lesson plans used since 1982. Those lessons, in turn, were based on what the Pentagon called "old material" from the 1960's.
The Pentagon pulled the manuals from circulation in 1991 after an internal investigation turned up at least two dozen objectionable passages in six manuals. It has since destroyed the manuals on hand, except for one copy of each for its records, but an internal report noted that it was doubtful the Army could retrieve all of "as many as 1,000 copies" distributed over the years.
The disclosure has reignited a debate over the School of the Americas, whose students have included military leaders implicated in human rights abuses. The critics of the school, like Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d of Massachusetts, are now intensifying their demands that it close.
With titles like "Revolutionary War and Communist Ideology" and "Terrorism and the Urban Guerrilla," the manuals, which the Pentagon has made available for public scrutiny, have a dry, almost antiseptic style. But they recall the roiling political divisions of the cold war, when the United States willingly overlooked some abuses in Latin America.
The following excerpts come from a manual called "Handling of Sources," translated from Spanish by the Pentagon. The passages in italics are those the Pentagon identified as violations of American policies or principles. The spelling mistakes have been corrected. The term "employee" means "informant." The abbreviation "C.I." stands for counterintelligence. STEVEN LEE MYERS
 
Obtaining and Utilization of Employee We can define the "employee" as that person who renders his services in exchange of remuneration or compensation. Since the insurrection movements could emerge in different zones of economic, political and geographic influence, the Government is not able to depend only on the information provided voluntarily by faithful citizens or information obtained involuntarily from insurgents who have been captured.
A deserter . . . could be more or less certain that there will be no reprisals against him if all other members of his cell (who are the only ones who know that he was part of this cell) are eliminated by the government security forces. This circumstance could be used to persuade insurgent deserters to provide information to the Government.

Locating the Employee The C.I. agent must not discard the possibility of employing women. Women should be employed in some situations, while in others, they could be used with greater effectiveness than men. Remember that women are, as a rule, more emotional than men, but there [is] no difference in their intelligence.

Experience has shown that information obtained on the basis of fear is unreliable. . . . In addition, if an individual has been recruited using fear as a weapon, the CI agent must be in a position of maintain[ing] the threat.

The possibilities of finding persons willing to collaborate with the Government, in the place where an insurrection movement is developing, are immense. Specific individuals, organizations and commercial companies must be the object of infiltration by government employees, in order to obtain information about the guerrillas.

The C.I. agent must offer presents and compensation for information leading to the arrest, capture or death of guerrillas.

Placement of Employees A vital part of this program is the educational system tending to indoctrinate and recompense government employees who inform when a guerrilla element approaches them and tries to recruit them. The C.I. agent could cause the arrest or detention of the employee's parents, imprison the employee or give him a beating as part of the placement plan of said employee in the guerrilla organization.

The C.I. agent could increase the employee's value [in] destroying the structure of the guerrilla organization around said employee. This could be done by means or arrests, executions or pacification taking care not to expose the employee as the information source. If the employee is one of the few survivors, he could be a key member in a new or different guerrilla organization. Also the employee's reputation could be strengthened in this occasion by means of story fabrication, documents and witnesses, who are not only credible but also difficult to refute, since there will be very few guerrillas that have survived.
There are other methods of providing external assistance in order to assure the promotion of an employee. A method of achieving this promotion is by influencing an employee who has a much higher position in the guerrilla organization, another is to eliminate a potential rival among the guerrillas.

Scrutiny of Employees The ancient Romans had a saying "in vino veritas," there is truth in wine -- with that they wanted to say that a drunk man reveals his true thoughts and his real reactions. If we observe our employee drinking or in a drunken state, we could learn much about him.

I am going to mention some of the mechanical methods to test, which could be used under certain extenuating circumstances. Sodium pentathol compound, which is an anesthetic and hypnotic drug . . . could be intravenously injected and would have results of a "truth serum." . . . Another method that can be used is hypnotism.

Separation of Employees If the agent suspects he could have difficulty in separating an employee, it will be necessary to fabricate a reason to convince the employee that the separation is to his advantage. That could convince the employee that he has been compromised by the guerrillas. That continuing working for the Government could result in serious consequences for the employee and his family. If the employee does not believe this story, other measures could be taken to convince him, placing anonymous telegrams or sending anonymous letters. Many other techniques could be used which are only limited by the agent's imagination.

In the majority of cases, the purpose of the informal separation technique will be to have the employee "placed on the black list" by all government agencies, or threaten to expose himself or admit his activities, or bring about his removal by means of imprisonment, threat of imprisonment or voluntary or forced re-establishment. The methods that have to be used in informal separations must be carefully planned and approved by higher authority before being applied. . . . Threats should not be made unless they can be carried out and the employee realizes that such threats could be carried out. There are many disadvantages in the use of threats of physical violence or true physical abuse.

UNEMPLOYMENT
Made-to-Order Statistics
Are the gods of statistics all Democrats? It certainly seems that way this year, for any President trying to be re-elected could not ask for better economic numbers. Even before Friday, all systems were humming, with the only possible flaw being that the economy might be heating up a bit too fast. But the jobs data took care of that with a stroke: unemployment up slightly, to 5.2 percent, and payroll jobs falling for the first time in eight months. To economists -- if not to people who lost jobs -- those are dream numbers. ("There is something for everyone in today's report," said Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich -- but not for Republicans.) The stock market duly did a little jig, with the Dow industrials heading tantalizingly close to (yawn) yet another barrier: 6,000. If things keep going this way, it won't be worth commenting on until it hits a round 10,000. But in case you've forgotten, it is possible for stocks to fall, too.
 
WIRELESS PHONES
P.C.S. Is Here, Sort Of
What? More high-tech lingo to cram into your overstuffed brain? Yes, like it or not, you'll have to get used to a new set of initials: P.C.S. That stands for "personal communications services," and it's the latest thing in wireless phones -- lighter phones, longer-lasting batteries, better sound quality. P.C.S. isn't exactly here yet, though it's coming soon. But last week AT&T decided to simply act as if it were here, introducing -- with trumpets blaring -- its new Digital PCS. True, the service is digital -- the signal is in computer code. But it's not true P.C.S. As one rival put it, "It's the same old AT&T in a new kimono."
 
HEALTH CARE
Poor? Old? Don't Get Sick
Many things in life are better if you're not too poor and not too old. Now you can add H.M.O. care to that list. A report out last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association said that while average patients did fine in managed-care plans, the poor and the elderly fared markedly worse. Maybe "we are going much too fast," one health expert said. "The market may not be ready for these patients." Of course, "average" people have few health problems; it's the ones on the margin who matter. People skeptical about H.M.O.'s could find a little solace in another bit of news last week: The stock of HCIA lost nearly half its value in a day on a poor earnings forecast. HCIA, among other things, advises H.M.O.'s about how long someone with a given ailment should stay in a hospital.
 
SHIPBUILDING
Subsidies That Won't Die
America, poor America, just loves to wail about unfair trade practices -- about how those other guys always do nasty, underhanded things to try to steal our quite ample lunch. The playing field must be level, we say. Just look at shipbuilding: Foreign countries pour billions into subsidizing this industry, so Americans don't stand a chance. So for six long, arm-twisting years American negotiators hammered away at this supposed inequity, and a deal was within a whisker of being ratified. But then some people suddenly said, "Oh, you mean it applies to us, too?" A level playing field is one thing, but not being able to help your local shipbuilding friends was just not acceptable, and the deal unraveled. So while human welfare is being cut back, corporate welfare is alive and grinning. (And surely election-year politics has nothing to do with it.)
 
AUTO SALES
Ovals and All, It's No. 1
Reports of the Taurus's death were premature. Ford came out with that wild redesign last year, with so many ovals -- from windows to dashboard -- that it's a wonder the wheels were round. But the car didn't sell too well at first, and Ford fretted that -- horrors! -- the Taurus wouldn't be the top-selling car any more. So it offered all sorts of incentives and rebates, everything except stopping people on the street and handing them wads of bills to take a test drive. Well, it worked, for when the model year ended on Sept. 30, Ford had sold some 378,000 Tauruses, edging out the Honda Accord. (Does that mean there's more bull than harmony this year?) But is the Taurus the No. 1 vehicle? Of course not. Ford's full-size pickup always wins that race, though provincial New Yorkers can never quite figure out who buys them.
 
GERMANY
Promised Land No More?
Americans straggling back from two- or three-week vacations sometimes think longingly of places like Germany. Now that, they say, is a civilized country: everyone, by law, gets six weeks off. And that's just part of a package that also features generous sick pay -- full salary for up to six weeks a year. But that haven may be about to vanish: last week corporate Germany started scaling back those benefits by trimming sick pay by 20 percent. With a single European currency due to arrive in 1999, the previous generosity may be an unaffordable luxury. But German workers are not giving up these goodies lightly, taking to the barricades in mass protests.
 
WCBS SHAKEUP
Don't Touch That Remote!
Well, the truth is out -- and a sad truth it is. TV executives, with no illusion that they'll always come up with scintillating programs, know that America's couches are chock-full of stupefied viewers who are not entirely sure where their TV's "off" button is. So the goal, as a CBS executive put it, is merely "to try to stop giving people a reason not to watch." But in New York, WCBS's happy-talk news -- actually, "local news" is the formal term -- has not even been able to meet that rather depressing goal, at least not enough to satisfy the bean counters. The station's response: kill the messengers. Last week it shocked viewers and people in the industry by dismissing seven top anchors and reporters, including high-profile types like Michelle Marsh and John Johnson. Since "Seinfeld" reruns usually beat the 11 o'clock news, maybe it should hire Kramer to read the weather.
 
TAKING MANHATTAN
Kmart Shrinks to Fit
Kmart came to Manhattan last week, but it wasn't easy. Its tractor-trailers, you see, are 13 feet high, but Manhattan -- in bridge and tunnel terms, anyway -- is a 10-foot-6 city. Not to worry: Kmart was so determined to take Manhattan that it lopped two and a half feet off some of its trucks. So it's really here, going "where no Kmart has gone before," in the words of the manager of the new store next to Penn Station. The questions now: Can it sell enough to pay sky-high Manhattan rents? Will jaded Manhattanites turn their noses up at this symbol of plain-vanilla suburbia? Or are New Yorkers people, too -- as enamored of warehouse bargains as their mini-vanned cousins? Take note, though: if you want guns (even toy ones) or huge bags of fertilizer, don't go to 34th Street.
 
POVERTY WAGES
A Bit Less Minimal
In terms of the overall economy, the minimum wage has become nearly irrelevant -- mainly because it got so low that few employers could pay it and still sleep at night. In all the Reagan years, the wage was unchanged, which means, of course, that it was drastically eroded by inflation. So when the latest increase finally took effect last week, from $4.25 an hour to $4.75, the experts barely blinked -- even after all the dire warnings of bankruptcies and mass layoffs. But was it a nonevent? Certainly not for the 4.2 million people who received automatic raises. Few people would scoff at a 12 percent raise, but if you're subsisting well below the poverty level, it could be a godsend. (The minimum wage would have to rise to $7.80 for a worker to lift a family of four to the poverty threshold of $15,600 a year.)

Negative Ads Don't Work Here

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: ULAAN BAATAR, Mongolia

 BODY:
DEMOCRACY is still relatively new here in the land of grassy plains and animal herders, so it's full of surprises.
Like the results of this year's election. Virtually everyone here predicted an easy victory for the ruling party, a bunch of still-in-office Communists, when election day came on June 30. They were running against a young and disorganized batch of newcomers who, describing themselves as democrats, had little government experience and less expectation of getting any. The opposite happened. 
 The reason everyone was so off-base is another nice surprise, at least to anyone jaded by the over-analyzed Presidential contest going on now in the United States: Little polling was done, and the few polls that were conducted got little attention.
"Why look at a poll?" asked Delgermaa, a young woman who won a seat in Parliament (and who like many Mongolians uses only one name). "We all knew who was going to win. We were just wrong."
A larger surprise is that the transition has gone so smoothly. The ruling People's Revolutionary Party stepped aside gracefully, making way for the newly elected Democratic Union. The new Government has now drawn up a sweeping reform program, which was introduced to the new legislature last week.
Negative campaigning was a new blemish, but Americans sick of attack ads may be happy to know that here the technique mostly backfired. Delgermaa believes that a big reason she won was that her opponent accused her of giving away free flour and rice to voters. Never mind that Delgermaa admitted it was true. "Mongolians hate negative campaigning," she said. "They think it shows a weak spirit."
It is tempting to romanticize the democratic change under way. The new ministers and legislators, led by a 41-year-old Prime Minister, are young and idealistic and just plain enthusiastic about taking power. Their sense of excitement is as infectious as their plans are ambitious, and their political lingo sounds genuine and concerned with real problems.

 
 
Hard Realities
 But that is mostly because Mongolia's problems are so very real: The old socialist way has collapsed and the new market system still lacks capital and skills. Unemployment has hit nearly half the urban work force, inflation has eaten away at salaries and pensions, and packs of street children roam the streets to scavenge for food, even in the winter when the temperature gets stuck below zero.
Even in such economic straits, the transition to democracy that began in 1990 has gone remarkably well, as the easy transfer of power last summer suggests.
Effecting change is doubtless easier in a country as modest as Mongolia -- just 2.4 million people live here, roughly the population of Brooklyn -- than in a larger nation with a more complex society. "It's a small place," said Werner Prohl, a German who works in Ulaan Baatar for the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a nonprofit group supporting research and democratic change. "It's really a few hundred people who matter in this country. If there is any scheming, everyone knows about it right away."
Yet Mongolia's experience plainly counters the argument, often voiced in the Far East, that democracy has no place in a developing country or in an Asian nation with "values" based on centuries of autocratic rule. Mongolian adults seemed fully capable of deciding who should govern them, and many rode by horseback for miles to vote. A full 98 percent of those registered to vote got to the polls.
"Asian people want democracy just like everyone else," Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary of State for Asia, said during a recent visit to the region. "What's happened in Mongolia shows that talk about how Asian values don't fit with democracy is simply untrue."
The Mongolian Government now attaches great importance to winning sympathy from, and improved relations with, the United States. Cut loose from Russia after decades of political subjugation and economic support, Mongolians worry about their portly neighbor to the south, China.
Living squeezed between two giants, Mongolians have often felt as though they had to side with one or the other. The Soviet Union may have dominated Mongolia, a common refrain here goes, but China would simply consume it.
It is an understandable fear. In the broad swath of southern Mongolian plain that China has controlled since the 1940's, and renamed the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, there are now twice as many ethnic Chinese as Mongolians. Buddhist temples were demolished and monks purged for years before a semi-tolerant religious policy was adopted in 1979. Chinese is the language of instruction in schools.
It seems unlikely that Mongolia's new-found democracy will irritate China's leadership, which is careful to limit any discussion of democracy among its own people. Few people in China seem to be aware of the recent changes here, and the leaders in Beijing have not voiced any territorial claim to Mongolia.

 
 
China's Shadow
 Yet there is always a danger of trouble along the long border between China and Mongolia, because Chinese authorities are highly sensitive about any nationalist or religious activism that might stir up unrest among ethnic Mongolians within China.
While Mongolia's Government will be careful to avoid offending China in any way, it is eager to have American friends.
"American support is critical, because we live between these two giants," said Batkhuyag, a senior economic adviser to the Prime Minister. "We're very sensitive to that. We think that Americans can handle these guys better than anyone else."

Suddenly, a Mood of Danger in the Mideast

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: CAIRO

 BODY:
THE grim expressions at the Middle East summit meeting in Washington last week were born not just of despair at the violence in the West Bank and Gaza that has intercepted the trajectory toward peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
A broader uncertainty lurks this autumn -- a sense that a region that a year ago seemed headed toward ineluctable peace might be on a track back toward war. 
 For King Hussein of Jordan and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, the feeling is particularly stark. As champions of peace, they have tried to dampen Arab skepticism about Israel, assuring their citizens and their neighbors that it can be trusted.
But the clashes and their aftermath have so inflamed older hatreds that even Mr. Mubarak found it prudent to stay away from Washington. To many Arab ears, leaders like President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, who has scorned what he calls others' imperfect peace, sound now like they have been speaking with wisdom.
The shift in sentiment is not all that is worrisome. With the path toward peace apparently in stasis, at best, the build-up of elite Syrian troops near an Israeli post on Mount Hermon, in the Golan Heights, has multiplied the potential for trouble. The indecipherable motives of Iraq's Saddam Hussein have freshened the angst since the Iraqi leader baited the United States into launching cruise missile strikes that only Kuwait, among America's Arab allies, found it palatable to support.
And now Turkey, whose Ottoman forebears occupied so much of this region, has become a new source of puzzlement and fury with its schizophrenic wobbles from a military agreement with Israel to closer ties with Iran and other Islamic states. Even before the latest plunge into violence, Richard N. Haass, the director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution, wrote in the current issue of Foreign Affairs that peace in the Middle East could be thought of as "a stock whose price has soared: a correction is inevitable."
After the failure of the meeting in Washington to produce more than the new round of talks between Israel and the Palestinians that was scheduled to start today, there remain worries that this could turn into Black October. King Hussein, who was sanguine even after the election of Israel's conservative new Government last May, was plainly gloomy after he and President Clinton failed to persuade Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to offer a clearer concession than hints that he might become more conciliatory.
"The psychological moment when people begin to lose hope is close by," the King said in a television interview.
For three years now, both the King and Mr. Mubarak, along with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, have relied on hope to prop up faith in peace agreements with Israel that have yet to produce many clear economic benefits. During the accord-a-year run from 1993 to 1995, spirits soared along with the rhetoric of signing ceremonies each autumn. But for all the peace partners' proclamations, the darker suspicion lurking in many minds and articulated most forcefully by Mr. Assad is that haste has already led to historic mistakes.
And since the suicide bombings in Israel last February and March, followed by clashes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon in April and then Mr. Netanyahu's election in May, the path toward peace has been left without momentum, opening the way to broader uneasiness.
One fear that haunts Arab leaders is that Turkey, despite recent overtures to the Islamic world, has decided to align itself with Israel, having signed a military cooperation agreement last spring. On Friday, the country's Prime Minister, Necmettin Erbakan, head of an Islamic party, joined Mr. Mubarak in urging that Israel close the archaeological tunnel in Jerusalem whose opening ignited the recent violence, but there remains deep Arab concern that the pro-Western half of Turkey's divided Government would cast its lot with Israel in a crisis. Under the military agreement, Israel and Turkey can train in each others' airspace, and Syria in particular is worried that Israeli planes in Turkey could presage a pincer attack.
 
 
 
Remembering 1973
 That and other uneasiness has been reflected in Arab troop movements. Most alarming has been a shift of elite Syrian forces in Lebanon to positions that threaten an Israeli outpost on Mount Hermon, the strategic peak southwest of Damascus. Diplomats think it less likely that this is an intentional step toward conflict than a reminder to Israel by Syria of the danger of remaining in a no-war, no-peace situation. But along with massive military exercises by Egypt that included a simulated crossing of the Suez Canal, the provocative gesture has rekindled anxious memories of the October of 23 years ago, when Arabs and Israelis last waged all-out war.
It was the Persian Gulf war of 1991, of course, that appeared to transform the troubled region by establishing the partnership between the United States and key Arab states that drove Iraq from Kuwait. But five years on, with Arabs growing weary of policies aimed at crippling the tenacious Iraqi regime, the latest flare-up between Washington and Baghdad exposed a widening rift. Forced to choose between pressure from the United States and public opinion at home, every Arab country except Kuwait showed its distaste for President Clinton's decision to resort to military action.
Urged last week by Mr. Clinton to attend the summit meeting in Washington, Mr. Mubarak faced a similar choice, and the fact that he said no underscores a widening Arab sense that this may be a season for new tactics. "One of our most potent weapons in confronting Israel is the weapon of rejection," the Egyptian commentator Assayed Zahra wrote, "and that is one that the Arab states have regrettably squandered."

Many See Election as Warm-Up for Kemp

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J., Oct. 4

 BODY:
The candidate bounded forth, mis-introduced as "Bob Kemp" but well enough known by the skeptical black audience to be greeted with a smattering of decidedly wary applause.
Jack Kemp, Republican candidate for Vice President, beamed nevertheless, barely flustered and determined to cherish each and every stop along his personal political revival circuit. 
 Beyond his sheer loquacious energy at any open microphone, there is a serenity to Mr. Kemp as he conducts a campaign that begs thoughts not so much of the coming Presidential election as the one in the year 2000.
"You just cannot get me to say what I hypothetically would do," the resurrected Republican politician firmly declared in an interview even as a sense of felicitous premonition, of being in a no-lose position regardless of the Nov. 5 result, quietly suffuses the Kemp campaign.
It remains unstated, especially by the candidate himself. Inured to most of the football metaphors that endlessly afflict his appearances, the former quarterback does dwell on one, his repeated promise of a come-from-behind fourth-quarter victory next month.
"By picking me, Bob Dole brought me back into the arena," Mr. Kemp acknowledged gratefully. He answered a few questions before going forth to "the lion's den," as he put it, to present the New Jersey Black Issues Convention with his relentless message that the Republican Party can be more inclusive. "I am at peace with my role."
Professional politicians studying his mellow mood along the trail sense a happy warrior retrieved from electoral oblivion, whose selection by Mr. Dole for the ticket may even hold the promise of the inside track on the future Republican Presidential nomination.
That track looks increasingly valuable as President Clinton's lead in the opinion polls keeps dogging Republican hopes. While swearing off all thought of new-millennium politics, Mr. Kemp seems to fortify his ebullience at every little-noticed whistle-stop. Party officials, fund-raisers and local journalists are on hand, a fund of future contacts grateful for his energetic performances.
"Advantage Kemp," contended Representative Bill McCollum, the Florida Republican, preferring a tennis metaphor in evaluating Mr. Kemp's perch, even should the ticket lose. "He'll be in a very good position for the year 2000, a wonderful opportunity," Mr. McCollum said on Wednesday at a rally in Orlando, Fla., hardly conceding defeat this year after hearing Mr. Kemp's rousing speech. The candidate delivered a typically booming address in which he grandly enlisted the biblical Good Shepherd into the cause of supply-side economics.
Off the campaign stage, he stayed busy denouncing any talk of being the leading edge of a trailing ticket. "That's just ludicrous," Mr. Kemp commented on speculation about being a front-runner in the 2000 election. "I do not view myself that way."
The speculation reached the point this week that Haley Barbour, the Republican national chairman, was asked about Mr. Kemp and pointedly omitted his name in estimating that the nation's Republican governors were the party's "vanguard" in any speculation about candidates beyond Mr. Dole. "That diminishes the prospect that there's any one person who you would think of as the party leader," Mr. Barbour said.
Mr. Kemp, paying careful attention to this news between campaign stops, said he was "disappointed, not angry" that Mr. Barbour even took a question on the subject. "It's not a good signal to be talking about the year 2000 when we have five weeks left in the campaign," he said, while agreeing that the future was wide open and insisting that his main goal was to stay on what he optimistically referred to as the Dole re-election ticket.
As a candidate, Mr. Kemp may have reined in his more ad-hoc riffs of oratory lately, with no further compliments to be heard for Louis Farrakhan, the firebrand black Muslim leader. But his pleasure in loyally bending his back to the ticket's secondary role seems undiminished at stop after stop as flashing security cars and a large retinue of campaign factotums announce the re-entry of Jack Kemp into competitive politics.
The candidate's rat-a-tat revivalist's performance in public is matched in private by Mr. Kemp's own lighthearted references and allusions to how the wintry years out of power of one of his political heroes, Winston Churchill, prepared the British politician for leadership.
As a performer, Mr. Kemp is always on, a political whirligig pointing and waving to people in the passing scene as he tours America, even shouting "Hey, how are you?" across an empty hotel lobby floor at a stranger who was mopping it in Jacksonville, Fla. The single word "entrepreneur" on his Thursday morning agenda rendered him evangelistic for a solid hour at the University of New Haven.
"I really believe he really believes in what he says," said Bob Burkett, a real estate dealer after intently studying the ever-moving, ever-talking Mr. Kemp on Wednesday at a Florida stop.
In contrast, the resentment was palpable among the black audience here when Mr. Kemp, relying on his progressive reputation as a former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, sought to address one woman amiably as "girl" and referred to an earlier campaign stop as being with "the folks in Harlem."
The wary reception seemed to put Mr. Kemp off a bit, at least to the extent of his uttering what lightly struck some listeners as a Dole-ism: "This is the most exciting world in history." But he maintained his whirlwind speaking style -- he claims 275 words a minute as his oratorical velocity --- and kept his promise to bring his message to a wide variety of American scenes and to not concede the black vote to Democrats. "Listening to polls is stupid," he told an autumnal rally on Thursday evening in Stamford, Conn., as he urged a full hearing of the candidates' debates. "Mr. Lincoln never took a poll."
Mr. Kemp volunteered in the interview that he was not entirely satisfied with the way the ticket is performing. "I am not convinced that we've done as good a job as we must do to get across to the American people the positive nature of this agenda, the growth side of it, the tax reform ideas," he said. "It would be no secret that I do not see politics as tearing someone else down," he added on the Republican strategy of focusing criticism on Mr. Clinton at the expense of issue discussions.
As he happily heads from stop to stop on the national scene, Mr. Kemp declares the ticket's current situation is no worse than being down 7 or 10 points in the third quarter of a contest he considers eminently winnable.
"We have yet to do the salesmanship and marketing and advertising necessary to advance our brand of politics," the candidate complained. "But we will in the last five weeks."

THE STATES AND THE ISSUES

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

Idaho
A Democratic Threat In G.O.P. Country
It has been said that in politics these days there are some issues, like Social Security, that are radioactive. The Senate race in Idaho indicates that there are no issues more radioactive than radioactivity. 
 In recent weeks Walt Minnick, the Democratic challenger, has pulled within striking distance of the incumbent, Larry Craig, a Republican in one of the country's most staunchly Republican states. Polls by the Minnick campaign show that the Democrat has closed to within two points of Mr. Craig. Mr. Craig's campaign officials scoff at those polls and cite an independent poll showing their candidate with a comfortable lead.
Nonpartisan observers, like Jennifer Duffy, an analyst with The Cook Political Report, a Washington newsletter, say Mr. Craig does have a race on his hands. They attribute Mr. Minnick's surge mainly to Mr. Craig's support for a deal reached between Gov. Phil Batt and the Clinton Administration to allow the Navy and the Department of Energy to store highly enriched uranium at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. In return, the Federal Government has promised to remove the waste by the year 2035.
"All this has to do with this one issue," Ms. Duffy said.
At a recent 90-minute debate among Mr. Craig, Mr. Minnick and two independent candidates, a third of the time was spent on the nuclear-waste issue. Mr. Minnick has trumpeted his support for a ballot initiative that would void the agreement and require that any future agreements to store nuclear waste be approved by the State Legislature. Mr. Craig opposes the measure.
Ms. Duffy said Mr. Craig could pull through, given the state's high percentage of Republican voters. Still, the fact that some people are even talking about a Democratic upset in Idaho is surprising.
"It is a Republican state, and in the end that may pull Craig across," Ms. Duffy said. "But right now, he looks like an incumbent who is in trouble and who probably didn't anticipate being in trouble. This one is sort of coming out of the blue."

Oregon
Senate Race Hinges On Portland Suburbs
According to Tip O'Neill's famous saying, all politics is local. In the Oregon Senate race, all politics is Clackamas and Washington Counties.
Like the Ron Wyden-Gordon Smith senatorial race in January -- won by Mr. Wyden -- the contest this fall between Mr. Smith, a Republican, and Tom Bruggere, a Democrat, is coming down to who can capture the two counties that are suburban bedroom communities of Portland.
Mr. Smith has a solid lead in the historically Republican areas in the eastern and southern parts of Oregon, whereas Mr. Bruggere is way ahead in Portland, a traditionally Democratic city. The two are running even in the Portland suburbs.
"We certainly need to have stable numbers in the metro area," said John Easton, a spokesman for Mr. Smith's campaign, referring to the suburbs that ring Portland. "They can't go lower."
Indeed, Mr. Smith's razor-thin loss to Mr. Wyden in January came as a result of being defeated among moderate voters in the Portland suburbs, mainly women who did not like his anti-abortion stand. This time around, Mr. Smith is trying to soften his image and is stressing economic themes.
But Mr. Smith appears to be hampered by a lack of money. In the next two weeks, state officials will mail out the first round of absentee ballots in Oregon's vote-by-mail system, but Mr. Smith has not run any television advertisements in a week.
"We're just making a determination on where we're going," Mr. Easton said.
 
Minnesota
Candidate, 41, Seeks Votes and a Wife
People may or may not agree with Michael Gubash's positions on social issues. But you have to admit that the guy knows how to hold down spending.
Mr. Gubash, 41, is running a shoestring campaign for the State Senate in Minnesota. Seeking to contain costs and hoping to take care of two very basic needs, he recently placed an advertisement in the September/ October issue of "Meet People," a Minneapolis-St. Paul singles sheet.
"My name is Michael and I am running for state senator, Senate District 65," the ad said. "I am a God-fearing, moral, pro-life Republican. I am also seeking a faithful, devoted, obedient, God-fearing woman to be my wife, to share my life, and to bear my children."
Mr. Gubash, who ran unopposed in the Republican primary, explained that he had placed the ad because he needed to jump-start his campaign against incumbent Sandra Pappas, a Democrat, and because he had not "been successful meeting people." Since his campaign, like his love life, is running on empty, it seemed fiscally wise to combine his personal and professional desires.
"It's cost-effective," he said in a telephone interview.
The ad asked people to contribute to his campaign and asked interested women to send pictures. "Either one or the other," he said, "or both."
So far, he hasn't had much luck. No pictures have come in, though he has received some telephone calls that have not panned out. And his ad has generated only enough contributions to bring his campaign war chest up to $100, and his donors' list up to three.
"Four, if you count myself," he said.
Mr. Gubash, a pipe fitter, is facing a tough political battle in an overwhelmingly Democratic district. A staunch conservative, he has vowed, if elected, to make abortion illegal, to shut down gay bars and to "teach children the value of marriage."
To accomplish the latter, of course, it would help if he found a wife -- and some votes. Either one.
Or both. STEVEN A. HOLMES

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE VOTERS;
Clinton Finds the Northeast Just as Cozy as Home Turf

SERIES: THE RACE FOR PRESIDENT: The Northeast

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
There is no better gauge of President Clinton's political potency in Pennsylvania, or in the entire Northeast, than in the changed behavior of this city's Democratic Mayor, Ed Rendell.
Only 14 months ago, when Republicans were still savoring their triumph in the 1994 elections, Mayor Rendell was so eager to cozy up to Republicans who had gathered here for their national summer meeting that he startled many in the audience when he declared with enthusiasm: "We are a solid Republican state. We have a Republican Governor and Lieutenant Governor. We have two Republican Senators." 
 But when Mr. Clinton came calling here the other day, the Mayor was back to being a loyal Democrat, clinging to the Chief Executive at every stop. "C'mon, I'll buy," he said as he treated Mr. Clinton to a cheese steak.
While Mr. Clinton is enjoying an immense lead over Bob Dole in polls around the country, nowhere is it more manifest than in the dozen states in the Northeast. Although large states in the region, like New York and Massachusetts, have long been safely Democratic, what is particularly surprising is Mr. Clinton's strength in states that have been Republican bastions in Presidential races, like New Hampshire, Maine, Vermont and Connecticut. In addition, the region's traditional battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware, which usually roil with political swells, today look like still ponds.
The Northeast has essentially emerged as Mr. Clinton's electoral base. In contrast with other sections of the country, polls show that the President has completely shut Mr. Dole out of the Northeast, to the point that many Republicans say they fear that his unpopularity could drag down candidates for Congress and local offices. The third-party candidacy of Ross Perot, who did particularly well four years ago in Maine, is mired in the low single digits in every Northeastern state.
"If we weren't strong in the Northeast, we'd be in trouble," said Harold M. Ickes, a deputy chief of staff who oversees the political operation from the White House.
Even Mr. Ickes acknowledges that the President has been stronger in the region than many Democrats expected, in part because of the sturdy economy and also because Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Congressional Republicans seem particularly noxious to many voters here.
"If you didn't know any better, you'd think Bill Clinton was a New England governor," said J. Bradford Coker, president of Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research, a nationwide polling concern based in Columbia, Md. "He runs much better in New England than even in his home territory. It's rooted in traditional Yankee politics, which is a social liberalism and a rejection of Gingrich."
In an outburst of overstatement or, perhaps, overconfidence, Gary Hindes, chairman of the Democratic Party in Delaware, was so enthusiastic about Mr. Clinton's prospects in his state and beyond that he declared, "There's a possibility this guy could carry 50 states, which has never been done in history."
Scott Reed, Mr. Dole's campaign manager, insists that the outlook for his candidate is not as bleak as polls suggest. "Don't believe the polls," he said. "Pennsylvania is a key battleground state where Bob Dole's message of cutting taxes and being tough on crime and drugs will resonate. It has a large Catholic population where Clinton is extremely vulnerable on the partial-birth abortion issue. And we have a very popular Republican Governor who has cut taxes who is running our campaign."
While Mr. Dole's aides always expected Pennsylvania to be a battle, the fact that they are struggling in New Hampshire is a telling measure of what the campaign is up against across the entire region. Although Mr. Clinton carried the state in 1992, he was the first Democrat to win there since 1964, and it was by only one percentage point. The latest Mason-Dixon survey shows that Mr. Clinton is leading by 11 points.
Mr. Dole's advisers explain that there is still residual anger toward Mr. Dole from the New Hampshire primary, where he finished second behind Patrick J. Buchanan. To get that far, Mr. Dole had to survive millions of dollars' worth of attack commercials from the campaigns of Steve Forbes and Lamar Alexander.
Gov. Stephen Merrill of New Hampshire, general chairman of the national Dole campaign, tried to put the best face on Mr. Dole's prospects in his state. "I wouldn't say this is the dream scenario I wrote in my mind," he said. "But I'm not running scared."
After a slow start, the Dole campaign is now geared up in the state and has begun advertising on television, Mr. Merrill said. He surmised that the effort had not begun earlier because campaign officials had hoped that Mr. Clinton would not pose any threat in New Hampshire.
Mr. Dole's troubles in the Northeast are reflected in his travel schedule. Although he has campaigned and advertised heavily in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, he seems to have all but given up on campaigning in other states in the region. Mr. Dole stumped in heavily Republican central Pennsylvania last week, in the wake of a visit to the state by the President.
In an appearance at a fund raiser here, Mr. Clinton made special note of the affluent Main Line communities around Philadelphia that are full of swing voters who backed him four years ago. "The normally Republican suburban areas near here were unusually good to the Clinton-Gore ticket in 1992," he said, "and I hope they will be in 1996."
David Buffington, editor of The Pennsylvania Report, a political newsletter in Harrisburg, said Mr. Dole represented a hard-edged Republicanism that was too conservative for this state. "Voters here want Jack Kemp, but Jack Kemp ain't at the top of the ticket," Mr. Buffington said. "They want a kinder, gentler Republican Party that will still keep the I.R.S. out of their stock funds." He said Democratic appeals about protecting Medicare had also played well with the sizable elderly population in this state.
But Kieran Mahoney, the Dole campaign's senior consultant for the Northeast, noted that there was a recent tradition of Republicans in the region coming from behind and scoring upsets. He cited the elections of three Governors: George Pataki of New York, Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania. "These states are highly sensitive to taxes -- and outraged at the levels of government spending," he said. "Talk to Mario Cuomo. Talk to Jim Florio. The political graveyard is littered with people like that. And Clinton's still the poster child of tax increases."
Tony Podesta, who is helping to run the Clinton campaign in the state, said Mr. Clinton was doing so well that he had the luxury of limiting his appearances in Pennsylvania while campaigning more heavily in usually Republican territory, like Arizona.
"Who would have dreamed that in the month of September in this election year, the President would be in Arizona twice and Pennsylvania once?" Mr. Podesta said. "It speaks of Clinton's strength and Dole's vulnerability."
It also explains Mayor Rendell's change of heart. "I want the President to be responsive to the needs of the city of Philadelphia," Mr. Rendell said. "And he has."

President Clinton won the Northeast states in 1992, and the most recent Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research polls for each state show that he has a commanding lead this year. About 800 registered voters who said they were likely to vote on Nov. 5 were interviewed for each of the 1996 polls. The polls have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. The dates listed are for the most recent polls. (Source: The Almanac of American Politics 1996 [election results])

HEADLINE: POLITICS -- Political Battle of the Sexes Is Tougher Than Ever;
Suburbs' Soccer Moms, Fleeing the G.O.P., Are Much Sought

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif., Oct. 3

 BODY:
If the catch phrase that emerged from the Republican sweep in the 1994 elections was "angry white men," then what will it be this election season?
"Anxious white women," suggested Karen Hasse Ball, a mother of two who lives with her husband, children, dog and two cats on a leafy street in this Los Angeles suburb and casts her vote based on concerns about her children's future. 
 In fact, the white suburban women like Ms. Hasse Ball who are fast becoming the most sought-after voters of the campaign season are already known in campaign circles by a different name that is only now gaining currency: soccer moms.
But she was right that she and her comrades in the minivan brigades are politically hot. By breaking with their traditional Republican leanings and spurning Bob Dole in striking numbers, according to early polls, they have become a central focus of campaigners and pollsters who consider them part of the swing vote, without which Mr. Dole cannot win the Presidency.
"The campaigns are both trying to target and appeal to this group," said Susan Carroll, a senior research associate at the Center for the American Woman and Politics at Rutgers University. "And what's making it very tough for the Dole campaign is that the Clinton campaign seems to be going after these women equally aggressively."
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, conducted in early September, found that support for President Clinton among married white suburban women appeared to have jumped dramatically since 1992. In a comparable poll in September 1992, 48 percent of them preferred Mr. Bush while 27 percent preferred Mr. Clinton. This year, only 39 percent favor Mr. Dole while 49 percent prefer Mr. Clinton, for a shift of 22 percentage points in Mr. Clinton's favor.
In interviews around the country this week, white suburban married women who plan to vote for Mr. Clinton gave many reasons for their choice, but they all seemed to boil down to a perception that Mr. Dole is from Mars and Mr. Clinton is from Venus.
Mr. Clinton and the social welfare programs he supports appealed more to the women voters' compassion for the unfortunate and feelings of "there but for the grace of God," they said, while Mr. Dole's arguments that the tax cut he is proposing would benefit all families struck less of a chord.
"Men tend to vote with their pocketbooks," said Robin Smith, an insurance executive and father of three stopping in to the La Salle High School here for a parent-teacher conference, "and women. . . . "
" . . . vote with their hearts," finished his wife, Leslie.
But it is far from that simple.
At an evening mah-jongg game in a suburb of Lincoln, Neb., the five players -- all married white women -- listed an array of issues that concerned them most and that President Clinton seemed better on, like abortion, health care reform, gun control, improved public education and paid leave for family caregivers. But Michelle Carr, 38 and a Democrat who voted for George Bush in 1992, said she would nonetheless vote for Mr. Dole -- reluctantly -- because she could not trust Mr. Clinton. Like several other women interviewed, she said that neither candidate seemed right but that she would vote for Mr. Dole because "we need some tax relief in this household."
In Richmond, Mary W. Alexander, a mother of two from the suburb of Mechanicsville who teaches learning-disabled children, expressed a similar lack of enthusiasm for both candidates but leaned the other way.
"I was really for Bush, so there was a reason to vote for him," she said as she sat on a folding lawn chair and -- a literal soccer mom -- watched her son play for the Chickahominy Chargers. "Dole is not a very appealing candidate. A lot of women I teach with feel the same way: Clinton is the lesser of two evils."
Mr. Clinton, she added, "does seem to care."
That sense of caring appears to count tremendously for women who say their political approaches have altered since they had children.
"You think where the country's going to be in 10 years," Ms. Alexander said. "You aren't so me-centered. Before, I thought how it was for me -- taxes, Social Security, balancing the budget. Now I'm thinking about them -- drugs, education, medical reform. You get that mom focus."
Their husbands, many women said, tend to remain more concerned about economic issues, pushing for lower taxes and trusting in their own earning ability rather than supporting more of a social safety net in case they should fail.
When they discuss politics, the men in their lives also tend to see things more in black and white, they said, whereas they, like President Clinton, have a more consensus-building style.
"Dollars and cents," said Gay Koty, a school nurse, mother of four and typical Bush-to-Clinton shifter from Somerville, Mass., of her husband's way of thinking about politics. "Nuts and bolts. Meat and potatoes."
Those differences are longstanding, but some pollsters and analysts say the shift in the soccer moms' vote is accentuated because of women's reaction to the cuts effected by the Republican Congress.
The breakaway moms also reflect the mounting political independence of women who have been out in the workplace for many years now, said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. Her suggestion for the 1996 catch phrase was "energized white women" because "they're not particularly angry but they are empowered."
The Republican assessment of the importance of the soccer moms shows in the campaign's open wooing of them recently; campaigners say Mr. Dole's message does jibe with the moms' concerns, but it has not been effectively communicated yet.
"We just need to do a better job of talking their language," said Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster.
Another Republican pollster, Charles F. Rund, cautioned that there had often been a radical, last-minute change in voting gaps between the sexes with the approach of Election Day.
For the soccer mom contingent, 11th-hour changes would be for one obvious reason: their lives are so hectic many barely have time to think about eating, let alone voting.
"Moms will listen at the last minute," said Linda C. Baber, who was in Richmond this week planning a slumber party for 10 9-year-old girls for the eldest of her three children. "I need a quick summary."

It is not that the young women strolling the meandering alleys of this sun-dappled farming village in southern Japan are lazy or dishonest or impolite. No, the problem, at least as old folks and local officials see it, is just that they have almost stopped having babies.
The latest statistics, released recently, show that Japan's birth rate hit a new low last year, and a Government projection now suggests that the population will fall by more than half over the next century. It is forecast to tumble to 55 million in 2100, from 125 million today. 
 Reflecting the unease, a weekly magazine went even further and calculated that in the year 3000, if trends continue, the population will dwindle to 45,000. No one has worked out just when Japan will be down to a final, childless couple, a reverse Adam and Eve, post-genitors of the race, but there is agreement that such a trend would not be reassuring for housing prices.
Tumbling birth rates are a concern in much of the industrialized world -- indeed, the United States is one of the few major countries with a rough balance. Fertility rates in most of Europe are well below the replacement level needed to sustain a population.
By contrast, in much of the third world, the rates are causing population explosions.
"My husband doesn't want kids at all, and I don't particularly want them either," said Naomi Hamada, a 28-year-old Tokyo housewife.
"My husband just doesn't like them," she said. "He doesn't like annoying things. And since he wouldn't help out raising them, I don't want kids either."
Because of people like the Hamadas, the average Japanese woman is now expected to have just 1.4 babies. It takes just over 2 babies per woman, roughly the level in the United States, to maintain a population in the long run.
This figure, called the total fertility rate, is even lower in a few other places: 1.2 in Germany, Spain and Hong Kong, and 1.3 in Italy.
So officials here in Kyokushi -- and around the world -- have been debating how to make people make more babies.
"There are several ways to encourage people to have more babies," said the Mayor, Masahide Iwane, a lean and dour man with gray hair, 4 children and 12 grandchildren. "For starters we thought we would offer a congratulatory reward to mothers of a fourth child, to show our community's desire for more babies."
So any woman in town will get a gift of almost $5,000 upon the birth of a fourth or subsequent child. To lure fecund types to Kyokushi, which is on the southern island of Kyushu, the town will pay the same sum to newly arrived couples who have a fourth child -- but only after they have stayed in town for a year.
Many other Japanese towns also offer cash for births, but Kyokushi's rewards are among the highest. Mr. Iwane said the town had also considered other financial incentives: cash for marriages, cut-rate land for child-bearing couples, and cash grants to parents when their children turn 3, 5 and 7, which are all auspicious birthdays in Japan.
The problem is that the potential procreators, like Noriko Hirayama, are unimpressed. Mrs. Hirayama, 25, lives in a farm family on the edge of Kyokushi with two children, 5 and 3, and is resisting pleas to have more.
"I tell her all the time to have more kids," said her mother-in-law, Atsuko, who lives with them. "I'm young and I was once a nursery teacher, so I tell them the sooner the better. But kids these days seem to think about all kinds of things."
What are these things? The younger Mrs. Hirayama said that she doubted she had the time or money to raise four children properly, and that she relishes what free time she has.
"People in my generation feel we want kids," she said, "but we also want to enjoy our own lives."
Since Kyokushi introduced the reward in April, no woman with three or more children has become pregnant. Women interviewed around town all suggested that the amount was far too small.
"It costs far more than that to raise a child," noted Emi Nagata, a 34-year-old mother of two who was shopping in the main grocery store in Kyokushi. If the reward were paid "not once but every year," she said, people might find it more tempting.
One might think, after enduring the Tokyo subway during rush hour, that a reduced population would not be such a bad idea. After all, Japan's projected 55 million inhabitants in 2100 still represent the same population that the country had back in 1920, and they would still create a population density five times that of the United States today.
Yet there seems little enthusiasm for a tumbling population. One reason is apprehension about the destabilizing effects of a smaller work force, declining land prices and a shrinking economy. Another is worry that Japan will become a less important country, as its population drops to just one-quarter of America's soon after 2050, from two-thirds of America's a century ago.
Fertility rates have risen in some industrialized countries in recent years. But just why is unclear; it could be a statistical discrepancy, or the result of cash payments and maternity benefits that some Governments have offered, or a function of social changes that make it easier for a woman to combine motherhood with a career -- or the result of an influx of immigrants whose higher birth rates have driven up the total.
Whatever the reason, Sweden has bolstered its fertility rate to 1.9, from 1.7 in 1980. Similarly, the fertility rate in the United States has risen to about 2.0, from less than 1.8 in 1975. Even when the American fertility rate falls below the replacement level, the population is expected to increase steadily because of immigration.
Japan is considering substantial increases in child and maternity benefits, which are now minimal. These seem critical in the calculations of some women, like Michiko Kawamura, a strong-willed, angular housewife who is a bit of a local heroine in Kyokushi because she has had four children.
"Our fourth child was on condition that my husband help more," Mrs. Kawamura, 37, said. "But then after I had the baby, he kept saying that he was too busy. So I ended up doing all the work by myself."
Japan is in many ways a difficult place to be a mother. While an excellent national system of day-care centers is available for working mothers, women sometimes feel pressure to care for children entirely by themselves. Mothers are often expected to spend huge amounts of time taking their children to cram schools, special classes and other activities, with almost no help from fathers.
Tokyo, with its tiny homes, sandbox-size parks and obsession with getting into the right schools, is probably the most child-unfriendly place in all of Japan. Not surprisingly, it has the lowest fertility rate: just 1.1 children per woman.
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, when he was Finance Minister, suggested what seemed a novel way to increase fertility: discourage women from going to college. In 1990, Mr. Hashimoto told the Cabinet the reason for the decline was that the Government was encouraging women to seek higher education.
Mr. Hashimoto's comments provoked a furor; he has not been heard from on this issue since.
Another reason for the dropping rates is the growing pool of women who marry late or who feel no burning compulsion to marry at all.
"My child absolutely doesn't want to get married," said Atusko Tanaka, 52, an Osaka housewife. "She's already 26 years old, but she never had high hopes or dreamed of marriage at all. She looks at the way I live, which I think is the way most women my age live, and tells me she doesn't want to end up like me."
The average woman marries at 27, and about 17 percent of women in their early 30's are unmarried.
"The reason for women marrying later, I think, is that men are wimps," said Makiko Kobayashi, 24, a Tokyo student researching motherhood. "I know that might sound a bit exaggerated. But it's hard to find the men of our dreams."
Some experts echo Miss Kobayashi, saying the decline has less to do with women's not wanting babies than with their difficulty finding the right fathers.
In an attempt to boost marriage rates and fertility levels, some local governments are helping arrange for the immigration of marriageable women from the Philippines. Still, some demographers doubt much can be done.
"I'm very pessimistic about a restoration of fertility," said Makoto Atoh, director general of the official Institute of Population Problems in Tokyo. "The main reason for the decline in fertility is that women have advanced. They want to get ahead in the world, but they're also asked to care for children and do all the housework. Men never do that stuff."

HEADLINE: It's a Lonely Way to Pay the Bills;
For Unauthorized Biographers, the World Is Very Hostile

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
There is a living purgatory inhabited by biographers who dare to write about famous people who are neither consenting nor dead, and that is where Carole Klein found herself one night several years ago at the New York Public Library.
The occasion was a reading by Doris Lessing, the novelist whose biography Ms. Klein was preparing to write -- over the objections of Mrs. Lessing, who had actively discouraged others from helping Ms. Klein. 
 The auditorium was packed. In the crowd sat Ms. Klein, feeling the duplicity that is the unauthorized biographer's burden -- unrecognizable yet conspicuous, sheepish yet righteous, professional writer turned amateur spy.
Then a strange thing happened. Mrs. Lessing, formidable in her 70's, finished reading, and no one rose to ask a question. It occurred to Ms. Klein that the audience was afraid of looking stupid. The silence grew awkward.
Suddenly, she found herself feeling, of all things, protective of Mrs. Lessing. "I thought to myself: Should I ask a question?" Ms. Klein recalled recently. "Then I thought: No, I'll ask the question and she'll think I'm stupid."
These may be boom years in the biography business, but the economics of publishing and popular tastes have put pressure on writers to select living subjects instead of the kind one biographer calls "nice and dead."
The problem is that the living ones tend to say no. Some even encourage their friends to do the same. Which can make spending three or four years reconstructing a hostile subject's life a lonely, dispiriting way of paying the bills.
Letters go unanswered, calls unreturned. Sources hang up when the biographer introduces himself over the phone. One potential source let Ms. Klein fly all the way to London before canceling their lunch date.
And when Carl Rollyson wrote to a former husband of one of his subjects asking why their marriage had failed, the man shooed him away by quoting Macbeth's dismissal of Banquo's ghost: "Hence, horrible shadow!/Unreal mockery, hence!"
Then he signed the letter: "Insincerely yours."
It gets painful.
"I will never, never do another living person," said Ann Waldron, who is completing a biography of Eudora Welty. "I have a pretty thick skin but not that thick to undergo this for the rest of my life."
And in a city where virtually every definable group has its corresponding support group, and where biographers are abundant enough to have two, one small subset of biographers working on living subjects hangs loosely together, mostly by phone, to share war stories, lick their wounds and offer moral support.
They are all experienced biographers with multiple books to their names. They consider themselves serious, responsible writers -- who just happen to have chosen subjects who are less than ecstatic about their plans.
The group includes Ms. Klein, writing her book on Doris Lessing; Marion Meade, researching a biography of Woody Allen; Mrs. Waldron, doing a book on Eudora Welty, and Mr. Rollyson and his wife, Lisa Paddock, who are researching a biography of Susan Sontag.
The writers met through the New York University Biography Seminar, a larger group of published biographers, many of them academics writing on figures long dead, who gather monthly at N.Y.U. to do the biographer's equivalent of talking shop.
But the writers with living subjects are almost a breed apart.
"Let me put it this way: I don't think I could do that," said Brenda Wineapple, a biographer and professor at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., who is a co-director of the N.Y.U. group. "It can be very demoralizing, very difficult. You need a certain kind of personality to confront that.
"Plus, you really need to believe in what you're doing," she said. "Which is not being a literary paparazzo, it's not being a scandal monger. It's really, in some sense, excavating history. And that's difficult when your subject is alive."
None of them started out looking for trouble. They describe themselves, mostly, as admirers of their subjects. Ms. Klein was "a tremendous fan" of Mrs. Lessing's books, interested in the social and cultural context of her life. As she puts it: "I had this feeling that we would connect."
Ms. Meade's previous subjects had all been dead -- Eleanor of Aquitaine, Dorothy Parker, Buster Keaton and others. But when she proposed another "dead person" last year, she found editors said things like: "I'm only going to be able to ship 3,000 copies of a subject like that. What else do you have?"
So she suggested Woody Allen.
Neither Ms. Meade nor Mr. Rollyson sought their subject's cooperation first; they believe they are more objective biographers without it. Instead, each wrote a letter informing the subject that they had signed a contract to write a biography. Neither received a letter back.
Mrs. Waldron and Ms. Klein, on the other hand, each approached their subjects before making a book proposal. They had known them, at least slightly, before. Mrs. Waldron had visited Miss Welty in Jackson, Miss., on several occasions. Ms. Klein had had earlier telephone conversations with Mrs. Lessing about receiving an award from a group of which Ms. Klein is a member.
But Miss Welty and Mrs. Lessing said no, repeatedly. They were not interested in having biographies done, they said. They gave reasons subjects often give: Miss Welty said she wanted her writing to stand on its own; Mrs. Lessing said she was writing a memoir.
"I was a fool," Mrs. Waldron said in retrospect. "I rushed in where angels would have feared to tread." She said she allowed herself to believe Miss Welty was not adamantly opposed. And being from the South, like Miss Welty, she figured she would be able to get Southerners to talk.
One of the first people she called was a man she had interviewed for an earlier book. "I'll have to call Eudora," she remembers him saying. When he called back, he said he had been asked not to cooperate. He said Miss Welty had said: "Ask Ann to call me."
Mrs. Waldron didn't.
"She'd just talk me out of it," she explained.
Mrs. Waldron went to Memphis and tracked down a retired college administrator who had known Miss Welty years before. Does Eudora know you're working on this book? The woman asked over the phone. Mrs. Waldron said yes. Do you have her permission? No. The woman hung up.
Mrs. Waldron wrote to another man; he never answered, then declined to talk when she reached him by phone. Still another agreed to see her as soon as he returned from Europe. When he got back, he called her. "Don't come," he said. "I've talked to Eudora."
Mrs. Waldron drafted and redrafted a letter to him, explaining how much she wanted and needed the interview. She offered not to quote him, if that would help. To try to convince him she was a serious literary biographer, she sent along a copy of one of her earlier books.
"He sent the book back unopened and a one-line letter saying: 'The last thing Eudora needs at this stage in her life is an unauthorized biography,' " Mrs. Waldron said. She called her colleague Carl Rollyson from the N.Y.U. biography group and said, "I can't stand this!"
"Nobody ever told you it was going to be easy," he said coolly.
Ms. Klein ran into similar problems. When she published an author's query in The New York Times Book Review, looking for correspondence and personal recollections about Mrs. Lessing, Mrs. Lessing's agent sent a frosty letter to the editor that was then published in the Book Review.
"I am writing on behalf of Mrs. Lessing to say that this biography is totally unauthorized, that no permissions will be granted for extracts from the author's work and that her letters are also copyrighted and cannot be used without her permission," the two-paragraph letter said.
Ms. Klein was stunned.
"If you were an unsophisticated person reading this, you would have thought it was illegal to answer," she said. "I did think that was out of bounds. This was cutting off the most valuable research tool a biographer has. It was such an extreme step, particularly for a writer to do to another writer."
There are other difficulties, too. When Mr. Rollyson proposed an unauthorized biography of Lillian Hellman, he knew her papers were stored at the University of Texas. Only after he had signed a book contract did he learn that the only biographer with access to the papers was her authorized one.
After an initial panic, he says he ordered copies of every Ph.D. dissertation that had been written using the archive, knowing that graduate students did not need permission from Miss Hellman's estate to use it. He says he was able to reconstruct much of the Texas archive through the dissertations.
For his unauthorized biography of Martha Gellhorn, the writer and third wife of Ernest Hemingway, Mr. Rollyson found that copyright laws severely limited his ability to quote from her unpublished letters. The lawyer for his publishing company ended up allowing him to quote just three words.
According to Mr. Rollyson, the three words had appeared in a letter from Miss Gellhorn to Bernard Berenson, responding to his teasing suggestion that Mr. Hemingway, from whom she was then divorced, might be visiting him in Italy at the same time as Miss Gellhorn had planned to come.
"She said, 'Don't you dare. I don't want to feel his hot jungle breath on my neck,' " Mr. Rollyson recalled in an interview. "I said to the lawyer: 'Come on! I'm going to come up with a paraphrase for 'hot jungle breath'?' So she said, 'O.K., O.K., O.K.' So 'hot jungle breath' is in the book."
Ms. Meade said she believes biographers' feelings often follow a predictable course: They adore the subject, then despise the subject, then wonder whatever possessed them to choose that subject at all. Eventually, biographers "work through that hostility and come out in the proper place," she said.
Ms. Meade herself had a hard time adjusting to a living subject. "The very idea that my subject was alive and living across the park freaked me out," she said. For months, she would wake up in her Upper West Side apartment "feeling just horribly depressed."
But as time passes, she said, "the subject recedes to a place which is like a twilight zone." Much of the research is the same, whether the subject is living or dead. "Now, I don't feel as terrified," she said. "Besides, I do keep telling myself: This is my job."
There are signs above Ms. Meade's desk. One that appeals to her sense of humor reads: "The less said about this person the better."
Of everyone in the group, Mr. Rollyson appears to have achieved the deepest state of emotional detachment. He professes, persuasively, to take a clinical view of his work. He and Ms. Paddock describe his attitude as a product of temperament and long experience.
The son of a bartender and a discount-store sales clerk, Mr. Rollyson was an actor in his adolescence, then got a Ph.D. in English literature and became an academic. He writes in small spurts -- "two, three hours, tops" -- while also working as a professor at Baruch College of the City University of New York.
He gets his legal advice on copyright matters from Ms. Paddock, a lawyer, former stock broker and now a freelance writer. Their home is an apartment in what was once an Ex-Lax factory in downtown Brooklyn. Together, they have also written a couple of how-to books about genealogy.
Biography, as Mr. Rollyson sees it, is all about exposure.
"I seem to fasten on subjects who have created these images of themselves and who seem to feel entitled to project this as history," he said. He believes the public is entitled to understand how that is done. If his subjects reject him, Mr. Rollyson doesn't mind. After a half a dozen biographies, mostly of writers, he understands.
"I feel my subject is entitled to their anger," he said. "I can certainly understand why someone would be nervous that there's someone around inquiring into their life. They have no control over this person. Who is this person?
"You know, you're dealing with someone with a very significant literary reputation. And the biographer, compared to that person, could easily be called a second- or third-rater. So I can see all sorts of reasons why they might be upset and worried."
How would he feel? he was asked.
"I've left instructions to everybody: Talk, talk, talk," Mr. Rollyson said, laughing. "I want it to be a good book, colorful stories. Everybody talk. I want to be famous."
And Ms. Paddock?
"I wouldn't like it at all," she said. "It would make me very angry and upset."

Chart: "GOING TO GREAT LENGTHS TO REACH A DEAD END"
 ANN WALDRON, who is writing an unauthorized biography of Eudora Welty, gave this account of her efforts to land an interview. Without success.
 
1. In a published interview with Eudora Welty, Mrs. Waldron notices a reference to a family named Miat with whom Miss Welty had spent May Day, 1950, in France.
 
2. Mrs. Waldron runs the name through various library indexes and finds Mary Miat, a writer who had married a French sculptor, Aristide Miat.
 
3. From a guest list for a celebration of Miss Welty's birthday, Mrs. Waldron finds that Mrs. Miat had lived at one time in Santa Fe, N.M.
 
4. Mrs. Waldron calls galleries and museums in Santa Fe. In one museum, an employee finds a catalogue with a single reference to Aristide Miat.
 
5. Mrs. Waldron writes to thank the museum employee, who then voluntarily tracks down a daughter of Mrs. Miat still living in Santa Fe.
 
6. The daughter tells Mrs. Waldron that her mother is 90 years old and living in Bethesda, Md. with another daughter. She gives Mrs. Waldron the address.
 
7. Mrs. Waldron writes to Mrs. Miat, asking to interview her about Miss Welty.
 
8. Mrs. Miat writes back. She says she has spoken to Miss Welty and she would rather not talk. JANNY SCOTT

HEADLINE: POLITICS -- Political Battle of the Sexes Is Tougher Than Ever;
For Many White Men, Clinton's the Reason To Vote for Dole

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Ask Republican men in this stronghold of conservatism why they are voting for Bob Dole in November, and the odds are they will tell you first that Bill Clinton is a promise-breaking, policy-shifting politician whose charm and sweet talk have cast a dangerous spell on much of America.
It is not that they think Mr. Dole would not be a good President. They think he would be. It is just that the same passion they feel in explaining why they do not like and do not trust Mr. Clinton eludes them in explaining why they prefer his opponent. 
 As the 1996 Presidential campaign has unfolded, President Clinton's persistent lead over Mr. Dole in public opinion surveys has been defined, in part, by a growing number of women who say they prefer the President over Mr. Dole. Poll after poll shows Mr. Clinton has gained significant strength with female voters in the four years since he defeated President George Bush.
But on the other side of the gender gap, many of the same polls measure something else: a strong preference for Mr. Dole over Mr. Clinton among certain groups of men, like white men who are married and live in the suburbs. In many cases, the polls show, Mr. Dole is doing even better among these groups of men than Mr. Bush did in 1992.
With the Presidential campaign lumbering into its final weeks, many men, particularly in a state like Texas, are angry that Mr. Clinton is doing so well in the polls, frustrated that Mr. Dole has failed to catch fire with voters and baffled that so many Americans do not seem to care about character.
These men may profoundly respect Mr. Dole, but they do not seem to like him very much. While it troubles them to admit it, they wish he could be a lot more exciting, like Mr. Clinton, or better still, like Ronald Reagan.
In the family room of a house in an upper-middle-class Dallas suburb, seven white men stayed behind after a weekly 7 A.M. Bible study group with their sixth-grade sons to vent. Their lack of enthusiasm for Mr. Dole is so great that it took 20 minutes before his name came up.
"I wish you could put Ronald Reagan's head, when he was President, into Bob Dole's body," said Gil Sheehan, a 39-year-old father of three who runs a small gift-manufacturing business. "Ronald Reagan said, 'Hey, America, this is what I believe.' I don't know if it's his handlers or what, but Bob Dole comes off as wishy-washy."
Phil Mabry, a 42-year-old stockbroker and father of four, agreed, saying: "Ronald Reagan had vision. Jack Kemp has vision. Hillary Clinton has vision, although it's one I don't agree with. I don't sense that from Bob Dole. He's very qualified, but he has trouble articulating his message. And that's what elects Presidents."
While none of the men said his wife was supporting Mr. Clinton, they are painfully aware that the polls show Mr. Clinton has a 2-to-1 lead nationwide over Mr. Dole among female voters.
Even in Texas, where the most recent Democratic Presidential candidate to carry the state was Jimmy Carter in 1976, men and women are straining in opposite directions. While 50 percent of Texas men prefer Mr. Dole, only 39 percent of the women do, according to a poll of 1,007 registered voters taken by Blum & Weprin Associates in September. By contrast, 36 percent of Texas men who were surveyed prefer Mr. Clinton, while 46 percent of the women do. The margin of sampling error for each sex was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The men have little trouble explaining why some women do not find Mr. Dole an attractive candidate. "Grumpy old man," said Frank Bullock, a 41-year-old real estate broker.
"It's a Nixon-Kennedy thing," Mr. Mabry said.
The only time the group got excited about the Republicans was when Joseph P. Garrett, a 41-year-old real estate developer and father of two, asked: "Would you vote for Elizabeth Dole for President?"
"I'd love it!" Mr. Sheehan said. "She's one of the reasons I'm excited about Bob Dole."
"I'd love a Kemp-Elizabeth Dole ticket," Mr. Mabry said.
"That's my ticket," Mr. Bullock said.
Even when Mr. Sheehan tried to stop the group from fantasizing too much about a possible female President Dole, he still could not stir much enthusiasm for her husband. "Please don't think Bob Dole doesn't have a lot of vision, that we'd rather have a woman," he said. "But you know, he doesn't have a lot of vision."
The men -- and dozens of other middle- and upper-middle-class men interviewed throughout Dallas -- acknowledge that the explanation for the male-female gap is more complicated.
They cite the Republican Party's rigid opposition to abortion, which has polarized the party establishment in Texas and alienated a large segment of Republican female voters.
They say that Mr. Clinton has inaccurately -- but cleverly -- managed to portray Mr. Dole as a man who would rob old people of their medical benefits and take food away from poor children.
They think that some of the issues that Mr. Dole has stressed, like the need for a stronger defense and a stronger business environment, do not automatically carry as much weight with women.
And in a state like Texas, where the economy has thrived in the Clinton Presidency, Mr. Dole's pledge of a 15 percent tax cut comes off sounding to both men and women more like a political ploy.
But the way Mr. Dole looks and talks is what the men keep coming back to -- whether at an afternoon game of six-man football for sixth graders in the upper-middle-class enclave of University Park or in the hog house of the Texas State Fair.
"I wish Dole would come across as a more tough-minded person, a person with more vigor," said Grant Stephenson, 52, an executive recruiter, watching his son play football.
"I don't think it's the age thing. It's his style. Bill Clinton has so much charisma I don't even know if a Ronald Reagan could beat him this year," Mr. Stephenson said.
At the State Fair, men talked more bluntly about why Mr. Dole's inability to charm hurts his chances, particularly with women.
"Dole, well, he's old and ugly for one thing," said Scooter Brown, a 51-year-old veterinarian, horse-trader and Dole supporter.
As for Mr. Clinton, Mr. Brown added: "Some women know about his past, but they don't seem to care."
Mr. Clinton's past, in Republican circles here, is shorthand for accusations of marital infidelity that may not be much of a factor nationally but that are being used in Texas as part of a broader attack on the President's character.
"Bill Clinton is not a role model for our children or our nation," said David Slaughter, 38, the owner of a women's shoe company who was at the fair with his wife and children. "It's the immorality, it's Whitewater, it's sex."
That sentiment was echoed at the fathers' morning meeting. "I have friends who run around on their wives, and it's nice to go hunting and fishing with them," said Frank Fleming, a 44-year-old lawyer, "but I wouldn't want them running my country."
Recent polls in Texas showed Mr. Dole had a lead so slim over Mr. Clinton that the race is considered a dead heat.
But Mr. Dole's die-hard supporters remain convinced that Texans -- both male and female -- will not be swayed by the President's charm.
"Been there," said Will Ford Hartnett, a lawyer and conservative member of the Texas Legislature. "I was the nerd. My fiancee was always attracted to smooth talkers. But the good guys always win in the end. In the end I got her. What counts is stability, loyalty, devotion, integrity. Bob Dole's going to win Texas hands down."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE OVERVIEW;
DOLE CAMP LOOKS TO COMING DEBATES AS A LAST CHANCE

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Frustrated that their candidate is still bogged in second place, Bob Dole's advisers consider the nationally televised debates that begin Sunday night as his last best chance to reverse his electoral fortunes in a campaign that President Clinton has dominated from the start.
The Dole camp is placing such importance on the first debate that it has suspended decisions about its television advertising as well as which states to pump its remaining resources into in the last four weeks. "All strategic decisions have been put on hold," said one senior Dole aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "Everything is on hold until after the debate." 
 But as Mr. Dole shares the stage in Hartford with Mr. Clinton in the first of two 90-minute confrontations, he faces a titanic challenge: to break through to an unusually uninterested electorate and then take the next step of persuading voters to reconsider what polls show is their predisposition to support the President. Mr. Clinton has held a double-digit lead over Mr. Dole in most polls, the type of deficit from which no candidate in the last several decades has rebounded this late in the campaign.
Another complication for Mr. Dole is that historians contend that debates have never been consequential in how people make up their minds, and polls show that this year a particularly large proportion of voters has already decided.
While Mr. Clinton was spared a primary challenger, allowing him to coast through the campaign -- he has never even formally announced his candidacy -- Mr. Dole has had a particularly hard time capturing the nation's attention. Aides close to Mr. Dole said he had been toying with the idea of a dramatic gesture: announcing during the debate that Gen. Colin L. Powell would be his choice for Secretary of State. They met for breakfast on Thursday in Washington.
Despite such possible flourishes, the debates may not generate quite the usual enormous interest -- and not only because they are competing this year with the baseball playoffs. In a nationwide poll of 1,517 registered voters by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, only 30 percent of those surveyed said the debates would matter to them, while 65 percent said their minds were already made up. In a departure from previous elections, only 43 percent of registered voters said they were "very likely" to watch the debates; that is down from 67 percent in 1992.
Even so, Mr. Dole's advisers emphasized that the debate, with an audience estimated at 90 million people, offered Mr. Dole the first opportunity of the race to appear on an equal footing with the President, particularly now that the commission sponsoring the debates has excluded Ross Perot, the Reform Party candidate. It will be followed by another face-off in San Diego and a Vice-Presidential debate in St. Petersburg, Fla.
"From the standpoint of being able to put Bob Dole in front of 90 million or 100 million sets of eyeballs, it's very important," said Tony Fabrizio, Mr. Dole's pollster. "This is an opportunity for Dole not to be drowned out by a bombing in Iraq or a Middle East summit."
Scott Reed, Mr. Dole's campaign manager, added, "The debate is a stepping stone to winning the election."
By contrast, a certain headiness now pervades the White House. Concluding that it was all but too late for Mr. Dole to win, George Stephanopoulos, a senior adviser to Mr. Clinton, said: "It's not enough for Senator Dole to win the debate on Sunday. It's not enough for him to beat expectations. He's got to fundamentally change the nature of the race."
Even Haley Barbour, the Republican national chairman, said debates were not known for turning campaigns around. "I'm not a believer that debates in and of themselves change a whole lot of votes," he said. Then, searching for some hope for Mr. Dole, he went on, "But in this case, I think they probably do focus people more on the campaign than they have been."
The Dole campaign is so intent on knocking Mr. Clinton off stride that aides said they were considering what one called the "psychological warfare" of putting in the front row one or two people who would make the President uncomfortable. One possibility, according to aides, is Billy R. Dale, whom Mr. Clinton dismissed as director of the White House travel office and who now works for the Dole campaign.
For Mr. Dole, the debates open the final phase of a campaign that has become famous for its multiple starts. For months, Mr. Dole's advisers pointed to markers in the campaign that would scramble the dynamic: First they said the polls would change once he won the nomination. Then after he quit the Senate. Then after he announced his economic plan. Then after he picked Jack Kemp as his running mate. Then after the convention in San Diego.
Despite those efforts to jump-start the Dole campaign, the race has been remarkably static. The President's lead has been unchallenged in most polls for at least six months, and state surveys also show that Mr. Dole is still struggling even in states that have long been Republican strongholds, like Florida, Arizona and New Hampshire.
Mr. Dole used his weekly radio address to set the stage for the debate as well, listing many of the goals he has laid out in this campaign so far. Mr. Dole said Mr. Clinton claimed that he shared many of the same goals but in fact could not be trusted to follow through.
"You'll hear President Clinton say he wants many of these same things for our future," Mr. Dole said. "But listen carefully. If it were a contract, you'd need to read the fine print." That Mr. Dole, whose favorable rating in the latest New York Times/ CBS News Poll is lower than his unfavorable rating, faces a mountainous task can be measured by the list of things his aides want the debates to accomplish. They hope that Mr. Dole will change voters' image of him, sell his tax plan and undermine Mr. Clinton's character and his record -- and do it all with a smile.
The Clinton camp has a shorter agenda: Mr. Clinton must avoid any gaffe that could jeopardize his lead, should avoid picking fights and should look Presidential. Rather than cast the election as a referendum on his leadership, Mr. Clinton is expected to invoke the Republican Congress led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, subtly suggesting that Mr. Dole is an extremist in the Gingrich mold.
Although Dole aides have been dampening expectations by portraying Mr. Clinton as far more skilled on his feet, the President may have more to lose. "The risks are all Clinton's," said Nelson Polsby, a political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley, "because everyone expects him to do extremely well."
Mr. Dole has struggled to find an issue that can take hold -- raising character questions about Mr. Clinton, promising a tax cut, promising a war on drugs and even branding the President a liberal. Now he must try to convince voters not only that the economy is in trouble, but also that he, not Mr. Clinton, could best bring it back to life.
Yet the predicament for Republicans is that with the election only four weeks from Tuesday, some prominent party members are raising the prospect that Mr. Clinton could sail to Election Day without even a tightening in the polls. Many Republicans are most concerned that even if he loses, Mr. Dole does well enough to keep Republican control of the House and Senate.
Asked about the stakes in Sunday's debate, one top Dole aide said: "I think he'll do better than expected. But is that enough?"

HEADLINE: 2 Governors Plan Cleanup For Harbor

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
In a move that could end a threat to the regional economy and quell a longstanding environmental dispute, the Governors of New York and New Jersey have agreed to clear five million tons of silt from clogged shipping channels in New York Harbor over the next 12 months and to share the burden of disposing of harbor mud that is too contaminated to be dumped in the ocean.
In an agreement to be released tomorrow, Gov. George E. Pataki and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman outline how they intend to use dredged material on land, to dispose of it safely in waters close to shore, and to develop new techniques for decontaminating the most polluted mud so that it can be turned from an environmental problem into a commodity. New Jersey officials will focus on finding ways to use the dredged material as a resource for shoreside development projects while New York looks for ways to reduce the flow of pollutants that have created the contamination problem and complicated harbor dredging. 
 Over the last three years, dredging largely ground to a halt after strict new Federal environmental standards barred mud with traces of toxic chemicals from being dumped at sea off the New Jersey Shore, as had been the norm for most of the century.
The Governors say that the agreement -- to commit up to $130 million from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for dredging in the next 12 months -- sets the stage for a long-term solution to a problem that has dogged the region, and should prevent deep-draft ships -- along with almost 170,000 jobs and $20 billion in annual economic activity -- from moving to competing ports. Representatives of port industries and shipping firms said they were cautiously optimistic that the impending move -- the first concrete pledge by the states to resume dredging after three years of environmental discord -- could preserve New York Harbor's 150-year status as the dominant East Coast seaport. With new fleets of cargo ships cutting deeper into the water even as the channels were losing depth, port officials and shipping companies said that the region stood to lose not only existing trade and jobs but also the prospect of future growth. By the turn of the century, a new generation of deeper-draft ships is expected to bring goods from Asia to the East Coast. A key goal in the effort to carve channels even deeper is to best competitors like Norfolk, Va., and Halifax, Nova Scotia, and to make New York the hub for this new trade route.
"This bistate plan is a critical step in breaking the dredging deadlock," Governor Whitman said in a statement accompanying the plan. Copies of the plan were sent by the governors' offices to several newspapers, including The New York Times.
The agreement adds new detail to commitments made by the two Governors in May, when they pledged to spend $130 million in capital funds from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey on dredging but offered no specific solutions.
It also builds on a Federal plan announced in July by Vice President Al Gore, which clarified environmental testing procedures, streamlined the process by which Federal permits are issued for harbor dredging, and set a deadline for ending dumping of contaminated mud at the traditional dumping grounds, east of Sandy Hook, N.J. The sea bottom there has been stained by contamination after a century of dumping.
A firm date -- Sept. 1, 1997 -- for halting the dumping of tainted mud offshore was considered essential by private environmental groups to spur the states to find alternatives.
In essence, the states' agreement says that New York and New Jersey will share the burden of finding new repositories or uses for the millions of tons of silt that washes down the Passaic, Hudson and Raritan rivers each year and settles in the harbor's 430 miles of berths and channels.
Until now, dredged mud from every corner of the sprawling port was barged to the old site off Sandy Hook, angering coastal communities, fishermen and environmentalists who felt unfairly saddled with New York City's waste.
The backlog of contaminated mud will be distributed in different places, depending on the level of pollutants. Federal environmental officials have agreed to allow a million additional tons of lightly tainted mud to be disposed of at the old dump site before next September. Thereafter, only mud with no significant levels of pollutants will be dumped there. Environmental officials hope that the continued spreading of clean dredged material over the dump site and a 30-square-mile area around it will slowly cover past contamination.
Under the two-state agreement, heavily contaminated mud will go into submerged pits in Newark Bay, to a foundation for a shopping mall parking lot in Elizabeth, and into shoreline restoration projects and other sites that will be identified in new programs initiated by each state. Once the backlog is cleared, however, the states must find ways to deal with the three million tons of contaminated mud that accumulates each year. Although a potential threat to marine life, the tainted mud is not considered a hazard to humans, and similar dredged material has been used successfully in other parts of the country to create waterfront parks and artificial islands and to cover garbage in landfills.
Altogether, New Jersey plans to spend $65 million on a variety of dredging and disposal programs through 1997. The plan calls for increasing the use of dredged material in highway projects, finding places where the material can be used to restore shorelines, and developing new disposal methods and decontamination processes.
New York has committed the same amount of money, and will dedicate some of its portion to studies looking at how to reduce the flow of pollution into the harbor. The plan draws heavily on work done by an ad hoc task force of state and Federal officials and representatives of environmental and business groups interested in the harbor, and so is likely to generate broad support, members of the ad hoc group said.
The states are also likely to lean heavily on a large study, scheduled to be released this week, by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which lays out an exhaustive list of dredging and disposal options and their probable costs. The Corps is responsible for issuing dredging permits and for maintaining the central group of channels around the harbor.
In an indication that the new plan is unlikely to put an end to conflict over mud, when drafts of the Corps report were circulated to groups last week, community groups and state officials quickly challenged certain options, like an artificial island that could be built in the lower harbor.
Over all, though, tomorrow's announcement by the Governors and the recent moves by the Clinton Administration have cheered the owners of port-related businesses.
"For the first time in a long time, we're optimistic," said John Holtz, a spokesman for the New Jersey Petroleum Council.
The council represents the dozens of businesses that transport billions of gallons of petroleum products in and around New York Harbor each year. Channels leading to oil terminals tucked between Staten Island and New Jersey have grown steadily shallower year after year. But in the last eight days, Exxon and Chevron went through the initial phase of the new streamlined routine for simultaneously obtaining state and Federal dredging permits, Mr. Holtz said, and company officials were pleased by the speed of the process.
It was likely that channels that have remained undredged since 1989 will be clear by next spring, Mr. Holtz said, adding: "The states and Federal agencies are cooperating. They've really demonstrated to us that they're serious about making this happen."

HEADLINE: Labor and Academia In a Campus Meeting

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The buzz was undeniably there, although no one expected it to be.
It was a standing-room-only crowd. Another 500 people were packed into nearby rooms to watch on closed-circuit television. And outside stretched a 200-yard-long line of people who were turned away. 
 It was not a Mike Tyson fight. Nor was it the latest Pearl Jam concert. The crowd was there for a panel discussion with professors of philosophy, law and religion, a feminist author and a labor leader.
Far exceeding the organizers' expectations, some 1,700 people thronged to an auditorium at Columbia University on Thursday night for the Fight for America's Future, billed as "a teach-in with the labor movement." With an electricity that was rare for both labor and academic events, there were repeated standing ovations for the speakers, who included Cornel West, the Harvard professor of religion and Afro-American studies, and John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president.
Speaking under the rotunda of Low Library, Betty Friedan, the feminist author, said: "I have a pretty good historical Geiger counter. Thirty years ago, my Geiger counter was clicking about the beginning of the women's movement. My historic Geiger counter is clicking again."
The Columbia teach-in was the flagship of 10 such events scheduled around the nation this month, at sites including Eastern Illinois University, the University of Texas at El Paso, and Wayne State University in Detroit. The events -- modeled and named after antiwar conferences of the Vietnam War era -- are being organized by various groups of academics, not only to renew ties with unions but also to teach students more about the labor movement and to get more students and professors to devote their intellectual energies to helping working Americans.
The organizers are hoping to re-establish the labor-intellectual partnership that was a powerful force from the Progressive Era until the early 1960's. That alliance broke down as union leaders grew angry with liberal academics for opposing the Vietnam War, while left-leaning intellectuals soured on the A.F.L.-C.I.O., seeing it as tradition-bound and preoccupied with the cold war.
Academics now say it is time to renew the alliance because the labor movement is on the rebound and American workers are feeling squeezed.
Thursday night and again on Friday at Columbia, the labor leaders reveled in the unaccustomed glow of academic chic, while intellectuals appeared delighted to hold labor's muscled hand and feel relevant.
Nelson Lichtenstein, a University of Virginia historian and a co-chairman of the event, said: "We have hit a moment when class questions are back at the center of American social and political concerns. That's why all these people are here."
At the main panel discussion on Friday morning, held at Columbia's School of International Affairs, the crowd included undergraduates, professors, retired unionists and dozens of middle-level union officials.
Stirred by the crowd, Mr. Sweeney asked labor's new partners to use their brainpower -- to write books and articles, give speeches and do research for organizing drives -- to back union efforts to lift wages and give workers more say.
"We need your help in making basic economic education available and accessible to every American, so everyone can understand what is happening to their family budget and who is doing it to them," Mr. Sweeney said. "We need your help in telling millions of unrepresented workers that while it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a union to get a raise."
The teach-in did feature one obligatory nod to academic traditions: infighting. Orlando Patterson, a Harvard sociologist, was booed by many people in the audience when he said the left should support tougher immigration rules because immigrants were undercutting workers' wages.
Richard Rorty, a University of Virginia philosopher, was attacked for suggesting that New Left activists were responsible for creating the rift between intellectuals and labor when they spat at Vietnam veterans and burned flags.
And Katha Pollitt, the poet and essayist, angered some A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials by asserting that the labor movement did not oppose the new welfare law vigorously enough and had isolated itself by fighting primarily to help union members, instead of all workers.
Sarah Kendzior, a Sarah Lawrence freshman attending the conference, said, "I don't understand how these people can unify when they keep disagreeing among themselves."
But other students -- like Michelle Sieff, a graduate student in political science at Columbia -- found a heartwarming, if old-fashioned, sense of solidarity.
"It's been very inspiring to see labor back on American campuses," she said. "Students are reaching for something right now. There's a lot of apathy, as we all know, but there's a desire to find an alternative to the M.B.A.-law school track of life."

HEADLINE: For Poor, Life 'Trapped in a Cage'

SERIES: BARELY FOUR WALLS: Housing's Hidden Crisis -- First of six articles.

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG; Jane H. Lii contributed to this article.

 BODY:
On a corner of Clinton near Delancey, up a narrow stairway between a pawnshop and a Dominican restaurant, Ana Nunez and her three children live in a single, illegal room that suffocates their dreams of a future.
It is a $350-a-month rectangle, with no sink and no toilet, that throbs at night with the restaurant's merengue music. Ms. Nunez's teen-agers, Kenny and Wanda, split a bunk bed, while she squeezes onto a single bed with little Katarin, a pudgy 4-year-old with tight braids. Out the door and down the linoleum-lined hallway is the tiny bathroom they share with five strangers. 
 In this cramped room on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the Nunezes suffer the consequences of their poverty in ways that eerily recall the pathologies of turn-of-the-century tenements. Last winter, tuberculosis traveled from Kenny to his mother and younger sisters in a chain of infection as inevitable as their bickering. Inevitable, too, is their fear of fire: life in 120 square feet means the gas stove must stand perilously close to their beds.
This so-called apartment, this life, preys on them all, but most of all on Kenny, who, at 18, is a restless young man in a female household. Ask him what bothers him most and he flatly states that he has only one way to get some privacy: "I close my eyes." Partly because he had nowhere to study, much less to think, Kenny dropped out of school last year, a fact that his mother found herself too depressed to lament. She changed the subject instead.
"At night," she said, "when the mice crawl over us in bed, it feels even more crowded."
Across the city, tens, perhaps hundreds of thousands of poor families like the Nunezes live in miserable, crowded conditions from which they can see no way out. But they suffer privately, captives of a hidden housing crisis that has been masked for years by the more public crisis of homelessness.
These families live in a growing network of illegal homes: stacked like firewood in Chinatown; wedged into coffin-sized cubicles in Washington Heights; even tucked away in the basements and attics of the leafier reaches of Queens, where private homes have been sliced and diced. They also live in perfectly legal rentals, crowded together in overextended families: in the aging brownstones of East Harlem and the decaying tenements of Bushwick, Brooklyn; under puckered ceilings in Mott Haven, the Bronx, and up sloping stairways in the Rockaways.
Compared with outright homelessness, even their bad housing has come to seem acceptable in a new urban calculus that finds something to be better than nothing. Well aware of the crisis, the Federal, state and city governments are nonetheless stepping away from it; their commitment to providing and maintaining housing for the poor slips by the year.
Emblematic, perhaps, of New York City's shifting priority is its deployment of municipal employees: for almost every housing inspector charged with keeping the city's 140,000 apartment buildings livable and safe, there is a city counselor devoted to the new task of "homeless diversion."
Despite city laws that explicitly outlaw crowding, homeless-diversion workers routinely urge the poor to double and triple up with other families -- if that is what it takes to keep them out of the homeless shelters, the only real gateway to the exhausted supply of public housing.
"Sometimes, you're talking three, four generations in a studio," said Beatrice Adams, who trains homeless-diversion workers for the city. "But it's better than in the shelter. That's our position."
It is a position that subverts the very premise of the housing reform movement begun more than 100 years ago by the Danish-immigrant photojournalist Jacob A. Riis. With haunting photos, Riis's crusade provoked a great outcry that led to a stringent system of codes to protect a poor tenant's claim to a safe and decent home.
Yet more than a century later, in a city that blatantly defies those very codes, the Nunezes inhabit just the kind of claustrophobic quarters that Riis sought to eliminate. Like so many others, they are the all-but-homeless, enduring their homes because they have nowhere else to go.
"We're trapped in a cage," said Ms. Nunez, a United States citizen born in the Dominican Republic.
Precisely how many such tenants there are cannot be known. But these poorest of the city's families are being squeezed between a powerful combination of changing demographics and economics: since the early 1980's, the city's stock of inexpensive apartments has withered away just as the demand has mushroomed with deepening poverty and a vast influx of immigrants.
An ambitious, decadelong program started by former Mayor Edward I. Koch created 40,000 apartments for the poor and working class, but it ultimately made only a dent, albeit a significant one, in the problem.
Almost inevitably, the growing demand spawned the network of illegal homes, and taxed the shrinking, already decaying supply of legal rentals. At the same time, the city all but abandoned strict enforcement of housing laws, allowing the illegal market to flourish and leaving legal tenants to fend for themselves.
"The reality is that if you are poor in a fast, cold city like this, they don't care how you live so long as you are not out on the streets worrying people," said Maria Pagan, 83, a retired school cafeteria worker who lived for a decade in a city-owned building in Bushwick that was crumbling around her, with a wooden brace supporting its foundation and outside walls so unsteady they could be shaken like loose teeth.
In a busy city that accepts hardships as a given, glimpses into Miss Pagan's world occur only rarely -- when smoke fills a lower Manhattan basement, rousting a dozen Chinese men; when a building collapses in Harlem, killing three; when fire fatally traps a young family in an illegal attic home in South Jamaica, Queens.
Except on these very worst of days, their crisis remains behind closed doors.
"It's our city's dirty little secret, because people don't have to face it," said Scott Sommer, chairman of the Metropolitan Council on Housing, a tenant-rights group.
Over the last 10 months, reporters for The New York Times visited at least 200 poor households in a sorry panoply of living spaces, from storage sheds and storefronts to basements, triple-decker bunkrooms and apartments that are simply falling apart.
As expected, the reporters found illegal immigrants in some of the makeshift homes. But many of the worst apartments were filled with considerably more established New Yorkers, foreign- and native-born Americans alike, people working menial jobs as well as those on welfare, young mothers and elderly widows and single men battling mental illness or addiction. And most have spent their adult lives -- lives increasingly without options, lives often without heat -- on stale waiting lists for government housing assistance.
And so they spend winters shivering, windows smothered in blankets, ovens on broil.
Or they bed down in illegal basements with nothing but plywood between their mattresses and the sibilance of boilers.
Or they share beds with their children, bedrooms with their in-laws and bathrooms with strangers.
They confront frightening dilapidation: leaks that eat at their ceilings and rot their floors, rusted fire escapes and rollercoaster stairways, sometimes with steps so corroded that tenants adopt idiosyncratic safety measures: Martinez Tyson in East Harlem, for one, keeps a rope under his bed, preparing for the day when he will have no way out but a window with no fire escape.
And they endure vile infestation -- rats gobble their garbage and nibble their slippers, and, in one horrifying case in Bushwick, cockroaches have laid eggs inside the noses of Wanda Carrero's children.
"When I see the density and conditions in which people live," said Richard Plunz, a Columbia University professor and author of the definitive "History of Housing in New York" (Columbia University Press), "I have to wonder just what Jacob Riis and the housing reformers would say if they wandered into the New York of today."
Since Riis's day, of course, there have been some very basic improvements, like plumbing and electrification -- although plenty of apartments still lack the rudimentary amenities, like fire escapes and hot running water, mandated by early-20th-century housing laws.
And compared with just 25 years ago, the very worst conditions seem to have improved: far fewer people are known to live in buildings considered so unsafe and unfit for habitation that they endanger lives -- although, by the city's latest housing survey, more than 60,000 people still do.
"In aggregate, if you take a rock-bottom criterion, there has been some general improvement in the city's housing stock over the last 25 years," said Victor Bach, director of housing policy and research for the Community Service Society, an antipoverty organization. "But in the hardest-hit neighborhoods, by the city's own measure, there are increasing numbers of deficiencies. Conditions are not good."
In poor neighborhoods, tenants and landlords have always been locked in a tenuous relationship, dependent on the buildings that no one else wants to live in or own. But now, as expenses for landlords are rising and tenants' incomes are falling, the dynamic is particularly unhealthy. When rents cannot be met consistently, even the best-intentioned landlords cannot afford to maintain their properties. So they let them deteriorate, or simply walk away, leaving the tenants' fate in the hands of government.
But the government is pulling back. The Koch building program has no successor; fewer apartments are being created even for the homeless.
"We're at the point where we cannot afford to make a massive investment in a continuous way," said Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, the city's Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development since April. "Not that the need is not there. There are a substantial number of people living in sub-substandard housing. But we have to figure out how to motivate the private sector."
Private landlords of low-income housing, however, have always relied on government assistance. And there have already been and will continue to be cuts in the welfare payments and rental subsidies that keep poor buildings afloat.
Poor tenants have always depended on the city to regulate private landlords. But the city's housing regulatory system has shrunk into what can seem like a parody of its noble intentions; the slashed force of housing inspectors responds only to emergency complaints, and even then, does so little follow-up that many landlords feel free either to ignore their orders or to lie to the city about repairs never made.
"It seems that we have almost given up the concept of preserving the housing stock in this city through code enforcement," said Joseph M. Corso, president of Local 211 of the Allied Building Inspectors union. "Maybe that's because it's so easy to forget what's really happening inside private buildings until they fall down or burst into fire and somebody dies."
Yet, the city's own apartment buildings -- thousands of them, taken from deadbeat landlords -- are in the worst repair of all; many experts see this as emblematic of a failure of municipal will on the entire issue of low-income housing.
A basic tenet of Riis and the housing reformers was that insuring decent housing was a prerequisite for a humane society -- that the public conscience would not tolerate the kind of conditions he had documented.
But while this century began with the optimism that bad living conditions could be reformed out of existence, it is ending with a tacit official acceptance that any home is preferable to no home at all.
 
The Housing Ladder
On the Lowest Rungs, The Most Hope
Think of low-income housing as a ladder, with the meanest dwelling -- the cellar cubicle, the mattress on the dormitory floor -- at the bottom and public housing at the top. But it is a treacherous ladder, with a built-in paradox: it is often those on the lowest rung who feel the least trapped.
Take L. Ping, 21, whose small tenement apartment on Elizabeth Street resembles a beached submarine, lined with stacks of the hand-sawed bunk beds that many recent Chinese immigrants call home.
When he returns late at night from his job as a restaurant cashier, he eases off his shoes and climbs into his allotted space. He often takes out a knife and whittles flowers from potatoes, practicing to be a chef. Or he hunches over a small notebook, composing Chinese aphorisms that are a kind of mantra for survival: "As long as you are courageous and hold your head up high," he writes, "bitter juice will turn into sweet wine."
Like Mr. Ping or H.D. Zheng, who lives in yet another Lower East Side bunkroom, many of the worst-off tenants are recent immigrants. Eking out an existence on the absolute edge of society, confident that their only path can be up, they festoon their wretched spaces with plastic flowers or scrub them to a patina of decency.
Three years after arriving in this country from the coastal province of Fujian, Mr. Zheng, 35, is still working off a $30,000 debt to the smugglers who secured him passage on a series of ships. He can devote very little of his meager busboy's salary to rent, so he has 11 roommates. They share a studio bracketed by triple-tiered bunk beds, with a narrow passage like a gangplank between them. One bachelor household among two dozen others in a complex of three low-rise buildings on Allen Street, they split a rent of $650 a month, paying about $54 each.
Like the others, Mr. Zheng keeps his scant belongings in a plastic bag above his mattress, nailed beside the herbal-medicine pouches and girlie pictures that decorate his rectangle of wall. And like them, he curls into his allotted space without grumbling -- except, perhaps, for one small complaint.
"Fujianese girls in America are very materialistic," he says. "The first question they ask is, 'Do you have your own apartment?' and if you don't, they won't look at you."
Still, Mr. Zheng says, he knows from the example of more-established immigrants that he will not have to live forever in a communal home bereft of any grace or privacy. Now, he may have to share his nightly dinner of rice gruel and mustard greens with a pack of relative strangers, their tiny television tuned to an Italian soap opera as incomprehensible as anything on English-language television. But soon, he feels certain, he will have a room of his own, however small or dismal, in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, say, or Flushing, Queens.
Jose Moreno Reyes, a Harlem resident born in the Dominican Republic, once knew that kind of faith. But like other more-established immigrants, he took that first step toward a higher standard of living too long ago to appreciate it any more.
Now, he is an American citizen, with a long work history at a clothing factory in New Jersey. But that doesn't buy him any better than a rotten apartment at the top of a rickety stairway in an aging brownstone that lists to one side. "The building is bad," he said. "The building is broken."
When Mr. Reyes, who is 58, came to New York 13 years ago, he slept on his brother's couch until he found a good job packing clothes at a factory. Then he moved into the tiny two-room apartment in Harlem, expecting it to be a stepping stone.
Over the years, as three of his children joined him there, the building deteriorated, and by the time his wife and youngest son immigrated last spring, they were so ashamed of where they lived that they did not even throw a party to celebrate their reunion.
Not that there would have been room for one -- although, they point out, the place feels a lot roomier during the evening, when everyone is sitting up, than at night, when everyone is stretched out.
Mr. Reyes's oldest children -- Belta and Manuel, both 24, and Eduardo, 22 -- sleep head to toe in the bedroom, which measures 7 by 14 feet. Through a doorway covered only by a bedsheet, in a living room that is 9 by 10 feet, Mr. and Mrs. Reyes squeeze onto a cot that is flush against the sofa where their 20-year-old son, Carlos, spends the night.
A wire, draped with clothes, traverses the rooms -- a closet on a rope. The communal kitchen, which has no ceiling and a corroded linoleum floor, and bathroom are out in the hall. The apartment is infested with vermin and littered with sticky traps. "We live like animals," he said. "The rats crawl over us, and roaches fall in our cooking pots."
Mr. Reyes said he had repeatedly asked for the city to send a housing inspector to his building, but no one had ever come. It wasn't that he actually believed they might make repairs, he said, but he wanted a written report that might persuade the Housing Authority to give him some kind of priority for public housing.
"It is immoral for the city to ignore us," he said. "We've got one foot in the streets, and the other in this tinderbox."
Constantly looking for a new apartment, he never finds anything better at the same rent: $400 a month. Too many buildings have drug problems, which he will not tolerate, or demand security deposits he cannot afford. Dozens of times, he says, he has greased the palms of superintendents with an illegal $50 fee just to see apartments no bigger or better than his own -- and more expensive.
Jeanette Rowe thought she had taken a step up when she moved with her five young children, ages 2 to 13, from an illegal room to an illegal cellar apartment in Laurelton, Queens. Ms. Rowe, a native of Queens who depends on welfare but has a high school diploma and swears she will get a job once her youngest child is in school, had no idea there was such a thing as an illegal home. "So many folks live in basements around here," she said.
Even with the half-windows painted shut, her cellar home seemed spaciously luxurious -- until the leaks began and the appliances gave way. Then, because she withheld her $550-a-month rent when her demands for repairs went unmet, Ms. Rowe found herself facing eviction from a home that wasn't legal or fire-safe -- but was better than nothing. "My main concern is for the children to have somewhere to stay, if it's a cellar or an attic or what," said Ms. Rowe, who ended up voluntarily leaving the cellar at the end of June to double up with a friend's family as she figured out what to do next.
In Bushwick, Miss Pagan, who retired from the cafeteria at Public School 124 in the Bronx after 26 years as a school employee, was too old and infirm to search for another apartment herself. She just kept waiting for help from her landlord, because her landlord was the city, and the city kept promising to help, especially during the year and a half after her ceiling collapsed.
"I was doing the dishes when it fell like in an earthquake," she said. "I ran, and thanks to God I wasn't hurt."
The city did erect makeshift beams to hold up a temporary plywood ceiling in her kitchen, but left uncovered the gaping holes in her bathroom, with its exposed heating pipes and wires and a clear view of the rotting floorboards above. Because the bathroom sink did not work, Miss Pagan had to scoop water from her toilet to wash her hands and brush her teeth, bending slowly in her floral house dress and pink slippers.
As a sign, perhaps, of where she was placing her hopes, Miss Pagan had hung a plaque on her living-room wall. "God Bless This Home," it read.
"It's not so bad here," Miss Pagan said in February. "At least there is good steam." The next month, the boiler died, and there was no heat at all for the rest of the winter.
Occasionally, her upstairs neighbor, Carmen Torres, checked in on her. But Ms. Torres, a 46-year-old grandmother who lived with her mentally incapacitated daughter and five grandchildren, including a 9-month-old infant, had problems enough of her own.
In the spring, Mrs. Torres said: "Some days I wake up and wonder how exactly we'll all die. Will we fall to our deaths when the floor gives way, or be crushed when the ceiling falls, or die in a fire because we can't make it out our broken window?"
 
A New York Problem
Issues and Answers All Start in the City
Birthplace of both the American tenement and public housing, New York has always been home to the nation's most severe housing problems and to some of its most creative solutions. And while the shortage of affordable housing is a national problem, New York remains at the heart of the nation's housing story.
According to the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, more Americans -- 5.3 million -- have "severe housing crises" now than at any point in the last 20 years, when the Government began measuring. But the New York metropolitan area has the greatest number of households with what are known as worst-case needs -- that is, those paying more than half their incomes for rent or living in substandard conditions or both, according to HUD.
And those needs have been growing, largely because of rising rents, falling incomes, gentrification and the persistent abandonment of buildings in low-income neighborhoods, many of them overleveraged during the speculation of the 80's. Further, among old American cities with an aging housing stock, New York is one of the very few that is gaining population.
According to the most recent city housing survey, the number of apartments renting for $450 a month or less fell 40 percent between 1981 and 1993. And the vacancy rate was near zero for the very cheapest apartments -- those going for $300 a month, barely affordable to families dependent on menial jobs or on welfare, with its average monthly shelter allowance of $286.
Over that same decade, the 40,000 new apartments of Mr. Koch's more than $4 billion housing program revitalized patches of devastated neighborhoods throughout the city, especially in the South Bronx. But housing analysts say around 300,000 more low-income homes are needed.
And the poorest of New York's tenants are growing more impoverished as they struggle to pay the rent.
Anthony Blackburn, a consultant who analyzed data for the city in its most recent housing survey, found a crisis that had grown "more, not less, severe" over the previous decade for almost half the city's tenants. The poorest fifth, he found, now spend 80 percent of their incomes on rent, compared with 60 percent a decade ago.
For most of the city's poor people, public housing remains the hope -- the grail. But the waiting lists for housing assistance -- both public housing and rental vouchers -- are the longest in history, with 336,000 families. Late last year, for the first time ever, the Housing Authority closed the door on new applicants for Section 8 rent subsidies, the sole Government program to help poor people pay rent in private apartments, after calculating that it would take six years to interview all who had already applied.
All of which adds up to this startling statistic: While more than half of New York City's renters are poor enough to qualify for Federal housing assistance, most do not receive it; many do not even apply.
So for now their only option is to rent private housing in a famously expensive market where affluent people battle for the right to pay $3,500 a month for a two-bedroom flat with "original plumbing."
And that option is circumscribed.
"People who are poor are significantly poorer than a decade ago. So what do they do?" said Liz Krueger, associate director of Community Food Resources, a nonprofit group that helps poor people. "They punt, and one of the most obvious ways is to move down the food chain for housing."
 
One Building's Tale
Model Apartments Fall Into Squalor
Almost building by building, the city's current housing crisis echoes with history, with hopes dashed and lessons learned. On the Lower East Side, 211 Madison Street is a case in point.
In 1887, three years before Riis published his landmark book, "How the Other Half Lives," a picture framer named Henry Waters built a squat brick apartment house there and named it the Henrietta. Its five solid stories, a $19,000 investment, seemed a clear aspiration to a decent future amid the neighborhood's rookeries.
By 1905, Mr. Waters had filled his 22 apartments with 107 immigrants, mostly Russian Jews, according to the handwritten census taken then. Louis Becker, a painter, lived there with his wife and five children, and Sarah Horowitz, a bookkeeper, with her parents. With their neighbors -- a cigar maker, an ice cream maker, a presser, a folder, a milliner and a corset maker -- they made a portrait in miniature of the turn-of-the-century Lower East Side.
Today, 211 Madison Street is a rundown relic that long ago abandoned its role as a model of decent housing. Its residents are late-20th-century equivalents of those Russian Jews: Chinese immigrants who work in garment factories and return home, variously, to filth, broken windows, leaking ceilings, peeling lead paint, blocked fire exits and "hot" water of 52 degrees. The superintendent, Luis Gonzalez, collects and redeems cans to buy light bulbs for the hallways.
On the first floor of 211 Madison, an elderly couple -- Deng Peiwen, a retired garment worker, and her husband, Ting Dong Huang, a retired dishwasher -- taped garbage bags over their windows to keep out the winter cold, and hammered wooden planks over rat holes in their sinking floor. Tired of complaining without results and too old to consider moving, they finally asked their son to take on the landlord's responsibilities for repairs, glumly accepting an idea that many of their neighbors share: that an affordable apartment is in itself a kind of gift from the landlord, who can be asked for nothing more.
The owner of 211 Madison Street, Kai H. Lo, stands out as a landlord so negligent that the city has devoted scarce resources to pursuing him. But it has been a frustrating legal battle, never finished. The building has racked up 752 violations; Mr. Lo has paid the city $45,000 in fines over the last decade.
But he owes $47,000 for repairs the city has made on the building, and for unpaid taxes and water bills. And as he corrects some violations, Mr. Lo accumulates new ones.
In 1989, for instance, city officials ordered him to remove the tenants living illegally in cubicles in his basement; in 1991, they issued the same order; and in 1994, they cited him six more times for renting out basement space. Yet when a small fire broke out in the building last year, firefighters found 15 immigrants living in the basement.
Last spring, after many tenants had been on a rent strike for months, Mr. Lo made enough repairs that the city considered 86 violations corrected when it inspected in late June. But as of Friday, he had 157 violations outstanding, many new. Mr. Lo has not returned telephone calls seeking comment.
"He is a real problem," said Mari Carlesimo, an assistant housing commissioner. "Kai Lo needs the constant pressure of litigation to force him to tend to his buildings, but the problems never stop appearing.
"Sometimes you wonder, are you just going through an awful lot of effort to end up back in the same place?"
 
Revisiting History
Is Any Housing Better Than None?
Tenants in the Bushwick tenement of Miss Pagan say their landlord, the city, told them it would not fumigate their building because it was not worth even that expense. Still, that did not mean the city could provide them with anything better, the tenants say they were told. "We were supposed to feel lucky," Mrs. Torres said. "We weren't homeless."
That has become the official bottom line for city officials dealing with the poor: To eliminate crowded and illegal housing would ultimately mean condemning thousands to the streets or the filled shelters.
When Riis exposed the squalor of the slums, the dilemma was the same. In 1894, American Architect magazine wrote, "If the tenants are ordered out of houses unfit for habitation, they have no other place to go."
Riis and the housing reformers, though, saw that as a false choice. And so, even as their work displaced thousands, they gave birth to a movement that led to the demolition or improvement of tenements, to stringent codes that regulated everything from ventilation to space per person, and, eventually, to public and subsidized housing.
Over the next century, however, those gains were repeatedly lost during economic declines and political changes in a city that never made poor tenants a priority for long.
During and after World War I, for instance, the tenements boarded up in the heyday of the reform movement were reopened to ease a severe housing shortage. And they quickly became overcrowded. But while this time they were clearly illegal, the city considered it impractical to enforce the law. Besides, for fiscal reasons, the city had cut the number of inspectors by half.
Many political mood swings later, by the start of the 1990's, the city seemed again to have lost its sense of mission about insuring decent housing for all. Not only was the housing-inspection force a shadow of its former self, but Housing Court, created amid idealistic rhetoric in 1973 to enforce the housing maintenance code, had devolved into a kind of collection agency for rents.
By the time Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani took office in 1994, even public housing was at least 25 percent above capacity, in violation of Federal regulations. And the city was too busy focusing on housing crises -- people already homeless and buildings already falling apart -- to think about preventing them.
"The way I see it our city's attitude toward housing boils down to this: Instead of doing primary care, we only do emergency-room stuff," said Ms. Krueger of Community Food Resources.
Some housing experts believe that government intervention has not worked, and that the real estate market should be left to regulate itself. Indeed, a battle to weaken, if not abolish, rent controls is expected when they expire next year. But most experts agree that decent low-income housing requires strong government involvement: a combination of direct investment, subsidies to landlords and stringent oversight.
In an era of fiscal restraint and retrenchment in social welfare policy, though, the government's goal is to minimize its role.
Starting last summer, for instance, the Giuliani administration decided that families living doubled up with other families would be ineligible for beds in city shelters.
And like its predecessors, the administration contends that it is not the city's role to act as landlord of last resort to the city's poorest tenants. So the city has not only stopped foreclosing on properties in tax arrears but has started trying to return its vast inventory of rundown buildings to the private sector. Although many tenant advocates criticize this move because they expect that a cycle of investment and abandonment cannot help but repeat itself, city officials discount their criticism, reminding them that the city has been a terrible landlord.
"It's inexcusable that, as a landlord of last resort, we run poor buildings," Ms. Barrios-Paoli, the Housing Commissioner, said. "That's why we shouldn't be in the business."
Back at the turn of the century, the health of the slums was seen to impinge directly on the health of the city; to regulate housing for the poor was to inoculate the city at large against the physical and social ills believed to breed in their homes.
"Preventing fire and contagion, that's what urban housing policies were all about, and I think we've forgotten that," said Dr. Ernest Drucker, a professor of epidemiology at Albert Einstein Medical College, who has studied the link between crowded living and childhood tuberculosis in the Bronx. There, he has found, both have returned to the peak levels of the Great Depression.
At 84, Jane Benedict is the doyenne of the housing reform movement, the retired chairwoman of the Metropolitan Council on Housing. She says it has always been "clear as bells" to her that housing reform was not just a liberal impulse but an investment in the common cause. But now, she wearily concludes that others either do not see this as clearly or do not care.
"I think this is the lowest point I've seen," she said. "The politicians don't even care about the homeless anymore, so how are they going to begin to care about the way people live?"
 
When Officials Act
Help Comes Slowly, If It Comes at All
City officials knew Ana Nunez was living in extremely overcrowded conditions; she was certified as a top priority for public housing four years ago. And they knew Maria Pagan was living in a dilapidated building with collapsed ceilings; the city owned it.
But each woman had a roof, if not a ceiling, over her head, and so neither was considered officially in crisis.
Weeks after a Times reporter described the condition of Miss Pagan's building to a spokeswoman for the Housing Preservation and Development Department, the tenants were moved. They were told, they said, that the move was urgent, that their 76-year-old building, with the wooden brace supporting its foundation, was unstable. "It was very confusing," Miss Pagan said. "They put me off for years, and suddenly they decided my situation was an emergency."
The housing agency did not grant interviews with the building's managers, who would not speak without approval. In a written response, the agency said the building was "temporarily closed in order to perform systems replacement work."
After a reporter described Miss Pagan's living conditions, however, Commissioner Barrios-Paoli said: "God knows no one should live in buildings like that. Her manager should have closed that building before you brought it to our attention."
Miss Pagan is now living in another city-owned building in Bushwick. "I can only thank God that I have a new home for my remaining years," she said.
On Clinton Street, above the pawnshop and the Dominican restaurant, Ms. Nunez's room is an illegal living space in a two-story building that was once solely commercial and is now certified to have two full apartments with complete bathrooms and kitchens. It is, effectively, an illegal single-room occupancy that violates the most basic size and occupancy rules for S.R.O.'s: children are not allowed and no more than two people should be housed in no less than 140 square feet.
Still, Ms. Nunez's home is not hidden from the authorities. School counselors have visited, lamenting quarters so close that they seemed to explain Wanda's troubles in school. When Kenny had tuberculosis, Ms. Nunez told his social worker that she thought their small room was a breeding ground for germs; the social worker said housing was not her responsibility. And welfare officials even send Ms. Nunez's shelter allowance -- $312 a month -- directly to her landlord.
Through the years, Ms. Nunez has felt indebted to her landlord, who first rented the room just to her. After she brought her older children from the Dominican Republic and gave birth to a third, he told her it was not legal or safe to stay, but he did not kick her out. He even installed the gas stove, and divided the room with a partition.
"I kept telling her the apartment was too small for all of them," the landlord, Henry Hallivis, said. "First there was one, then three, then four. Oh, my God, a baby in there. And then the tuberculosis! It was a disaster.
"But she kept saying she would get into the projects. The projects, the projects. Tomorrow, she'd say. Always tomorrow."
An inspector from the Buildings Department showed up in June, but the landlord need not have worried: The inspector's visit was indirectly prompted by a reporter's inquiry to the housing agency, which, believing the building to be simply a commercial one, filed a complaint with Buildings, urging an investigation of its illegal use as a residence.
Somehow, the housing agency's complaint was miscommunicated or misunderstood: the inspector was instructed to look for "an illegal commercial use." He found none.
And, not knowing there was any reason to search further, he never climbed the steps to the second floor, where Ms. Nunez, Kenny, Wanda and Katarin feel as if the walls are closing in on them.

New York's low-income housing crisis is the result of a powerful mix of economic and demographic changes: The demand for low-income housing has risen because of deepening poverty and the arrival of vast numbers of new immigrants, many of them poor. But the supply of such apartments has simply withered away, 1981-1993. (Sources: Prof. Andrew A.

HEADLINE: Cyber-Retailers Hitting the Web For Wider Markets

BYLINE: By BILL SLOCUM 

 BODY:
THE doors of the Cyberian Outpost computer supply outlet in Kent have been locked for months now. The storefront scene is one all too familiar in Connecticut: Yellowing display posters, dusty windows, a floor strewn with boxes.
Yet the reasons for the store's closing are not the usual ones, like minuscule clientele or through-the-roof rents. Neither was competition; the Cyberian Outpost was the only computer store of its kind for miles around. Rather, Darryl Peck, the owner, shut it up because "it didn't make sense," he said. "If we did $400 of business a day down here, we'd do that in 12 seconds upstairs." 
 Upstairs, in a section of somewhat sparse-looking offices in the Kent Town Center's second floor, is where Cyberian Outpost has made its name. Mr. Peck says 7,000 people visit each day, though one wouldn't bump into any of them on the way to the water cooler. That's because all the shopping is done on-line, via the World Wide Web.
Cyberian Outpost began life only last year, in a 500-square-foot combination warehouse and office in Mr. Peck's hometown of Sharon. The idea of establishing a computer store accessible only via the Internet came to Mr. Peck, then an out-of-work software company executive, when he spent some of his new downtime surfing the World Wide Web, a multimedia avenue of the Internet.
"I immediately thought, 'This is what I must do with my life,' " he said. "Clearly there was a living to be made off the Web. The question is how to do that."
With Cyberian Outpost, he believes he has found the answer. After clicking onto its web-site address (http:// www.cybout.com), the viewer arrives at a brightly colored home page display menu. Viewers can select what kinds of computer products they want and whether they want them in Macintosh or IBM-PC format. There is even a parade of flags from almost a dozen different countries; click on one and the text will be re-rendered in that language.
Clicking a particular item will call up a description and often a photograph of a product. To order, tap a display with the cursor arrow. Because many customers are leery of giving credit card numbers over the Internet, a telephone number for that purpose is provided.
Mr. Peck says that Cyberian Outpost has been doubling its business every 90 days, and is within range of becoming a $20 million company by the end of the year. Also doubling will be the staff, with some 25 new employees anticipated in time for the holidays. That is a long way from Cyberian Outpost's beginnings in early 1995, when it was started with only $28,000 and two staffers: Mr. Peck and a sales director.
Because it is not a store, there is no need to hire clerks or rent prime commercial space. Because it is not a typical mail-order operation, there is no need to print or ship thousands of catalogues several times a year to potential customers. And the ability to change or update the Web site to account for new products or prices is instantaneous. Mr. Peck estimated that Cyberian Outpost makes 500 such changes each day.
"In all due modesty, we have been by far the most successful retail venture ever to open on the Internet," he said. "We know we're onto a good thing here."
When it comes to the advantages of getting on the Web, many Connecticut-based businesses would seem to agree. According to a Connecticut Business and Industry Association report released in September, a third of employees at small and mid-sized businesses in the state use the Internet regularly, up from 14 percent in 1995. And 15 percent of small businesses now have a Web site. "We pretty much had a doubling of use of the net by small business," said Kim Trumbore, a C.B.I.A. analyst. "The results also represent how quickly small and mid-sized businesses have been accessing technology. They need to adapt to change to stay competitive."
The Internet isn't just for computer people. Evelyn Siefert Kennedy owns a textile restoration and appraisal firm in Groton called Sew tique. Late last year, she decided to put up a home page, hiring an independent contractor to design it.
"We're averaging six hits a day," she said, meaning visitors to the Web site. If that translates into just one contract a month, it's no small thing. A single job of making a wedding dress or repairing a quilt is rewarding enough, and there is the ancillary benefit of getting the store's name out to a very wide audience indeed. Ms. Kennedy noted Sewtique has attracted clients from as far away as Australia by virtue of the site.
The Sewtique web site (http:// members.aol.com/sewtique) is not nearly as flashy as Cyberian Outpost, but it has its own charm. A photograph of the shop is displayed, and buttons below invite the browser to choose from a slew of possible services.
When it comes to wiring up small businesses to the Internet, Bryan Adams likes to think he has the market cornered. That is because Mr. Adams is owner of WebToad Advertising, a Hartford-based firm that produces, among other services, the Hartford Index. An on-line directory, the Hartford Index (http://webtoad.com) provides listings for some 200 businesses in the Hartford area. A key element is that it only lists companies within driving range of the city, in order to boost its local appeal.
So far, results are mixed. The Hartford Index lists addresses and telephone numbers free of charge, hoping to earn its revenue through specialized services like graphic displays and Web sites that can be accessed through Hypertext Multi-Link formatting.
Campus Pizza, for example, has a display window that includes a handy pull-out directional map. So far, only a few companies have opted to do this.
"We have built a good engine, but unless the word gets out, we're not going to be able to develop it," Mr. Adams said. "The problem is it's hard to explain just what on earth it is we're talking about."
Many note the concept of the Internet is still fairly young. "We're really still in the build-out or novelty phase," said Bob Allen, a managing partner at Modem Media LP in Westport. "The real growth is two to three, even five years ahead of us."
Modem Media, which was started the day the stock market crashed in 1987, a pioneer in setting up Web pages for corporate clients like AT&T and Delta Airlines, now employs 140 people.
New operations are sprouting up regularly in the state, like the Women's Global Business Alliance, LLC, a for-profit operation based in Westport that will offer a Web-based list of contacts and advice for female corporate executives when it makes its debut in November.
The Alliance web site will offer browsers free access "to a certain level," and then provide a members-only station, according to an Alliance founder, Deborah Polydys. "Globally, the women's market is ready to explode," she added.
While Ms. Polydys notes surveys that say men are more likely to surf the net than women are, Ms. Polydys takes heart in another survey result showing that women are more likely to linger at a particular site.
"Technology is a way to even the playing field," she said. "We're looking to be The Wall Street Journal for women."
Can the Internet be the mechanism by which Connecticut finally emerges from its economic doldrums? Can it be to the 21st century what the telephone has been to this one? There are skeptics who question some business applications, particularly Web stores like Cyberian Outpost.
"It's kind of come and gone," said Michael J. Walsh, president of Internet Info Inc. of Falls River, Va., about the cyber-store innovation. "The biggest problem is that they don't offer consumer price and selection."
Others agree the business is due for further shakeouts. Tristian Louis, development director at iWORLD, an on-line magazine of Internet news based in Westport, notes there are currently about a hundred on-line malls, and that "the offer is now greater than the demand."
"They are usually a glorified mail-order catalogue," Mr. Louis said.
He wasn't familiar with Cyberian Outpost, but agreed to take a look. He came away with some positive first impressions. Their telephone feature for credit card purchases was a good attempt to alleviate customer fears, he said, and a feature that suggested complementary items for a particular purchase was noteworthy. "It creates more impulse purchases," he said.
Not everyone is so impressed. Dale Dougherty, president of Songline Studios in Sebastopol, Calif., said he has a "casual acquaintance" with Cyberian Outpost from making price comparisons, and that the site did not provide enough information about some items. "It's like shopping in a warehouse," he said.
Guy Kawasaki, an executive with Apple Computer Inc. said Cyberian Outpost challenges the notion that cyber-stores have run their course. "They belong in the category of stores that belong on the net," he said.
Cyberian Outpost began as a forum exclusively for Apple products and prides itself today as a place for Mac owners to go in an increasingly personal computer-centered universe. "One of the great myths is that Macintosh has no software, or less software," Mr. Kawasaki said. "People like Cyberian Outpost challenge that."
Mr. Peck disputes claims that retail on the Web is a done thing. In fact, he says, it's only just begun.
"Every piece of research shows electronic commerce is going to grow in leaps and bounds," he said. "Some of the research shows it's going to be a $7 billion business. That's what's going to drive the Internet. Sure nine out of ten will fail. But that's because most create terrible Web sites."
As he sees it: "The World Wide Web is the world's first global consumer marketplace."

One Son Learns Lessons From a Father . . .

BYLINE: By TOURE 

 BODY:
NOT LONG AGO, Olu Dara, a 55-year old jazz and blues trumpeter who once played with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, lighted a pipe, turned on the CD player in his cozy Harlem apartment and put on "Illmatic," the debut album from a popular 23-year-old rapper named Nas. "My goodness," he recalled thinking at the time. "It sounds like something I would've done."
Nas is Mr. Dara's son, and Nas's latest album, "It Was Written," has sold more than two million copies. He and his father share a musical philosophy, even though their styles are as different as their upbringings. And for these reasons their relationship illuminates how a musical heritage can be passed down in a family. 
 Mr. Dara grew up in Natchez, Miss., during the 40's and 50's to become a jovial country gentleman who is charmingly young at heart. (He was born Charles Jones 3d and took his current name in the 60's.) His music, which he calls "creative rhythm music," draws from jazz, folk, blues and Caribbean roots.
His father was a well-known singer and his uncles were traveling minstrels. His great-uncles were performers in the historic Rabbit's Foot and Silas Green touring carnivals. And his grandfather, who traveled through the South as a W.P.A. foreman, had a reputation for bursting into song to entertain his workers.
At age 7, Mr. Dara began playing the trumpet professionally, and he spent much of his youth touring the South. In the 1960's and 70's he gained acclaim in the jazz world while playing with Blakey and recording with Taj Mahal, Bobby Womack, David Murray and many others. Mr. Dara recently wrote and performed music for a play by Rita Dove called "The Darker Face of the Earth." He also appears as a musician in Robert Altman's recent film "Kansas City."
"When I was a kid on Sundays, we'd lay back and listen to my father on the radio," Mr. Dara recalled. "So it's almost like I expected to hear Nas on the radio or see him in performance."
Nas's full name is Nasir Jones. (Nasir, which Mr. Dara chose, means helper and protector in Arabic.) He and his younger brother, Jungle, were raised by their mother, Fannie Ann Jones, in the tough Queensbridge Houses, a housing project in Long Island City, Queens. During his teens, Nas was a break dancer who used the name Kid Wave. Now he is quiet and pensive, an introspective old soul. His music is hard-core hip-hop with lyrics like tightly written street poetry.
"Music is in my blood," Nas said while sitting at a console at a Manhattan recording studio. "I could have chosen to do a lot of other things. I could have been a scientist, a lawyer. But this is where I'm comfortable at, right here."
When "Illmatic" was released in 1994, it was hailed as a classic. (Mr. Dara appears on it in one song playing a short and poignant trumpet solo.) Nas was compared favorably with Rakim, who is considered the best rapper ever. A few months ago Nas released "It Was Written," and it immediately leaped to the top of the Billboard charts.
Nas's music is characterized by a laid-back cool, with a penchant for medium-pace tempos and relatively sparse tracks, all of which are hallmarks of his father's music. "He has different genres of songs," Mr. Dara said of Nas, "but in each one, the chords he has going, the economy, the smoothness, the nonaggressiveness. . . . His aggressive is cool. Not like, 'I'm angry! I'm mad!' It's cool. And that's the way my music is."
Vernon Reid, the legendary guitarist who has played with Mr. Dara and is a fan of Nas's music, also noted similarities between the two. "Both have a finely tuned sense of irony, which I think is evident in Nas's lyrics and Olu's playing as well," Mr. Reid said. "There's a kind of cockeyed way of looking at the world. A raised eyebrow. Sly. They're seeing what's going on underneath the surface."
Nas agreed. Speaking of his father, he said, "The certain sound that he likes, that's the sound that I like."
HOW IS IT THAT TWO MEN WHO ARE SO different and who work within different genres make music that shares so much? "It's probably genetic," Nas said. "And just growing up with music being around, instruments being around. It's just inspirational."
Wynton Marsalis, the jazz trumpeter who is himself the product of a famous musical family, agreed with this theory. "I think you mainly learn music from hearing it, and also from seeing how musicians act, the way they talk to each other, their work ethic," he said. "Being in a musical family means you're always around music. You grow up with it. Musicians are always around other musicians. They're always having rehearsal at the house. They're listening to music. They're always talking about music."
In Nas's family, music is a central mode of communication. "When we get together, there's no words thrown away, no idle talk," Mr. Dara said. "We'll sit down, play drums and just conversate musically."
Jungle, who is not a rapper, remembers such moments. "Soon as I come in my father's house," he said, "he'll start talking about an instrument, and he'll teach me how to play something, and next thing you know we're playing our own song."
One recent afternoon Mr. Dara, Nas and Jungle were at the studio. Nas began sounding out a beat with is palms. A moment later, Mr. Dara tapped out a counter-rhythm with the tips of his fingers. It seemed a father-son collaboration was imminent. But as soon as it started, the beat fell away, and the room passed back into silence.
"In the future," Jungle said later that afternoon, "Nas and my father are probably going to get together and make some stuff. Maybe an album. They talk about that. That's probably why he had Nas."

HEADLINE: The Rough Rider and the Easy One

BYLINE: By Edmund Morris; Edmund Morris, the author of "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt," is at work on a biography of Ronald Reagan.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Twenty years ago, during an out-of-town tryout of the musical "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue," I was intrigued by the actor Ken Howard's ability to transform himself from President to President with the aid of a quickly applied prop or two, and adroit changes of voice and gesture. Although he was big and blond, he needed only to clamp on some pince-nez, and snap his teeth at the audience to become a creditable Theodore Roosevelt. The audience burst into applause.
The current resident of the White House has recently pulled off a similar coup de theatre, inspired no doubt by the success of his Truman skit last year and his masterly impersonation of Ronald Reagan before both houses of Congress last January. One remembers, further, that in his youth he modeled himself on John F. Kennedy and vowed on entering the White House to become another Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
 Should the scholarly gravediggers who wish to exhume Lincoln ever succeed in their quest and parade the Emancipator's bones on the nightly news, we must brace for appearances by Mr. Clinton in a stovepipe hat. In the meantime, he's found his latest vein of mimicry in T.R.
Not coincidentally, the 26th President is hot at the moment. Tonight and tomorrow, PBS will broadcast a major documentary on his life and times. Mr. Clinton has a bust of him on his desk (along with busts of all the other Presidents mentioned above), and I'll bet that at times during the recent Netanyahu-Arafat summit he thought wistfully of T.R.'s Nobel Peace Prize, glistening like a chimera on the mantel of the Roosevelt Room.
It is natural, given the loneliness of supreme power, for a chief executive to identify with his more distant predecessors (consecutive Presidents hardly ever get along, as anyone studying photographs of them together can see). We all know about Richard Nixon's chats with Honest Abe, and Ronald Reagan told me, with entire lack of self-consciousness, that he and Thomas Jefferson liked to "look at each other" across the Mall.
Usually, however, such moments of self-identification are private. When Mr. Clinton evokes T.R. on horseback in Wyoming, or wearing cowboy boots and khakis at the edge of the Grand Canyon, he invites public comparison with the Rough Rider -- at his considerable peril.
There are many parallels between them as campaigners for their respective second terms in the White House. Overwhelming personal charm, youthfulness -- T.R. was 45 on this date in 1904, Mr. Clinton is just 50 -- acute political intelligence, garrulousness, love of applause, love of people, luck: the list could be extended right down to prowess at the lunch table and their common enjoyment of a hapless opponent.
If we compare them intellectually, however, such a void opens up as to isolate them from each other, on the north and south rims of our regard. Mr. Clinton's new book "Between Hope and History" happens to be exactly the same length as T.R.'s official letter accepting the Republican nomination in 1904, and since both documents were published in late summer for the same political purpose, a side-by-side reading is instructive.
To begin with, there is the question of gravitas. I allowed Mr. Clinton's book to fall open at page 57, and found that of its 191 words, only 31 had any particular meaning. The rest of the space was devoted to cliches (one every three lines), generalities like "investing in the capacity of our people," redundancies and extremely vague statistics, of which my favorite was his claim to have made "improvements in the bottom lines of average Americans."
Out of sympathy as well as fairness, I deliberately chose one of the least noun-dense, fact-packed paragraphs of T.R.'s own manifesto (interested readers may find it at the foot of page 937, Volume IV, of his collected letters). In 14 lines, there is not a single cliche, and only 10 unnecessary words. Every sentence states something concrete, and all the emotions -- contempt for governmental critics, impatience with naysayers, veneration for veterans, sympathy for farmers, excitement over the implications of his Reclamation Act -- are genuine and strong. One senses a passionately self-directed man whose mind moves like an oiled combine over every dry stalk of policy, neatly stacking and sorting.
In contrast, Mr. Clinton has what T.R. would call "a fatal lack of sequitur." He drives without steering, and he would as soon process weeds as wheat. "Between Hope and History" reads like a series of improvised speeches (incessantly punctured by the word "I"), although his publisher assures us that the text was "labored" over for many months, and his uncredited co-author says the final book is "80 percent Bill Clinton." T.R.'s enormous letter was dictated -- probably during the course of a morning -- but it is clearly the work of a disciplined writer.
Of course, we do not elect Presidents for their prose style. Mr. Clinton is unquestionably sincere -- for the moment -- in asking us to equate him with T.R. the mediator, the environmentalist, the bully-pulpit thumper, the legislative reformer. All these aims are noble, providing he closely examines T.R.'s actual record of achievement, which was a lot less progressive than he seems to think.
On the environment, for example, T.R. was by no means a tree-hugger. When it came to a choice between scenery and the homesteader desperate for firewood and aqueducts, he paid little heed to the protests of preservationists.
"It is a cardinal principle of the forest-reserve policy of this Administration that the reserves are for use," he said in his Fourth Annual Message. Similarly, the great Trust Buster prosecuted the Northern Securities Corporation more to make a moral point (that government maintained the right to regulate a free economy) than to declare any kind of war on Wall Street. His successor, William Howard Taft, whom he lambasted for being pro-business, in reality busted more trusts than he did.
There was, moreover, a lordly hauteur about T.R.'s foreign policy, and a hair-trigger willingness to deploy gunboats when crossed, that Mr. Clinton surely does not wish to emulate. (Watch him whip off those pince-nez at the slightest hint of trouble in Panama!) He rightly sees today's world as a flux of forces -- interactive, freewheeling, cyberspatial -- rather than power blocs separated by steel and saltwater.
It is tempting to speculate, in the manner of those old "Impossible Interviews" in Vanity Fair, how Teddy and Bill would get along today should they bump into each other on the campaign trail. One imagines that Mr. Clinton would avoid any discussion of the Vietnam War, not to mention his veto of the late-term abortion bill, which would undoubtedly result in an abrupt end to the conversation. (Of all Theodore Roosevelt's convictions, the deepest was his reverence for life.)
They would admire each other's power of memory, political skills and stage manner, and laugh at their shared habit of saying, "in closing" before 3,000 words of peroration. Mr. Roosevelt would notice that Mr. Clinton, behind his joviality, has no humor, while the latter would be dismayed by T.R.'s binary way of looking at things: Good vs. Evil, Strong vs. Weak, Duty vs. Dereliction.
Such speculations, though, are historically vain. For the moment, Mr. Clinton has as much right as Theodore Roosevelt to preen before a largely contented electorate. It is encouraging that he, too, wants to be remembered for effecting great changes in a time of peace. But he might bear in mind, as he almost certainly proceeds to emulate the landslide of 1904, that T.R. never felt the need to imitate anybody.

HEADLINE: FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW;
Nasty Little Gang of Boys In the Low Life of Taipei

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
"There are two types of people, crooks and dopes," sneers Red Fish (Congsheng Tang), a teen-aged Taipeian wheeler-dealer whose corrupt, formerly wealthy father has gone into hiding after declaring bankruptcy. Red Fish is the soul, if you can call it that, of "Mahjong," the Taiwanese film maker Edward Yang's frantically scribbled hate letter to the boom town in which he grew up.
This grubby little character is also the de facto leader of a gang of four avaricious youths who share apartment space and women and who collaborate in scamming and hustling everyone who crosses their paths. Hong Kong (Zheng Zhang) is a hairdresser and gigolo; Toothpaste, also known as Little Buddha (Qizan Wang), tells bogus fortunes, and the more contemplative Luen-Luen (Yuluen Ke) serves as his noisy roommates' chauffeur and translator. 
 In a typical scam, Hong Kong seduces a wealthy woman and arranges for Toothpaste to foretell an imminent vehicular mishap, which Red Fish and Luen-Luen then engineer. From here on, she is an easy mark. Along the way, more than one Mercedes gets mangled.
"Mahjong," like Mr. Yang's previous film, "A Confucian Confusion," is a comic portrait of a city gone haywire with greed. Where Mr. Yang's last movie ridiculed the obsession of Taipei's corrupt, soulless nouveau riche with maintaining a facade of respectability, virtually all the characters in "Mahjong" are shamelessly rapacious about money and sex. The queen of the Hard Rock Cafe, the characters' tacky social center, is Ginger (Diana Dupuis), a jolly American who has parlayed her escort service into a corporate giant.
Into this rat's nest stumbles Marthe (Virginie Ledoyen), a beautiful 18-year-old Frenchwoman in headlong pursuit of Markus (Nick Erickson), a fickle English entrepreneur she met in London. A snooty twit who derisively refers to all Taiwanese as "these people," Markus sees Taipei as the future economic capital of the world and intends to grab a huge chunk of it. Before it's over, the movie has followed its characters through a typical day of hustling, kidnapping, blackmail, suicide, murder and endless sexual double-dealing.
"Mahjong," which the New York Film Festival is screening this evening at 6 at Alice Tully Hall, doesn't even try to establish a basic credibility. As its outrageous characters slither and scuttle around the congested Taiwanese capital, the film has the feeling of a live-action cartoon. The stridently bad acting of much of the cast only adds to the hysteria.
For all its sloppiness, this satiric morality tale still has a sharp comic bite. It also sends the same message as the New York Film Festival's other Taiwanese selection, "Goodbye South, Goodbye." In Asia's Wild West, there is a gold rush going on.
 
MAHJONG
Written (in English, Taiwanese and Mandarin, with English subtitles) and directed by Edward Yang; director of photography, Yixu Li and Longyu Li; edited by Bowen Chen; music by Forward Records; produced by Wei-yen Yu. At Alice Tully Hall today at 6 P.M. as part of the 34th New York Film Festival. Running time: 120 minutes. This film is not rated.
 
WITH: Virginie Ledoyen (Marthe), Congsheng Tang (Red Fish), Yuluen Ke (Luen-Luen), Zhen Zhang (Hong Kong), Qizan Wang (Toothpaste), Diana Dupuis (Ginger) and Nick Erickson (Markus).

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Pie In The Sky

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Going into the first debate, Bob Dole was hobbled by one problem above all. What was meant to be the foundation of his campaign for President, the promise of a 15 percent cut in income taxes, had turned out to be a loser. Doubly so.
From the moment he unveiled the idea, at the San Diego convention, it damaged Senator Dole's reputation as a man of principle, of consistency. He had long ridiculed as puerile fantasy the supply-side doctrine -- theology, really -- that reducing rates would increase tax revenue. Now here he was embracing that very doctrine. 
 The second difficulty has developed in the weeks since San Diego. As Senator Dole has made more arguments on how he can cut taxes while still keeping his old commitment to balance the budget, he has quite failed to convince his listeners. And for good reason. His figures do not remotely add up.
Senator Dole's proposal for the 15 percent income tax rate reduction plus a 50 percent cut in the capital gains tax and the child tax credit would cost the Treasury $548 billion over six years. In order to meet that cost and also eliminate the budget deficit by the year 2002, he would have to cut a total of $867 billion in spending by the Federal Government. On the stump, Mr. Dole has been saying he can do that by reducing by just 5 percent all expenditure except on defense and entitlement programs. He holds up a nickel to show how little that would be. But the arithmetic he offers is embarrassingly phony.
The Dole plan starts with the premise that most of the $867 billion in spending cuts he needs are going to occur anyway under the budget resolution passed by the current Republican Congress. But Thomas Oliphant of The Boston Globe pointed out the other day that Congressional Republicans have already abandoned the harsh budget-cutting requirements of the resolution.
Before it adjourned, Congress dropped the idea of huge cuts in Medicare and Medicaid spending that were in the budget resolution. Republicans did not act, as they had said they would, to cut the earned-income tax credit for poor working families. And so on.
The reason Republican leaders in Congress shied away from the sharp reductions promised in the budget resolution is no secret. The public did not like them. It did not want to destroy the civilian side of the Federal Government. So Newt Gingrich & Co. dropped their radical plans and agreed to appropriations that preserved most government services.
The result is that the spending cuts needed to reach the Dole target by 2002 would make Dracon of Athens look like a pussycat. Mr. Dole ruled out touching some of the biggest items: defense, Social Security, Medicare, veterans' benefits. All other government activities would have to be cut not 5 but 37 percent. That figure comes from a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and it is convincing.
What Federal programs would the public want to cut by 37 percent? Hurricane forecasting? Air traffic control? Prisons? The F.B.I.? Emergency relief for the victims of floods and other natural disasters? Border control?
No President could eliminate or drastically scale back those and numerous other programs. So remaining Federal activities would have to be slashed far more than 37 percent to reach the target.
The Concord Coalition, the spending watch-group headed by former Senators Paul Tsongas and Warren Rudman, said the Dole plan would reduce the Federal Government to the level of the Coolidge and Hoover era. It said: "Most public services to the young and the poor will have to be defunded entirely."
You do not have to be an economist to understand that Senator Dole's economic plan is humbug. But economists do not think much of it either.
A magazine that takes a rigorous view of government spending, The Economist of London, reports in its current issue a survey it made of 60 macroeconomists "at America's top universities," about half the total number of such economists. An astonishing 70 percent responded. Asked whether they believed that Mr. Dole could cut taxes and balance the budget as he promised, they voted: 17 percent yes, 83 percent no.
Campaign promises always tend to be rosy. Bob Dole's budget promises could have been written by Pollyanna.

Advertisers gather for their 87th annual conference to proclaim that 'brands are back.'

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

DATELINE: AMELIA ISLAND, Fla.

 BODY:
THE nation's largest advertisers, taking a cue from a venerable name-brand cereal, are focusing their 87th annual conference on the branding of champions and the championing of brands.
The conference of the Association of National Advertisers, which began Friday with more than 500 people attending at the Ritz-Carlton here, has as its theme "Brand Champions." John J. Sarsen Jr., president and chief executive of the association, explained that choice by declaring, "brands are back in a very big way." 
 That resurgence, particularly evident among marketers of consumer packaged goods, is of course very good news to association members, whose companies expect to fuel growth with increased sales of brand-name products. Their ebullience was palpable as the conference opened, stronger even than the rain and gale-force winds that have so far forced virtually all scheduled outdoor events inside.
The silver lining in those clouds for conference organizers has been large audiences for the speeches and break-out session concentrating on ways to build, bolster and brighten brands.
For instance, the keynote speaker at the general session yesterday suggested that it took the collapse of Communism for America's biggest advertiser to revitalize the capitalistic practice of brand-building.
"We had to go halfway around the world" to "some of the world's newest markets" to relearn some old lessons, said Wolfgang C. Berndt, executive vice president of the Procter & Gamble Company and president of Procter & Gamble North America. His reference was to Eastern Europe, where P.& G. sales since 1991 have soared to $1 billion.
In more than 50,000 interviews, Mr. Berndt said, the company found the newcomers to market economies "responded to product-focused advertising and sampling" rather than to tactics like coupons and short-term price cuts that have become common in the United States in the last two decades.
"We'd become our own worst enemy," he added, in adopting those tactics. "We'd taken our eyes off the prize, the deep abiding loyalty of consumers."
Now that P.& G. has revamped its advertising and marketing efforts in this country, Mr. Berndt said, with "selling ideas that are focused on product benefits," that approach of "back to basics is paying off in a big way" in important product categories like diapers, generating "three consecutive years of share and volume growth."
Another challenge to the conventional wisdom came from Ed Winter, chief executive of the Channel One Network unit of the K-III Communications Corporation. In a session on Saturday, he asserted that advertisers "can build brand equity" if they "embrace controversy" rather than avoid it.
"If you're taking big bold steps to grow a brand," said Mr. Winter, whose efforts to expose students to sponsored newscasts still invoke contentious debate, there can be "a strategic role for controversy" -- not "controversy no matter what, to get attention," but controversy linked to brand attributes that play off consumer attitudes. Among the examples he offered were Nike Inc., Calvin Klein Inc. and the Dallas Cowboys.
Indeed, Jerry Jones, president of the Cowboys, was one of 13 executives honored at a dinner Friday, sponsored by the trade publication Brandweek, for their marketing achievements.
Other honorees included two related to the Summer Olympics: Dick Ebersol, president of NBC Sports, which broadcast the Games from Atlanta, and Jeff Bliss, president and chief executive of the Olympic Partnership at the Sara Lee Corporation.
A reminder of how difficult a task brand-building is came with the Brandweek selection for 1996 Marketer of the Year: Roger Enrico, chairman and chief executive of Pepsico Inc. That company recently disclosed financial problems related to difficulties in its soft-drink and fast- food operations.
In business matters, the association made its annual change in elected leaders. Ronald O. Cox, group vice president at the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, was named the 1996-97 chairman. Mr. Cox, who was vice chairman for the last year, succeeded the 1995-96 chairman, Richard A. Costello, corporate marketing communications manager at the General Electric Company.
James J. Garrity, vice president for communications at the Compaq Computer Corporation, was elected the 1996-97 vice chairman.
Also, Bruce R. Wilson, corporate advertising director at the Eastman Kodak Company, received the Robert V. Goldstein Award, honoring his work on a public service campaign for the advertising council for the American Red Cross. The award is named for a former board member of the association and the council.
The conference continues through today.

The Asian Connection

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
On April 12, 1993, Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell received a call from the Indonesian businessman James Riady, a former client, and the Arkansas lawyer and Clinton golfing partner Mark Grobmyer. Both men had, a month before, been seen in Indonesia's East Timor, a human-rights hellhole.
Hubbell's log shows Riady called again the next day, this time from the Washington number 456-2684. That is the Office of Presidential Personnel, then supervised by Bruce Lindsey, Clinton confidential aide. 
 James Riady is the son of Mochtar Riady, the ethnic Chinese at the head of the Lippo Group, a $6 billion conglomerate with great commercial and political influence throughout Asia.
Both Hubbell and Clinton knew the Riadys well. During the 1980's, the Riadys held an interest with the Little Rock financier Jackson Stephens in the Clinton-friendly Worthen Bank, which retained lawyer Webster Hubbell.
During the 1992 race for President, James Riady and his wife overtly contributed close to $200,000 in "soft money" to the Democratic campaign. The Democratic finance chairman, Marvin Rosen, tells me he was informed that Riady employee John Huang "helped a lot in raising money in '92."
The Riadys were then able to boast of placing their man in a position of influence in the Clinton Administration. Mr. Huang, 46, was named Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for International Economic Policy. Just before taking this job, Mr. Huang was paid almost a million dollars in salary, bonus and severance from the Lippo Group, $788,750 from Hip Hing Holdings, operator of a parking lot in Los Angeles owned by the Riadys.
Mr. Huang left the Commerce Department late last year to become a vice chairman of the Democratic Finance Committee. President Clinton praised "my longtime friend John Huang" on July 22, 1996, for "his aggressive efforts to help our cause."
Aggressive is putting it mildly. Three months before, the Riadys' man Huang introduced Mr. Clinton to a South Korean magnate who made a $250,000 contribution to the Democrats through a subsidiary of a South Korean corporation.
Such a contribution is clearly against the law, which finance chief Rosen admits; only when The Los Angeles Times began asking about it was the quarter million hastily given back. Thus, for the first time, a President of the U.S. was personally involved in the solicitation of a major illegal contribution, but the Democratic Finance Committee has not had one call on this from the Federal Election Commission.
If foreigners want to slip U.S. politicians "soft money," the best conduit is a U.S. citizen or a resident alien. One of the largest Democratic contributions -- $425,000 -- is from an Indonesian gardener named Arief Wiriandinata, a green-card holder no longer in the U.S., whose wife's father helped run several Lippo ventures for the Riadys.
The Riadys gained much face in Indonesia in 1993, helping the Clinton Administration lose interest in labor abuses in East Timor; in 1994, as an Asian conference was to be held in Indonesia's capital, they were eager to impress China's leaders with their American influence. Again they turned to Webster Hubbell.
By that time, the Associate Attorney General who had loyally kept Whitewater files hidden in his basement had quit Justice because he was about to be indicted for defrauding law clients. Who would hire a man facing ruination at a time when his silence was golden to the Clintons?
The Riadys did. I'm told that between resignation and indictment, a Lippo affiliate paid Hubbell over $250,000. He went to Indonesia for them in October 1994.
One month later, at a conference in Jakarta, Indonesia, that included China's Jiang Zemin, President Clinton surprised U.S. Embassy officials by holding a private meeting with James Riady. This duly impressed Asian leaders who put great weight on connections in high places.
Clinton's foreign contributors are coming through for him in this campaign. Does Hubbell, his lip zipped in jail, expect to be sprung before his time? Will he then be made financially whole by the Clinton Asian connection? "Nobody's promised me a damn thing," the felon insisted at a Senate hearing. We'll soon see.

HEADLINE: Trade vs. Cultural Identity in Canada

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
Canada knows that by charging excise taxes of 80 percent on Canadian editions of Sports Illustrated and other American magazines, it can keep those publications off the nation's newsstands and out of its advertising market.
Canada contends that it is only trying to protect the country's national identity and help support its own modest magazine industry. 
 But the United States contends that Canada's real goal is to stifle competition. After years of complaining to the Canadians without satisfactorily resolving the issue, the United States has finally taken its grievance to the World Trade Organization in Switzerland, where it filed a formal complaint in September.
The United States is asking the international organization, which represents the trading interests of nations that have signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to determine whether Canada is using cultural identity to conceal unfair trading practices.
The United States also objects to postal rates in Canada that are much lower for Canadian magazines than those imported from the United States and to a 30-year-old ban on Canadian editions printed in the United States.
Canada's response, citing what it believes are GATT provisions allowing countries to protect cultural resources, was filed Sept. 26. A hearing will be held this Friday at the World Trade Organization in Geneva and a ruling is due by Feb. 21.
Whatever the organization decides, the issue has already raised hackles in a Canada increasingly apprehensive about the encroaching American culture.
"There is a very strong dominance in the cultural industries of the Canadian marketplace by the United States," Arthur C. Eggleton, Canada's Minister for International Trade, said. "We come at this from the point of preserving culture and identity, while the U.S. comes at it from the standpoint of wanting to do business in our country."
Mr. Eggleton said that 70 percent of the magazines sold in Canada already come from the United States, and that allowing Canadian editions -- cheap to produce and full of local advertising -- would further shrink the small pool of advertising open to Canadian publications.
Canadian magazine publishers insist that existing trade agreements do not guarantee the United States free access to Canadian advertising. They say that opening the market to Canadian editions of United States magazines would threaten the survival of Canadian magazines.
"American publishers have virtually unlimited access to Canadian readers," said Catherine Allman, acting president of the Canadian Magazine Publishers Association. "The question is, will Canadian readers have unlimited access to Canadian magazines" if the magazines cannot survive competition that the Canadians regard as unfair?
Canada's cultural concerns go far beyond magazines. The Government has not allowed the United States bookstore chain Borders to establish a Canadian branch because the company and its Canadian partners did not satisfy standards for substantial Canadian control of the enterprise. And Government action in 1994 effectively threw out the Country Music Television cable channel to make way for a Canadian competitor. Eventually, the two companies involved negotiated a joint venture.
A United States trade official, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said that the two nations had been jousting over the real meaning of cultural exemptions in trade for a long time, usually without filing any formal complaints.
"But when certain actions are taken like chasing a business out of the market, we have to weigh in and say 'You've gone too far,' " the official said.
The issue of cultural influences is one of the most sensitive in the modern global economy, and an especially important part of the trading strategy pursued by the United States. With the decline of traditional manufacturing, intellectual properties like movies, magazines and books are now considered to be among the most attractive exports of the United States.
Canada is not alone in restricting intellectual imports from the United States. Some European countries have limited the showing of movies and television programs from the United States.
Before Canada signed the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Mexico in 1993, it fought hard to exempt sectors of the economy essential to its cultural identity. Because of the difference in language, Mexico did not fight as hard for such cultural safeguards, although representatives of Mexican media groups warned that there was no way Mexico could compete with Hollywood.
Canada's cultural exemptions in the North American accord meant that the United States complaint on magazines would have a better chance in front of the World Trade Organization, United States trade officials said.
Canada's protectionism goes back at least to the 1960's, when Canadian editions of United States magazines were not allowed across the border. Technological advances later made it possible to print these editions in Canada.
In 1993, Time Warner Inc. introduced a Canadian edition of Sports Illustrated. It included a small amount of material on Canadian sports but most of the magazine was identical to issues sold in the United States. It then sold advertising in the regional, or "split run" editions, to Canadian companies.
A Canadian Government task force estimated that 53 other United States magazines and 70 trade journals might also try to publish split- run editions. As a result, Canada last year imposed an excise tax of 80 percent on the total dollar value of the advertising in almost every split-run magazine sold in Canada, except for Reader's Digest and Time, which had longtime Canadian editions.
For example, an issue of Sports Illustrated that carried $100,000 in ads would be charged $80,000 in excise taxes.
On top of that, a 1976 law prohibited Canadian companies that advertise in the regional editions from deducting those costs from their taxes, as they would if the ads ran in a Canadian magazine. And postage rates were higher for Sports Illustrated.

HEADLINE: Candidates For Senate Use Truth, Of a Sort

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
Truth is to political campaigns what military music is to music: a distantly related phenomenon.
In the feisty campaign to fill the United States Senate seat from New Jersey being vacated by Bill Bradley, the two candidates have unleashed a dizzying array of charges and countercharges. Representative Robert G. Torricelli, a Democrat, has repeatedly accused his opponent, Representative Richard A. Zimmer, of voting to cut Federal spending on Medicare. Mr. Zimmer, a Republican, has delighted in saying that Mr. Torricelli voted for the largest tax increase in American history. 
 In their bare-knuckles television commercials and again in their first, somewhat testy debate on Saturday, Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Torricelli have repeated these and other assertions meant to paint the opponent as extremist and the accuser as the kind of middle-of-the-road statewide candidate that New Jersey voters historically favor.
On careful examination, none of their major claims prove patently false. Each possesses enough truth to meet the vague, unwritten standards for what is fair in political oratory. But many of the most frequently repeated broadsides also tend to slip into hyperbole.
Take, for instance, Mr. Zimmer's contention that Mr. Torricelli, a seven-term Congressman, voted for "the largest tax increase in history." The assertion is a centerpiece of Mr. Zimmer's attempt to brand Mr. Torricelli an old-fashioned tax-and-spend liberal, someone hopelessly out of step with the times.
The tax increase refers to President Clinton's five-year economic plan, approved by Congress in August 1993. By one measure, the plan did include the largest tax increase in American history: $241 billion over five years.
But in another way of counting, a 1982 bill sponsored by Senator Bob Dole and signed into law by President Ronald Reagan actually contained a larger tax increase. It raised taxes by $215 billion in 1982. But adjusting for inflation, the Reagan increase was worth $286 billion in 1993 dollars, making it the largest tax increase ever.
There are also important aspects of Mr. Clinton's 1993 economic package that Mr. Zimmer's debate zingers and 30-second television ads leave out. For example, the plan barely raised the average American's taxes at all.
What it did was increase substantially the Federal tax rates on the richest Americans. The top income tax rate, which was 31 percent, was increased to 36 percent for single taxpayers with taxable incomes of more than $115,000 and for couples with taxable incomes of more than $140,000. The rate for all taxpayers with taxable incomes of more than $250,000 was increased to 39.6 percent.
The plan also raised the Federal taxes on gasoline and corporate incomes modestly, but it also cut taxes for low-income workers by expanding the earned-income tax credit.
Moreover, labeling the Clinton package as a tax increase -- something Republicans from Mr. Dole to Mr. Zimmer have taken pleasure in doing since the campaign began -- ignores what Democrats view as its primary purpose: reducing the Federal deficit. The package reduced projected spending by more than $250 billion over five years.
Mr. Zimmer, a three-term Congressman, is not the only candidate who blurs complexities with political one-liners, of course. Mr. Torricelli often twits Mr. Zimmer for his support of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, trying to portray Mr. Zimmer as a conservative Gingrich acolyte.
In the debate, Mr. Torricelli recited a long list of Federal programs that Mr. Zimmer and other House Republicans had voted to cut, citing popular middle-class services like aid to college students and environmental protections. "It may be worst in Medicare," Mr. Torricelli said of the cuts, "the most vulnerable citizens of all, our senior citizens."
On closer scrutiny, though, Mr. Zimmer voted not for a reduction in Medicare, but for a cut in the program's rate of growth -- which was also an important element of President Clinton's 1993 economic plan to trim the Federal deficit, which Mr. Torricelli voted for.
In the debate, Mr. Torricelli also took Mr. Zimmer to task for having voted to cut American aid to Israel by $750 million. Well, he did and he did not. In 1992, Mr. Zimmer voted in favor of a bill that would have cut all American foreign aid by 25 percent. That would have translated as a cut of $750 million in aid to Israel. The bill did not pass.
So when is a cut not a cut? When it is a limitation on future spending increases, or a projection from a larger overall reduction in foreign aid. In politics, as in art, beauty and truth are in the eyes of the beholder.

 BODY:
Today, just a month after Congress agreed to double the size of the Border Patrol and provide more helicopters, weapons and fortifications, one of the world's most closely guarded border crossings opened for a horde of more than a thousand dashing across from Mexico.
"My number is my passport," said Jesus Ramos, pointing to the black numerals pinned to his singlet for the El Paso-Juarez International Classic 15-kilometer road race. With about 20 other members of his Chamizal Runners Club from Ciudad Juarez, he was standing near the starting line just yards from the Rio Grande and the Mexican border. 
 This year's race, the 17th, came as a reminder that the two cities often identify more closely with each other than with national capitals 1,300 miles to the south and 2,000 miles to the northeast. Even as they quarrel over crime, pollution and dozens of other issues, they tend to think of themselves as a single city, with nearly 700,000 residents in the El Paso area and about 2 million in Juarez, which promotes itself as the largest metropolis on any international border.
"Despite Operation Hold the Line, there's a natural kind of bonding because of all the economic ties," said Lucinda Vargas, a United States Federal Reserve economist raised in Juarez and now based here, referring to tougher border enforcement.
The flow of shoppers, visitors and shipments of supplies and finished goods to and from the factories across the river makes this the Mexican border's busiest crossing. There are about 60 million legal crossings a year, while illegal crossings are down but far from eliminated.
The race has become emblematic of the Juarez-El Paso alliance as an adventure in cooperation with unforeseen calamaties.
Race organizers praise the flexibility of the Immigration and Naturalization Service even as they note the challenges of a 9.3-mile event that starts in the United States, soon crosses to Mexico for about four miles, then crosses back.
"People joke that we leave the U.S. with a thousand runners and come back from Mexico with 2,000," said Bill Barry, a race sponsor through his two local Athlete's Foot stores.
A clipped "heh, heh," was the only response when Albert Martinez, an immigration inspector with his hands clasped behind his back and a Smith & Wesson on his hip, heard this joke on the Good Neighbor Bridge as runners streamed past. While most runners had numbers, a few, as well as some bicyclists, did not.
The task of linking two cultures, nations and languages with a road race falls to a group used to enduring no matter what. Almost every year presents its own challenge.
"You're dealing with the city, the state because we're on a state highway, the county," said Ted Jablonski, the race course manager. "We're dealing with immigration, with border patrol, with customs. We're dealing with three different railroads and the bus people. Then you go to Mexico and you duplicate it."
About seven years ago, organizers carefully planned the race with officials in Juarez, arranging for a police escort to lead the runners from the crest of an international bridge through Juarez traffic. Then, days before the race, a newly elected government took office in Juarez. Come race day, the runners mounted the crest of the bridge only to find honking motorists but no police.
Three years ago, a guard at the bridge bringing the runners back to the United States first heard from the El Paso police minutes before they wanted him to let through more than a thousand people with no passports or permits. No wholesale border break on his watch, he said. A few frantic minutes later, the right immigration officials had been reached and beseeched to give him the official word, and the runners swept past undetained.
Last year, less than a mile from the finish, a train cut off runners at a rail crossing. This year, El Paso's Mayor threatened to block the bridges in a dispute with Washington over maintenance funds. In recent weeks, the bridges have been closed several times after anonymous bomb threats.
The major problem this time befell contestants in a smaller 2-mile race walk earlier this morning. From a course entirely in El Paso, they were misdirected by race volunteers and then immigration inspectors, they said. They ended up dodging trucks and other traffic in Juarez. It took a 10-year-old girl, Anne Magers, to react somewhat as Dorothy did after her unplanned excursion from Kansas to Oz. Anne, realizing they were no longer on track, led a confused band of walkers back across the bridge.
Steven R. Silver, the race director, said: "In the New York Marathon, the worst thing that can happen to you is you get lost in the Bronx. Here, you end up in another country."
Earlier, at the start of the race, Mr. Silver had to improvise when there was only a tape of the United States national anthem, but not one for Mexico's. A Mexican runner ended up singing his country's anthem into the race announcer's microphone.
Runners from both countries were elated to zip across a border where one to two-hour waits for inspectors and drug-sniffing dogs have only recently been reduced with the arrival of more agents.
"The only reason I do this is to go through customs unimpeded," one runner hollered at Mr. Martinez, the immigration inspector.
A majority of the other runners appeared to be from the United States, including more than 300 troops from nearby Fort Bliss, who were grouped by units and shouting their cadence. But hundreds of other runners came from Mexico.
An immigration agency spokesman sternly insisted that the organizers screened undesirables from a list they brought over the night before the race, but the organizers say the immigration service does it.
For the racers, officialdom is one domain they would rather run around.
"The politicians don't understand the border," said Jesus Zambrano, a coach for the Club Avanti team in Juarez. "The athletes do."

HEADLINE: Why European Computer Makers Flop

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: MILAN, Italy, Oct. 4

 BODY:
When Olivetti S.p.A. announced on Thursday that it was putting its personal computer division on the block, it joined a long line of European computer makers that had dropped out in the face of strong American competition.
The Europeans, unlike their counterparts in the United States or East Asia, held on to costly retail stores too long and failed to speed products to customers in a race against obsolescence that is crucial in a business where product cycles are measured in months, not years. Besides that, most European computer makers have failed to gain market share beyond their tight national boundaries, robbing themselves of economies of scale needed to be internationally competitive. 
 So it is perhaps not surprising that the field is littered with the corpses of the losers. This year, Compagnie des Machines Bull of France merged its personal computer division, Zenith Data Systems, with Packard Bell Electronics of the United States. Earlier, ICL P.L.C. of Britain sold most of its personal computer business to Fujitsu. This summer, Escom, No. 2 in Germany after Siemens Nixdorf, filed for bankruptcy.
"If history is a guide, it's not Olivetti -- it's European technology companies," said Daniel Mandresh of Merrill Lynch & Company in New York. "Getting beyond their state borders is a major problem."
As a result, the five leading personal computer companies in Europe, including the No. 1, Compaq Computer Corporation, as well as I.B.M., are American; of the top 10, only Siemens Nixdorf and Olivetti are European. And if Olivetti succeeds with its plans, that, too. will soon change.
The lure of Europe for the American companies is in many respects obvious. Price margins have been high in comparison with those in the American market, and until recently the pricing environment has been stable. Add to that a rich humus of small and medium-sized business customers, which in major markets like Germany and Italy form the backbone of local industry, and the opportunity for rapid growth and high profit becomes evident.
So what have European computer makers been doing wrong? For one thing, although the American computer industry stopped running its own retail stores a decade ago, many European companies still run expensive chains. Vobis Microcomputer, a small and aggressive German manufacturer, for example, operates 251 stores and 436 franchised outlets. Only recently have superstores in Britain and Germany come on the scene -- hastening a shakeout of the less competitive.
Moreover, unlike their nimble, highly specialized American competitors, many of Europe's personal computer makers are divisions of huge, diversified electronics corporations. Siemens Nixdorf, for instance, the European leader, is a unit of the giant Siemens A.G., which makes everything from power generating stations to toasters.
In a major turnaround, Siemens Nixdorf has had three years of profit, after running up $1.3 billion in losses. Norbert Strauch, a company spokesman, attributes the improvement, among other things, to "internal restructuring, breaking down from one big organization to a whole series of smaller ones."
David Winn, general manager of European PC operations for International Business Machines, , says that a strength of the Americans, and a European drawback, has been the ability to move equipment around, making quick sales and avoiding inventory pile-ups that translate into losses.
"Given the rapid technology change and short product cycles, logistics becomes an overwhelming differentiation," he said. Indeed, unsaleable inventories caused much of the red ink that has drowned Olivetti.
Oddly, too, on a Continent where many businesses regularly export two-thirds of their products, European computer companies have failed miserably to break out of national boundaries. Siemens Nixdorf does 65 percent of its business in Germany; Elonex, an innovative British company, rings up 89 percent of its sales in Britain. Tulip Computers N.V., No. 4 in the Netherlands, is No. 22 in all of Europe.
Graham Lisle, a Compaq executive in Munich, attributes this European failing to being "a hero in your own country, and to a lesser extent elsewhere."
"We're all over," he said of his own company. "If there's an economic downturn, you're less exposed, because it balances out."
Olivetti, which did a mere 29 percent of its personal computer business in its home Italian market, avoided that pitfall at least. But by most indications, it seems to have done everything else wrong.
Until early this year, when it began shutting down, Olivetti ran an expensive chain of computer stores throughout Italy and abroad. With production of only about 700,000 machines, Olivetti never achieved the economies of scale of competitors like Compaq and Hewlett-Packard, and slow-moving delivery systems meant inventory pileups that cost dearly. Like Siemens Nixdorf, Olivetti's personal computer unit was part of a much larger group that sold everything from fax machines and copiers to mobile phones and printers.
Nearly half of Olivetti's personal computers were delivered to the group's own systems and services unit for inclusion in large banking or business systems, with often unclear bookkeeping between various Olivetti units that led to heavy losses.
Oddly, too, on a Continent accustomed to a patchwork of languages and cultures, European computers are often shunned outside their home country. Germans buy Siemens Nixdorf, the Dutch buy Tulip. American computers, in contrast, are somehow neutral.
American companies have proved superior to their European counterparts at meeting varying local demands. Compaq, for example, sells smaller processors and slower modems in southern Europe, where technology tends to lag behind; ads by the American manufacturers are attuned to national taste.
"There is an art to getting the balance between your global business, and making just the right allowance for local markets," Mr. Winn of I.B.M. said.
"I think manufacturers from the United States have gotten good at that."

HEADLINE: Spurred by U.S., Two Sides Open New Talks to Save Mideast Peace

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Spurred on by Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Israelis and Palestinians sat down today to the urgent negotiations they agreed on at last week's summit meeting in Washington in an effort to salvage their peace after the recent gunbattles in the West Bank and Gaza.
The central focus was to reach agreement as soon as possible on turning over control of most of Hebron, on the West Bank, to the Palestinians. The long-delayed transfer has evolved into a litmus test of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's intentions toward the Palestinian peace. 
 But the fact that Palestinian police officers used their weapons against Israelis in the violence has made Mr. Netanyahu determined to strengthen the security arrangements for the Jewish enclaves in the heart of Hebron, the last of seven West Bank cities to come under Palestinian self-rule under a 1995 agreement. The transfer had originally been scheduled for March, but was suspended after a series of Palestinian bombings in Israel.
The talks that opened today were officially negotiations that had been agreed on last month and delayed by the shootings. But the prominent presence at the negotiating table of Mr. Christopher's chief Mideast coordinator, Dennis Ross, and Mr. Christopher's own meetings with Mr. Netanyahu and the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat made clear that the United States was now determined to press for quick and tangible results.
"The recent violence has demonstrated the great urgency of reaching some concrete results just as soon as possible," Mr. Christopher told reporters after meeting with Mr. Netanyahu in Jerusalem. "The situation has eased somewhat, but it is still a dangerous situation," he said two hours later after meeting Mr. Arafat in the Gaza Strip.
Mr. Christopher, Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat did not attend the opening session of the negotiations, which was held at Erez on the Israeli-Gaza border.
The two-and-a-half-hour session was described as largely organizational, and the chief negotiators -- Said Erekat on the Palestinian side and Dan Shomron on the Israeli -- said they had agreed to set up three subcommittees: on Hebron, on security and on economic issues.
Israel also announced some easing of the security cordon thrown around Palestinian areas after the recent violence. They said 2,000 Gazan workers would be allowed into the Israeli-controlled Erez industrial zone on Monday, and the blockades around two West Bank towns, Tulkarem and Jenin, would be eased.
But the two sides could not decide where to continue the negotiations. The plan agreed to in Washington was to retire to a secluded spot for continual talks, but Israel was reportedly against the Palestinians' first choice, the Egyptian resort of Taba, near Eilat, the southernmost Israeli city.
Both the negotiators and senior American officials made clear that the major hurdle would be to find a way to satisfy the conservative Israeli Government's demands for more stringent security for Jewish settlers in Hebron while meeting the Palestinians' insistence that the existing agreements not be reopened or renegotiated.
Accordingly, at a news conference with Mr. Christopher, Mr. Netanyahu said: "We did not propose opening the agreement. We suggested that within the confines of the existing agreement, adjustments be made."
Mr. Christopher stressed the same point: "One of the things that has been clarified during my visit here is that the parties intend to negotiate within the four corners of the agreement. They do not seek to modify it."
The question was how much "adjusting" Mr. Arafat was prepared to accept, since the new Israeli plan, as reported in the Israeli press, demanded substantial changes, including the arming of Palestinian police in Hebron only with sidearms, new buffer zones around Jewish enclaves, and the right of Israeli soldiers to pursue Palestinians anywhere in the city.
Appearing later with Mr. Christopher, Mr. Arafat avoided commenting on the issues to be negotiated. But the chief Israeli negotiator, Mr. Erekat, firmly declared on going into the meeting, "We will not renegotiate the agreements signed, we will not reopen the agreement for any modifications or amendments." Only the "implementation" can be discussed, Mr. Erekat said.
Dore Gold, Mr. Netanyahu's foreign-policy adviser, was equally firm in declaring that "without reopening the agreement, a lot can be changed."
Senior American officials expressed satisfaction that Mr. Netanyahu had given a public assurance that existing agreements would not be renegotiated. They said one reason for Mr. Christopher's stopover was that the decision to open these talks was made at the very end of the Washington summit meeting last week, leaving no time to work out critical details.
Mr. Christopher said that Mr. Ross's role in the talks would be only as a "facilitator," and that whenever possible the Americans would leave the talks to the Palestinians and Israelis. It was not clear how long Mr. Ross would stay, nor was any deadline set for reaching agreement.
American officials said they believed their presence was necessary because the three days of violence across the West Bank and Gaza that erupted on Sept. 25 had deeply undermined an already shaky level of trust between the Palestinians and Mr. Netanyahu's Government.
Hebron, moreover, brought out all the mutual distrust -- the Israeli fear that Palestinian police might fire on the Jewish settlers, and the Palestinian suspicion that Mr. Netanyahu was trying to roll back the peace agreements.
The crisis erupted after Israel opened a new exit in a tunnel alongside the ancient plateau where the Dome of the Rock stands, raising suspicions among Muslims that the Israelis were seeking to change the delicate religious balance in Jerusalem's Old City.
The incident also proved to be the breaking point in mounting Palestinian frustrations with the lack of movement in carrying out the peace accords. Protest demonstrations escalated into firefights between Palestinian police and Israeli soldiers, in which 62 Palestinians, 1 Egyptian and 14 Israelis were killed.
That was followed by the emergency meeting arranged by President Clinton in Washington last week between Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat. After more than three hours of talks, the two leaders agreed to hold the talks on Hebron and other issues.

Gretzky's Home Debut Is Less Than Great

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY 

 BODY:
WAYNE GRETZKY would have been great even if his family name had never prompted the alliterative and literary nickname The Great Gretzky. No hockey player has ever maneuvered the puck like him.
But sports fans in the most chauvinistic town would insist that it never truly happened for Wayne Gretzky until he shucked off the garb of the hinterlands, St. Louis and Los Angeles and Edmonton, and played his first home game as a Ranger last night. 
 He skated onto the ice in the Garden -- you know very well which Garden -- in the familiar red, white and blue uniform and smiled shyly as the 18,200 fans (dozens of them wearing expensive new No. 99 Ranger jerseys) cheered for him.
"It even went up to another level for Mark," Gretzky noted later, referring to the ultimate introduction for his pal, Mark Messier.
Messier was ejected in the second period for mugging an opponent, and the Rangers went down to a 5-2 defeat that reminded everybody that the Florida Panthers were Stanley Cup finalists last season and the Rangers most emphatically were not.
Last night Gretzky made his first point as a Ranger, after not being involved in a goal in the 4-4 opening tie in Boston on Saturday night. In both games, Gretzky's intuitive and feathery passes showed his new teammates what they can expect, eventually.
"Communication is the whole game," Gretzky said. "You talk about it or you try to watch it in a video. It works both ways. It's a team game. No one player has ever won a championship by himself."
There have been few reunions like this in any sport because rarely have two teammates come along at the same time, on the same team, with the skills of superstars, with strong egos, yet remained loyal friends.
Messier came to New York a superstar and goaded the Rangers to their first Stanley Cup in 54 years in 1994. He showed his ultimate security by saying, yes, there was room for his friend on this team.
With all due respect to Messier, Gretzky has been a defining and transitional figure in his sport much the way Babe Ruth was in baseball and the triumvirate of Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan was in basketball, raising the level of skill and fan awareness. Gretzky had McEnroe touch and Ashe diplomacy. And he still does.
Since Gretzky first skated from Ontario to the major leagues as a willowy teen-ager, he has flitted through defenses with otherworldly instincts, making time stand still on ice. From the 70's to the 90's, hockey progressed from a tight little Canadian passion to a world sport, and nobody came close to Gretzky in making hockey big time.
The surliest goons on other teams would refrain from trying to break his wispy body, the same way the beefed-up strongboys of the old American Football League sacked Joe Namath with tenderness, laying him down like a babe in a bassinet, because they respected him as superstar and savior.
For Gretzky to finally play as a homeboy in "the world's most famous arena," as the folks at Madison Square Garden call it, required considerable deliberation in corporate offices.
"The hockey part was easy," said Dave Checketts, the president and chief executive officer of the Garden. "Wayne scored 102 points last year for two different teams, one of them not going anywhere."
Neil Smith, the general manager, and Colin Campbell, the coach, thought Gretzky was still a superior player. But Checketts had to sell Gretzky's $5.047 million, one-year contract to the two corporations that jointly own the Garden.
"I went to the people at ITT and Cablevision and said, 'This is not in line with our plans, but these things don't often happen,' " Checketts said. "The people at ITT and Cablevision were very supportive."
Checketts had already approved a brutal increase in ticket prices for the second straight year -- "North of 15 percent, over all," he said -- which angered longtime fans, who fear being squeezed out by huge corporations who can afford $5,000 or more per season ticket.
"We didn't pull a Los Angeles Lakers," Checketts said. "They raised their lowest ticket from $9 to $21 the day they signed Shaquille O'Neal. We had already sent out our renewal forms."
Once Gretzky had signed in July, the demand was so strong the Garden even refused to sell season tickets to one longtime patron who had complained about the Garden's holding his money during the lockout two years ago. These people play hardball on ice, but it seems to pay off.
"All our suites and sponsorships are already sold," Checketts said. "So the economic benefit will be long term. But we will be selling a lot of No. 99 shirts."
Garden fans -- who tear the visiting team jersey off the back of any hapless fan who dares to wear it -- used to greet Gretzky the polite way Brooklyn Dodgers fans used to greet Stan (the Man) Musial, even while Musial was bashing the Dodgers' brains out with a smile. You can't hate Wayne Gretzky.
Checketts saw another dimension of Gretzky after the summer signing ceremony at the Garden: "Wayne and his wife, Janet, were flying home to California, and ITT offered its company plane," Checketts said. "I was eager to see my family, so I asked if I could fly west with them. We stopped in Utah and my kids came out to the plane to meet me. He and Janet got out of the plane and stopped to talk to the children.
"Afterward, my 17-year-old, Katie, said that he had held out his hand and said, 'Hi, I'm Wayne,' and he asked her what she thought of life in the East, and what she did in school. I realized that what sets him apart is more than his talent."
The talent was awesome and unique, and maybe it still is. Some New Yorkers truly believe they deserve whatever The Great Gretzky has left.

Is That Glass Half Empty, or Half Full?

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

 BODY:
From the moment the red light went on last night, Bill Clinton played the optimist and Bob Dole, his Republican rival, played the pessimist.
For several months, Mr. Dole's strategists have urged him to project some of the sunniness, some of the confidence that happier days lie just ahead, that made Ronald Reagan one of the great motivators and vote-getters in American history. But Mr. Dole opened the first of his two planned debates with President Clinton by speaking of what he termed the anxieties and worries of the American people, and he said later, "There's a lot of things wrong with America." 
 President Clinton, on the other hand, took as his basic theme an incumbent's typically upbeat appraisal: "We are better off than we were four years ago. Let's keep it going." In his final answer, he commented pointedly, looking directly at Mr. Dole, "It is not midnight in America, Senator."
Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of the debate was its temperate, civilized tone. The two men stuck carefully to major policy issues.
Neither with his economic thrusts nor with other barbs, directed at the President's records on drugs, foreign policy and health care, did Mr. Dole seek to transform the political argument with some dramatic new tactic or revelation. Indeed, his arguments restated those that he has presented on the campaign trail, to no great effect so far.
Whether Mr. Dole gave voters sufficient reason to take another look at him, as his managers said beforehand that he must, remains to be seen. But if this was his last best hope of cutting into Mr. Clinton's lead in the polls, as several of his aides said, he showed no signs of desperation or even urgency.
The President appeared thoroughly relaxed. He made his case calmly and with good humor, stating a credo that reflected his rediscovered centrism of the last year or so: "I believe the purpose of politics is to give people the tools to make the best of their own lives." Nothing that Mr. Dole said seemed to get under his skin, although he occasionally sounded the slightest bit defensive.
Mr. Clinton had little fresh to offer, returning several times to the metaphor he has ridden hard since the Democratic convention, the now-famous "bridge to the 21st century."
Neither man committed anything remotely resembling the kind of gaffe that could hurt him, such as George Bush's indiscreet glance at his wristwatch four years ago or Gerald R. Ford's stumble over Poland's political status in 1976.
Incumbents do not often lose when a nation is at peace and the economy healthy. No American troops are fighting abroad this fall. So Mr. Dole, looking for an opening in a race in which he has trailed for months, had little alternative but to suggest that the President's economic claims were bogus. And he did so, suggesting that while Mr. Clinton might be better off, many of the nation's "working families" had been left behind in what he called the slowest recovery of the century. Bankruptcies, he said, were at the highest rate in history.
But that is a hard sell when the Republican governors of pivotal states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan are bragging about record employment in their towns and cities and when the stock market stands at record levels.
Mr. Dole barely mentioned the economic boom that his supply-side running-mate, Jack Kemp, contends would be set off by the Republicans' 15 percent tax cut, and he said little about revolutionary change in the Federal tax code. Nor did he confront, head-on and in detail, the doubts expressed by many voters and economists that he could cut both taxes and the deficit.
"We're going to make the economic package work," he said without much passion about halfway through the 90-minute debate in Hartford.
He scored several times with his humor, teasing the President about his weight and his cholesterol and teasing himself about his fall from a campaign platform in California. Mr. Dole showed he was not just a grumpy old man, as some have said, and he sought to demonstrate that he had a compassionate side.
He demonstrated a mastery of the details of government that easily matched Mr. Clinton's. At times, he delivered a crisp line that seemed likely to find a receptive audience, as when he told the increasingly conservative electorate: "I trust the people, the President trusts the government." Or at another point: "I want the government to pinch pennies, not families."
Mr. Dole did not shrink from personal attacks, although he declined the invitation of the moderator, Jim Lehrer, to state how his character differed from Mr. Clinton's in ways relevant to the election. He raised the Whitewater issue while saying he would adhere to his policy of not raising Whitewater.
He said the President reminded him of his late brother Kenny, "a great talker" who exaggerated things -- a clear if subtle effort to reinforce doubts about Mr. Clinton's veracity. Borrowing one of Mr. Reagan's more successful lines, he said, "There he goes again," accusing Mr. Clinton of taking credit for things he had not accomplished.
Mr. Dole also stirred memories of his 1988 outburst after the New Hampshire primary, when he demanded that George Bush "stop lying about my record," telling the President to "stop scaring seniors and stop tearing me apart."
But he did avoid the bitterness of tone and dourness of visage that have landed him in trouble in the past -- what Eddie Mahe, a leading Republican campaign consultant, calls "this kind of 'black Bob Dole' vulnerability."
Over all, there was a notable lack of edge to the exchanges. Mr. Dole said repeatedly that he respected the President, and Mr. Clinton said, "I like Senator Dole. You can probably tell that we like each other." That no doubt pleased those Americans who tell pollsters and other interviewers that they dislike the endless bickering in Washington.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE OVERVIEW;
CLINTON AND DOLE, FACE TO FACE, SPAR OVER MEDICARE AND TAXES

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

 BODY:
President Clinton briskly defended his stewardship last night as improving the lives of ordinary Americans while Bob Dole tried to chip at his record by saying that average people had become worse off in the last four years and would prosper with Mr. Dole's proposal for a major tax cut.
The Republican challenger also repeatedly raised questions about the President's character in the first debate of the 1996 Presidential campaign. 
 Trailing in statewide and national polls, Mr. Dole was on the offensive throughout the 90-minute program in Hartford, occasionally displaying a sharp edge, frequently flashing his dry wit and needling Mr. Clinton by calling him a liberal elitist who had done little to curb drug use among teen-agers and whose policies would saddle Americans with higher taxes.
Mr. Clinton, who remained calm but assertive in the face of Mr. Dole's combativeness, put himself forward to the national television audience as having protected the education system, the elderly and the nation's children, and as having presided over a foreign policy that has kept the nation out of war. He depicted his targeted tax cuts as more responsible than what he persistently derided as Mr. Dole's "scheme," a 15 percent across-the-board tax cut.
"It is not midnight in America, Senator: We are better off than we were four years ago," Mr. Clinton declared, sounding a theme of his campaign that he repeated throughout the evening.
Mr. Dole drew the first of many laughs of the night when he said that Mr. Clinton, along with Saddam Hussein of Iraq, was "better off than he was four years ago." But Mr. Dole said that millions of Americans were worse off, in part because the economy was growing slowly.
Neither candidate provided any particularly noteworthy moments, either a particularly compelling quote, or a mistake, that might come to define the debate.
Both candidates tried to link their opponent to the perceived weaknesses of their parties. For Mr. Dole, the word for Mr. Clinton was "liberal."
The Bushnell Theater in downtown Hartford erupted in laughter when Mr. Dole, in a remark about liberals, said of Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, "I remember one day on the floor I said, 'Now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories,' and Kennedy jumped up and said, 'Why haven't we thought of that before?' "
Mr. Clinton brushed aside the criticism. "This liberal charge, that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race," Mr. Clinton said of the Republicans. He said the charge was like a "golden oldie."
As his rival harped on liberals, Mr. Clinton cited the unpopular Speaker, Newt Gingrich, far more than Mr. Dole's running mate, Jack Kemp. The President brought up Mr. Kemp only when he reminded the audience that Mr. Kemp "once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didn't hike."
Mr. Clinton also seized on a question about Medicare to link Mr. Dole to Mr. Gingrich, an effort that is a staple of Democratic campaign advertising. The "Dole-Gingrich" Medicare plan, Mr. Clinton said, would put Medicare at risk, while Mr. Clinton said his own plan to balance the budget would provide 10 years of breathing room to address the looming crisis in Medicare.
Mr. Clinton seized on the first question posed by the moderator, Jim Lehrer of PBS -- about his view of the differences between himself and Mr. Dole -- to deliver a litany of his accomplishments.
"I have worked hard on things like the family and medical leave bill, the Brady bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street," he said. "All these are programs that Senator Dole opposed and I supported because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives." To that he later added his support for a "V-chip" to restrict violent television programming, for rating systems for television programs, for anti-drug programs and for greater regulation of tobacco.
Mr. Dole responded with a line from his own stump speech. "The basic difference is, I trust the people," he said. "The President trusts the government." And he reminded viewers that Mr. Clinton had proposed a $265 billion, five-year tax increase in his fiscal 1993 budget, as well as a sweeping health-care overhaul in his first year in office -- at a cost, he said, of $1.5 trillion.
Mr. Clinton replied, "I trust the people." He then said his Administration was "smaller and less bureaucratic" and had delegated more powers to the states than the Administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush combined.
Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton have shared the stage more than many debate combatants in the past because they frequently appeared side by side when Mr. Dole was still the Senate Republican leader. But the event last night was particularly critical for Mr. Dole because it gave him his first opportunity to appear on an equal footing with the President before an audience of tens of millions.
The format also allowed the two major candidates to face each other head on without Ross Perot, the Reform Party candidate, who was was excluded by the Commission on Presidential Debates, the sponsor of this forum and the second and final in San Diego on Oct. 16. Both candidates appealed to Mr. Perot's supporters when asked about one of his signature issues, campaign reform.
Beyond pounding Mr. Clinton on policy, Mr. Dole's intent last night was to erase his image as a hatchet man from the 1976 Vice Presidential debate -- when he assailed his opponents for "Democrat wars." At the start of the program, for example, Mr. Dole introduced Frank Carafa, who helped rescue Mr. Dole on a hillside in Italy after he was wounded by enemy fire in World War II.
Mr. Dole responded to Mr. Lehrer's wide-ranging questions with hardly any references to his three decades on Capitol Hill, but at times, he spoke in a legislative shorthand that might have been hard for the television audience to follow. Mr. Clinton, who has a reputation as far quicker on his feet, stuck to a few themes in promoting his record.
Mr. Clinton was firm when questioned about his record. Asked how he avoided being influenced by large campaign contributors, Mr. Clinton said, "I try to articulate my positions as clearly as possible, tell them what I stand for, and let them decide whether to support me or not."
Mr. Clinton noted that he had fought the National Rifle Association and tobacco companies, saying, "Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it's right for the country."
But Mr. Dole said the President had taken large amounts of money from labor unions and Hollywood. "If these are not special interests, then I've got a lot to learn," Mr. Dole said.
Mr. Clinton suggested that Mr. Dole had been subject to undue influence by tobacco companies and by "polluters," even allowing polluting companies to write legislation.
When Mr. Lehrer posed one of the most-anticipated questions of the evening -- whether Mr. Dole had difficulties with anything personal about Mr. Clinton -- the Republican candidate all but ignored it, talking again about his economic program.
And then he made a joke. "My blood pressure's lower, my weight, my cholesterol," he said. "But I will not make health an issue in this campaign." It was a lift from Mr. Reagan, who defused concerns about his age in a 1984 debate with Walter F. Mondale by saying he would not make his opponent's youth and inexperience an issue in the campaign.
Mr. Dole briefly turned serious then, saying: "I don't like to get into personal matters. As far as I'm concerned, this is a campaign on issues."
Seeking to cast the contest in terms of trust and character, he said his greatest strength was that "Bob Dole keeps his word."
"Mr. President, about all you have going for you in this campaign is fear," Mr. Dole said, citing Democratic campaign advertising asserting that Mr. Dole would endanger Medicare.
"I know all about poverty and need and taking care of people," Mr. Dole said in a reference to his upbringing in rural Kansas and his painful recovery from his war wounds. And he tried to extend the question of trustworthiness to his plan to cut taxes while still balancing the budget by 2002.
"If I couldn't cut taxes and balance the budget," Mr. Dole said, "I wouldn't look you in the eye and tell you this is good for America."
Mr. Clinton did not directly address Mr. Dole's veiled questioning of his trustworthiness. Instead, Mr. Clinton said the central element of his campaign was his argument that his "plan for the 21st century is the better plan," citing his support for changes in education, health care, welfare and small-scale tax cuts.
On a personal issue for Mr. Clinton -- the Whitewater case -- the President was asked if he intended to grant pardons to anyone involved in the matter. "There has been no consideration of it, no discussion of it," he said.
On foreign policy, an issue that has not drawn much attention in the campaign, Mr. Dole noted that he had "supported the President, I thought he was right" on Bosnia, the North American Free Trade Agreement and other trade issues. But he said Mr. Clinton's overall foreign policy looked like "an ad hoc foreign policy."
Recalling the summit meeting of Middle East leaders at the White House last week, Mr. Dole said, "It seemed to me, just as an observer, that before you'd call somebody to America, you'd have some idea what the end result might be."
"We have lost credibility around the world," Mr. Dole said.
Mr. Clinton insisted that "we have a very consistent policy in the Middle East," to support the security of Israel, the peace process and those who are willing to take risks for peace.
As part of a drive by the Dole campaign to rattle the President, Billy R. Dale, whom Mr. Clinton dismissed from the White House travel office and who now works for Mr. Dole, was seated in the first row, facing Mr. Clinton's lectern. He was one row and four seats away from Hillary Rodham Clinton and said he had been given a ticket by Mr. Dole.
"It's just a pleasure to be here," Mr. Dale said before the event began. "I'm not here to shake up the President, just to see the debate."

A Transcript of the First Televised Debate Between Clinton and Dole

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of last night's Presidential debate in Hartford, as transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House, a private transcription service. The moderator was Jim Lehrer of PBS.
 
MODERATOR The order for everything tonight was determined by coin toss. Now, to the opening statements and to President Clinton. Mr. President.
 
CLINTON Thank you, Jim. And thank you to the people of Hartford, our hosts. I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service, and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults. 
 Four years ago, I ran for President at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration. I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all and an American community where everybody has a role to play.
I wanted a Government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people have the tools to make the most of their own lives. Four years ago, you took me on faith. Now, there's a record: 10.5 million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare rolls, a strong America at peace. We are better off than we were four years ago. Let's keep it going. We cut the deficit by 60 percent. Now, let's balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans. Now, let's pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies and buying a home.
We passed family and medical leave, now let's expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force. We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady bill. Now, let's keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs.
We passed welfare reform, now let's move a million people from welfare to work. And most important, let's make education our highest priority so that every 8-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old can log onto the Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college. We can build that bridge to the 21st century, and I look forward to discussing exactly how we're going to do it.
 
MODERATOR Senator Dole, two minutes.
 
DOLE Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President for those kind words and thank the people of Hartford, the commission and all those out there who may be listening or watching. It's a great honor for me to be here, standing here as the Republican nominee. I'm very proud to be the Republican nominee reaching out to Democrats and independents.
I have three very special people with me. My wife, Elizabeth; my daughter, Robin, who's never let me down, and a fellow named Frank Carafa who, from New York, who along with Ollie Manninen helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back.
I've learned from them that people do have tough times. And sometimes you can't go it alone. And that's what America's all about. I remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses, a doctor in Chicago named Dr. Kelikian. And ever since that time, I've tried to give something back to my country, to the people who are watching us tonight.
America's the greatest place on the face of the earth. Now, I know millions of you still have anxieties. You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table. You worry about the quality and the safety of your children and the quality of education. But even more importantly, you worry about the future, and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had. And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight. Jack Kemp is my running mate, doing an outstanding job.
Now, I'm a plain-speaking man, and I learned long ago that your word was your bond. And I promise you tonight that I'll try to address your concerns and not try to exploit them. It's a tall order, but I've been running against the odds for a long time. And again, I'm honored to be here this evening.
 
Views of Government
MODERATOR Mr. President, first question. There's a major difference in your view of the role of the Federal Government and that of Senator Dole. How would you define the difference?
 
CLINTON Well, Jim, I believe that the Federal Government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives. That, to me, is the key. And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole. For example, we have reduced the size of the Federal Government to it's smallest size in 30 years. We've reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors.
But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street. All these are programs that Senator Dole opposed that I supported, because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives.
I've worked hard to help families impart values to their own children. I supported the V-chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they're young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television. I supported strong action against the tobacco companies to stop the marketing, advertising and sale of tobacco to young people. I supported a big increase in the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program.
These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believe that they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future.
 
MODERATOR Senator Dole, one minute.
 
DOLE I think the basic difference is -- and I've had some experience in this -- I think the basic difference: I trust the people. The President trusts the Government.
We go back and look at the health care plan that he wanted to impose on the American people -- one-seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies, a cost of $1.5 trillion. Don't forget that. That happened in 1993. A tax increase that taxed everybody in America, not just the rich. If you made 25,000, as the original proposal, you got your Social Security taxes increased.
We had a B.T.U. tax turn into a $35 billion gas tax. A $265 billion tax increase. I guess I rely more on the individual. I carry a little card around in my pocket called the 10th Amendment. Where possible, I want to give power back to the states and back to the people.
That's my difference for the present. We'll have specific differences later. He noted a few, but there are others.
 
MODERATOR Mr. President, 30 seconds.
 
CLINTON I trust the people. We've done a lot to give the people more powers to make their own decisions over their own lives. But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries. I think we were right to pass the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, which says you can't lose your health insurance just because you change jobs or because someone in your family's been sick.
Our Government is smaller and less bureaucratic and has given more authority to the states than its two predecessors under Republican Presidents. But I do believe we have to help our people get ready to succeed in the 21st century.
 
Four-Year Comparisons
MODERATORSenator Dole, the President said in his opening statement we are better off today than we were four years ago. Do you agree?
 
DOLE Well, he's better off than he was four years ago.
 
CLINTON I agree with that. That's right.
 
DOLE And I may be better off four years from now, but I don't know. I looked at the slowest growth in the century. He inherited a growth of 4.7, 4.8 percent. Now it's down to about 2.4 percent.
We're going to pass a million bankruptcies this year for the first time in history. We've got stagnant wages. In fact, women's wages have dropped 2.2 percent. Men's wages haven't gone up -- gone down. So we have stagnation.
We have the highest foreign debt in history. And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off? Well, I guess some may be better off. Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago. Rene Preval is probably better off than he was four years ago. But are the American people? They're working harder and higher -- harder and paying more taxes.
For the first time in history, you pay about 40 percent of what you earn, more than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined, for taxes under this Administration. So some may be better off.
 They talk about family income being up. That's not true in Connecticut; family income is down. And it's up in some cases because both parents are working. One works for the family and one works to pay taxes for the Government. We're going to give them a tax cut so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation. That's what America's all about.
 
MODERATOR Mr. President, one minute.
 
CLINTON Well, let me say first of all, in February Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape it's been in in 30 years. We have 10.5 million more jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920's, wages are going up for the first time in a decade, we have record numbers of new small businesses, we had the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years. All groups of people are growing. We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995.
The average family's income has gone up over $1,600 just since our economic plan passed. So I think it's clear that we're better off than we were four years ago. Now we need to focus on what do we need to do to better off still? How can we help people, as we are, to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children? That's what I want to focus on. But we're clearly better off than we were four years ago, as Senator Dole acknowledged this year.
 
MODERATOR Senator Dole?

DOLE I doubt that I acknowledged that this year, but in any event, I think we just look at the facts. We asked the people who are viewing tonight, Are you better off than you were four years ago? It's not whether we're better off, it's whether they're better off. Are you working harder to put food on the table to feed your children? Are your children getting better education? Drug use has doubled the past 44 months all across America. Crime has gone down, but it's because the mayors, like Rudy Giuliani, where one-third of the drop happened in one city, New York City.
So yes, some may be better off, but of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from economic package, they'll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is Vice President.
 
On Medicare
 MODERATOR Mr. President, Senator Dole has come pretty close in the last few days of accusing you of lying about his position on Medicare reform. Have you done so?
 
CLINTON Absolutely not. Let's look at the position. First of all, remember that in this campaign season, since Senator Dole's been a candidate, he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning, in 1965, one of only 12 members. He said he did the right thing then; he knew it wouldn't work at the time. That's what he said.
Then his budget that he passed, along with Speaker Gingrich, cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund. It would have charged seniors more for out-of-pocket costs as well as more in premiums, because doctors could have charged them more. The American Hospital Association, the Nurses Association, the Catholic Hospital Association all said hundreds of hospitals could close and people would be hurt badly under the Dole-Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed.
And now, with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole's, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says that they can't possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him.
Now, my balanced budget plan adds 10 years to the life of the Medicare trust fund. Ten years. And we'll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers.
But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine. We always have to reform it over the years, but we need someone who believes in it to reform it.
 
MODERATOR Senator Dole?
 
DOLE Well, I must say, I looked back at the vote on Medicare in 1965. We had a program called Elder Care that also provided drugs and was means-tested so that people who needed medical attention received it. I thought it was a good program.
But I've supported Medicare ever since. In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, she said: "Bob all I've got is my Social Security and my Medicare. Don't cut it." I wouldn't violate anything my mother said.
In fact, we had a conversation about our mothers one day, a very poignant conversation, in the White House. I'm concerned about health care. I've had the best health care in Government hospitals, Army hospitals, and I know its importance, but we've got to fix it.
It's his trustees, the President's trustees, not mine, who say it's going to go broke. He doesn't fix it for 10 years. We ought to appoint a commission, just as we did with Social Security in 1983, when we rescued Social Security. And I was proud to be on that commission, along with Claude Pepper, the champion of senior citizens from Florida. And we can do it again if we take politics out of it.
Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President. You've already spent $45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart. I think it's time to have a truce.
 
MODERATOR Mr. President?
 
CLINTON Well, let me say first of all, I'd be happy to have a commission deal with this. And I appreciate what Senator Dole did on the '83 Social Security Commission. But it won't be possible to do if his tax scheme passes, because even his own campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says he'll have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed.
I vetoed that bill because it cut more Medicare and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system. My balanced budget plan puts 10 years onto Medicare. We ought to do that; then we can have a commission. But Senator Dole's plans are not good for the country.
 
Tax-Cut Plans
 MODERATOR Senator Dole, speaking of your tax plan, do you still think that's a good idea, the 15 percent across-the-board tax cut?

DOLE Oh, yes, and you'll be eligible. And so will the ----
 
CLINTON Me, too?
 
DOLE So will the former President, yes.
 
CLINTON That's good. I need it.
 
DOLE Well, the people need it. That's the point. This is not a Wall Street tax cut. This is a family tax cut. This is a Main Street tax cut. Fifteen percent across the -- let's take a family making $30,000 a year. That's $1,261. Now maybe to some in this Bushnell Memorial, it's not a lot of money, but people watching tonight with a couple of kids, a working family, that's four or five months of day care, maybe a personal computer. It may be three or four months of mortgage payments.
This economic package is about families, but it's a six-point package. First of all, it's a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, which President Clinton defeated. He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way. We lost by one vote.
It's balancing the budget by the year 2002. It's the tax cut, cutting capital gains 50 percent, so you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities. It's estate tax relief. It's a $500-per-child tax credit. It's about litigation reform. Now that the President gets millions of dollars from the trial lawyers, he probably doesn't like this provision. In fact, when I fell off that podium in Chico, before I hit the ground I had a call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer, saying, "I think we got case here."
So, and it's also regulatory reform. It's a good package, Mr. President. We'd like to have your support.

MODERATOR Mr. President?

CLINTON Well, here's the problem with it. It sounds very good, but there's a reason that 500 economists, including seven Nobel Prize winners, and business periodicals like Business Week, and even Senator Dole's friend, Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican Senator from New Hampshire, says it is a not a practical program. It's a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit, which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans and small business loans.
It's not good to raise the deficit. We've worked too hard to lower it. It will actually raise taxes on nine million people, and in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year.
So, it sounds great, but our targeted tax cut for education, child rearing, health care and home buying, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, something that he has not done, certified by the Congressional Budget Office, that's the right way to go.

MODERATOR Senator Dole?
 
DOLE The President wants to increase spending 20 percent over the next six years. I want to increase spending 14 percent. That's how simple it is. I want the Government to pinch pennies for a change instead of the American families. We're talking about six percentage points over six years. And with that money, you give it back to working people. You also provide opportunity scholarships so low-income parents will have the same choice that other have in sending their children to better schools. And we -- it will work. And when it does work, Mr. President, I know you'll congratulate me.
 
Campaign Financing
 MODERATOR Mr. President, the Senator mentioned the trial lawyers, and that means campaign financing. How do you personally avoid being unduly influenced by people who give you money or give you services in your campaigns?

CLINTON Well, I try to articulate my positions as clearly as possible, tell people what I stand for and let them decide whether they're going to support me or not.
The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers. In the case of the Product Liability Bill, which they passed and I vetoed, I think that's what he's talking about. I actually wanted to sign that bill and I told the people exactly what -- the Congress -- exactly what kind of bill I would sign. Now, a lot of the trial lawyers didn't want me to sign any bill at all. But I thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits. But they wouldn't make some of the changes that I thought should be made.
Now, let me just give you an example. I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus. The drunk driver had no money. Under the new bill, if I had signed it, a person like that could never have had any recovery. I thought that was wrong. So I gave four or five specific examples to the Congress and I said, prove to me that these people could recover, but we're going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits, I'll sign the bill.
But generally, I believe that a President has to be willing to do what he thinks is right. I've done a lot of things that were controversial -- my economic plan, my trade position, Bosnia, Haiti, taking on the N.R.A. for the first time, taking on the tobacco companies for the first time. Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it's right for the country over the long run. That's what I've tried to do, and that's what I will continue to do as President.

MODERATOR Senator Dole?

DOLE How does he avoid conflict? Well, I don't know in the case of the trial lawyers. When I look at the trial lawyers and you're a few million short, you run out to Hollywood and pick up $2 million to $4 million. And organized labor comes to Washington, D.C. and puts $35 million into the pot. Now, if these aren't special interests, then I've got a lot to learn, and I was there for a while before I left on June the 11th.
The trial lawyers, I don't -- you know, my wife's a lawyer. We're the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other. But we're lawyers. I like lawyers. I don't dislike trial lawyers. But it seems to me there's got to be some end to the frivolous lawsuits, and there's got to be some cap on punitive damage. You're putting a lot of businesspeople out of business. Small businessmen and small business women who paid 70 percent of your 19 ---- your $265 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America. I said that one day, and Pat Moynihan, the Democrat, say, no, he said, in the history of the world. So I modified it -- the largest tax increase in the history of the world. And it seems to me that there's a problem there, Mr. President.
And I will address you as Mr. President. You didn't do that with President Bush in 1992.

MODERATOR Mr. President?

CLINTON Let me say, first of all, I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago. I proved that I will sign reasonable tort reform. Secondly, Senator Dole's had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money. But it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who are subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal Government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing and sales of tobacco to children. And it wasn't me that let the polluters actually come in to the halls of Congress, into the rooms and rewrite the environmental laws. That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.

DOLE That's not true.

CLINTON So I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues, instead of trying to characterize each other's motivations. I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree.

MODERATOR Well, Senator Dole, let me ask you the same question I asked the President. How do you avoid being influenced by people who contribute money and services to your campaign?

DOLE I think it's very difficult. Let's be honest about it. That's why we need campaign finance reform. That's why I reach out to the Perot voters, and we've done about all that -- we are the reform party, the Republican Party. And the Perot voters who are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record. Whatever it is, whatever the checklist was in '92, it's all done with campaign finance reform. I worked with Senator Mitchell who played me, I guess, in the debate warm up. We tried six or eight years ago -- he appointed three people, I appointed three people to get campaign finance reform. We couldn't get it done because it wasn't enforceable.
You suggested a commission. Newt Gingrich did. I've suggest that at least four or five years ago. We have a commission on campaign finance reform. They sent it to Congress and we have to vote it up or down, that's how it works. We're never going to fix it by the parties, because Democrats want to better advantage themselves, we want a better advantage as Republicans, and that's not how it's going to work.
But I want to touch on this tobacco thing. I know the President's been puffing a lot on that. But I want to go back to 1965. That was my first vote against tobacco companies when I said we ought to label cigarettes, and I've had a consistent record ever since 1965. We passed a bill in 1992 that encouraged the states to adopt programs and stop kids from smoking. All 50 states did it.
It took three and a half years -- it wasn't until election year, Mr. President, you ever thought about stopping smoking. What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months? Cocaine is up 141 percent, or marijuana, cocaine up 166 percent. I mean it seems to me that you have a selective memory. And you know, mine doesn't work that way so I just want to try to correct it as we go along.

MODERATOR Mr. President?

CLINTON Mr. Lehrer, I hope we'll have a chance to discuss drugs later in the program but let me respond to what you said.
I agree that too many incumbent politicians in Washington and both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform. That was certainly the case from the minute I got there. So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested -- a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago suggested that we appoint a commission. And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members and the commission never met.
And then Senator's Dole's ardent supporter, Senator McCain, who's out there today, along with Senator Feingold supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal. I strongly supported it, and members of Senator Dole's own party in the Senate killed it, and he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill.
So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I've had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform and I will continue to have. And I hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress cause we need it badly.

MODERATOR Senator Dole, 30 seconds.

DOLE Well, on campaign reform itself, we're going to get it when we have a bipartisan commission, take it out of politics, get people who don't have any interest in politics but understand the issue, and let them make a recommendation to Congress. Now we're not kidding anybody, Mr. President. These are sophisticated people watching tonight, millions and millions of Americans. They know the Republican Party hasn't done it. They know the Democratic Party won't do it. We ought to agree that somebody else should do it and we have to vote it up or down.

Drugs in America
MODERATOR Mr. President, the Senator mentioned drugs.

CLINTON I agree.

MODERATOR He's suggested in the past that you are -- you bear some responsibility for the rise in drug use of teenagers in the United States. Is he right?

CLINTON Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what's happened. I am. But let's look at the overall record. Overall in America, cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent. The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it.
Let me tell you what I tried to about it. I appointed a four- star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation's drug czar, the most heavily decorated soldier in uniform when he retired.
We submitted the biggest drug budget ever. We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border. We supported a crime bill that had 60 death penalties, including the death penalty for drug kingpins. And I supported a big expansion in the Safe and Drug Free Schools program to support things like the DARE program, because I thought all those things were very important.
Now, do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don't understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you, even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them? I think we all do and I hope we can do better.
I don't think this issue should be politicized, because my record is clear and I don't think Senator Dole supports youth using drugs. I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn't dangerous and won't kill them and won't destroy their lives get the message and change.

MODERATOR Senator?

DOLE Notice again, you're very selective, Mr. President. You don't want to politicize drugs, but it's all right to politicize Medicare and go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell grants and things of this. I mean, you say we've done all these bad things which isn't the case.
But it seems to me the record is clear. The record is pretty clear in Arkansas. When you were governor, drug use doubled. You resisted the appointment of a drug czar there, because you thought it might interfere with treatment.
But here you cut the drug czar's office 83 percent. You cut interdiction substantially. I mean, that's what you -- I want to stop it from coming across the border, and in my administration we're going to train the National Guard to stop it from coming across the border. This is an invasion of drugs from all over the world and we have a responsibility. You had a surgeon -- or before General McCaffrey, you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs. Is that the kind of leadership we need? And I won't comment on other things that have happened in your Administration or your past about drugs.
But it seems to me that the kids ought to-- -- that if they started they ought to stop, and just don't do it.

MODERATOR Mr. President.
 
CLINTON Let me say again, we did have a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered to the governor just like this one answers to the president. That's what I thought we ought to do.
Secondly, Senator Dole you voted against the crime bill that had the death penalty for drug kingpins in it. And you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act.
I don't think that means you're soft on drugs. We just have a different approach. But, let me remind you that my family has suffered from drug abuse. I know what it's like to see somebody you love nearly loose their lives. And I hate drugs, Senator. We need to do this together and we can.
 
Firearms Issues
 MODERATOR Senator Dole, on the Government -- continuing to talk about the Government's role. If elected President, would you seek to repeal the Brady bill and the ban on assault weapons?
 
DOLE Not if I didn't have a better idea. But, I've got a better idea. It's something that I've worked on for 15 years. It's called the automated check or the instant check.
It's being used in 17 states right now, states like Florida, Colorado, Virginia and other states. You don't buy any gun, you don't get any gun. We've got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have a gun.
We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and there are eight other categories that should not have guns. I've been working on this for a long, long time. You walk in, you put your little card in there. If it says, tilt, you don't get any gun.
You don't get a handgun, you don't get a rifle, you don't get a shotgun. You get zippo. If we're going to protect America's children and American families, and people who live as prisoners in their own home, we've got to stop guns from being dumped on the street.
The Administration says they support the instant check. They've appropriated about $200 million, but only spent about $3 million to get it underway.
In our administration -- in my administration -- we will expedite this, keeps up with technology, it keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns. That is the bottom line, and I believe it's a good idea, has strong bi-partisan support and perhaps, that's another thing we can de-politicize.
You talk about the Brady bill. There's only been one prosecution under the Brady bill -- only one under the Assault Weapon Ban -- and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time.
And on the Assault Weapon Ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because 11 have been modified and they're back on the street. Let's get together on this instant check because that will really make a difference.
 
MODERATOR Mr. President?

CLINTON Let me say first of all, Senator Dole has gone back and forth about whether he'd be for repealing the Brady Bill or repealing the assault weapons ban. And I think his present position is that he would not do so. And if that's true, I'm grateful for it.
But let's look at the facts here. The Brady bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting handguns. Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady bill. He tried to keep it from coming to my desk. He didn't succeed, and I signed it, and I'm glad I did.
Then when we had the assault weapons ban. In the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn't want the Assault Weapons Ban. Just like they didn't want the Brady bill.
But two years later, nobody's lost their handguns -- I mean, their rifles. We've expanded the Brady Bill to cover people who beat up their spouses and their kids, and this is a safer country. So I'm glad I took on that fight, and I believe, with all respect, I was right and he was wrong.

DOLE Well, the President doesn't have it quite right. I mean, it seems to me that at the time that the assault weapon ban was not effected. That's history, because I've told the N.R.A. that's history. You're not going to worry about it anymore. I'm not going to worry about it anymore.
Let's do something better. Let's stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President, talk about this and this. You add up all the states that have used the instant check and how many weapons they've kept out of the hands of criminals, it would far surpass the number you mentioned.
So in my view, if you want to be protected, you ought to vote for Bob Dole, and we'll get the instant check passed and we'll keep guns out of the hands of criminals.
 
Foreign Policy
 MODERATOR Mr. President, Senator Dole said the other day that you practiced a photo-op foreign policy that has lessened the credibility of the United States throughout the world. Is he wrong about that?

CLINTON If that's what he said, he's not right about that. Look at where we are today. The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st century. I have worked to support our country as the world's strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security.
We have done the following things. No. 1, we've managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia; the removal of Russian troops from the Baltics; the integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO and, I might add, with a democratic Russia.
There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the United States tonight, and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age.
We have worked hard for peace and freedom. When I took office, Haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the United States. When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia. Now there is a democratically elected president in Haiti, peace in Bosnia. We've just had elections there.
 We made progress in Northern Ireland and the Middle East. We've also stood up to the new threats of terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America's economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest number of new trade agreements in history.
 That's one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again.

MODERATOR Senator?
 
DOLE Well, I have a different view. Again, I've supported the president on Bosnia. And I think we were told the troops would be out in a year. Now I understand it's been extended until some time next year.
But let's start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets and where 18 Americans were killed one day because they didn't have -- they were pinned down for eight hours. The Rangers, they didn't have the weapons, they didn't have the tanks.
They asked for the tanks. They didn't get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building. It's called mission creep. We turn it over at the United Nations. The President didn't have much to do about it.
Look at Haiti, where we spent about $3 billion and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago, you got to send down some more people because the president found out there are death squads on his own property. So we need more protection from America.
Bosnia, Northern Ireland. There's no cease-fire in Bosnia. I think there's still lots of problems in Bosnia. We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992. We haven't done that. We're way behind, which means Americans can't come home.
Americans shouldn't have gone there in the first place, had we let them defends themselves as they have a right to do under Article 57 of the United Nations charter.
 
MODERATOR Mr. President?
 
CLINTON First of all, I take full responsibility for what happened in Somalia. But the American people must remember that those soldiers were under an American commander when that happened.
 I believe they did the best they could under the circumstances, and let's not forget that hundreds of thousands of lives were saved there.
 Secondly, in Haiti, political violence is much, much smaller than it was. Thirdly, in Bosnia, it's a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war, and at least there has now been an election and the institutions are beginning to function.
 In Northern Ireland and the Middle East, we are better off than we were four years ago. There will always be problems in this old world, but if we're moving in the right direction and America is leading, we're better off.
 
Use of Troops
 MODERATOR Senator Dole, if elected President, what criteria would you use to decide when to send U.S. troops into harm's way?
 
DOLE Well, it -- after World War I, we had, you know, a policy of disengagement. Then, from World War I to World War II, we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy. Now I think we have to have a selective engagement policy. We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations' interests. And many of the things the President talked about he'd turn over to the United Nations. They decided. He's deployed more troops than any President in history around the world.
It's cost us billions and billions of dollars for peacekeeping operations. These are facts. And it seems to me that when you make a decision, the decision is made by the President of the United States, by the Commander in Chief, he makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go around and defend our liberty and our freedom.
That would be my position. And then I'm going to have a top-down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom-up review, we all fight over how much money is there. I want a top-down review to determine what our priorities are and what we should we do in defense, and then follow that policy instead of this bottom-up review with all the services fighting for the money.
You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion. He cut defense $112 billion, devastated states like California and others. And I think now we've got a problem. We've got to go back and look. It's just like you said in Texas, one day, you know, you raise taxes too much, and you did. And you cut defense too much, Mr. President, and you did. And you may have said that, too.
But the bottom line is, we're the strongest nation in the world, we provide the leadership, and we're going to have continue to provide the leadership. But let's do it on our terms, when our interests are involved and not when somebody blows the whistle at the United Nations.
 
CLINTON Our military is the strongest military in the world. It is the strongest, best-prepared, best-equipped it has ever been. There is very little difference in the budget that I've proposed than the Republican budget over the next six-year period.
We are spending a lot of a money to modernize our weapons systems. I proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training.
That is my solemn obligation. You asked, when do you decide to deploy them? The interests of the American people must be at stake. Our values must be at stake. We have to be able to make a difference. And frankly, we have to consider what the risks are to our young men and women in uniform.
But I believe the evidence is that our deployments have been successful in Haiti, in Bosnia, when we moved to Kuwait to repel Saddam Hussein's threatened invasion of Kuwait, when I have sent the fleet into the Taiwan Straits, when we've worked hard to end the North Korean nuclear threat.
I believe the United States is at peace tonight in part because of the discipline, careful, effective deployment of our military resources.

MODERATOR Senator Dole?

DOLE Well, I failed to mention North Korea and Cuba a while ago. You look at North Korea, where they have enough plutonium to build six nuclear bombs, where we have sort of distanced ourselves from our ally, South Korea. They lost about 1 million people in the war, the Korean War, the forgotten war. We lost 53,000 Americans. We shouldn't be doing any favors for North Korea. It's a closed society. We don't have any inspection. We don't know whether it's going to work or not. But we keep giving them these incentives. Some have called them something else. Incentives. We don't know what's going to happen.
Here we have Cuba 90 miles from our shores and what have we done? We passed a law that gave people the right to sue and the president postponed it for six months. And it seemed to me, if you want to send a signal, you got to send a signal, Mr. President. The sooner the better off we'll be if you put tougher sanctions on Castro, not try to make it easier for him.
 
On Cuba
 MODERATOR Mr. President, what is your attitude toward Cuba and how Cuba should be treated?
 
CLINTON Well, first of all, for the last four years we have worked hard to put more and more pressure on the Castro government to bring about more openness and move toward democracy. In 1992, before I became president, Congress passed the Cuban Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously. We made the embargo tougher, but we increased contacts people-to-people with the Cubans, including direct telephone service which was largely supported by the Cuban-American community.
Then Cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international airspace. They were completely beyond the pale of the law and I signed the Helms-Burton legislation. Senator Dole is correct, I did give about six months before effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed, even though they're effective now and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba. And the United States needs help from other countries. Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now, but this law can be used as leverage to get other countries to help us to move Cuba to democracy.
Every single country in Latin America, Central America and the Caribbean is a democracy tonight but Cuba. And if we stay firm and strong we will be able to bring Cuba around as well.
 
DOLE Well, that's the point I made, we have to be firm and strong. And I hope that will happen. It will happen starting next January and maybe can happen the balance of this year. We have not been firm and strong. You look at the poor people who still live in Cuba; it's a haven for drug smugglers and we don't have a firm policy when it comes to Fidel Castro.
In my view, the policy has failed. So Congress passes a law, the president signs it -- like he does a lot of things -- but he, like welfare reform -- well I'm going to sign it but, I'm going to try to change it next year. In a lot of these election year conversions, the President talking about all the drug money and all the other things, all this anti-smoking campaign, all happened in 1996.
I think the people viewing out there ought to go back and take a look at the record -- when he fought a balanced budget amendment, when he gave you that biggest tax increase in history, when he tried to take over your health care system, when he fought regulatory reform that cost the average family $6000 to $7000 a year. This is serious business. It's about your family. It's about your business. And in this case, it's about a firmer policy with Cuba.
 
CLINTON There were several off the subject whoppers in that litany. Let me just mention, Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases. His running mate, Jack Kemp, once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didn't hike.
And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal -- hardly a friend of the Democratic Party or this administration -- that the '82 tax increase he sponsored in inflation adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history. So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here.
 
Health Care
 MODERATOR Senator Dole, you mentioned health reform several times. What do you think should be done about the health care system?
 
DOLE Let me first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut. You know, we were closing loopholes. We were going after big corporations. I know you probably would have oppose them, Mr. President. But I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system and we'll have a fairer, flatter system and we're going to make the economic package work.
Health care, well we finally passed the Kassebaum Bill. The President was opposed to it in 1993. He wanted to give us this big system that took over about one-seventh the economy, that put on price controls, created all these state alliances, would have cost $1.5 trillion and forced people into managed care whether they want it or not. Most people want to see their own doctor. They're going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president. We won't threaten anybody.
So we passed the Kennedy-Kassebaum -- Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. That'll cover about 20 to 25 million people. We've been for that for four or five or six years. The President held it up. And even it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days because he wasn't satisfied with one provision. But it will cover pre-existing conditions. If you change your job, you're going to be covered. So a lot of good things in this bill that we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal Government.
But then, of course, they had a Democratic Congress, and they didn't want to do that. Until we got a Republican Congress, we finally got action, and I'm very proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done.
It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight.
 
CLINTON Well, that sounds very good, but it's very wrong. Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a health care bill in 1994, '93, but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill.
And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid health care before the '94 elections, so they could make that claim.
Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we're pursuing a step-by-step reform now. The Kennedy-Kassebaum Bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or somebody in their family's been sick.
I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries where insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours, and I vetoed Senator Dole's Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine.
 
MODERATOR Senator?
 
DOLE Well, many of the provisions in the Kassebaum bill were provisions of -- my provisions like deductions for long-term care, making certain that self-employed who are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent, but 80 percent you pay for premiums.
You can also deduct long-term care now. So it's a good start. I think there's -- we're even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package. There may be a way there to reach out to the uninsured because there are a lot of uninsured people in this country, particularly children, that should be covered.
Another way you can do is to expand Medicaid. In America, no one will go without health care. No one will go without food.
 
MODERATOR Senator, go ahead and finish your sentence. Sorry.
 
DOLE Food.
 
MODERATOR Food.
 
Handling Iraq
 
MODERATOR Back to foreign affairs for a moment, Mr. President. Are you satisfied with the way you handled this last Iraq crisis and the end result?
 
CLINTON Well, I believe that we did the appropriate thing under the circumstances. Saddam Hussein is under a U.N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own -- repress his own citizens.
Unfortunately, a lot of people have never been as concerned about the Kurds as the United States has tried to be, and we've been flying an operation to protect them out of Turkey for many years now. What happened was that one of the Turkish -- and one of the Kurdish leaders invited him to go up north. But we felt, since the whole world community had told them not to do it, that once he did it we had to do something. We did not feel that I could commit -- I certainly didn't feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that.
So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors. We did that by expanding what's called the no-fly zone, by increasing our allies' control of the airspace now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad.
Was it the right thing to do? I believe it was. Was it fully effective? Did it make him withdraw from the north? Well, he has a little bit, and I hope he will continue.
We have learned that if you give him an inch, he'll take a mile. We had to do something. And even though not all of our allies supported it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was appropriate thing to do.
 
MODERATOR Senator Dole?
 
DOLE Well, the President's own C.I.A. director says that Saddam is stronger now than he was. And I don't understand, extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north. And what we've done, during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department negotiating, trying to work their differences out.
Now we've got all -- thousands and thousands of refugees. We're even shipping, I guess, 3,000 Kurds to Guam. It involves Turkey. It's a real problem that Saddam is probably stronger than he ever was.
We shot -- what? -- 44 cruise missiles that are worth about $1.2 million apiece, and hit some radar that was repaired in a couple, three days. Did we inflict any damage? No.
Did we have any of our allies helping? Well, we had Great Britain. They're always very loyal to us and I appreciate that.
And of course, Kuwait, even though they had to find out they had 5,000 troops coming, they didn't even understand that. We had to get their permission.
The bottom line is, we went in there alone, we're supposed to be operating under U.N. resolution. We did it without any of our allies that helped us in the gulf.
 
CLINTON Senator Dole, as two or three times before tonight, criticized me for working with the U.N. Now I'm being criticized for not working with the U.N.
 
DOLE This is not the U.N.
 
CLINTON Sometimes the United States has to act alone, or at least has to act first. Sometimes we cannot let other countries have a veto on our foreign policy. I could not send soldiers into the north of Iraq. That would have been wrong. I could reduce Saddam Hussein's ability to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again. That's what I did; I still believe it was the right thing to do.
 
The Middle East
 
MODERATOR Senator Dole, on your photo-op foreign policy charge against the President . . .
 
DOLE It's not mine.
 
MODERATOR Oh, no, no, I mean your charge against the President that he has a photo-op foreign policy.
 
DOLEOh.
 
MODERATOR Does the Middle East summit last week fall into that category?
 
DOLE Well, there were some good pictures, but does it fall in that category? I don't know. I want to be very serious. I have supported the president when I thought he was right on Bosnia. I supported him on Nafta and GATT. So it's not that we always disagree. Others disagreed with us.
The Mideast is very difficult, but it seemed to me just as an observer that before you'd call somebody to America you'd have some notion what the end result might be. Now, maybe it's better just to get together and sit down and talk. Maybe that was the purpose. And I know talks have continued -- started again today.
But again, it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy. It's ad hoc; it's sort of well, we get up in the morning and read the papers and what country is in trouble? We'll have a meeting. To me, that's not the strategy that I think that people expect from America. I think we have lost credibility and I say this very honestly, without any partisanship: we've lost credibility around the world. Our allies, they're not certain what we're going to do, what our reaction, what our response is going to be.
Nobody suggests that sending troops to Iraq, if that was the hint there from the president. But I do think that Saddam Hussein is stronger than he was. And I do believe that we didn't gain a great deal in the Mid-East by bringing three of the four leaders -- one refused to come -- to Washington, D.C.
 
CLINTON We have a very consistent policy in the Middle East. It is to support the peace process, to support the security of Israel and to support those who are prepared to take risks for peace. It is a very difficult environment. The feelings are very strong. There are extremists in all parts of the Middle East who want to kill that peace process.
Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace. I would like to have had a big organized summit, but those people were killing each other rapidly -- innocent Arab children, innocent Israeli people, they were dying. And so much trust has broken down in the aftermath of the change of government.
 
CLINTON I felt that if I could just get the parties together to say, let's stop the violence, start talking, commit to the negotiations, that would be a plus.
Now today, the secretary of state is in the Middle East. And they've started negotiations and all those leaders promised me they would not quit until they resolve the issues between them and got the peace process going forward again.
 
MODERATOR Senator Dole.
 
DOLE Well, I'm disappointed in the President not calling for an unconditional end to the violence. I mean, it seemed to me the violence had stopped when these leaders came to America.
The killing and the tragedies had taken place. And it's unfortunate. And it is a difficult area. No doubt about it. It shouldn't be politicized in any way by the President or by his opponent. And I don't intend to politicize it. I hope that they've talked. And I hope they've reached some result and that the killing will end.
 
Bridges to the Past
 
MODERATOR Mr. President, in your acceptance speech in Chicago, you said the real choice in this race is quote, "Whether we build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past; about whether we believe our best days are still out there or our best days are behind us; about whether we want a country of people all working together or one where you're on your own." Are you saying that you believe Senator Dole is a man of the past, and if elected President, he would lead the country backward?
 
CLINTON Well, I'm saying that Senator Dole said in his fine speech in San Diego that he wanted to build a bridge to the past. And I think I know what he meant by that.
He's troubled as I am by some of the things that go on today. But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge, the barriers of the present, always moving into the future.
That's why when I became President, I was determined to kind of move beyond this old, stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long, to get this country moving again.
And that's why we've got a country with 10.5 million more jobs and record numbers of new businesses and rising incomes and falling crime rates and welfare role rates; why we're moving in the right direction.
And I'm trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue to do that. That's why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy. That's why I want a tax cut for education and child rearing. But it's got to be paid for.
That's why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again. These are my commitments.
I am very oriented toward the future. I this election has to be geared toward the future. I think America's best days are still ahead, but we got to build the right bridge.
 
MODERATOR Senator Dole?
 
DOLE You know, the President reminds me sometimes of my brother, Kenny who's no longer alive. Kenny was a great talker.
And he used to tell me things that I knew were not quite accurate, so we always had a rule we divided by six.
Now, maybe in your case, maybe just two. But 11 million new jobs, and everything -- I mean the President can't take credit for everything that governors are doing, or that's happening in New York City when it comes to the murder rate and then not be responsible for the bad things that happen, whether its drug use, or something else in America. And so it seems to me that we can talk about what we call Kenny the great exaggerator, because he just liked to exag-- -- make it sound a little better -- it made you feel better.
When it comes to bridges, I want a bridge to the future. I also want a bridge the truth. We have to tell the truth. We've got people watching tonight, and listening tonight, trying to find the truth. And the truth is there's a lot wrong with America.
We need a strong economic package. We need a tax cut, we need the $500 child credit. And we'll have that, soon.
 
MODERATOR Mr. President?
 
CLINTON I do not for a moment think I'm entitled to all the credit for the good things that have happened in America. But where I have moved to work with the American people to help them have the tools to make the most of their own lives, I think I should get some credit for that.
I also personally took responsibility tonight when Senator Dole asked me about the drug problem. But you know, I think my ideas are better for the future.
Senator Dole voted against student loans, against Head Start, against creating the Department of Education. If he gets elected president, we'll start the new century without anyone in the Cabinet of the president representing education and our children.
I personally don't think that's the right kind of future for America and I think we ought to take a different tack.
 
Department of Education
 
MODERATOR Senator Dole, do you still favor eliminating the Department of Education?
 
DOLE Yes. I didn't favor it when it was started. I voted against it. It was a tribute that after President Carter's election, to the National Education Association, we sent a lot of delegates to the Democratic Convention, who gave 99.5 percent of their money, Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools.
So, what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships. Now, some say, oh, you're a Republican -- you can't be reaching out to these people. I've reached out to people all my life.
I've worked on the food stamp program proudly and the W.I.C. program and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey and others, to name a few of my Democratic friends.
I'm not some extremist out here. I care about people. I have my own little foundation that's raised about $10 million for the disabled. I don't advertise it. Just did. I haven't before. But I try to do a lot of things that I think might be helpful to people.
Well, it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landel Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father you're going to get to go to school because we're going to match what the state puts up, and you're going to get to go to the school of your choice.
I don't fault the president or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools. I applaud them for it. I don't criticize them. But why shouldn't everybody have that choice?
Why shouldn't low income Americans and low middle income Americans? I'm excited about it. It's going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people.
 
CLINTON Let me say, first of all, I'm all for students having more choices. We've worked hard to expand public school choice.In my balanced budget bill, there's funds for 3,000 new schools created by teachers and parents, sometimes by business people, called charter schools, that have no rules.
They're free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children. The ones that are out there are doing well.
What I'm against is Senator Dole's plan to take money away from all the children we now help with limited federal funds and help far fewer. If we're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be done at the local level or the state level.
But Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal help to education. He voted against student loans. He voted against my improved student loan plans. He voted against the National Service bill, against the Head Start bill.
He voted against our efforts in Safe and Drug-Free Schools. He has voted against these programs. He does not believe it. That's the issue. Ninety percent of our kids are out there in those public schools, and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those I've outlined in this campaign.
 
DOLE I better correct the president here. I don't know what time it is, but it's probably getting late. But I want to correct -- all these things I voted against, they were probably part of some big package that had a lot of pork in it or a lot of things that we shouldn't have had and we probably voted no.
I've supported all the education programs. I've supported Head Start. I think we ought to look at it. So I don't want anybody out there to think that we've just been voting no, no, no.
Let's give low income parents the same right that people of power and prestige have in America and let them go to better schools. Let's not -- let's help -- let's turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the National Education Association.
 
School Choice
 
MODERATOR Mr. President, what's wrong with the school choice proposal?
 
CLINTON I support school choice. I support school choice. I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and, I said the creation of 3,000 new schools that we are going to help the states to finance.
But if you're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be determined by states and localities where they're raising and spending most of the money. I simply think it's wrong to take money away from programs that are helping build basic skills for kids -- 90 percent of them are in the public schools -- to take money away from programs that are helping fund the school lunch program that are helping to fund the other programs that are helping our schools to improve their standards.
Our schools are getting better. And our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level.
I have been a strong force for reform. And Senator, I remind you that a few years ago, when I supported a teacher testing law in my home state, I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers' association. I just don't believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them in the way you did at the Republican convention. I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward.
And let me just say, that budget you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 kids out of Head Start, it would have eliminated the AmeriCorps plan and it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships. Now it would have, that's a fact. That's one of the big reasons I vetoed it. We need to be doing more in education, not less.
 
DOLE Well, the AmeriCorps program, I must say, if that's one of your successes, I wouldn't speak that too loudly. It's cost about $27,000 to pay people to volunteer.
We've got four million young people volunteering every year. The number hasn't gone down. And you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering.
I like young people. I like teachers. I'm a product of public schools. You attended a private school for some time in your life.
I like teachers. But let's -- you're not for school choice. You can't be for school choice, because this is that special interest money again. When you get 99.5 percent of the money, we don't know what happened to the other 0.5 percent we're looking for. Somebody got it.
But it all went to Democrats. And this is part of that liberal establishment, one of those liberal things that you just can't do. You're for school uniforms and curfews, and you're opposed to truancy. Now that's not reform, Mr. President. Why can't Landel Shakespeare in Cleveland or Pilar Gonzales in Milwaukee give their children an opportunity to go to a better school?
Some schools aren't safe. Some schools aren't even safe. And your choice is nothing. Let's give them a real choice, the kind of choice you have and the kind of choice a lot of people have in America.
If we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy, let's start with education.
 
CLINTON First of all, Senator Dole, let's set the record straight. I was able for two years, when I was a very young boy, to go to a Catholic school, but I basically went to public schools all my life. And I've worked hard for a long time to make them better; 90 percent of our kids are there.
It's amazing to me -- you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything, except schools. Where we don't have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education, we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help. If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private school choice plan, like Milwaukee did, let them have it.
 I might say, the results are highly ambiguous. But I want to get out there and give a better educational opportunity to all of our children, and that's why I vetoed the budget that you passed with $30 billion in education cuts. It was wrong, and my plan for the future is better.
 
Convention Remarks
 
MODERATOR Senator Dole, at the Republican convention you said the following, and I quote, "It is demeaning to the nation that within the Clinton Administration the core of the elite who never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered and never learned should have the power to fund with your earnings their dubious and self-serving schemes." Whom precisely, and what precisely did you have in mind?
 
DOLE I had precisely in mind a lot of the people who were in the White House and other agencies who never been -- had any experience, who came to Washington without any experience. They're all very liberal, of course, they wouldn't be in the administration. And their idea was that they knew what was best for the America people.
 Now, I feel very strongly about a lot of things. I feel strongly about education. I want to help young people to have an education just as I had an education after World War II with the G.I. Bill of Rights. And we've had millions of young men and women in subsequent wars change the face of the nation, because the government helped with their education.
 Now, the reason they don't have -- you know, the reason the President can't support this is pretty obvious. It's not taking anything away from schools, it's new money, it's not going to be taken away from anybody else, except we'll downsize the Department of Education.
But this is a very liberal Administration. This is the Administration gave you the big tax cut (sic). This is the Administration that tried to take over health care and impose a governmental system. This is the administration that fought regulatory reform that's putting a lot of small businessmen and small business women out of business.
This is the Administration that fought the Balanced Budget Amendment and vetoed a balanced budget and vetoed welfare reform twice and the list goes on and on and on. That's what I had in mind. I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America. There won't be 10 millionaires and 14 lawyers in the Cabinet. They'll be people with experience and people who understand America and people who've made it and know the hard knocks in life.
 
CLINTON When Senator Dole made that remark about all the elitists, young elitists in the administration, one of the young men who works for me who grew up in a house trailer looked at me and said, Mr. President, I know how you grew up. Who is he talking about? And you know this liberal charge, that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race. It's sort of their golden oldie, you know. It's a record they think they can play that everybody loves to here. And I just don't think that dog will hunt this time.
The American people should make up their own mind. Here's the record. We cut the deficit four years in a row for the first time since before the Civil War. I mean before World War II and maybe before the Civil War, too.
We've got 10 and a half million new jobs. We've got record numbers of those new small businesses. We made everyone of them eligible for a tax cut. We've got declining crime rates, two million fewer people on welfare rolls before the welfare reform passed, and a 50 percent increase in child support, and a crime bill with 60 death penalties, 100,000 police and the Assault Weapons Ban. The American people can make up their mind about whether that's a liberal record a record that's good for America. Liberal, conservative, you put whatever label you want on it.
 
DOLE Well I think it's pretty liberal. I'll put that label on it. Now you take a look at all the programs you've abdicated, Mr. President. Thank goodness we had a Republican Congress there. The first thing you did when you came into office was send up a stimulus package, said we've got a little pork we want to scatter around America, $16 billion.
And even some in your own party couldn't buy that. I remember talking to you by the telephone. I'm not even certain you were too excited about it. I never repeat what I talk to the President about, but in any event, we saved the taxpayers $16 billion. And then came some other programs, and then came health care and then came the tax increase. And a lot of these things just stopped in 1994 because then the Congress changed and I think we've done a good job.
 
MODERATOR Mr. President, if you're not a liberal, describe your political philosophy.
 
CLINTON I believe that the purpose of politics is to give people the tools to make the most of their own lives, to reinforce the values of opportunity and responsibility, and to build a sense of community so we're all working together. I don't believe in discrimination.
I believe you can protect the environment and grow the economy. I believe that we have to do these things with a government that's smaller and less bureaucratic, but that we have to do them nonetheless.
It's inconvenient for Senator Dole, but the truth is I've reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors, and I did stop them. I admit that. I sure stopped their budget.
Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third. It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump by a third. It ended the principle of the polluter should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent.
Their budget weakened our support for education $30 billion. It even cut funds for scholarships and college loans. Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare.
And finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of health care to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing home, poor pregnant women.
It was wrong for the country, and calling it conservative won't make it right. It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I hadn't stopped it.
 
DOLE Well, the president can define himself in any way he wants. But I think we have to look at the record, go back to the time he was, what, Texas director for George McGovern. George McGovern is a friend of mine, so I don't mean -- but he was a liberal, proud liberal.

 I've just finished reading a book. I think it's called, what is it, "The Demise of the Democratic Party" by Ronald Kardash or something, talking about all the liberal influences in the administration, whether it's organized labor or whether it's the Hollywood elite or whether some of the media elite or whether it's the labor unions or whatever.
And so, I think you take a look at it. But at the bottom line is this: I think the American people thought he'd sign all these bills and all these things, they want to know what's going to happen to them.
They've all got a lot of anxieties out there. Did anybody complain when you raised taxes? Anybody go out and ask the people how are you going to pay the extra money?
That's why we want an economic package. We want the government to pinch their pennies for a change instead of the people pinching their pennies.
That's what our message is to people watching, not all this back and forth -- you voted this way, you voted that way. We want a better America as we go into the next century.
 
CLINTON The way to get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment; to give a targeted tax cut -- and let me talk about the education tax cut; to let people have a $10,000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year.
Any kind of college tuition. To give families a tax credit -- a dollar-for-dollar reduction in their taxes for the cost of a typical community college so we can open that to everybody.
And to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education, home buying or medical expenses. That's the right way to go into the 21st century, balance the budget and cut taxes, not balloon with this $550 billion tax scheme.
 
Personal Differences
 
MODERATOR Senator Dole, we've talked mostly now about differences between the two of you that relate to policy, issues and that sort of thing. Are there also significant differences in the more personal area that are relevant to this election?
 
DOLE Let me say first on the president's promise for another tax cut. I mean, I've told people as I travel around, all of you've got the tax cut he promised last time, vote for him in '96, and not many hands go up.
 So, the question's would you buy a used election promise from my opponent. The people want economic reform. They're having a hard time making ends meet. You got one parent working for the government. The other parent working for the family.
 And this is important business. This is about getting the economy moving again. This is about American jobs and opportunities. It's about the government, as I said before, pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer.
 When they raise your taxes, nobody runs around asking people, where you going to get the extra money? I think the government can do better. Are there personal differences?

MODERATOR That are relevant to this here.
 
DOLE Well, my blood pressure's lower and my weight, my cholesterol. But, I will not make health an issue in this campaign.
 So -- I think he's a bit taller than I am. But, I think there are personal differences. I mean, I don't like to get into personal matters. As far as I'm concerned, this is a campaign about issues.
It's about my vision for America and about his liberal vision for America. And not about personal things. And I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past.
I know, he wants to disown it. I wouldn't want to be a liberal either, Mr. President, but you're stuck with it because that's your record. That's your record in Arkansas. The biggest tax increase in history; biggest crime increase in history; biggest drug increase in history in Arkansas.
 
MODERATOR Mr. President?
 
 Well, just for the record, when I was the governor, we had the lowest -- second lowest -- tax burden of any state in the country. The highest job growth rate of any state when I ran for president. And we're widely recognized for a lot of other advances.
But, the important thing is, what are we going to do now? I think a targeted tax cut is better for our future, targeted to education and child rearing.
With the rest of the education plan, hooking up all of our classrooms to the Internet by the year 2000, making sure we've got an army of reading volunteers train people to teach with parents and teachers so that our eight-year-olds can learn to read.
Investing in environment, cleaning up 2/3 of the toxic waste dumps. Those plans are better than this $550 billion tax scheme. Now, remember, folks, even Senator Dole's campaign coach here says that D'Amato says he's got to cut Medicare to pay for this.
Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, 7 Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy. It's going to blow a hole in the deficit, raise taxes on 9 million people and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed.
Our plan is better, it will take us into the future with a growing economy and healthier families.
 
DOLE Well, I'm really encouraged to know of your renewed friendship with Al D'Amato. And I know he appreciates it.
You didn't even have tax cuts in your budget, Mr. President, the first two years you were president. It wasn't until we had Republican Congress you'd even thought about -- you talked about tax cuts.
And getting back to personal differences. I don't -- I think if Jim -- if you're a little more specific. But I think the president could clarify one thing tonight, and that's the question of pardons.
I know you talked about it on the Jim Lehrer on a PBS show, and I've never discussed Whitewater as I've told you personally, I'm discussing Whitewater now, but I am discussing a power of the president has to grant pardons.
And hopefully, in the next segment you could lay that rest.
 
MODERATORMr. President?
 
CLINTON Well, first of all, you know, he made that remark about Senator D'Amato.
He's arranged for me to spend a lot more time with Senator D'Amato in the last couple of years, and so I'm more familiar with his comments than I used to be.
Let me say what I've said already about this pardon issue. This is an issue they brought up. It's under -- there has been no consideration of it, no discussion of it. I'll tell you this: I will not give anyone special treatment and I will strictly adhere to the law, and that is what every president has done, as far as I know, in the past. But whatever other presidents have done, this is something I take seriously and that's my position.
 
DOLE But it seems to me the president shouldn't have any comment at all, particularly where it's someone where you've had business dealing with. I mean, you may be sending a signal. I don't know; I'm not questioning anybody. But as the president of the United States, when somebody asks you about pardons, you say no comment, period.
And I think he made a mistake, and I think when you make a mistake, you say I made a mistake. But apparently his position hasn't changed. If there are other specific areas, but beyond that I haven't gotten into any of these things, as the president knows. We've had that discussion.
And again, I know Senator D'Amato I think may have had a hearing or two on Whitewater, I can't remember, but he's not my general chairman, he's a friend of mine. And so is Senator Kennedy a friend of yours and----
 
CLINTON You bet.
 
DOLE and I remember one day on the floor I said, now gentlemen, let me tax your memories, and Kennedy jumped up and said, "Why haven't we thought of that before?" So, one of your liberal friends.
 
CLINTON Thank you.
 
MODERATOR Mr. President, 30 seconds.
 
CLINTON No comment.
 
DOLE What's the subject matter?

Views of Their Opponent
 
MODERATOR Senator Dole, if you could single out one thing that you would like for the voters to have in their mind about President Clinton on a policy matter or a personal matter, what would it be? Something to know about him, understand it and appreciate it?

DOLE See, if I say anything, it's going to misconstrued. I don't think this is even a race between the -- it's about our vision for America. I happen to like President Clinton personally. I'm addressing him all evening as Mr. President. I said in 1992 he didn't extend that courtesy to President Bush.
But I respect the Presidency. I've served under a number of presidents. They all have their strengths and they all have their weaknesses. So I'd rather talk about my strengths. I think I have my strengths.
And I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word. It's a question between trust and fear. And I would say, I think, Mr. President, about all you've got going in this campaign is fear. You're spending millions and millions of dollars in negative ads, frightening senior citizens. I know this to be a fact, because I had one tell me last week, Senator, don't cut my Medicare.
I'm trying to save your Medicare, just as I rescued Social Security with a bipartisan commission. I have relatives on Medicare. I used to sign welfare checks for my grandparents. I know all about poverty and all about need and all about taking care of people. And that's been my career in the United States Senate.
And I'll keep my word on the economic package. If I couldn't cut taxes and balance the budget at the same time, I wouldn't look you in the eye tonight in your living room, wherever you may be, and say that this is good for America.
People will tell you who served with Bob Dole, agree or disagree, he kept his word. That's what this race is all about.
 
CLINTON I'd like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side and to move this country forward. And we're better off than we were four years ago. But the most important thing is my plan for the 21st century is a better plan.
A targeted tax cut; a real commitment to educational reform; a deep commitment to making welfare reform work, within incentives to the private sector to move people from welfare to work.
Now we've have to create those jobs now that we're requiring people to go to work. A commitment to continuing step by step health care reform with the next step helping people who are between jobs to access health care, not lose it just because they're out of work for a while. A commitment to grow the economy while protecting the environment.
That's what I'd like them to know about me, that I've gotten up everyday and worked for the American people and worked so that their children could have their dreams come true. And I believe we've got the results to show we're one the right track.
The most important thing is, I've believe we've got the right ideas for the future.
And like Senator Dole -- I like Senator Dole. You can probably tell we like each other. We just see the world in different ways and you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right.

DOLE Well I'd say, you know the first homeless bill in the Senate was the Dole-Byrd bill, part of the Dole-Byrd bill -- I can't remember who was in control then. I remember working with Senator Ribicoff from Connecticut on the hospice program, and now 2500 hospices. As I said, I remember -- I've worked all my life while I was in the Congress. I left on June the 11th because I wanted the American people to know that I was willing to give up something.
President Clinton ran for Governor in 1990 and said he's going to fill out his term but he didn't. He's president so I guess it's a little better deal. But I wanted the American people to know that I was willing to give up something. It wasn't just getting more power and more power.
So I rolled the dice. I put my career on the line because I really believe the future of America is on the line. We can give you all these numbers. They don't mean a thing if you're out of work, you have nothing to eat or you can't have medical care or you're holding a crack baby in your arms right now, and what do you do next?
 
DOLE You know, America's best days are ahead of us. I've seen the tough times. I know they can be better. And I'll lead America to a brighter future.
 
MODERATOR Mr. President, what do you say to Senator Dole's point that this election is about keeping one's word?
 
CLINTON Let's look at that. When I ran for president I said we'd cut the deficit in half in four years. We cut it by 60 percent. I said that our economic plan would produce eight million jobs. We have 10.5 million new jobs. We're number one in autos again, record numbers of new small businesses.
I said we'd pass a crime bill that would put 100,000 police on the street, ban assault weapons, and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug kingpins. And we did that.
I said we would change the way welfare works, and even before the bill passed we'd moved nearly two million people from welfare to work, working with states and communities.
I said we'd get tougher on child support, and child support enforcement's up 50 percent. I said that I would work for tax relief for middle class Americans. The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be, and I think they're better off -- all of us are -- that we got those interest rates down and the deficit down.
The Republicans talk about it, but we're the first administration in anybody's lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row.
We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans, and now I've got a plan that's been out there for two years. It could have been passed already, but instead the Republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me, and I couldn't take that.
But we'll get the rest of that tax relief. And so, I think when you can look at those results, you know that the plan I've laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if you'll give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st century.

MODERATOR Senator.

DOLE Well, there he's goes again. I mean, it's a line that's been used before. But, exaggerating all the things that he did. He didn't do all these things.
Let's take all these four-debt years in a row. He came in with a high growth rate, the 1990 budget agreement -- which some didn't like -- had some very tough cost controls, put a lot of pressure on congress. The S & L crisis was over, they were starting to sell assets.
So, all that money was coming in. And he cut defense an extra $60 billion, threw a lot of people out of work. He talks about a smaller government. There are actually more people in government except for the people in defense-related jobs. They're gone.
The government's bigger than it was when President Kennedy was around. No, he says, it's not. In addition, the Republican congress cut $53 billion. So, let's just, you know, let's give credit where credit is due.
Governor Engler of Michigan cut taxes 21 times, created a lot of new jobs. So, did Governor Thompson, so did Governor Rowland. You know, a lot of people out there deserve credit, Mr. President.
When I'm President of the United States, we're going to have a Governor's Council. And we're going to work directly with the governors -- Republicans and Democrats -- to get power back to the people and back to the states.
 
CLINTON I think a lot of people deserve credit. And I've tried to give to them. But, I believe that my plan is better than Senator Dole's ill-advised $550 billion scheme which I'll say again will blow a hole in the deficit.
Our plan, will balance the budget, and grow the economy, preserve the environment and invest in education. We have the right approach for the future. And look at the results. It is not midnight in America, Senator, we are better off than we were four years ago.

Closing Statements
 
MODERATOR All right. That's the last question. The last answer. Let's go now to the closing statements. Mr. President, you're first. Two minutes.

CLINTON Well, first Jim, let me thank you and thank you, Senator Dole, and thank you ladies and gentlemen, all of you listening tonight, for the chance you've given us to appear.
I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years. I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life and I've done my best to be faithful to the charge you've given me.
I'm proud of the fact that America is stronger and more prosperous and more secure than we were four years ago. I'm glad we're going in the right direction. And I've done my best tonight to lay out my plans for going forward to an even better future in the next century.
I'd like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn't happen in this country. The auto worker in Toledo who was unemployed when I was elected and now has a great job, because we're number one in auto production again.
All the people I've met who used to be on welfare who are now working and raising their children and I think what others could do for our country and for themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way.
I think of the man who grabbed by the shoulder once with tears in his eyes and said his daughter was dying of cancer and he thanked me for giving him a chance to spend some time with her without losing his job, because of the Family and Medical Leave Act.
I think of all the people that I grew up with and went to school with whom I stay in touch with and who never let me forget how what we do in Washington affects all of you out there in America.
Folks, we can build that bridge to the 21st century big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across. And I hope that you will help me build it.
 
MODERATOR Senator Dole, you're closing statement, sir.

DOLE Thank you, Jim. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank everyone for watching and listening. And I want to address my remarks to the young people of America because they're the ones that are going to spend most of their life in the 21st century. They're the ones who have the challenges and there are people out there making predictions that it's not going to be the same.
You're not going to have the opportunities. It's going to be more deficits, more drugs, more crime and less competence in the American people. And that's what you're faced with, the parents are faced with and the grandparents are faced with. It's important. It's their future.
And I would say to those -- I know there are more young people experimenting with drugs today than ever before. Drug use has gone up. And if you care about the future of America, if you care about your future, just don't do it. And I know that I'm someone older than you, but I've had my anxious moments in my life. I've learned to feed myself and to walk and to dress. I'm standing here as proof that in America the possibilities are unlimited. I knew who I am and I know where I'm from, and I know where I want to take America.
We are the greatest country on the face of the Earth. We do more good things for more people in our communities, our neighborhoods, than anywhere that I know of.
This is important business. This election is important. I ask for your support. I ask for your help.

Thank you. God bless America.

HEADLINE: THE DOCTOR'S WORLD;
Yeltsin's Heart Surgeon in Action Performing a Coronary Bypass

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D. 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 7

 BODY:
In the same immaculately clean, high-technology operating room at the Cardiology Center here where Boris N. Yeltsin is expected to undergo heart bypass surgery in the next few weeks, his surgeon, Dr. Renat S. Akchurin, performed a similar operation on a 36-year-old man on Thursday.
Looking on, this reporter had a rare glimpse into heart surgery in Russia where surgeons said far fewer bypasses are done than are needed. Economic hardships limit the number of bypasses to about 3,000 each year, compared with more than 300,000 in the United States. 
 Draped in a two-tone blue and olive scrub suit, Dr. Akchurin peered at different times in the operation through either jeweler-type loupes strapped to his head or an operating microscope suspended overhead. The aim was to magnify by several times arteries and veins, some less than two twenty-fifths of an inch in width, that he cut and stitched to create new channels for blood to flow around the man's blocked coronary arteries and nourish the heart.
There was strict adherence to infection control practices, except for an assistant whose mask failed to cover his nose. The operating room was silent until Dr. Akchurin finished the most difficult part. The music that ordinarily plays in the background was inexplicably absent this day, Dr. Akchurin said, and he had to sew two extra stitches to adjust for the man's unusual anatomy. Otherwise, the operation went smoothly.
Efforts to reach Dr. Akchurin today for a report on the patient's condition, however, were unsuccessful.
During the surgery, Dr. Akchurin was polite and soft-spoken, unlike many other surgeons who have been known to yell and throw instruments in the operating room. He prefaced requests for instruments from his scrub nurse with a "please." But Dr. Akchurin changed his tone of voice to convey degrees of displeasure when assistants were not quick enough or a reporter asked too many questions about Mr. Yeltsin's case.
The circular operating room was more spacious than many in the United States. Its stainless steel walls make it easier to clean and avoid the repainting needed for most American operating rooms.
The Finnish-built and designed room contained standard items like a heart-lung bypass machine; monitors for vital functions like blood pressure, heart rate and electrocardiogram tracings; X-ray equipment, and television monitors connected to cameras placed in the overhead spotlights that brighten the operating field. The equipment was, for the most part, made in Germany or Britain. Store rooms appeared well stocked.
The cardiology center is in a larger institute named for its head, Dr. Yevgeny I. Chazov, a cardiologist who pioneered in the modern clot-dissolving techniques used to stop heart attacks in progress and was Minister of Health in the former Soviet Union. The center is clean and plush by Russian standards. The lobby and hallways are made of marble, the floors of granite and flagstone. The floors near Dr. Akchurin's office are wood parquet.
The heart center contrasts starkly to the grimy, aging hematology institute where Dr. Andrei I. Vorobyov works. He heads the Russian team of consultants in Mr. Yeltsin's case and his expertise has been tapped in studies of radiation damage from the Chernobyl nuclear accident. Doctors at the hematology center said they lacked essential drugs and equipment and that the building had not been repaired since it was built after World War II. People stumble in the hallways, which are dark to save the costs of electricity.
Over the weekend, Mr. Yeltsin moved from the Kremlin Hospital, where he had been a patient since Sept. 12, to a sanitarium, where he is expected to be freer to move around and increase his workload.
Dr. Akchurin is one of several consulting cardiac surgeons at the Kremlin Hospital. Yet the man whose hands control Mr. Yeltsin's fate and perhaps that of his vast country said he did not know why he was chosen to perform a triple or quadruple bypass operation on the 65-year-old Russian President.
Dr. Akchurin said he expected and preferred to perform Mr. Yeltsin's operation at his center instead of the Kremlin Hospital, particularly because of a disagreement between the two hospitals. Dr. Akchurin said he believed that the intensive-care practice at the Kremlin Hospital was inferior because anesthesiologists there stopped caring for a patient once the operation was completed and did not join the surgeons in monitoring a patient's course in the recovery room, as they did in his own hospital.
During his first years as a surgeon, from 1973 to 1984, Dr. Akchurin learned microsurgical techniques, largely for research purposes. In transplanting kidneys and hearts in rats, Dr. Akchurin came to depend on the 8- to 10-power magnification of an operating microscope. At the time, microsurgery was an underdeveloped field, Dr. Akchurin said. He applied the skills learned from animal surgery to the delicate repair of nerves and arteries in hands that had been mutilated in industrial accidents and in reimplanting arms and legs severed in automobile accidents.
Dr. Akchurin also worked with leaders in Russian cardiovascular surgery to perform heart transplants, create grafts to bypass clogged arteries in a leg and repair bulges in the aorta, the body's main artery. It was also a time when Dr. Chazov was scouring Russia for talented young doctors to upgrade the quality of medicine at the institute.
Dr. Chazov invited Dr. Akchurin to work at the cardiology center and sent him to work for several months with his friend Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, the heart surgery pioneer, at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. Two weeks ago, Dr. DeBakey consulted on Mr. Yeltsin's case while attending a scientific meeting here.
After visiting heart surgeons at the Stanford University, New York University and New York Hospital-Cornell medical centers, Dr. Akchurin returned to Moscow and started a program in coronary artery surgery at the institute, relying on the operating microscope that only a few others like Dr. George Green at New York University were using for coronary bypasses. To do so, Dr. Akchurin said he had to solicit the aid of factories in Kazan to fashion a needle that is three times thinner than those used elsewhere as well as other lightweight surgical tools to let him sew with the extra thin sutures. He said he also helped modify to his needs scissors "made like a pencil so you just turn it and cut what you need" instead of spreading the handle as in a conventional pair.
Most surgeons use loupes while performing bypass operations. But Dr. Akchurin looks through them only while removing the internal mammary artery from beneath the rib cage. Then, while stitching the grafts made from the mammary artery and veins taken from the leg, Dr. Akchurin turns to the higher magnification afforded by operating microscopes. The reason, he said, is that he can make tiny slits in the blood vessels and then sew the arteries and veins to their new location on the surface of the heart with sutures that are finer than those used by surgeons wearing loupes.
All the surgeons on Dr. Akchurin's team use operating microscopes and microsurgical techniques. They said the skills take three to four years to learn but are worthwhile because the thinner needles and sutures help to keep the vessels stay open for many years and improve long-term results. But most heart surgeons elsewhere disagree, saying that they can do as well using the three or so power magnification afforded by loupes.
Dr. Akchurin said his team performed about 650 bypasses a year and had success and complication rates comparable to those in the United States and elsewhere. Such statistics cannot be independently checked.
Dr. Akchurin has performed surgery in other countries. This week he expects to leave to visit Dr. DeBakey's team in Houston to review the latest techniques and equipment. Dr. Akchurin plans to return with members of Dr. DeBakey's team and with newer equipment that he does not have, like a ventricular assist device that can aid patients with failing hearts, in the unlikely event that it is needed.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Settles Mostly Lower On Hint of Japanese Rate Trim

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar finished mostly lower yesterday, dropping sharply against the yen when a top Japanese political aide forecast a rise in domestic interest rates after elections are held in less than two weeks.
The remarks by Shizuka Kamei, chief spokesman for the Liberal Democratic Party, helped touch off a broad rally in the yen. Japan's rates have been at record lows for more than a year, helping depress the yen and causing the dollar's rise to two-and-a-half-year highs against the Japanese currency last week. 
 The dollar's decline in other foreign exchange dealings was softer. The dollar was underpinned by weakness in the mark, which continued to fall against other European currencies because of optimism about European monetary union.
In late trading in New York, the dollar fell to 111.12 yen, from 111.80 on Friday. The dollar also fell to 1.5312 German marks from 1.5321 marks. The British pound slipped to $1.5635 from $1.5640.
Traders said most of the action came in Asian trading after Mr. Kamei told a private conference in Tokyo that a monetary tightening was possible in Japan, including a rise in the Bank of Japan's discount rate, after the general elections on Oct. 20.
Mr. Kamei's remarks were widely quoted and confounded the prevailing view that rates were likely to remain low. Although Mr. Kamei is not a policy maker, his position as the Liberal Democrats' chief spokesman and the likelihood that the party will win the elections in less than two weeks carried some weight.
"The statement on the possibility of a rate rise after the election brought the dollar off its highs against the yen," John McCarthy, foreign exchange manager at ING Capital Markets in New York, said. Japan's low rates have weakened the yen by making yen-denominated holdings less attractive.
The mark's weakness against European currencies came after Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, said the selection of countries for participation in the 1999 currency union would be based on their ability to sustain strict financial criteria required for entry.
Mr. Tietmeyer's remarks were seen as soothing fears that some countries would use fiscal accounting tricks to qualify for participation in the plan and undermine it.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup;
Justices Skeptically Review Law Requiring Cable Systems to Carry Broadcast Stations

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
The Federal Government's defense of a law requiring cable-television systems to carry the signals of most broadcast stations found a skeptical audience at the Supreme Court today as the Justices, formally opening their new term, questioned whether the law violates the free-speech rights of cable systems.
Solicitor General Walter Dellinger, making his first appearance before the Court since President Clinton named him as the Government's top appellate lawyer over the summer, said it was "a matter of critical importance" to the Government to maintain a "robust array of quality programming" on broadcast stations. Mr. Dellinger said that with 60 percent of American households now wired for cable, broadcast stations that are cut off from cable subscribers would wither in the face of lost advertising. 
 "How many and to what extent?" Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist asked. The Chief Justice said the Court needed evidence rather than speculation before it could accept Congress's rationale for what are known as the must-carry rules.
Mr. Dellinger said that before the must-carry rules went into effect in 1992, cable systems were typically dropping as many as one-third of local broadcast stations in favor of other sources of programming.
Justice Antonin Scalia, for one, was not satisfied. It was "no big deal" to lose a broadcast station in a crowded market like New York City, Justice Scalia said. "Most communities have only one newspaper," he said before asking Mr. Dellinger: "Would you require newspapers to carry their competitors for the sake of diversity?"
"What cable operators have is the gate-keeping function" that controls what subscribers may watch, Mr. Dellinger replied, adding: "No newspaper has the authority to exclude others from entering the home."
If the argument at times had the quality of an interrupted conversation, there was a reason: this was the second time in three years that the case, Turner Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission, No. 95-992, was before the Court. In a 5-to-4 decision in 1994, the Court endorsed the general economic theory behind the Cable Television Consumer Protection Act of 1992, that cable's ability to exclude broadcast programming from a subscriber's home gives it the power to inflict economic harm on its broadcast rival.
But the Court, in an opinion by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, said the First Amendment would not permit the Government to turn cable operators into unwilling transmittors of others' speech without strong evidence of the damage that would occur without Government intervention. The Court sent the case back to a special three-judge Federal panel here, which reviewed tens of thousands of pages of evidence and upheld the must-carry rules on a 2-to-1 vote.
Many of the questions from the Justices today concerned how much and what type of harm would suffice to meet the Court's First Amendment standard. Mr. Dellinger said the public, particularly those without access to cable, would suffer if the broadcast stations that were shut out from cable became so weak economically that they could no longer provide high-quality programming.
Justice Stephen G. Breyer expressed doubt about that theory. Programming that is less expensive may nonetheless "be aimed more directly at the minority that doesn't have cable," he said, adding: "I see a theory, but no evidence that the minority has programming they find less desireable."
"Maybe people in the lower economic brackets don't necessarily want the History Channel," Chief Justice Rehnquist observed.
The Justices also had some tough questions for the lawyer representing the cable industry, H. Bartow Farr 3d. After Mr. Farr said that cable systems would voluntarily carry most broadcast signals, Justice Kennedy suggested that the industry was exaggerating the extent of the rules' burden.
"You can't have it both ways," Justice Kennedy said, adding that the cable industry was trying to argue that the requirement was both "terribly burdensome" and at the same time unnecessary, because cable systems would do what the law requires in any event.
Mr. Farr said the must-carry provisions were a burden because most cable systems are already at full capacity. To comply with the rules, he said, those systems have to eliminate programming they would prefer to carry in order to make room for the broadcast signals. He said the case posed the "fundamental question" of whether "Government can use the means of forcing access on private media to serve its goal of promoting broadcasting."
At one point in the argument, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor suggested that if the Government wanted to bolster broadcast television, it should do so with a direct subsidy. "Then you don't have to commandeer all these channels," she said.
Arguing for the broadcast industry, Bruce J. Ennis Jr. said it was "critical to the survival of broadcast television" to have access to cable. Several Justices questioned him about the fact that in the years before the must-carry rules took effect, only 31 broadcast stations failed out of some 8,000 that were denied a spot on their local cable systems.
Congress, in the 1992 law, was making a "predictive judgment" about the downward trend in the health of broadcast television, not simply looking at a "historical snapshot," Mr. Ennis replied.
Chief Justice Rehnquist was not satisfied. "How do you answer the fact that only 31 actually departed this world, so to speak," he asked.
As the Justices took their positions today for the opening of the term, many eyes in the courtroom were on Justice Scalia, who was known to have grown a beard over the summer recess. The question was whether he would keep the beard now that the recess was over. He did. The 60-year-old Justice, whose beard contains more than a hint of gray, became the first bearded member of the Court since Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, who retired in 1941.
Clearing their calendar of the appeals that had piled up since the last term ended on July 1, the Justices denied review in more than 1,500 cases, including these:
 
Abortion Clinics
Without comment, the Court turned down a constitutional challenge to the 1994 Federal law that makes it a crime to use threats or force to block access to an abortion clinic or to harass or intimidate a clinic's patients and staff.
The law has now been upheld by all four Federal appeals courts to have reviewed it.
It was challenged in this case by six men who were arrested outside an abortion clinic in Milwaukee after they welded themselves to two automobiles they had used to block the entrance.
They argued that Congress lacked jurisdiction to pass the law because protests against abortion clinics were "wholly intrastate noncommercial activity" over which Congress had no authority.
The defendants had won an initial ruling from the Federal District Court in Milwaukee in 1995, in a decision that the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, overturned last December.
The appeals court held that Congress had the power to pass the law under its authority to regulate interstate commerce because the clinics "operate within the stream of interstate commerce" and patients travel across state lines for medical services.
The decision in this case, Skott v. U.S., No. 95-1523, was the third time the Court had turned down a challenge to the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, and it is unlikely the Court would take such a case unless a split develops among the lower courts.
 
Judges' Taxes
The Court ordinarily turns down cases because not enough Justices are interested in hearing them. In one unusual case today, too many Justices were interested, in the sense of having a possible financial stake in the outcome. As a result, the Court lacked a quorum. The effect was to uphold a Federal appeals court's decision that a 1983 law subjecting Federal judges to Social Security and Medicare taxes for the first time had the unconstitutional effect of reducing their compensation.
The 1995 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit came in a lawsuit by 16 Federal judges, all of whom were on the bench when the law took effect in 1984. They argued successfully that the new taxes violated the provision of Article III of the Constitution under which Federal judges' compensation "shall not be diminished during their continuance in office."
Steven Rosenthal, a lawyer for the judicial plaintiffs, said the judges who had joined this and other lawsuits -- about 80 judges -- might each receive as much as $75,000. There are several open issues in the case, however, including whether subsequent pay raises that all Federal judges have received could be deemed to have counteracted the effect of the taxes.
The Justices who took no part in the case, Justices O'Connor, Breyer, John Paul Stevens, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, were all Federal judges in 1984, and theoretically could assert a similar claim. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Kennedy were also Federal judges in 1984, but the combination of subsequent promotions -- which entail resigning one judicial commission to accept another -- and the six-year statute of limitations has wiped out any claims they might have. Justices David H. Souter and Clarence Thomas were unaffected because they were not Federal judges in 1984.
Six Justices constituted the quorum necessary for the Court to act. The case was United States v. Hatter, No. 95-1733.
 
Sexual Harassment
Without comment, the Court denied review in a closely watched case on the question of whether Federal law makes a school district liable for failing to protect a student against sexual harassment by another student. In this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, ruled that the law, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which bars sex discrimination in education, did not apply to "peer sexual harassment."
The Clinton Administration joined an appeal by the mother of two teen-aged girls who were repeatedly harassed on the school bus by boys who received only light punishment from the Bryan, Tex., school district.
The Federal appeals court in Atlanta is currently considering the same issue, and the Justices may be awaiting the outcome of that review. This case was Rowinsky v. Bryan School District, No. 96-4.

HEADLINE: Saving New York Harbor

 BODY:
Yesterday's agreement between the Governors of New York and New Jersey to clear the shipping channels in New York Harbor is of great importance to the regional economy. The agreement is only a first step in a huge undertaking. But it starts a process that could preserve the local maritime industry, which provides the area with $20 billion in annual revenue and nearly 170,000 jobs.
Had nothing been done, the harbor could easily have closed down to major shipping within a decade. Three years ago new Federal regulations and an executive order by New Jersey's Governor, Christine Todd Whitman, halted ocean dumping of toxic silt that washes down the Hudson, Passaic and Raritan Rivers each year and settles in the harbor's 430 miles of berths and channels. Since there were few other places to put the silt, dredging stopped, the harbor clogged up and shippers began sending their deep-water container vessels to more accessible ports. 
 In July, the Clinton Administration came forward with a temporary fix. Vice President Gore announced that ocean dumping of lightly contaminated mud could resume off the New Jersey shore, but only for one year. The dump site would then be closed forever. Faced with this deadline, Mrs. Whitman and Gov. George Pataki of New York have now come forward with a plan that offers real hope.
In essence, the plan commits each state to provide $65 million to clear the channels of five million tons of silt over the next year and find new places to put it. Heavily contaminated silt will go into submerged pits in Newark Bay, which would then be capped; to a foundation for a shopping mall parking lot in Elizabeth, and possibly to highway projects. While tainted mud is a threat to marine life, it is not regarded as a hazard to humans if it is properly contained.
That should clear up the backlog. But it leaves untouched the larger problem of what to do with the three million tons of silt that will continue to accumulate each year. Dredged material has been used successfully in other parts of the country to create waterfront parks and artificial islands and to cover garbage in landfills. The plan calls for exploring these and other options, and also sets aside $20 million for research into "decontamination technologies" and ways to prevent pollution from occurring in the first place.
State and local funds will not be enough to keep the harbor open. For that reason the two Governors and local environmentalists are eagerly awaiting a report later this week from the Army Corps of Engineers, which is responsible for keeping many of the most important channels clear. The Corps will present its own menu of dredging and disposal options, perhaps laying the groundwork for increased Federal funding.
By the turn of the century, a new generation of even deeper-draft ships is expected to begin carrying goods directly from Asia to the East Coast. The prospect that the region could lose not only current business but also the hope of future growth lends added urgency to the need for comprehensive strategy. The agreement that both Governors have now signed on to is a solid beginning.

HEADLINE: U.S. Criticizes Turkish Leader For Libya Trip and Trade Deal

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
The United States sharply criticized Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan of Turkey today for visiting Libya and signing a deal to triple trade with the Government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, which Washington accuses of sponsoring terrorism.
"We've got to stand together," the State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, told reporters. 
 The Libyan media quoted Mr. Erbakan during his visit to Tripoli over the weekend as criticizing the United States and Israel and describing Libya itself as a victim of terrorism.
"I hope the Prime Minister didn't say those words," Mr. Burns said. "It would be highly surprising if the Prime Minister of an allied country, a NATO country, were to defend a terrorist like Muammar Qaddafi."
The United States has long led a campaign to isolate Libya politically and economically, and Libya is one of seven countries the State Department accuses of sponsoring international terrorism.
In 1992, the United Nations banned air travel and arms sales to Libya. The sanctions are aimed at pressing Libya to hand over two men suspected in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland.
Mr. Erbakan, Turkey's first Prime Minister from an Islamic party, came to power in June after promising to improve Turkey's relations with other Muslim countries.
In August, he visited Iran, which Washington also lists as a terrorist sponsor, and signed a multibillion-dollar natural gas deal. That visit drew similar criticism from the United States and other NATO allies.
"It's up to allies to be good allies and to understand you can't pick and choose places where you are going to support us or not support us," Mr. Burns said. "The United States remains troubled by any trip that could be seen as benefiting the Qaddafi regime."
The deal with Libya to triple trade was signed after 13 hours of talks between Mr. Erbakan and his Libyan counterpart, Abdel Majid el-Qaud. The agreement could raise trade between the two countries to nearly $2 billion a year.
Mr. Erbakan had threatened earlier to leave Libya without signing the agreement because Colonel Qaddafi had condemned a crackdown on ethnic Kurds in Turkey's southeast. He also previously said one goal of his trip was to get Libya to pay some $300 million owed to Turkish contractors, and reportedly made the deal contingent on payment of the debt.
In Tripoli, local media quoted the Turkish leader as describing Libya as being against terrorism and the victim of terrorism itself. He cited a United States air attack on Colonel Qaddafi's home in 1986.
Mr. Erbakan's visit was condemned by members of his own Cabinet. His coalition partner and Foreign Minister, Tansu Ciller, criticized the visit as ill timed and threatened to resign.

HEADLINE: Threat Seen to Catskills Trout;
Stream Repairs Worsened Flood Damage, Anglers Say

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

DATELINE: ROSCOE, N.Y.

 BODY:
The flood that swamped the western Catskills last January seemed insatiable, plucking trees out by their roots, plunging bridges into streams, wrecking homes and stores and leaving eight people dead.
 No one in this countryside famed for its two-foot wild trout could remember anything like it, and Federal officials declared the flood the state's worst calamity in 24 years. 
 Here and in the other mountain villages in Delaware and Sullivan Counties just beyond the Borscht Belt, people set to work, with the gritty resourcefulness that is a point of native pride and with $8.3 million in Federal and state emergency money. Throughout the winter and into summer, they launched an armada of bulldozers and tractor-driven shovels that reopened clogged roads and culverts under bridges and cleared the muck out of vital streams where brook, brown and rainbow trout spawn.
Now some people are saying that the flood relief was almost as harmful as the flood, that sloppy or excessive work had damaged two dozen glistening brooks and winding rivers, like the Beaverkill, that form the heart of this region's economy as the trout fishing capital of the East Coast.
With the spawning season just beginning, there is no evidence yet of a falloff in trout. But conservation groups like Trout Unlimited, a national organization of 95,000 members that strives to protect fish habitats, say that gravel and silt disturbed by excessive repair work ended up blocking tributaries that trout must enter to spawn. The work, these critics say, has also muddied or warmed cool-water pools in which the trout gather to rest or escape predators.
"The heavy equipment work represents a disaster for trout and the insects they feed on, one that will take years of careful work and lots of taxpayers' money to restore," said Jock Conyngham, a field biologist for Trout Unlimited. "Much of the critical habitat is now compromised."
Mr. Conyngham said much of the repair work was done carelessly and to excess as contractors tried to capitalize on the windfall of Federal aid. Enforcement of environmental regulations, he said, was lax. Though 1,000 permits were issued for stream repairs in Delaware County, the hardest hit of 41 counties affected by flooding, not a single summons for improper work was issued.
Environmental officials and local public works administrators conceded that some work had created as many problems as it cured, but they said those trouble spots were being repaired. Over all, the officials said, government workers and private contractors did the best they could, given the public outcry and pressure to free marooned families who needed to buy food and get to work.
"It was a natural disaster that tested all our resources," said Anthony F. Adamczyk, director of Region 4 of the State Department of Environmental Conservation. "In all honesty, it was not a time to get into a strong enforcement mode given the emotion that was there."
Strict supervision by an understaffed agency, he added, was not possible given the disaster's magnitude. Wayne D. Reynolds, public works commissioner of Delaware County, attributed most of the damage to the flood, which in some cases blanketed streams from bank to bank with rock and sand, leaving them impassable for trout.
Fishing this season has been better than in the drought-ridden previous two years, and state biologists suggested that Trout Unlimited was exaggerating the problem's gravity, since artificially raised fish outnumber wild fish in many local waterways.
But some of the men and women who fly fish the 87-mile-long Beaverkill and the linked east and west branches of the Delaware River say they have noticed more murkiness in the once vodka-clear water and a drop-off in the aquatic insects the trout feed on.
On a recent Monday, Bob LeDonne, a retired television news writer who has been fishing for 50 years, was wading hip-deep in the Beaverkill, flogging the air with his line until his fly landed in a spot he liked. He said he wondered whether the bulldozers working in nearby Horse Brook might have turned the river muddier and made it more difficult for fish to see his flies.
"Before, the river was so clear you were tempted to drink it on a hot day," he said. "It's tough enough fishing, but especially when the odds are against you like that."
Old Route 17 runs alongside Beaver Kill and crosses Horse Brook over a small bridge. Photographs taken for Mr. Reynolds show that debris seemed to fill a sizable stretch of the stream above the bridge, leaving only a small trickle into the Beaver Kill. The debris was cleaned out in the spring.
"The entire upstream channel was level bank to bank," Mr. Reynolds said. "I just put it back to what it was pre-existing."
But Mr. Conyngham said the workers widened the stream far beyond its original channel and churned up bank gravel that will be deposited downstream. He showed a reporter a three-foot rise of gravel that was now blocking much of the stream's mouth as it ran into Beaverkill. The channel, he said, was not deep enough to invite trout to spawn.
"They needed to clear the culvert, but they didn't need to do that," said Mr. Conyngham, a lean, intense man of 39 with a reddish-blond beard.
Mr. Adamczyk countered that much of the turbidity in the area's waterways was a result not of bulldozers but of the flood, which scoured away the banks and exposed underlying clay. One of his fisheries biologists, Kay Sanford, pointed out that gravel deltas were formed naturally whenever sloping brooks joined rivers.
Nevertheless, the state has asked the county's public works department to return to clear the gravel delta. At Read Creek, 10 miles north, it has also asked for work to reslope banks and reinforce them with rock walls, and to lay down boulders in midstream that can serve as fish sanctuaries.
Mr. Conyngham also showed a reporter Mountain Pool, a popular fishing spot in Beaverkill that he said had been muddied by work to shore up the Beaverkill banks. There he joined a landowner, Edward E. Eckel, 60, an expert fisherman and Trout Unlimited member, who said he had been told before the work started that two bulldozers and an excavator would shore up the banks by taking gravel from an island in the river. Less than half of the island should have been disturbed, but workers "scalped" it entirely of vegetation, he said.
Mr. Sanford, the fisheries biologist, said the work had been necessary. Sediment was coming not from the island, he said, but from an eroding bluff on one bank, which had to be resloped with dirt from the island.
The flood was generated by an untimely spell of warm weather. After heavy snows deposited a four-foot white pelt over the mountains, temperatures rose to the mid 50's and, along with a rainstorm, triggered a colossal meltdown. On Jan. 19 people awoke to find their roads and bridges impassable.
Gerald A. Barnhart, chief of fisheries for the environmental conservation department, said he grew up in Roscoe and "looked at streams I had played in all my life and I couldn't recognize them."
The Federal Emergency Management Agency described the disaster as the worst since Hurricane Agnes in 1972 and estimated the damage to 41 counties at $102 million. In the pandemonium, state officials issued permits for repairs on the spot, without demanding and reviewing construction sketches. Almost $50 million has already been spent on repairs.
Since Colonial days, roads have been built alongside the level ribbons of rivers and streams, but the required bridges and culverts -- tubes carrying water under roads -- create opportunities for bottlenecks. In the resulting flooding, streams leap out of their channels into the roads and deposit gravel in their beds or eat away at the manmade structures.
"Rivers and roads were not designed to go together," said Joe Rosa, a supervisor for Delhi Rock Drilling who was busy sloping banks on a recent Monday at a stream known as Fish Creek.
Floyd Franke, a fishing guide in the Roscoe area who has shepherded fishermen from as far away as Australia, saw the issue a little more skeptically, suggesting that highway contractors were not really meant to work in sensitive streams.
"If someone spends his life building roads, he ends up making the river look like a road," he said.

"The heavy equipment work represents a disaster for trout and the insects they feed on," said Jock Conyngham, a field biologist for the conservation organization Trout Unlimited. "Before, the river was so clear you were tempted to drink it on a hot day," said Bob LeDonne, fishing on the Beaverkill. (Photographs by James Estrin/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: High-Flying Quintiles to Buy Innovex in $747.5 Million Deal

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
The Quintiles Transnational Corporation, a rapidly growing drug research company that is a Wall Street favorite, said yesterday that it planned to buy Innovex Ltd. of Britain for $747.5 million in stock.
Quintiles said the deal would make it the world's biggest outside supplier of research and development to pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology companies. 
 Dennis Gillings, chairman and chief executive of Quintiles, said the combined client list included the 20 biggest American and European drug makers. Besides providing research, he said, Innovex rents out to drug makers a specialized sales force that includes people who had a part in the final development stages of new drugs.
Big drug companies are increasingly cutting fixed overhead costs by farming out part of their billion-dollar research pipelines to companies like Quintiles and Corning Pharmacueticals Services, a division that Corning Inc. plans to spin off this winter as a publicly traded company.
Under pressure from cost-conscious customers and profit-hungry investors, the drug makers have eliminated battalions of scientists, many of whom have moved to Quintiles headquarters in Research Triangle Park, N.C.
Quintiles stock jumped $5.031 yesterday, to $78.781 in Nasdaq trading, valuing the 10 million shares in the deal at $788 million. A year go, Quintiles traded at $26.25, adjusted for a stock split.
The current stock price exceeds 100 times 1995 earnings per share, reflecting Wall Street expectations for a continuation of the company's 74 percent surge in sales last year.
James S. Patricelli, a securities analyst with Adams Harkness & Hill in Boston, projects 61 percent growth in Quintiles earnings this year and 50 percent in 1997, which he said would be about 55 times the current stock price. Quintiles said Innovex would add 5 to 7 cents to earnings in 1997. Quintiles had $156.4 million in 1995 revenues. Innovex sales were $129.1 million for the year ended March 31.
"Quintiles is the best company in a tremendously fast-paced field, which is growing 20 to 25 percent a year," Mr. Patricelli said.
By keeping high-salaried scientists going full tilt and using electronic methods to analyze results, the independent research contractors say they can undercut the pharmaceutical giants' own costs. But Mr. Patricelli noted that "nobody can document the savings."
The pharmaceutical companies insist that huge research costs justify high prices for breakthrough drugs but they guard their numbers as trade secrets.
Under the deal, Quintiles will also assume $60 million in Innovex's debt. Mr. Gillings, the chief executive of Quintiles, will be chief of the combined company. A British-born statistician and former professor at the University of North Carolina, Mr. Gillings founded Quintiles in 1982.
In another deal last month, Quintiles agreed to buy BRI International Inc., a closely held research company, for about $134 million in Quintiles's high-flying stock.
"We are primarily an outsourcing and information company," Mr. Gillings said. "We sell a lot of information about pharmaceuticals and medical devices. We are beginning to move strongly into the health economics and outcomes research that determines whether large purchasers -- such as H.M.O.'s, insurance companies, large employers, the states and the World Health Organization -- regard the drugs as cost effective."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE THIRD PARTY;
Perot Demands That Clinton Unequivocally Rule Out Pardons

BYLINE: By ERNEST TOLLERSON 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 7

 BODY:
After a month and half of sounding the alarm about the Federal debt and other issues, Ross Perot today sharply attacked President Clinton, asserting that he should unequivocally rule out Presidential pardons for associates who are in jail for Whitewater-related crimes.
"I guess a lot of you watched the debates last night," Mr. Perot said after pressing his case for high ethical standards during a speech to the American College of Surgeons here. "Can you believe that we have a President who has a number of associates who have gone to jail on financial issues that he was allegedly connected to, and he will not look the American people in the eye and say, 'If you re-elect me as President, I will not use that power to pardon my friends because if I don't, they are going to talk about me and do a plea bargain.' 
 "Now let me ask you, is it asking too much of the President to promise that he won't do that? I hope not."
After a burst of enthusiastic applause at the Moscone Center here, he repeated, "I hope not."
At the debate, held on Sunday night in Hartford, Mr. Clinton said that he had not considered any such pardons, adding, "I will not give anyone special treatment, and I will strictly adhere to the law."
Since he became the Reform Party's Presidential nominee in mid-August, Mr. Perot has criticized the Republican candidate, Bob Dole, especially after Mr. Dole's vigorous opposition to Mr. Perot's participation in the debates between the Presidential candidates. But today's attack on Mr. Clinton was a departure from his usual generic and even-handed appeals for change in a political system he contends is corrupt and dominated by special interests.
The Texas businessman's speech also included two indirect critiques of Mr. Clinton. But both were in keeping with his usual emphasis on issues.
Mr. Perot asserted that America's social programs started with "noble dreams" but have been broken for quite some time. He then criticized the White House study group that produced the Administration's health care bill in 1993, saying it could not solve the problems of the health care system, in particular, Medicare, because it had no doctors on it.
"The Medicare program is more complex than building the space shuttle," Mr. Perot said. "The space shuttle follows the laws of physics. Only in America would you have a task force with no doctors on it."
While the study group itself, headed by Hillary Rodham Clinton, did not have doctors among its members, there were doctors among the hundreds of advisers and consultants who helped the panel do its work.
After telling his audience that he would have been the preferred candidate in 1992 if Americans had voted their conscience, Mr. Perot referred to Mr. Clinton again indirectly and mildly, observing "You got what you voted for -- a winner."
Much of today's speech was full of statistics that Mr. Perot described as illustrating the grave threat that Federal debt posed to the nation's ability to remain an economic superpower. And when he got around to discussing the cause of the fiscal "mess," he distributed blame in equal amounts -- and with a pinch of sarcasm -- to Democrats and Republicans.
"The Democrats say they didn't do it," he said. "And the Republicans say they didn't do it. And each political party blames the other political party for doing it. But neither one says they did it. It's kind of like the O. J. trial. The facts are: there was nobody else around," he said, setting off a round of laughter and applause.
Mr. Perot also delivered mini-reviews of the debate in Hartford.
He said the Commission on Presidential Debates and its recommendation to exclude him favored the major parties, turning the Hartford debate into an entertainment event.
"If you have zip standing in the polls, and you are a Democrat or a Republican, you get to debate -- fascinating," he said. "But five Democrats and five Republicans decided, we don't want this, we want a nice tight, little theatrical event, which you saw last night."
In 1992, Mr. Perot took part in all three Presidential debates.
At another point, Mr. Perot gave Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole bad reviews, asserting that neither had tried to rebut the charges made by the other in a substantive way. "In 1996 we are still being manipulated by propaganda and negative ads that have nothing to do with the facts," he said. "And if you listened last night, it was confusing because they were both playing Ping-Pong in denying what the other said and not getting to the facts."
Several times during his speech, Mr. Perot urged the surgeons to take the lead in drafting a health care policy for the nation. Since neither party is trying to solve the nation's health care problems, he said, he suggested that the doctors raise $60 million for 30-minute infomercials and take their plan to their patients: the American people.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE VOTERS;
In Debate's Aftermath, Coffee and No Surprises

SERIES: AN AMERICAN PLACE: By and Large, Unimpressed

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP 

DATELINE: CANTON, Ohio, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Perhaps the first debate of this Presidential campaign will change the minds of some voters, but if that is the case, it was awfully hard to find any evidence of it here, whether you were looking at the oldest newsstand downtown or the just-opened Borders in The Strip, a suburban shopping complex so new, trucks are still busy spraying the dirt green.
"I'd call it a draw," said Jack Baker, a lawyer who stopped to pick up his daily newspaper at the News Depot downtown near the courthouse and who is undecided about how he will vote this time. "It was what I expected going in." 
 "A wash," said Johnny Miller, a Kent State University professor and Clinton supporter who was at the 30,000-square-foot Borders in suburban Jackson to pick up a copy of "Nordstrom Way: The Inside Story of America's Number One Customer Service Company." "If you need to call it something, call it a wash."
"Neither stuck out," said Pat Hassig, a retired nurse from North Canton shopping at Borders who favors Bob Dole.
On the plus side, people seemed grateful for the civility of the debate. "I was surprised by how polite they were to each other," said Cathy Kelty, who holds two part-time jobs. Several remarked about appreciating Mr. Dole's humor. "It was a side I'd never seen before," said Charles Mailat, a retired teacher. "And I enjoyed the way Clinton accepted the jokes."
On the minus side, people seemed a little shellshocked by all the numbers, the dates, the quotations and counter-quotations that were amassed on each side and then hurtled back and forth. Tom Cwynar, who made his usual Monday morning stop at the News Depot to pick up The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette to get some good Steelers stories, felt like he was being punted back and forth the whole 90-minute debate. "You see a lot of half-truths, half the facts to prove your point and then leave the other half out," he said. "I'll put you down for the N.R.A. and I'll put you down for the drug stuff."
"Everything they said was so ridiculously filled with numbers," said Tia Weber, who was reading at the Borders bistro, which offers 13 coffee selections. "I thought Bob Dole tried to pack so much in when he spoke about economics, he sounded confused. He was so busy punching out numbers I felt sorry for him."
Part of the reason for the muted reaction may be that people tuned in expecting to see some big surprise from Mr. Dole because he is trailing so in the polls. Instead they saw a man who came across simply as intelligent, prepared and funny.
Though Ohio still seems within reach for Mr. Dole -- he is trailing by 8 percentage points in the latest statewide University of Cincinnati poll released just before the debate -- there is a fatalism creeping into the voices of even the Republican faithful here.
"The only way Clinton's going to lose," said Ms. Weber, "is if Chelsea's caught smoking crack. My father's such a Republican, he's going to kill me for saying that."
When asked for her reaction to the debate, Darlene Stermer, a professional astrologer inspecting the selection at Borders, said, "Not much." She will vote for Mr. Dole, because she says, he has the better ideas. "Clinton is two-faced," she said, "but his chart is very good, it's highlighted for the coming election. He's going to win, astrologically speaking."
Despite all the facts and figures, a frustration mentioned by many was the absence of in-depth discussion of most issues and the proliferation of the sound bite. Martha Lottman, who is involved with Head Start and the Jewish community here, was disappointed to hear nothing new on welfare or health care.
William Friedman, a driver for the post office, had to be up at 2 this morning for work, but still wanted to see the debate. He said he was disappointed that there was no talk of the homeless or poor. "When I was driving by the mental health center at 5 this morning," he said, "there were two men waiting to get in who had no place to stay last night. There's homeless in Canton, Ohio."
To a great extent people seemed to take from the debate as confirmation of what they already felt. Allan White, a starter at the Bob-O-Link golf course, voted for George Bush in '92, but this time will be voting for Mr. Clinton, because, he says, the Democrats are more likely to protect people who face downsizing. ("Their constituents will kill them if they don't.")
"Did you see the shots of Clinton and Dole side by side?" he said. "Poor Dole, geriatric people have their rights, but I don't want him running the country." He was voting Clinton anyway, he says, but "I feel a little better about casting my vote now." And Leanne Barton, who watched a replay of the debate at 2 A.M. as she fed her 3-month-old Halie, said, "I've always liked Clinton, I'm for Clinton all the way, I thought he did great."
Sam Sliman, father of six, who owns the News Depot and holds two other jobs, did not see it that way. As he finished stacking the papers this morning for the 8 o'clock opening, Mr. Sliman, a Republican, said, "Bill Clinton's very smooth -- geez, he can deliver a speech on a dime. But you could see Bob Dole's integrity. I thought Bob Dole did better than I thought he would."
And Mr. Baker, the lawyer who is still undecided but usually votes Republican, is pretty sure what will happen over the next two weeks. "Clinton's done a good job moving to the middle," he said. "It makes it a difficult choice for someone with a Republican background like me. I'll keep watching and looking for signs from Mr. Dole and eventually I'll probably find enough things and I'll vote for him."
A few took into account the impossibly high standards voters hold for the Presidential candidates. Mr. Mailat, the teacher said, "They both seemed nervous at the beginning." And Robert Horowitz, the county prosecutor who comes in for his Akron Beacon-Journal every morning at the News Depot, noted, "I've seen both do better."
For years Lydia Goebeler, 85, and Mary Salvador, 83, have been coming into the News Depot, where there are only two kinds of coffee (with or without caffeine), but it is still just 50 cents a cup. Both are quite active (Ms. Salvador recently hurt her back putting in storm windows). They read all about the intense preparation the two candidates made for the Presidential debates, and they were ready to stay up Sunday night and watch.
"At the start I thought Clinton was winning," said Ms. Salvador.
"Oh yes," said Ms. Goebeler. "I did too."
"And then I fell asleep," said Ms. Salvador.
"I fell asleep, too," said Ms. Goebeler. "Right at the start."
"And the next thing I woke up," said Ms. Salvador, "and Bob Dole was saying 'God Bless America,' and it was over."
Both describe themselves as loyal Democrats who will vote for Mr. Clinton. "Dole is too old," said Ms. Salvador.
"He is," said Ms. Goebeler.
Living midway between Democratic Cleveland and Republican Columbus, the citizens of Canton, Ohio, and surrounding Stark County have a history of voting for the winning Presidential candidate. This is the 28th article in a yearlong series that seeks to explore the forces shaping the political debate at the grass roots.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE DEMOCRAT;
Clinton Shows That He, Too, Has Support Of Executives

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Oct. 7

 BODY:
Relaxed and folksy on the day after the first Presidential debate of the campaign, President Clinton today showcased his support from business executives and then barnstormed through New England to lure Northeastern Republican moderates to his side.
Mr. Clinton repeatedly stressed his fiscal policies and the economic growth of the past four years. "People tell me in Washington, 'Now don't go anywhere and talk about balancing the budget because it bores people now and it requires tough decisions,' " he said at a rally here in New Hampshire, which was battered by the recession of the early 1990's. "But it's important. Why? Because these declining deficits have meant as the Government borrows less money, it's easier for you to borrow money." 
 The President's post-debate campaign schedule almost seemed fashioned to taunt Bob Dole, as Mr. Clinton highlighted endorsements from business executives that served to undercut his Republican opponent's contention that the economy is stagnant, and campaigned in three states -- Connecticut, New Hampshire and Maine -- that have been Republican bastions in many previous Presidential races.
"I think part of today's message," said Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, is for Republicans in the more moderate wing of the party to "feel comfortable with Bill Clinton."
Mr. Clinton's first stop was in Stamford, Conn., where about 300 business executives turned out at the Stamford Center for the Arts to support the President. The Clinton campaign released the names of 2,591 business leaders who were endorsing him across the country.
Eli Segal, the head of the campaign's business outreach program, said that on the day after the debate "the President came to Stamford to show again that he is not a liberal, that he is a mainstream American, a mainstream President who has reached out to the business community."
Mr. Dole on Wednesday night had argued that the economy showed "the slowest growth in a century" and said "we've got stagnant wages; in fact, women's wages have dropped 2.2 percent. Men's wages haven't gone up, gone down." But today the chief executives applauded repeatedly as business leaders from their ranks spoke of low inflation, low interest rates and economic growth.
The speakers endorsing Mr. Clinton included George David, who is president and chief executive of United Technologies and who voted for George Bush in 1992; and William T. Esrey, the chairman and chief executive of Sprint, who introduced Mr. Clinton. The President's aides said Mr. Esrey is a Republican and one of the largest employers in Kansas, Mr. Dole's home state.
Mr. Esrey -- who has made contributions in this campaign of $1,000 each to Mr. Clinton, Mr. Dole and to Steve Forbes, who ran against Mr. Dole in the Republican primaries -- said that the Clinton campaign's feelers about an endorsement "produced a dialogue within my company which I'm sure has been echoed in boardrooms across America." He added, "What's driven that dialogue is the growing realization by corporate America that Democrat Bill Clinton has been good for American business."
Mr. Clinton told the business officials how gratified he was that they were willing to look at a Democrat. "This is a country with a strong private economy," Mr. Clinton said. "And if it doesn't work, then our aspirations for all the people we want to help can never, never, never be fulfilled by anything the government does. If there is not an effective partnership that is founded on a successful private economy, the rest of our endeavors are doomed to be thwarted."
In a long and rambling speech calling on business to help provide jobs for welfare recipients, Mr. Clinton did not mention his debate with Mr. Dole and brought it up only in passing in New Hampshire where he said, "I enjoyed that debate and I thank Senator Dole for joining me, and I believe that the American people got a pretty good feel for the differences between us."
But Mr. Clinton's aides asserted that the first of two nationally televised debates had gone their way, with Mr. Dole doing nothing to erode Mr. Clinton's large lead. They pointed both to their own instant poll conducted as the debate was taking place and several public polls.
"The fundamental nature of this race needed to be changed -- that's what we saw as the challenge for the Dole campaign," said Joe Lockhart, Mr. Clinton's campaign spokesman. "We essentially see the race this morning the way we saw it yesterday, a week ago, three months ago."
Mr. Clinton's advisers said that they would make no change in strategy as a result of the first debate, which traditionally is called the most crucial of the campaign season and the one with the most potential to change the dynamics of a race. Mr. McCurry called Mr. Clinton "quite happy with the outcome last night."
As the Presidential race moves into its final weeks, Mr. Clinton planned to campaign not only in traditional battleground states but to put time and money into states considered out of the Democrats' grasp in the past. Douglas Sosnik, the White House political director, cited Florida, Georgia, Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona.
Connecticut, New Hampshire and Maine all voted for Mr. Clinton in 1992, but he won New Hampshire by only one percentage point and his victory in Maine was attributed in large part to the fact that it was Ross Perot's strongest state in 1992, giving him 30 percent of its vote.
Polls in September gave Mr. Clinton double-digit leads in all three states.

HEADLINE: Consumers' Borrowing Slows Sharply

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Consumer borrowing grew at a much slower pace than expected, the Federal Reserve said today.
Americans' consumer credit rose $3.3 billion in August to $1.167 trillion, down from July's revised increase of $7.3 billion. Previously, the Fed said July borrowing rose $7.7 billion. Analysts had expected an August increase of $7 billion. 
 The growth rate in August was 3.5 percent at an annual rate, the slowest pace since May 1993.
After a three-year borrowing binge that nearly doubled the borrowing total, the August slowdown suggests "consumers' debt burden is much too high and people can't keep up that pace of borrowing," said Kevin Flanagan, an economist with Dean Witter Reynolds in New York. He added, "Consumer spending could slow accordingly."
The borrowing slowdown may be linked to a new cautious attitude by lenders in response to an increase in bankruptcy filings by consumers and a surge in credit card delinquencies.
"This number is telling us a lot of the delinquent consumer credit out there is starting to bite," said Anthony Chan, chief economist with the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio. "We're moving to a slightly slower growth patch in the economy."
For retailers, the report may be a warning that consumer demand will prove disappointing for the second consecutive year during the holiday shopping season, analysts said. But other analysts said too much should not be read into one month's report.
"Consumers are still sufficiently confident to continue purchasing on credit," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist with Barnett Banks in Jacksonville, Fla.
Today's Fed report showed that credit card borrowings rose $2.8 billion in August, auto loans increased by $200 million and other types of personal loans rose by $400 billion.
The Fed report showed that auto loans inched up $200 million in August, at an annual rate of five-tenths of 1 percent, sharply below July's $2 billion increase, when auto loans were growing at an annual rate of 6.7 percent.
Revolving, or credit card, debt in August also grew much more slowly, by $2.8 billion, at a 7.5 percent annual rate, only half the $5.6 billion July advance, when it was expanding at a 15.2 percent annual rate.
Other credit grew by $400 million, at a 1.3 percent annual rate, in August. The Fed's report does not track loans secured by real estate.

HEADLINE: Best Products to Shut 81 Stores and Let 4,500 Workers Go

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
The Best Products Company, the struggling Richmond-based catalogue-showroom retailer that sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month, announced yesterday that it would close 81 of its 169 stores and would dismiss 4,500 employees, or 45 percent of its work force.
The majority of the closings are planned in the West and Southwest, including 24 stores in California, 13 stores in Washington, 8 stores in Texas and 7 stores in Colorado. 
 Best sells products as diverse as jewelry, home furnishings, toys and electronics in 23 states. After the closings, to be completed in December, it will have 88 stores in 17 states. In addition, Best plans to close three of its four distribution centers -- in Denver, Seattle and Las Vegas, Nev. -- that employ about 75 people.
Analysts said Best had been unable to compete not only against mass merchants like Wal-Mart and Kmart, but also against high-end department stores.
"They sell low-quality merchandise in so-so retail locations that don't attract traffic," said Peter A. Chapman, president of Bankruptcy Creditors' Service Inc., a research consulting firm in Princeton, N.J.
Best emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the first time in June 1994. It has posted losses for the last six quarters and last year had revenues of $1.49 billion. "Best was too highly leveraged after that, and in an economic setting where retail sales are lackluster, it's hard for Best to make interest payments," Mr. Chapman said.
Daniel H. Levy, Best's chief executive, said in a statement that it was more efficient to close a large number of stores now. "We believe it's in the best interests of the company and its associates to finalize closing plans now and remove questions about which locations will continue to operate," he said.
The plight of Best is familiar in a hypercompetitive environment where other troubled retailers have been squeezed not only by strong price competition but also by impatient creditors and lenders.
"Last year was one of the worst years we've seen since the Depression, as far as the retail environment is concerned," Donald T. Spindel, a retail analyst with A. G. Edwards & Sons, said.
Among last year's filings for bankruptcy protection were those of the Caldor Corporation, the Petrie Stores Corporation and Edison Brothers Stores Inc. The Jamesway Corporation asked for Chapter 11 protection in 1995, emerged and then was liquidated last spring. And Herman's Sporting Goods Inc., the sports retailer, filed for bankruptcy last April and then was liquidated.
"I think that the best Best strategy would be to liquidate all the stores over Christmas," Mr. Chapman said. "A well-run liquidation sale could do a bang-up job in recovering a lot of their inventory."
But Ross O. Richardson, a company spokesman, said that "in our opinion, the best way to improve the value of the company is to continue to reorganize it," adding that the company is trying to make the transition to specialty retailer.
The company said that each store had an average of about 25 full-time employees and 30 part-time workers, and that a total of 2,000 full-time and 2,500 part-time workers would be let go. The company employs about 5,500 people in operations not involving the stores to be closed.
On Sept. 3, Best received a bid of $68.7 million, or $2 a share, from Ocean Reef Management Inc., a Miami investment firm. But two weeks later, Ocean Reef withdrew its offer, saying Best needed more financial support than it had expected.
In late September, Best said it was delaying some vendor payments and filed for bankruptcy protection.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Loss at Advanced Micro Smaller Than Expected

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif., Oct. 7

 BODY:
Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which has been trying to revamp its Pentium-class processor unit and return to profitability, today reported a third-quarter loss that was narrower than expected.
The company reported a loss of $38.4 million, or 28 cents a share, compared with earnings of $42 million, or 30 cents, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue fell 25 percent, to $456.9 million from $607 million. Wall Street had expected a loss of 37 cents, based on the average estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by IBES International Inc. 
 The results were reported after the stock market closed. But in after-hours trading, shares of Advanced Micro surged 87.5 cents to $15.75.
The third-quarter results reflected a restructuring charge of about $6 million after the company, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., dismissed 200 of its 15,200 employees because of weak demand.
Earnings for 1995 were restated to reflect the company's $623.2 million acquisition of Nexgen Inc., which it completed in January.
In the second quarter, Advanced Micro Devices had a loss of $34.7 million, or 26 cents a share, its first loss in more than five years, as the company struggled to introduce a chip that could compete with the Intel Corporation's industry-standard Pentium.
Advanced Micro said sales were improving in the unit that makes its Pentium-class chips, but not enough to make the business profitable yet.
"Over all, bookings improved significantly from the levels of the second quarter," but shipments are still outpacing new orders, W. J. Sanders 3d, the company's chairman, said in a statement.
Sales of telecommunications products and other businesses are also growing, Mr. Sanders said. Sales of the company's flash memory chips, which retain data when power is turned off, have also rebounded.

Intel Cancels Meeting
By Bloomberg Business News
The Intel Corporation yesterday canceled its semiannual analyst meeting, citing a California ballot initiative that it said would make it easier for shareholders to sue companies.
Intel said it would not give any more forecasts because it was concerned that the initiative, Proposition 211, would increase "frivolous" shareholder lawsuits.
"We are trying to be pro-active and have ourselves protected if it does pass," the company's chief financial officer, Andy Bryant, said. The meeting with analysts had been scheduled for Nov. 1.
Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, said it would not include such statements at any meetings or in quarterly earnings announcements except as required by law.
The company usually gives some indication of orders being booked or the outlook for the following quarter. That information is used by analysts and investors as an indication of future demand and earnings for personal computers and chipmakers as well as software companies.
Intel is one of many Silicon Valley companies that have come out against the initiative. The American Electronics Association said last week that 47 percent of its public member companies would consider leaving California if the initiative passed on Nov. 5.

HEADLINE: Federal Government Uses North's and Midwest's Dollars to Aid the South, Study Says

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Many states in the Northeast and the Middle West pay more in Federal taxes than they receive in Federal spending, while many Southern states are subsidized by the Federal Government, a new study shows.
Connecticut and New Jersey were the biggest "donor states" last year, and New York has consistently been among the large donors. 
 New Mexico, Virginia and Mississippi had the biggest surpluses, receiving far more in Federal outlays than they paid in Federal taxes.
The study, by researchers at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, said that Connecticut's tax payments to the Federal Government exceeded Federal spending in the state by an average of $2,099 for each resident last year. New Jersey had a deficit averaging $1,883 for each of its residents, while New York had an average deficit of $978 for each resident.
The report, issued by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, concludes that "the Federal Government is a major force in the geographic distribution of economic activity," though sometimes in ways that were not foreseen or intended.
The study measures the "balance of payments" for each state, defined as the difference between the Federal spending it receives and the taxes it pays.
Mr. Moynihan did the first such study 20 years ago to support his contention that New York had, in some ways, been treated unfairly. Since 1992, the body of the report has been prepared by Harvard researchers. The authors this year were Monica E. Friar, Herman B. Leonard and Jay H. Walder.
The latest study examines the flow of Federal money to and from all states and disavows any premise that states should get back precisely as much as they pay to the Federal Government. Indeed, the authors said, some redistribution of resources is inherent in the concept of America as a union of states in which people and commerce move freely across state borders.
The report made these points:
*"New Jersey, with high per capita incomes and Federal tax payments, receives relatively little in the way of Federal expenditures." The state is not a major center of military spending and, with a comparatively low poverty rate, gets a small share of Federal welfare spending.
*With income levels far exceeding the national average, "Connecticut residents consistently lead the nation in Federal taxes paid" per capita. "As a result, Connecticut contributes far more in taxes than it receives back in Federal spending."
*In the last decade, four New England states (Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont) and three Western states (California, Hawaii and Washington) experienced significant changes for the worse in their balance of payments with the Federal Government.
*New York regularly ranks among the top states in Federal tax payments, "a direct result of high per capita income." But it is consistently below the national average in the amount of Federal spending it receives for each resident.
Speaker Newt Gingrich said last year that New York could not expect the Federal Government to subsidize its "culture of waste." But Mr. Moynihan said the new data showed that things were really the other way around: New York has been subsidizing Georgia and other Southern states for years.
Southern and Sunbelt states have a different perspective. Elizabeth G. Schneider, executive director of the Southern Governors' Association, said it was natural that the South should get a large portion of Federal spending because many Americans were choosing to retire there. In addition, she said, the region has a higher poverty rate than the rest of the country and has many military bases.
Debby K. Kilmer, director of the Washington office for the State of Florida, said that Southern states generally paid more in gasoline taxes than they received in Federal money for construction of highways. With the South and the West growing faster than Northeastern states, she said, it is proper that "dollars should follow the people."
The study finds that military spending, though cut in recent years, remains an important factor in determining the balance of payments for many states. Federal benefit programs have become more important, but payments to the elderly, not the poor, account for the bulk of this spending.
The net influx of Federal money accounted for more than 10 percent of per capita income in New Mexico, Mississippi and Virginia, the study said. Virginia, home to the Pentagon and many naval installations, attracted large amounts of military spending. New Mexico's nuclear weapons industries also attracted large sums of Federal money. Mississippi had a large surplus because, with low incomes and a high poverty rate, it generates a relatively small amount of taxes and receives large amounts of Federal aid.
Mr. Moynihan said, "New York does very well in a category of Federal spending that might best be described as disaster relief," which includes Medicaid and welfare payments for the poor. But he said the state had made "the worst possible use" of the money it has received for job programs, sending welfare recipients to school rather than to work.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Profit Taking Pushes Bond Prices Down

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices retreated yesterday as investors moved to consolidate recent gains, particularly those made on Friday following an employment report that showed unexpected weakness.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 16/32, to 99 18/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.78 percent, from 6.74 percent on Friday. 
 "Concerns that the market may have gotten a bit ahead of itself in recent weeks found expression in Monday's pullback," said Joel Marver, chief technical analyst at Technical Data in Boston.
Dealers and traders were also busy setting up yesterday in preparation for today's $10 billion Treasury auction of new 10-year notes, another factor that weighed on prices yesterday.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the new 10-year was being offered at a price to yield 6.50 percent, down 3 basis points from Friday, to see if that yield would generate enough investor interest. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Bond prices received a slight lift late in the afternoon from a Federal Reserve report that showed consumer credit grew $3.3 billion in August, a much slower pace of growth than had been expected. Economists were looking for an increase of $7 billion in August.
The report was the latest bit of evidence to suggest that economic growth was slowing, which should cause interest rates to remain stable.
Such a view of the economy appeared to be confirmed on Friday, when the September employment report showed an unexpected drop. Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, noted that the market understandably celebrated the weak September payroll report, but he worried whether the October data would be a repeat or reversal.
Still, he said, third-quarter growth has slowed from the too-hot pace of the second quarter and for the moment has taken the pressure off the Fed to raise short-term interest rates.
In bond futures trading, which affects the cash market for current issues, support for the December bond contract was seen at Friday's post-employment low price of around 111 4/32. Anything below that, traders said, was seen as spurring sales.
"Unless the market decays below a price of 109 29/32, we need to continue a buy strategy for a move to 116 to 122," Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst at Thomson Research of Boston, said.
She added that the market could well be in a precarious pricing range, since it was from these levels that the market broke down in August to 105 7/32. "We are alert to what type of price action would herald that type of decline again," she said.
"A price of 109 28/32 is really like the point of no return," Ms. Mesch said. "But until then, we'll be looking to buy right to 110 20/32 this week." She agreed that the market was somewhat overbought, "but many a major upward move in the market has started from overbought levels."
The December contract closed at 111 6/32, down 17/32 from Friday.
The results of yesterday's $26 billion Treasury bill auction of three- and six-month bills were in line with market expectations. The average discount rate for a three-month bill was at 4.96 percent and the six- month, 5.07 percent, both down from the auction a week ago.
Dealers, who had been expecting decent demand, were a bit disappointed. But then, few expected the bills to be bid aggressively since market participants seem to be waiting for more economic data before making their next investment moves.
Following are the result of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.746	97.437	Discounted Rate	4.96%	5.07%	Coupon Yield	5.09%	5.28%	High Price	98.756	97.447	Discounted Rate	4.92%	5.05%	Coupon Yield	5.05%	5.25%	Low Price	98.746	97.432	Discounted Rate	4.96%	5.08%	Coupon Yield	5.09%	5.29%	Accepted at low price	63%	18%	Total applied for	$43,305,542	$46,519,388	Accepted	$13,091,982	$13,145,648	Noncompetitive	$1,481,984	$1,228,858	

Both issues are dated Oct. 10, 1996. The three-month bills mature on Jan. 9, 1997, and the six-month bills mature on April 10, 1997.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Where Was Character?

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Bob Dole entered Sunday's Presidential debate with two political handicaps. He emerged with three.
The first handicap was President Clinton. He achieved so large an October lead in the polls the way his critics thought he never could: by convincing enough Americans that he had looked after their economic and social interests and would continue to do exactly that in a second term. 
 Mr. Dole's second handicap is his own campaign. It was successful in only one goal: Say Dole and you think tax cuts.
The problem is that American voters believe that Mr. Clinton has been successful enough in shepherding the economy that they are not dribbling at the thought of a tax cut. Without how-to details from Mr. Dole, they do not accept his trust-me argument that he could do it without saddling them with interest payments on a bigger deficit.
The third handicap is a brand new one created by Mr. Dole and the geniuses who prepped him for the debate. Mr. Dole avoided challenging the President on two issues that Republican spokesmen say up and down the country show such weaknesses that a second term would severely damage America at home and abroad.
They are Whitewater and character. Mr. Dole failed to bring them up, except glancingly, and marginally.
All he said about Whitewater was that the President should announce that he would not grant a pardon to anybody convicted in the affair. That would be wrong for any President to say about any people still to face trial.
But pardon has not been the heart of Republican Whitewater charges, barely a toe. The allegations are that Mr. Clinton and his wife are guilty of something, that cover-up was going on in the White House, and even that the death of Vincent Foster, the Clintons' aide, was connected.
Those are charges of utmost seriousness. Any one of them could bring down a Presidency if true, and is villainous mischief if not. If Mr. Dole is too delicate or too uncertain to bring them up directly in nationally seen debate, continued Republican attacks about Whitewater will smell fraudulent.
Character: Mr. Dole brought it up obliquely by referring to drugs as something in the President's past, presumably using marijuana as a young man. But it is demeaning the issue to hang it on that.
At home character includes hiding files, misusing the White House against opponents and allowing Presidential aides to keep security clearances after they contemptuously evaded F.B.I. background checks.
In foreign policy the issue cuts even deeper.
Republican foreign policy experts accuse Mr. Clinton of squandering American prestige by refusing effective action to stall or punish Saddam Hussein for moving armed forces into Kurdish territory supposed to be within U.N. shelter. Mr. Dole said correctly that Saddam was stronger now than before his latest military adventure.
But there is a character issue involved in Mr. Clinton's conduct of foreign policy that Mr. Dole skipped over. That is the price of Mr. Clinton's inconstancy toward nations and movements he had promised to befriend, and its risks to the U.S.
The first to suffer from this unbecoming Presidential habit were Chinese Communist dissidents and Tibet, the victim of almost a half-century of Chinese occupation and oppression. Mr. Clinton hailed them one year and walked away from his official promises the next in submission to pressures from the Chinese Communist Government and the American lobby of businesses in the China trade. The failure of Mr. Clinton about Iraq, and the decision to walk away from the Kurds, was the latest inconstancy.
The debate was Mr. Dole's chance to point out that Mr. Clinton's character trait of inconstancy is a warning sign to all nations and peoples, that the word of American Presidents may amount to no more than a helicopter helping America's friends flee their own country. Mr. Dole missed it.
The debate will not decide the election, or many votes. For him or against him, Americans understand that if Mr. Clinton wins it will be because the country prefers his achievements, whatever his faults, to Mr. Dole's promises, whatever his virtues. Mr. Clinton has fought hard twice for the Presidency. He never got a free ride, not before Mr. Dole's generosity Sunday night.

HEADLINE: Dow Breaches 6,000 Before Falling 13.05

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average topped the 6,000-point level for the first time yesterday before ending lower on profit taking, but the Nasdaq index attained its first closing high in four months as technology stocks rallied.
The Dow index of 30 blue-chip stocks closed down 13.05 points at 5,979.81 following a brief run-up to 6,002.17. The broader-based Nasdaq composite index rose 3.31 points, to 1,250.87, eclipsing its June 5 high close of 1,249.15. That record was set before the summer's market swoon that hit technology stocks particularly hard. 
 Also in the broader market, declining issues barely led advancing ones, 1,230 to 1,145, on moderate volume of 381.9 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts said the Dow was due for a pause. It had set its 27th high close for the year on Friday at 5,992.86, as a weaker-than-expected report on September jobs lessened Wall Street's fears that the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates to slow the economy's growth.
"We're recovering from a little nosebleed after Friday's highs and some people are taking profits off the table," said Ken Ducey, head of trading at BT Brokerage. "People seem fairly convinced sometime this week we'll close above 6,000."
Other stock market gauges also set new milestones, with the Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks gaining 1.88 points, to 703.34, its fifth closing high in the last six trading sessions. The New York Stock Exchange composite index was at a new high, up 0.58 point, to 374.74.
William LeFevre, senior analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum, was unfazed by the 6,000-point milestone.
"It's a bull market," he said. "Relax and enjoy it."
As for yesterday's trading, Peter Canelo, chief investment strategist at Dean Witter, said: "A couple of the Dow stocks got hurt, but oils are very strong and some tech stocks are doing well. The market is consolidating after a big move Friday."
The bulk of the Dow's losses came from Eastman Kodak, which fell 3 1/4, to 75 3/8. The company's chairman, George Fisher, said that it might be embroiled in a dispute over opening the Japanese film market for 18 more months.
Oil stocks were bolstered by news of a planned merger of the United States refining and marketing operations of three of the world's largest oil companies -- Texaco, Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Star Enterprise, a joint venture between Texaco and the state oil company of Saudi Arabia, Saudi Aramco.
Texaco rose7/8 a share, to 96 1/2, and Chevron rose 7/8, to 65 3/8, 52-week highs for both.
Technology stocks were buoyed by speculation that the group would report upbeat earnings for the latest quarter. On Nasdaq, the technology stocks that led the rally that finally reached a new record yesterday were mainly blue chips such as the Microsoft Corporation. Investors have bought these less volatile stocks since the market fall during the summer.
Among the winners yesterday: Intel rose 2 15/16 to 104 5/8; Microsoft was up 1 1/8 to 137 1/2; I.B.M. added 1 1/4, to 127 7/8; Hewlett-Packard was up 2 1/4, to 45 7/8, and Motorola was up 1 1/2, to 49 3/4.
Cheyenne Software climbed 7 45/64, to 30 5/64 after Computer Associates International, which gained 1 3/4, to 64 1/2, agreed to buy Cheyenne for $1.2 billion in cash.
Thomas & Betts, a maker of electrical equipment, agreed to buy Augat, a manufacturer of circuit connection products, in a stock deal valued at $550 million; Thomas & Betts lost 1 7/8, to 37 7/8, and Augat climbed 4 3/8, to 25 1/4.
Westell Technologies tumbled 12 3/8, to 34. Alcatel of France won a contract to supply modem technology to four regional Bell companies, a contract some had expected Westell to win.
Earthgrains surged 6, to 45, on unexpectedly strong earnings.

HEADLINE: Behind a Suburban Facade in Queens, A Teeming, Angry Urban Arithmetic

SERIES: BARELY FOUR WALLS: Housing's Hidden Crisis -- Third of Six Articles

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI with DEBORAH SONTAG 

 BODY:
By day, the neighborhood holds its secret close, presenting the same front it has for decades: tidy parallel lines of two- and three-story houses with tiny but verdant front lawns and a sliver of driveway space between them.
But come nightfall, when residents trickle home from work, the blocks around 90th Avenue and 102d Street in Richmond Hill, Queens, reveal the telltale cracks in their semisuburban facade. 
 Cars that do not fit in the driveways line the curbs, cluttering and narrowing the roads. People huddle on stoops, in numbers greater than one would expect from the size of the brick and wood-frame houses. Windows glow brightly in attics and even basements; the silhouettes of parents and children scuttle constantly through them.
All are clues to the existence of three or four apartments, and from a dozen to two dozen occupants, in houses legally designed for just one or two families.
"These look like nice private homes," said Simcha Waisman, president of the Richmond Hill Block Association. "But many of them aren't. You have to look closely. You have to look for the extra utility meters and the amount of garbage being put out. You wouldn't believe the number of people living in some of these places."
Throughout the city, the combination of stubborn poverty and a dwindling supply of affordable housing has led to a surge in illegal apartments, wedged into virtually any available nook or cranny. The problem is not confined to the most blighted neighborhoods, where it would barely be noticed.
But in Queens, an explosion of illegal conversions over the last decade has utterly transformed even the leafier reaches of a borough that once fancied itself the tranquil gateway to Long Island, but is increasingly becoming the chaotic terminus of New York City.
In the more urban parts of the borough, this phenomenon of illegal residences has produced squalid scenes to rival the most disturbing tableaux in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx: recent immigrants spread out on bare mattresses in the basements of large apartment buildings or crowded into jerry-rigged structures little better than shanties.
But the problem more often manifests itself in a different, subtler and ultimately more disruptive manner, creating thousands of illegal apartments and pockets of mild poverty on otherwise middle-class streets.
From Richmond Hill to the Rockaways, Jackson Heights to Jamaica, even in posher enclaves like Bayside and Forest Hills, desperate tenants and enterprising landlords have sliced one- or two-family houses into multiple apartments, most often converting attics and basements into makeshift flats. While the units are usually newer and more spacious than the subterranean cubicles that characterize illegal housing in the slums of other boroughs, they can present severe hazards for tenants and serious problems for the surrounding neighborhoods.
Because these apartments are not registered with the city, they are essentially unregulated. Landlords can violate basic city rules for safety and livability with impunity; illegal tenants rarely complain to the authorities because they do not want to be discovered. Many apartments do not have fire exits or adequate electrical wiring, a deadly combination.
Moreover, illegal conversions have whipped up a special degree of turmoil in Queens, straining city resources such as schools and hospitals and pitting newcomers against old-timers who are upset not only about more neighbors but also a changed complexion in the neighborhood, not only about double-parked cars on streets but also the smell of curry or the sound of merengue music wafting from kitchens.
"The mindset of hundreds of thousands of people is that they bought into the suburbs, and now it's becoming the city," said City Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler, who represents parts of Fresh Meadows, Bayside, Queens Village and Hollis.
What has happened in Queens represents an extraordinary collusion of landlords, tenants, real estate brokers and contractors, tacitly abetted by judges and city bureaucrats who are partly unwilling and partly unable to stop it. The surrender of city officials exemplifies the calculation they have made throughout all five boroughs: it is better to let tenants remain in illegal apartments than to evict them, because the city has no place else for them to go.
"We're betwixt and between," said Borough President Claire Shulman of Queens. Ms. Shulman said that if officials invoked enough laws, hired enough inspectors and mounted enough court battles, they might be able to make a dent in the problem. But, she added, "It would probably only increase the homeless population."
Ms. Shulman and other borough and city officials say it is impossible to quantify such a hidden phenomenon, and census numbers provide little or no help, because they overlook many of the recent immigrants who occupy the basements, attics and even garages of houses throughout the borough.
But the district managers of virtually every community board in Queens cite the illegal conversion of private homes as their primary problem, causing fire and health hazards, overcrowding schools and cluttering neighborhoods that were not supposed to be overrun with garbage pails and double-parked cars.
School officials notice more children listing the same address on enrollment forms. Postal workers notice more names on the different pieces of mail being delivered to each house. And residents notice contractors trudging in and out of their neighbors' yards as more and more homeowners cash in on the trend.
"The bottom line is that there is profit in it for the landlords, needs met for the tenants and there's no one to stop it, so the economics play out on their own," said John Brannen, a firefighter in South Jamaica, where illegal conversions are especially rampant. Firefighters there estimate that as many as 80 percent of the homes there have been unlawfully subdivided.
In Astoria, most home buyers want to look only at houses with finished basements that could be rented out immediately as separate apartments, according to Angelo Langdakis, a real estate agent there.
Asked if these apartments were illegal, Mr. Langdakis grew philosophical. "It's a very fine word -- illegal," he said. "It's like crossing the street in the middle of the street. That's illegal, because you're supposed to do it at the corner. But everybody does it anyway, so it almost becomes legal."
 
The Tenants
For the Desperate, Life Could Be Worse
Some of the tenants of these apartments are struggling, often jobless immigrants who, more than ever before, are bypassing Manhattan and Brooklyn to make Queens their first stop in America, and are creating a demand for cheap housing that far outpaces new construction in the borough.
Others are working-class New Yorkers who are earning anywhere from $15,000 to $30,000 a year but, because of the high price of living in New York City, cannot afford the security deposit or extra $150 a month it might cost to rent someplace safer and better. They remain in Queens, or are drawn there, because they deem it a better world than Manhattan, Brooklyn or the Bronx, where trees are scarcer, yards nonexistent and drugs and crime more prevalent.
At the most desperate end of the spectrum are those like the Polish men with bad teeth and no English who inhabit the garage behind a three-story apartment building on a dingy street in Maspeth.
The garage has been carved into a warren of a half-dozen cramped rooms with a shared kitchen. Up a narrow, twisting staircase lies a tiny, oddly shaped maze with uncovered openings leading to the outside. Its resident, a stooped and emaciated man who looks to be about 80, does his cooking on a hot plate and his sleeping on a rickety bed under a clothesline strung with underwear.
The men generally stay in the garage for six months to a year, paying about $250 a month in rent, until they can save up enough money from hourly, seasonal construction work to get a better place.
"You see them mostly at night," said Bonnie Rae, who lives in a house near the garage. "We call it the roach motel."
Gary Bryan Frasieur, by contrast, lives not in a glorified shed but in a charming two-story house in Flushing on a quiet street of robust shrubbery and brightly painted shingles. Hanging plants flank the front door.
But Mr. Frasieur uses an inconspicuous doorway off the driveway to get to his illegal cellar apartment. A cellar is distinct from a basement, because at least half of it lies below curb level, and for fire safety and health reasons, the city forbids cellar apartments under any circumstances.
In this one, the ceiling is only a couple of inches higher than six feet; some walls are nothing more than thin sheets of cheap paneling. There is no stove; Mr. Frasieur uses a hot plate to make most of his meals.
"If I save up some money, I can get a toaster oven," said Mr. Frasieur, 48, who has a history of mental illness and receives $554 a month from Supplemental Security Income. He said that this apartment, for $415 a month, was about as cheap as any place, and that despite its unreliable heating and history of flooding in heavy rains, losing it would devastate him.
"I'd be in the streets, down and simple," said Mr. Frasieur, a nervous man with pleading eyes. "So, if that were your situation, what would it matter if you had stains on the carpet? If you didn't have heat for most of the winter? You hear the steam rushing up the pipes to the first floor, but you get used to it. And, you know, the block is very nice."
The block where Gonzalo Campos lives in Jackson Heights is not as nice, and the evidence of illegal conversions is ludicrously obvious.
The two-family house across the street, for example, had a sign hanging in the window last summer that read "Rooms for Rent," and its owner, Gilberto Medina, freely admitted that he was renting out three cubicles in the basement for $70 a week apiece.
The house in which Mr. Campos lives, which the city considers a three-family home, has no fewer than five different bells beside its front door, including the one for Mr. Campos's cellar apartment, where he lives with his wife and two children.
Still, it is a clean, well-lighted place, with pristine wall-to-wall carpeting throughout its four rooms and a full-size kitchen with a stove and large refrigerator. Mr. Campos, 44, who immigrated from Mexico seven years ago and makes about $25,000 a year as a construction worker, said that this apartment, for $700 a month, was an improvement on the first-floor unit a few blocks away that he previously occupied for $750 a month.
"This is bigger," he said, with what sounded like genuine pride. "It's more private. I like it here. You try to do better for under $1,000 a month. This is the best you can do."
 
The Dangers
In Case of Fire, No Escape Route
But even the best such apartments are beset by a host of grave problems. The most urgent is the danger of fire.
The fact that many illegal apartments are in houses with outmoded wiring intended to meet perhaps a quarter of the demand being placed on it increases the chance of an electrical short sparking a blaze. And because apartments in basements and attics seldom have more than one exit, the risk of residents being unable to escape a fire rises.
"They're living within firetraps," said Lieutenant Brian Hickey, a firefighter who works with Mr. Brannen in South Jamaica. "And they're dying because of it."
Tenants of illegal homes often find themselves powerless to make demands of landlords, even for repairs to hazardous conditions. Unlike other tenants, they risk losing their apartments by calling attention to problems in them; if they end up in Housing Court, the illegality of their homes is exposed, and many judges feel duty-bound to evict them.
This gives their landlords enormous power over them. If the tenants withhold rent to try to force repairs, landlords can seek evictions without great fear of punishment for the illegal rental.
"Landlords are using judges to evict tenants they don't have a right to be renting to in the first place," said Jill Zuccardy, a lawyer with Queens Legal Services. "The judges never even consider reporting the landlords to the Buildings Department, and as far as I can tell they suffer no consequences. They just re-rent the illegal places within a matter of weeks."
A Housing Court judge, James R. Grayshaw, said he evicted tenants from basements and cellars because he was concerned about there being no way out in case of fire.
"There's a reason that the building codes were written as they were," he said in an interview. "To turn a blind eye to this kind of widespread fire hazard, to wink it off, is to ignore the lessons of history, starting long before the Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire." That 1911 fire, in a Manhattan garment factory where the exits had been locked, killed 146 people.
Judge Grayshaw said he told landlords that they would be in contempt of court if they re-rented the apartments and warned them that he might order housing inspectors to check on the properties. But when asked how many times he had actually dispatched these inspectors, he said, "Two to three."
 
The Economics
For Landlords, Essential Income
Many of the landlords in question are hardly callous slumlords trying to wring every dollar they can out of decrepit properties they rarely visit or barely maintain. They are often middle-class families renting out whole floors or single rooms in their own houses as a way of realizing their dream of homeownership.
In that sense, they are little different from the generations who preceded them in Queens, buying two-family homes because they needed the rental income from the apartment on the second floor to own the one on the first. But with the rise in home prices in the last few decades, today's buyers find they need rental income not just from one additional apartment, but from two or three.
That strategy is abetted by real estate agents who increasingly encourage buyers to consider the possibility of renting out basements when evaluating their financial fitness to buy a home. These same agents coach absentee landlords to maximize their profit from houses by subdividing them.
Random calls to 10 different real estate agents in Woodhaven, Ridgewood, Richmond Hill and Jamaica found that half of them quickly detailed and recommended subdivisions when asked if homes in the area made good investments. "Let's say you have a house that has three bedrooms upstairs," said an agent at a Century 21 office in Woodhaven. "You can get $300 a room. I saw one place where they had made five rooms. You should talk to a contractor."
The incentives for landlords not to register these conversions with the city are powerful. If they went through legal channels to create the third and fourth apartments in their one- and two-family homes, they might have to apply for zoning variances, a process with a highly dubious outcome and a price tag of several thousand dollars. Their renovations would be subject to the approval of the city, meaning that they would have to incur the additional expenses of doing electrical work and taking fire safety precautions that met city codes.
Moreover, they would subject themselves to significantly higher property taxes. The tax rates for residences of four units or more are between three and five times greater than those for dwellings with up to three units.
Indeed, by not identifying illegal apartments and adjusting landlords' tax rates accordingly, the city loses revenue that could be used, for example, to plump up the budgets of public schools that are overcrowded in part because of the occupants of those illegal apartments.
Corey Bearak, chief of staff for Councilman Leffler, said that citywide, "We're estimating it could be $1 billion of missed revenue on an annual basis." Approximately 40 percent of that uncollected revenue, he said, can be attributed to illegal conversions in Queens.
 
The Communities
Neighbors Sense A Sort of Anarchy
Scrunched down low in the driver's seat of his red truck, a baseball cap casting a shadow over his face, Mr. Waisman, the president of the Richmond Hill Block Association, cruised quietly down a shady corridor of regal houses. He pointed surreptitiously to one of them, a rambling white Victorian, then swerved quickly around the corner lest he be spotted.
"That's one, right there," he said of the structure, which was once a private home but was now an illegal boardinghouse for a dozen different families. "That's what I'm talking about."
Minutes later, Mr. Waisman cased a brick-faced, overgrown Cape Cod with a front yard paved for extra parking space and four visible utility meters. He said three or four families were living in this house, which was legally designed for two. One of his informers on the block had told him so.
Mr. Waisman belongs to a growing brigade of residents in Queens who have assumed responsibility themselves for sniffing out the illegal conversions in their midst.
Some, like him, patrol the streets, homing in on such giveaways as extra meters, asphalt yards and overstuffed garbage cans. Others peek out their windows or peer over their hedges and anonymously report their suspicions to neighborhood groups and city agencies with the hope that something -- anything -- will be done.
Their behavior, while almost comical at times, provides a measure of their despair over what they see as the deterioration of their cherished neighborhoods. Nowhere else in the city have illegal conversions provoked as desperate an outcry as in Queens, where urban tensions encroach on a quasi-suburban refuge.
"At one time, if you moved to Queens, you were moving to a better neighborhood," said Ezio Benini, 66, a retired Transit Authority superintendent who has lived in Elmhurst since 1970. "Now, it's the same as all the neighborhoods."
Longtime residents like Mr. Benini say they are seeing the first jagged lines of graffiti on street corners where it was previously unthinkable, hearing the crescendo of car radios and boom boxes at hours of the night when quiet was once a given, and feeling a sense of anarchy invade their world.
"The house that used to put out one can of garbage puts out four," said Maria Thomson, an officer with the Woodhaven Resident's Block Association. "The house that used to send two kids to school sends eight. A lot of times the illegal renters are undesirable people. This has created havoc with the quality of life in our community."
Some residents express their complaints in racial terms. "Most of these real estate brokers are Indian or Hispanic, and they don't care who they sell the house to, or under what conditions," said Benjamin Bohland, a retired police detective who has been living in Richmond Hill for four decades.
Of his new neighbors, Mr. Bohland added, "I've heard them say, 'We're here now. You don't like it -- move!' But why should we have to listen to what I call that mau-mau music during these 72-hour weddings?"
Regardless of its origin, residents' frustration is sharpened by their knowledge that there is little chance that the landlords who profit from illegal conversions will be caught, let alone be punished in a manner that might deter them from renting out illegal apartments again.
While both the Buildings Department and the Fire Department can inspect so-called multiple dwellings of three apartments or more at will, courts have held that one- and two-family homes are a "man's castle," so inspectors cannot enter properties listed that way as freely, even if they suspect that the residences have become de facto multiple dwellings.
Firefighters need someone to allow them in or a record of a specific complaint that the property is a fire hazard. The Buildings Department also must get someone to grant inspectors access -- which residents sometimes do, either because they do not understand the implications of the visit or are cowed by the credentials of the visitor -- or go through the laborious task of obtaining a court order, a process rarely undertaken.
And the odds of Buildings Department inspectors being invited in are undercut by their schedules: 8 A.M. to 4 P.M, only on weekdays, which greatly limits the chance that anyone will be home.
Even when the city successfully enters a house, finds an illegal apartment, orders it vacated and summons the landlord to a hearing, the landlord frequently defeats the whole process by ignoring the summons or paying the undaunting fine -- usually less than $1,000 -- and simply finding a new tenant to take the old one's place.
"They just start again with illegal conversions," said Joel A. Miele Sr., the former Commissioner of Buildings, in an interview months before he left his post in August. "And we are back to square one."

Photos: "Telltale Signs of Illegal Subdivision"
The illegal conversions that have cropped up throughout Queens are not always easy to spot. But a close inspection of many seemingly ordinary houses and apartment buildings reveals clues that these structures have been subdivided to accommodate additional families.
 
Buzzers and Mailboxes
These attached rowhouses in Corona are listed in city building and tax records as two-family homes. But the five buzzers for one and four mailboxes for the other suggest more than two apartments in each.
 
Basement Doors and Rental Signs
According to the Buildings Department, this home in Woodhaven should be occupied by two families. But a separate side entrance suggests a basement living space, and a call to the phone number listed on an the sign confirmed a third apartment in the basement.
 
Backyard Shanties
This three-story apartment building in Maspeth looks normal from the street. But behind it, a garage has been converted into a boarding house, with a shanty-like second level on top.
 
Extra Utility Meters
This rambling home on a leafy street in Richmond Hill is supposed to house two families. But local activists say the four meters are proof that it has been divided into as many as four apartments.
 
Converted Garages
These brick rowhouses in Elmhurst were designed for apartments on the first and second floors. But activists say the new entrances that have replaced garage doors flag basement apartments. (Photographs by Ozier Muhammad/The New York Times)(pg. B6)

HEADLINE: Basic Research Is Losing Out As Companies Stress Results

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: MURRAY HILL, N.J.

 BODY:
When Greg E. Blonder joined Bell Laboratories in 1982 as a physicist just out of Harvard, no one said a word about products or selling. "They asked their usual job interview question," he said. " 'What would I work on if I had an empty room and an unlimited amount of money?' " He spent his time measuring the behavior of electrons at 1 degree above absolute zero, which is very cold. "Not many products exist in that situation," he conceded.
But now Dr. Blonder, whose two young sons often ask him where they can buy something he has invented, is making a transition from basic to more applied research characteristic of industry everywhere in America. At 41, he has traveled from quantum physics to consumer tastes, emerging as the improbable chief of "Customer Expectations Research," a novel undertaking for the august Bell Labs based in this suburb 30 miles west of New York. 
 "I am using what I know about science to invent to order," Dr. Blonder said. "I am working backward," he added, from what he used to do.
Corporations once spent big sums on basic research, the sort of open-ended inquiry that drew Dr. Blonder to physics and that can lead to innovations that spawn new industries and many thousands of well-paying jobs. A lot of basic research goes nowhere, of course, but AT&T, the owner of Bell Labs, knew that Dr. Blonder's fresh insights into electron behavior might someday make possible a momentous breakthrough, perhaps a new type of computer chip as revolutionary as the transistor, which came out of Bell Labs in 1947.
In the 1990's, though, corporate outlays for research and development have fallen significantly for the first time, with much of the decline coming out of basic research. The shift in emphasis to near-term development is paying off today as American companies excel at turning a generation of good ideas into profitable products. Yet many corporate executives have decided that basic research for tomorrow is simply too speculative. It should be done, they argue, by university scientists, paid mainly by government.
The problem is that in an era of deficit cutting, Federal financing for basic research has suffered, too. As a result, total spending on research in the United States -- basic or applied, whether federally or privately financed -- has stagnated in the 1990's, when adjusted for inflation, according to the National Science Foundation.
The last time the Government cut back on research -- in the 1970's when military spending fell sharply -- corporations held their own. But now industrial research has become a victim of downsizing, stiffer competition and the growing corporate view that the return from most research and development spending should come in three years or less.
"We are eating our seed corn," said Paul M. Romer, a Stanford University economist who argues that industry is still squeezing products from the aging cornucopia of breakthrough technologies that came during and after World War II. "If this continues, we will no longer be the nation that is on the cutting edge of new technologies, new products and new markets. For the moment, we still are, but that can't last."
The shift away from basic research shows up repeatedly in interviews with researchers, government officials and corporate executives like Dr. Edward M. Scolnick, the tall, courtly, Harvard-trained doctor and scientist who presides over research and development at Merck & Company, the huge pharmaceutical concern. "We haven't the resources to do that work," he said.
Merck, for example, plans to spend $1.5 billion this year on drug research, but very little of that will be devoted to finding the viruses and wayward enzymes that must first be identified before new drugs can be designed to attack them. Tenneco Inc.'s huge auto division spends heavily to develop new features for catalytic converters. But no Tenneco scientist is seeking the next generation of emissions control, perhaps some not-yet-dreamed-of technology. Even Microsoft, which has opened a basic research center -- mainly to seek new ways for people to interact with computers -- still invests nearly 99 percent of its $2 billion research and development budget on elaborations of existing software, or testing.
For now, the focus on immediate results pays dividends. A rash of new products -- another AIDS drug, a better catalytic converter, a new wrinkle on the Internet, a better A.T.M. machine -- are visible evidence of the success of corporate spending on applied research. There have been gains as well from "process R& D," the development of faster, more efficient, more sophisticated ways to manufacture.
By most estimates, 25 percent of corporate research and development spending is now going for process research, such as Tenneco's newly designed machinery for shaping metal pipes as if they were flexible plastic tubes. "We design catalytic converters now taking this new flexibility into account," said Tom Evans, president of Tenneco Automotive's Walker division.
But many experts worry that in 20 years or so a shortfall of new technology could shackle the economy, even though the stock market does not show much concern. "It doesn't reward basic research," said C. Richard Kramlich, managing partner of New Enterprise Associates, a venture capital firm. "It rewards only the products that come out of research soon."
Without the cold war, a prime engine for basic research, the Pentagon, has cut back. And neither Democrats nor Republicans, eyeing the deficit, have filled the gap with more civilian research. "President Clinton asked Congress for increases," said Mary L. Good, the Commerce Department's Under Secretary for Technology, "and if he had not asked, the cuts would have been greater."
Caught in these crosscurrents is Dr. Blonder, an energetic, optimistic man who decorates his office with the sunny crayon drawings of his sons, 10 and 7. The split-up this year of AT&T into three companies also cut up Bell Labs. And soon Dr. Blonder will leave Bell's old home here, with its landmark pyramid copper roof, and move to a building leased on Exxon's nearby campus, once a larger research center.
Left behind will be colleagues with whom Dr. Blonder once interacted daily who will now work for Lucent Technologies, the spinoff from AT&T's old equipment manufacturing arm. It keeps the Bell Labs name. "We had 20 projects going," Dr. Blonder said, "and four had to be abandoned because they relied on a synergy between our software and their hardware people."
More than anything, Dr. Blonder and his 40-member team are in a race to create a yet-to-be-designed, portable device that may someday instantly convert speech to text, or perhaps English to Japanese, and vice versa.
"How do people understand what they hear, how do computers understand grammar?" Dr. Blonder said. "And then you have to find out, in techniques that are a little fancier than focus groups, why they would want such a device. This is what basic research is for me now. When I joined Bell Labs we were at the tail of the more abstract decades."
The cutback in old-style basic research reflects a historic transition from a system that blossomed in the Eisenhower Administration, fathered by Vannevar Bush, the science czar then. Dr. Bush sought to encourage among scientists "the free play of intellects working on subjects of their own choice, in the manner dictated by their own curiosity." Such research was nurtured in huge corporate or Federal laboratories with heavy Government spending to keep ahead of the Soviet Union.
Nylon came out of this system. So did the silicon chip, the laser, cellular phones, color television, modern gene technology, fiber optics and other breakthroughs that eventually created new industries, which in turn helped to expand the national economy at a rapid pace. Much of the effort was concentrated in world famous laboratories at AT&T, I.B.M., Eastman Kodak, Xerox, General Electric, Du Pont and other giants that dominated their markets and could afford the costly, drawn-out research. That world has been turned upside down by deregulation and new competitors.
"We are moving now toward a more practical Japanese or German model," said Gavin Wright, a Stanford University economic historian. "That might not give us world leadership in technology in the future. But it is more realistic."
Indeed, in some ways the new approach is more efficient. The pharmaceutical industry, for instance, has found a way to make and test in a given week thousands of chemical compounds as potential prescription drugs, a far cry from the two or three a day that was the upper limit only a short time ago. That's the focus of scientists at Merck like Paula Fitzgerald, a biophysicist.
Occupying one of the many narrow offices off a long, gray corridor at Merck's laboratory in Rahway, N.J., Dr. Fitzgerald models the interaction of enzymes identified by university scientists and chemical compounds generated by Merck. She is seeking to determine what mixture might block a disease-causing enzyme. The enzyme and chemicals appear as blue, red and green filaments floating intricately in three-dimensional depth on her ink-black computer screen.
"You draw the compounds that you model and test from a computerized library," she said. "Before you had to actually mix the chemicals to see how a compound worked."
In the new emphasis on profitable products, research is being decentralized. The once mighty laboratories are losing their independence, forcing scientists who inhabit them to answer not just to profit-oriented operating units but even directly to customers. "It is very common to walk in the halls today and come across numerous outsiders," said Bernard S. Meyerson, a top executive at I.B.M.'s research center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., once renowned for its ivory tower approach. "We had much less of this in the early 1980's, when I arrived."
Corporations are also encouraging their scientists to monitor basic research by others, here and abroad, in lieu of attempting the research themselves. In this spirit, American companies have increased their research and development spending overseas threefold since 1980, the Commerce Department reports, while foreign companies operate 645 research offices in the United States, up from 250 in 1992.
A chunk of current research spending shows up in numerous cooperative arrangements. Some are among companies to avoid costly duplication. Others are between companies and university researchers, or the small start-up ventures often set up to commercialize some discovery made on campus.
Merck, like many other high-tech giants, has agreements with a dozen small companies. "As funds are cut back, people are finding ingenious ways to carry through basic research," said John Kozarich, Merck's director of biochemistry. "We might not notice the impact for a couple of decades."

HEADLINE: City Hall Sees Cable Battle By TV Titans

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
In an unusual venting of vitriol between two media giants, Time Warner and the News Corporation took their long-running feud to City Hall yesterday, lambasting each other before a panel that is reviewing whether Time Warner should be allowed to keep its valuable cable franchises in New York City.
The panel's meeting opened a new front in the campaign by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to get Time Warner to carry the new 24-hour news channel started by the News Corporation, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch. Time Warner has declined to accept the channel, and last week, the company rejected a request by Mr. Giuliani to put the channel on one of five public-access cable stations operated by the city. 
 After Time Warner's refusal, Mr. Giuliani moved to use the panel, the Franchise Concession and Review Committee, to pressure the company to reverse its decision.
Executives from the two companies bickered through the meeting yesterday, all but calling one another liars. It was a series of charges and countercharges from men who rarely air grievances so publicly.
In their testimony, News Corporation executives contended that Time Warner was suffocating access to information in the city and said Ted Turner, the new vice chairman of Time Warner, had a vendetta against the News Corporation. Time Warner executives countered that the News Corporation was seeking special treatment for its channel, the Fox News Channel, arguing that the panel had no right to change the franchise agreements.
"Time Warner has extraordinary power in its New York City cable monopoly and does not hesitate to use that power to damage competitors and to damage the economy of this city," said Arthur M. Siskind, senior executive vice president and group general counsel for the News Corporation.
Richard Aurelio, president of Time Warner Cable of New York City, asked why the Giuliani administration was helping one company when more than 30 other cable programmers had been unable to get space on Time Warner's systems, which have 1.1 million subscribers in the city.
"What right does Fox have to leapfrog over all these other programs?" Mr. Aurelio said.
Mr. Giuliani repeated his reasoning yesterday for helping the News Corporation, which also owns The New York Post. He noted that the company had located the news channel's headquarters in Manhattan. If the channel is not shown in much of the city, it might fail, threatening hundreds of jobs, he said.
The review board had been scheduled to meet before the dispute erupted between the Giuliani administration and the two companies. By law, it must determine whether Time Warner's takeover of the Turner Broadcasting System, which will soon be completed, constitutes a change in ownership of the company that holds the cable franchises.
If the review board concludes that ownership has changed, in a vote that could come as early as tomorrow, then it can seek to rewrite the franchise agreements, which are up for renewal in 1998. That raises the possibility that the city could make the contracts less lucrative for Time Warner, or even take them away.
Four votes are controlled by the Mayor and one by City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi; one vote is shared by the five borough presidents. It takes five of the six votes to approve any action. The Mayor is leaning toward telling his representatives that there is a new owner, administration officials said.
Mr. Hevesi and four of the borough presidents said they had not yet taken a position. Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, said she thought that control of the franchises had changed, but said the city should not alter the franchise agreements.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICAN;
DOLE, FULL OF ZIP, GOES AFTER VOTERS FROM NEW JERSEY

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

 BODY:
With the first debate behind him, Bob Dole went back to the trail yesterday to seek new vigor for his campaign, rolling across New Jersey on his first bus tour and into Manhattan in a motorcade at rush hour.
At the same time, the campaign began broadcasting a set of new commercials that promote his tax-cut plan, use his wife to vouch for his trustworthiness and cast President Clinton as a tax-and-spend liberal. 
 "This is a great way to start the post-debate effort," Mr. Dole, the Republican Presidential nominee, said with enthusiasm at a high school rally in Toms River, in the first of four quick stops across the Garden State. "We've got 30 days to go. Don't believe the pundits, don't believe the polls. As Jack Kemp says, don't look up at the scoreboard -- the game is still on!"
Mr. Dole said he would win the election because he would be associated with the word "trust" while Mr. Clinton would be associated with the word "fear."
"When they think of Bill Clinton, I want them to think of the word fear," he said, referring to voters. "Fear."
As the Willie Nelson song, "On the Road Again," wailed in the background, Mr. Dole campaigned with Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who advocated tax cuts, won an uphill election and then kept her word and cut taxes. Later this week, Mr. Dole will enlist the help of another of the Republican Party's most reliable sources of popularity, Colin L. Powell, for a campaign trip to the Midwest.
"There's something magic about riding around on a bus with Governor Whitman," Mr. Dole told a lunchtime crowd in the middle of a street in Red Bank yesterday afternoon in a speech that lasted less than five minutes. "She won."
As he breezed out of Milltown later in the day, Mr. Dole playfully took the microphone to the public address system outside his bus and regaled bystanders with a running commentary on the passing scene.
When he saw Clinton signs, he said: "Thanks for coming. You'll still get the tax cut." To someone selling anti-Dole T-shirts by the side of the road, he said, "Bet those shirts aren't selling well."
Dole aides tried to make the case that spending two days in New Jersey was a sign that Mr. Dole had secured the Republican base in other parts of the country and was now ready to fight for battleground states like this one, where he trails the President in polls by 10 to 15 points.
Mr. Clinton, meanwhile, spent the day invading traditional Republican strongholds. [Page A21.]
In Connecticut, Mr. Clinton showcased his support among corporate executives, many of them longtime Republicans, including the head of one of the biggest employers in Kansas, the Sprint long-distance telephone company. Then he traveled to New Hampshire and Maine in a schedule that seemed designed to taunt Mr. Dole and convey the impression that Mr. Clinton was feeling comfortable enough about his lead to go to states that are traditionally Republican and offer only marginal electoral prizes.
In addition to Mr. Dole's energetic return to the stump today, he unveiled a new series of commercials that followed two different political agendas: One reinforces the depiction of Mr. Clinton as an advocate of high taxes, and the other is aimed at women, who have been cool to Mr. Dole. Campaign aides said the advertisements would run in 17 states, including California, at least through the week.
In one advertisement, Elizabeth Dole, seated on a couch in a living room, says, "My husband has come out strongly to protect the victims of domestic violence and to make sure a man and woman who work at the same job get the same retirement benefits." She adds: "And when Bob Dole says he'll cut taxes 15 percent for families, you can count on it."
In a second advertisement, Mr. Clinton is portrayed as having raised taxes on Social Security, for upper-income people, and on gasoline. The announcer asserts that Mr. Clinton has proposed a total of 255 taxes and fees, declaring: "The real Bill Clinton. A real spend-and-tax liberal."
Clinton economic advisers criticized the advertisement tonight, saying Mr. Dole was counting a series of small, technical tax-law changes, many of which he had supported himself. "It's a bogus standard," said Gene Sperling, a White House economic adviser. "By that bogus standard, Bob Dole would have well over 1,000 tax increases. He's the Hank Aaron of tax increasers."
In addition, Mr. Dole will begin broadcasting a new round of radio advertisements aimed at particular groups of voters: radio listeners in farm states, particularly in the West, and listeners to Christian-oriented radio stations. The campaign's need to buy radio time in both markets is the latest indication of the difficulty Mr. Dole has encountered in trying to excite reliable Republican voters.
While Mr. Dole's senior advisers said they were pleased with his debate performance, they stopped short of asserting that it had altered the state of the race.
"This is going to be a steady building process for the next 30 days," Scott Reed, Mr. Dole's campaign chairman, said today. "There's not going to be an overnight shift."
Nor was Mr. Dole overly effusive. Asked how he had done in the debate, Mr. Dole told reporters as he emerged from his hotel this morning: "I don't know. We had a good time last night. I enjoyed it. Like Hartford. I'm going to work today."
Mr. Dole is behind in the polls at this point, Mr. Reed said, because the Democrats spent "millions of dollars to portray Dole as someone who is mean and out of touch."
Mr. Reed predicted that by the end of this week -- which is to include a bus trip across Ohio, where Mr. Dole will campaign with Mr. Powell, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- Mr. Dole would have narrowed the gap in the polls. "By the end of he week, we'll be back in the high single digits, which will be a successful week for us," he said.
He added, "The Democrats' advertising has been very effective painting us into a corner, now we're going to beat our way out."
Mr. Reed said the campaign was focusing on states that would give Mr. Dole 320 electoral votes -- 270 are needed to win -- and that he had already locked up 200 of those votes from 17 states. But when pressed, Mr. Reed offered a list that totaled only 144 electoral votes.
The states that Mr. Reed said the campaign could count on were Alabama, Arizona, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming. Mr. Reed's optimism, which he said was supported by campaign polling, is not supported by public polling in Arizona or Virginia. The other states are reliably Republican.
Having secured the Republican base, Mr. Reed said, the campaign is prepared to move on to battleground states like Ohio and New Jersey.
Greeting about 400 people briefly in a hotel ballroom in Manhattan before he attended a private fund-raising event, Mr. Dole ridiculed Mr. Clinton's debate performance.
"I thought I was back in the Congress last night, when I listened to President Clinton," Mr. Dole said. "You sound like a law clerk reading off all these things that he was responsible for, all these things that didn't pass the first two years when you had a Democratic Congress, all these things passed by the Republican Congress that he never heard of because he hadn't had an idea in four years! He said, 'These are mine! These are mine! These mine!' "

HEADLINE: Loan for Be-Bop Birth Site

 BODY:
State development officials said yesterday that they would provide the actor Robert De Niro and his partners with a $300,000 loan and other incentives to help resurrect Minton's Playhouse, the jazz club where be-bop was born, in Harlem.
Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the State Development Commission, said the low-interest loan would be financed through a fund for economically distressed areas. 
 Mr. De Niro teamed up with Drew Nieporent, who operates TriBeCa Grill and other restaurants, and Melba Wilson, a principal in Sylvia's Restaurant in Harlem, more than two years ago to reopen Minton's Playhouse at 118th Street and Seventh Avenue.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper Prices Gain Sharply As Warehouse Stocks Drop

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Copper prices rose sharply in New York yesterday after a report showed that available supplies in London Metal Exchange warehouses fell to the lowest level in 10 months.
The London exchange reported copper stocks in its warehouses around the world fell 8,625 metric tons since its last reporting on Friday. It was the 10th consecutive decline and took stocks down to 220,950 metric tons, the lowest level since Nov. 28, 1995. A metric ton is 2,204.62 pounds. 
 New supplies of copper have not been coming to market quickly because suppliers have been reluctant to sell with prices so low. But buying of copper cathodes, used to make wiring for automobiles and homes, is at its highest, said David Rinehimer, an analyst with Smith Barney.
"We're dealing with an extremely tight near-term supply situation reflecting the fact that the U.S. economy remains fairly strong," he said.
Copper prices have been erratic since the Sumitomo Corporation reported huge losses on copper trading in mid-June. To cover a $2.6 billion trading loss it attributed to unauthorized trading from its former chief dealer, Sumitomo announced that it was exiting the copper market and would sell its large supplies.
Some investors believe the company still has as much as 500,000 tons of copper that could be dumped on the market at any time. But those fears have eased as exchange supplies continued to show sharp withdrawals.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, copper for December delivery rose 3.20 cents, to 91.65 cents a pound.
Crude and heating oil futures gained early on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid fears that the tropical storm Josephine would further disrupt production out of the Gulf of Mexico. Several offshore platforms were closed Sunday and Monday but were reopened yesterday, causing prices to fall back.
November crude oil rose 30 cents, to $25.54 a barrel, the highest settlement price since the start of the Persian Gulf war. November heating oil fell 0.30 cent, to 76.19 cents.

HEADLINE: I.R.A. Says It Set Bomb That Wounded 31 at Barracks in Ulster

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY 

DATELINE: DUBLIN, Oct. 8

 BODY:
The Irish Republican Army acknowledged tonight that it had detonated the two bombs that wounded 21 soldiers and 10 civilians on Monday at the British Army's headquarters in the British province of Northern Ireland.
The attack, at Lisburn, 10 miles south of Belfast, was the first the I.R.A. has admitted to in Northern Ireland since Sept. 1, 1994, when it called a cease-fire. The overwhelmingly Roman Catholic guerrilla organization, dedicated to forcing Britain out of the predominantly Protestant province, had already broken its general cease-fire in February with attacks in England. 
 The admission, in a telephone call to the Irish national broadcasting network in Dublin, raised fears here and in Belfast of retaliation by Protestant paramilitary groups, which have observed their own cease-fire since Oct. 13, 1994. It may also mean that the peace talks that started in Belfast four months ago are now all but dead.
"Anything can happen," said David Ervine, leader of the Progressive Unionist Party, which has ties to the Protestant paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force. "We have to batten down the hatches and prepare for the worst."
The worst would include a return to the sectarian guerrilla warfare that has killed more than 3,100 people since 1969.
Mr. Ervine and other Protestant leaders say they are trying to persuade the Protestant paramilitary groups not to retaliate. Protestant paramilitary leaders have warned that if the I.R.A. continues its violence, the Protestants will resume their own attacks, including forays into Dublin and other Irish cities.
On Monday, Prime Minister John Bruton of Ireland said the attack on the army base was an attempt to provoke Protestant retaliation. Today the Irish Government said it was increasing patrols along the border to intercept any Protestant guerrillas coming south.
Irish officials said the I.R.A. attack appeared to have been timed to coincide with an economic conference in Pittsburgh intended to bring American investment to the North and with the British Conservative Party conference in Bournemouth, England.
At the conference tonight, Prime Minister John Major of Britain said the attack, which came without the usual warning to the police, was "sickening."
He noted that Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the I.R.A.'s political wing, had been insisting on meeting him to discuss peace, "and all this time he knew they planned to murder people in Lisburn."
The I.R.A. statement, made by a caller using a code word indicating its authenticity, said, "The target was personnel connected with the Thiepval barracks," that is, directed against soldiers.
"We regret any injuries caused to civilians," the caller added. "The resolution of the conflict demands an inclusive negotiated settlement."
The I.R.A. wants Sinn Fein to take part in the Belfast talks but the British and Irish Governments have excluded Sinn Fein until the I.R.A. restores its cease-fire.
At Lisburn, British officials are trying to find out how the high-security headquarters was penetrated and two car bombs placed near an administrative center and barracks. The base had not been attaked for more than 20 years and was considered a safe bastion.
Several I.R.A. operations in England have failed in recent months, and a huge cache of expolsives and weapons was seized two weeks ago by the police in London. But with the Lisburn bombing, the I.R.A. showed that in Northern Ireland it is still able to carry out terrorist attacks.

HEADLINE: The Downside of an Upturn

BYLINE: By James Grant; James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, is the author of "The Trouble With Prosperity: The Loss of Fear, the Rise of Speculation and the Risk to American Savings."

 BODY:
The United States economy, although growing too slowly to satisfy every registered voter, is a ball of fire compared with the economies of Western Europe and Japan. One vital source of this strength is the robust American capacity to fail.
Any economic system can cope with success. But capitalism excels at failure: recognizing it, cutting it short and, through the process of bankruptcy, forgiving it. 
 By forthrightly curing its 1980's-vintage debt troubles, the United States cleared the way for growth in the 1990's, at however slow a rate. The Japanese, by contrast, condemned their economy to stagnation by pretending that their boom-time banking problems could be made to disappear without the inconvenience of actually addressing them.
People in markets miscalculate, singly and in groups, both on the upside and downside. Overdoing it in a boom, they propagate white elephants -- driving prices too high in real estate, if that is the most favored type of investment, or in semiconductor plants, if that is what's hot. Making amends in the slump, they clear away the mistakes of the boom, salvaging and repricing them.
Wall Street today is in the overdoing-it phase. As the Dow Jones Industrial Average closes in on 6,000, the bull market is titanic in every particular: from the record number of investment clubs, to the record high cost of a dollar of dividend income, to the long lines of radio cars idling expectantly outside the front doors of the great investment banks at 2 A.M. With each new high in the Dow, fewer people fear what the ancients called a bear market. More and more believe that the cycles of markets have been displaced by one cycle, the smiling, upward one.
That this impossibility has become the short-odds betting favorite is proof of how far the bull market has gone and how thoroughly its critics (myself not least) have been flummoxed. There will always be cycles in markets and economies. They have to exist, if only because people conduct their market-related business in crowds. As individuals shopping at K mart, people prefer low prices to high. Operating en masse in Wall Street, they seem now to prefer high prices to low.
It is, in fact, the upside of the business expansion that helps to cause the downside. They are a matched set. The exuberance of the expansion produces investment that causes distortions in the economic architecture. Redesign is the necessary work of the downturn.
Decade by decade since the 1960's, the economy's growth rate has become fainter. Is it purely by accident that this loss of vitality has coincided with the Government's efforts to mitigate the business cycle, to protect the banking system and to manipulate the dollar exchange rate (exporting, as necessary, punitively high exchange rates to Japan and Western Europe)? Insofar as bear markets, bank runs, recessions and the like serve a useful purpose, their relative scarcity in modern life might not be an unalloyed blessing after all.
The relatively good performance of the American economy in recent years shows that our Government is less overprotective than some. In France, Credit Lyonnais, whose balance sheet constitutes a kind of museum of 1980's-era trouble, has just requested its third government bailout. "No one could ever even think of having the collapse of a bank like this," a European Union commissioner declared in explaining the unanimous decision to approve the requested subsidy. Like the Japanese, the French are still sorting out the mistakes of the last upturn, whereas the American savings and loan bailout was completed years ago.
Meanwhile, the United States has entered the champagne-and-cigar-smoke phase of a new upturn. There is nothing wrong with booms. They are the financial expression of innovation and derring-do. In the natural course of things, promoters will err on the side of excess. The greater the degree of financial subsidy in a particular up cycle (such as artificially low interest rates), the greater the tendency toward exaggeration.
Imagine an economy taking the form of a standard, boxy East Side Manhattan apartment building. Before the end of a long expansion (well-oiled with cheap money), our symbolic structure would acquire a penthouse, an airstrip, a rooftop farm, a full set of gargoyles and a television broadcasting tower. The vital work of removing these gauds (and auctioning them off in the open market for better, alternative use) would occupy the residents during the down times.
Japan is a case study in what happens when markets are not allowed to get on with the work of what a great economist has called "creative destruction." Overpriced, empty office buildings remain overpriced and empty; after bankruptcy, they do not become cheap and functional.
The American boom of the 1990's is distinctive for the near-universal conviction that the Fed is at the controls, clear-eyed and sure-handed. It is not, I think. But even if a central bank could temporarily create a financial condition resembling room temperature -- measuring out growth in noninflationary doses, neither too big nor too small -- it would be doing nobody a favor. By creating a false sense of security about contingent and unpredictable future events, it would be leading the innocent to believe that the down cycle had been scratched.
So believing, investors would put themselves needlessly at risk. As they are now.
A paradox of financial markets is that risk is most dangerous when it is least apparent and least dangerous when it is most apparent. Thus, one of the great all-time buying opportunities in modern history occurred in the spring of 1942, with capitalism at bay, the forces of Imperial Japan thrust directly at Los Angeles and common stocks given up for dead by their demoralized and heavily taxed owners.
It is hard not to draw invidious comparisons with 1996, a year when capitalism is triumphant (even in Mongolia), when lunchtime crowds file into the New York Stock Exchange to watch themselves getting richer and when some $15 billion or $20 billion a month seeks supposed safe haven in equity mutual funds.
Booms foment error because, in the heat of the up cycle, error is so financeable. Thus, in the junk bond market this season, certain wireless telecommunications companies have been able to borrow even before they achieve the conventional preliminary milestone of generating a little revenue.
Indeed, one seasoned bond buyer has publicly resolved to invest in no deal in which the Wall Street underwriter's payment is higher than the revenues of the borrowing company over the preceding 12 months. Revenues, not cash flow, not net profits. "The scary thing?" the investor asks, rhetorically, of his screening test. "It screens out a lot."
No doubt some of these revenue-impaired debtors will succeed. That is not the real issue. The issue is whether the market is pricing securities for any but the perfect, fair-weather outcome. Up and down Wall Street, the answer would seem to be no.
In speculative markets, nothing is more certain than the progress of apparent perfection toward certain imperfection. When things can't possibly get any better, it logically follows, they can only get worse.

HEADLINE: Motorola Expects Chip Growth to Resume

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Motorola Inc. said today that it expects growth to resume in the semiconductor industry next year, a prediction bolstered later in the day by the release of an industry report indicating a stronger-than-expected book-to-bill ratio.
The ratio, which compares the number of new orders with chips shipped, increased to 0.99 in September, as computer makers raised their orders 9 percent in the expectation of higher demand, the Semiconductor Industry Assocation said. A ratio of 0.99 means that for every $100 of chips sold, chip makers took in $99 in new orders. September's ratio rose from August's 0.93, which was revised upward from 0.90. 
 While growth appears to be returning to the industry, Motorola, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill., also said that it expected to take a charge in its fourth quarter of "several tens of millions" of dollars against earnings -- still less than 10 cents a share -- to cover the expense of cutting jobs and other cost-saving measures.
The semiconductor and wireless communications giant made the projection in a conference call to analysts early this morning that followed the release on Monday of the company's report on third-quarter earnings. In that report, Motorola said its earnings for the quarter had fallen sharply.
Following the call, several analysts reduced their projected earnings for the current quarter and 1997.
Investors were uneasy with the news and sent Motorola's shares down $1, to $48.75, in heavy trading today on the New York Stock Exchange.
But many analysts viewed the news, especially the semiconductor projections, as cautiously optimistic. "It's good news they think the semiconductor market will grow next year," Todd Koffman, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, said.
During the conference call, Motorola said that while it expected an upturn in the industry next year, it did not expect growth to reach 10 percent, a level necessary to soak up excess capacity and force prices to rise.
During the call, Motorola officials stressed that earnings would be hurt in the next few quarters by its heavy investments in new technology, especially flat-panel displays and the Iridium satellite system for worldwide wireless communications.
Iridium may launch its first satellite as early as the end of this year but the entire 66-satellite network will not be up and generating commercial revenue before 1998 at the earliest. Motorola's share is 25 percent of what it said would be "hundreds of millions" of dollars in upfront costs.
In another technology bet that was disclosed on Monday in Tokyo and explained more fully today in Austin, Tex., Motorola and the Mitsubishi Electric Corporation of Japan said they planned to share technology to develop a new microchip that could handle both processing and memory functions that now required two or more semiconductors.
The two companies said that the new design could substantially reduce costs, save space and improve the reliability for designers of electronic products like peripheral devices used with desktop computers, personal digital assistants, portable phones and multimedia equipment. Designers would be able to specify the amount of memory they want instead of coupling processors and other types of microchips with separate memory chips that are sold in standard sizes.

HEADLINE: Language Study Shifts Again: Chinese Is Up, Russian Down

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
In a dramatic shift in their choice of foreign languages to study, more and more American college students are taking Chinese and Arabic at the expense of French, German and Russian, according to a new study by the Modern Language Association of America.
"The foreign languages chosen for study by students have always fluctuated, and they have always reflected international developments," said Phyllis Franklin, executive director of the association. "During World Wars I and II, there was a definite movement away from the study of German. More recently, when postwar Japan seemed the model of efficiency and economic success, students began studying Japanese in great numbers, thinking that would be the ticket to a successful career." 
 The organization, which surveyed 2,700 two- and four-year colleges and universities, found that registrations in Chinese and Arabic were up 36 percent and 28 percent, respectively, over what they were five years ago, while those in Spanish had climbed by more than 13 percent.
Meanwhile, French, German and especially Russian have fallen off sharply, while registrations in Italian and Latin declined less dramatically. French and German are both down by 28 percent and Russian is down by 45 percent.
Largely unchanged are registrations in ancient Greek, Hebrew and Japanese, although Japanese is now the fourth most-studied language, up from fifth in 1990. Chinese became the sixth most-studied language, up from eighth.
Spanish continues to be the most popular foreign language among American students, with an enrollment of 606,286, nearly half of the nation's language enrollment of 1.1 million.
The survey found a substantially higher registration over the last five years among the less commonly studied languages. Three-quarters of this increase was accounted for by enrollments in Korean, Vietnamese and Hawaiian, plus American Sign Language, which the association included in its survey.
Although down since 1990 despite an overall rise in college enrollments, foreign language enrollments are still at higher levels than at any time in the 1960's, 1970's or 1980's.
Colleges and universities are struggling to cope with these changes in a variety of ways. At one extreme, officials at the State University of New York at Albany recently announced the elimination of its German program and its four tenured professors. Two years ago, Bennington College created a stir when it abolished its traditional language departments and replaced them with a language center that serves both the college and neighboring communities and is staffed by non-tenure-track teachers.
More commonly, educational administrators are allowing French, German and Russian departments to shrink by attrition. And, wary of building inflexible departments with tenured professors teaching languages that few want to learn, they are employing adjunct professors in non-tenure-track positions.
Asked whether American students could be expected to become fluent in unfamiliar languages, like Chinese and Arabic, Yuann-Yuann Meng, an instructor in Chinese at Columbia University, insisted that a hard-working student who studied Chinese over a period of three years "could become just as proficient as if he or she had studied Spanish for that many years."
"Chinese grammar is very simple," she said.
An Arabic scholar, Prof. Dilworth Parkinson of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, said that Arabic was not nearly so easy for Americans who do not come from Arabic-speaking families. "Arabic is so strange and difficult to many American students -- nothing looks familiar and there's an elaborate vocabulary -- that unless they can travel and find a way to become fluent, just enrolling in a university program will not be enough."
Ms. Franklin said some language choices had obvious explanations. "The changing demographics of the United States figure into this," she said. "We have an influx of immigrants who speak Chinese, Arabic or Spanish and so their children want to learn or improve their ability in the family language. We call these the heritage learners.
"Another explanation has to do with economics," she said. "Students see the increasing number of people who speak Spanish in the country and that attracts them to study Spanish as a way of getting a job or doing business with the Spanish-speaking population. These students see that they won't have to travel outside the United States to use their language skill."
Ms. Franklin also cautioned against "simplistic" interpretations of the survey findings.
"People don't sit around deciding which countries are likely to succeed in the years ahead and then study their languages," she said. "That's too much cause-and-effect. In actual practice, the choice of a language to study is less formal."
She said she was gratified by the finding that Americans are still actively interested in studying foreign languages.
"Only a few years ago," she said, "many people thought that English would become the international language and that Americans would not have to learn languages other than English. Well, English has become an international language, but even so there's a general awareness today that we are in a global economy and that that necessitates the study of foreign languages. We see that as a good thing."

HEADLINE: For 2d Day, Dow Tops 6,000 Then Retreats

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average made another short-lived move above 6,000 yesterday as stocks, particularly technology shares, fell on some profit taking in advance of the quarterly flood of earnings reports.
The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 13.04 to close at 5,966.77, having quickly surrendered an early 30-point gain that had lifted the blue-chip average just above 6,010. On Monday, the Dow pierced the 6,000-mark for the first time, but pulled back within minutes. 
 Broader market measures slipped from record levels as interest rates rose slightly in bond trading, providing stock investors with an excuse to secure more profits on the market's monthlong push into record territory.
The bond market's weakness after a series of strong sessions "is not that big a deal, but it was ideal for a stock market that has done extremely well and was looking for an excuse to sell," said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at Everen Securities in Chicago. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond slipped 7/32, pushing its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, up to 6.80 percent, from 6.78 percent on Monday.
Many investors want to see if the impending barrage of third-quarter earnings reports will justify the gains in the stock and bond markets. They are also awaiting Friday's and next week's readings on producer and consumer prices in September, hoping for further confirmation of the recently upbeat inflation and interest rate outlook.
The biggest losses among stocks came in the technology-laden Nasdaq market, which on Monday had closed at a new high for the first time in four months.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 10.72, to 1,240.15, as bellwether technology issues, the dominant force behind the Nasdaq's rebound from July's selloff, suffered some heavy profit taking. Intel fell 3, to 101 5/8, and Microsoft fell 2 1/8, to 135 3/8.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly a 7-to-5 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 435.1 million shares, up from Monday's pace.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.70 points, to 700.64, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.23 points, to 373.51.
Monday evening's third-quarter reports from the chip makers Motorola and Advanced Micro Devices offered a less-than-encouraging peek at the computer sector. But analysts said the scarcity of warnings of disappointing earnings expectations bodes well for the quarter's results from technology companies and the broad market.
"We haven't had that many negative announcements, and that's what's impressed me," said Peter Anderson, chief investment officer at the IDS Advisory Group in Minneapolis.
Motorola reported an expected 58 percent drop in third-quarter earnings, cautioning that troubles in its semiconductor and cellular equipment businesses might continue. Advanced Micro meanwhile, reported a loss of more than $38 million as sales fell.
In active trading, Motorola shares fell 1, to 48 3/4, but Advanced Micro Devices, whose loss was actually smaller than analysts were expecting, rose 3/8, to 16 1/8.
Dole Food lost 2 1/8, to 37 5/8, after its chief financial officer left the company. The executive's departure follows a forecast last week that Dole's third-quarter results would be at the low end of analysts' forecasts.
 Expeditors International, a transportation and logistics company, surged 4 3/4, to 40, after forecasting it would top analysts' third-quarter earnings estimates by 25 percent.
 McDermott International fell 2 1/2, at 19 1/2. The energy services company is cutting its dividend and trying to sell noncore operations in the face of deepening losses. McDermott also said late Monday that it expects to report a second-quarter loss that is larger than the first quarter's $9.9 million, or 18 cents a share.

HEADLINE: Croatia Chief Seeks to Muzzle A Radio That Aided His Rise

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, Oct. 8

 BODY:
A retired Croatian general, critical of President Franjo Tudjman's drive to turn this small country into a military power in the Balkans, took to the airwaves today to spell out what he said was the folly of such a course.
"We don't have the human, material or economic resources to be a regional military power," said the general, Antun Tus. "Our future should be in alliances, not in exhausting ourselves to build up our armed forces." 
 The broadcast was made over Radio 101, the last independent radio station in Croatia. It highlighted the fight by the dwindling number of news organizations in the Balkans to broadcast views contrary to those of the ruling parties that govern the six republics in the former Yugoslavia.
But Radio 101, which often gave air time to Mr. Tudjman when he was a dissident challenging the Communist authorities, may soon be silenced by the man who used its studios as a platform to build his political career. And its demise, many contend, would effectively end any hope for independent news media.
"There is very little diversity now in the Croatian press," said Marvin L. Stone, a former editor in chief of U.S. News and World Report and a visiting fellow at Zagreb University. "The Government has either tamed, taken over or closed nearly all independent media. As far as Eastern Europe goes, only Serbia is in the same league as Croatia. President Tudjman is always parading, talking or smiling on the state-run television. There is no room for the opposition."
New restrictive press laws, including a decision by officials at the Interior Ministry to limit the visas of foreign correspondents to three months, have been passed recently despite requests by Croatia's European and American allies to end a Government crackdown on the press. A new press law promulgated this month, intended to bolster Croatia's bid to join the Council of Europe, gives the Government the power to force newspapers to run corrections or clarifications and sets the qualifications for chief editors.
There are troubling signs that Radio 101, which for 13 years braved the intolerance of Communist and nationalist politicians alike, will be turned over to Tudjman supporters when its license expires in November. The Government commission that is deciding who will be awarded the frequency now used by the radio station has been busy the last few weeks handing out radio frequencies to party loyalists.
The station, with a 32 percent share of the Zagreb audience, according to independent telephone surveys, dwarfs that of any other radio station in the city. It can be heard by nearly a quarter of Croatia's 4.7 million people. And its listeners say that losing the station would recall the days of a dictatorship many hoped had ended when Croatia declared its independence five years ago.
"The radio is a symbol," said Nenad Vukadinovic, a lawyer. "It has given a voice, and hope, to those of us who yearn to see this country become a European democracy."
The governing political party, the Croatian Democratic Union, controls all television and radio, along with three of the four national newspapers. The three independent newspapers are all currently fighting several Government-backed lawsuits, any one of which, if successful, would throw them into bankruptcy. The suits were filed shortly after a new law was passed this year making it illegal to criticize the President or other top Government officials. Government tax inspectors have also been searching newsrooms and combing the newspapers' record books looking for irregularities.
The radio station, which broadcasts out of a cramped two-story building in downtown Zagreb, pumps out round-the-clock programming that includes popular call-in shows and rock music, although the 800-watt transmitter strains to reach the outskirts of the city. Reporters, editors and announcers often get their pay two or three months late.
Natasha Babic, a 30-year-old producer, stood recently in the door of a small studio, equipped with antiquated reel-to-reel tape players and old sound-mixers and turntables.
"The tactics used by the Communists to try to silence us are about the same used by Tudjman's Government," she said. "And this is because, in many cases, we are still dealing with the same people."

HEADLINE: Cable Interference

 BODY:
Part of the obligation of any top official in New York is to help businesses create new jobs. But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Gov. George Pataki and Attorney General Dennis Vacco have exercised poor judgment by demanding that Time Warner cable television allow the New York-based Fox News Channel to be shown to local television viewers. Since the Fox News Channel is owned by Rupert Murdoch, a political supporter of all three men, their actions involve a conflict of interest. Beyond that, Mr. Giuliani's threat to revoke Time Warner's license and Mr. Vacco's launching of an antitrust investigation are improper government interventions promoting one commercial programmer over another on cable television.
If the optimistic predictions of a few years ago had proved accurate, New Yorkers might have had 500 cable channels to choose from by now, with plenty of room for Mr. Murdoch's new 24-hour news operation. But technology has not moved that swiftly, and the 1.1 million city subscribers to Time Warner Cable receive only 75 channels, with 5 set aside for city-sponsored public service and educational programs. Time Warner Cable argues that there is simply not enough room for all the worthy companies that want to get on the air. 
 The current dispute arose when Time Warner promised the Federal Trade Commission to add one news channel in return for approval of its merger with the Cable News Network, owned by Ted Turner. Despite a strong bid by Fox, Time Warner chose a rival news unit owned by NBC and the Microsoft Corporation. In the media world, Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Turner are like Godzilla and King Kong. Time Warner says it had sound business reasons for awarding a channel to MSNBC, but Mr. Murdoch charged foul play based on his conservative views. Enter the politicians, who until now have never displayed much interest in cable programming. The Mayor wants to turn one of the city's public access channels over to Mr. Murdoch. That would probably violate the Federal ban on commercial use of the public-access channels. Time Warner declined to go along, no doubt reluctant to make room for another competitor to CNN.
Mr. Giuliani says he is only acting in the city's economic interest, noting that Fox News was awarded tax relief and other economic incentives only in June to start up its news service in the city, adding 1,400 new jobs to its operations. But the tax deal was not contingent on the Fox News Channel's being carried in the city, and in any case other cable companies that would like to get on Time Warner's service have never been surveyed on how many jobs they could bring to the table.
Under Federal law, any city that awards a franchise to a cable company is not permitted to take its content into account. But by threatening Time Warner that it might not renew its franchise, the city seems to be doing just that. Mr. Giuliani argues that the franchise renewal was prompted by Time Warner's acquisition of CNN a year ago, which changes the nature of corporate control. But that issue did not prompt a City Hall challenge in years past, when Time Warner was involved in other big takeovers.
As a powerful monopoly, Time Warner has a responsibility not to behave in a predatory way toward its competitors. But Mr. Murdoch is not some sort of innocent who needs a protector. He has ruthlessly used his news organizations in the United States and overseas to further his political agenda, and in New York City has used his newspaper The New York Post to help politicians he likes, including the Mayor, Governor and Attorney General. The conflict in this situation is clear and unseemly. These three have no business using their powers to force Mr. Murdoch on the air.

Slow Auction Causes a Slip In Bond Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices slipped yesterday after an auction of new 10-year Treasury notes failed to encourage buying.
"The market expected the 10-year note auction to come in stronger and when it came in weaker than expected, it did not sit well with traders," said Larry Berman, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 7/32, to 99 11/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.80 percent, from 6.78 percent on Monday.
Bond prices received some support from two weekly retail sales reports. The Mitsubishi Bank-Schroder Wertheim report for the week ended Oct. 5 showed a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in sales from the previous week. A survey by LJR Redbook Research, formerly Johnson Redbook, showed that sales fell four-tenths of 1 percent, as expected. The reports confirmed a view that the economy was slowing and that the Federal Reserve would hold interest rates steady.
Prices were also bolstered by comments by two Federal Reserve officials that were interpreted as being bullish for the market.
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, WilliamJ. McDonough, told the Reuters news service after addressing the Bank Administration Institute in Washington that he believed the Federal Reserve should set a target for the core Consumer Price Index, which excludes energy and food prices. His comments echoed remarks he made in March, analysts said, noting that the core numbers have been stable this year.
Also in Washington, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., told a group of economists that he saw signs of lower growth in recent reports on retail sales and jobs.
But prices were undermined by concern about how much demand dealers would see for the $10 billion auction of new 10-year Treasury notes.
Still, Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston, said the results of the sale were decent, noting that the average yield at auction of 6.502 percent was close to expectations of 6.50 percent.
For investors, the 10-year note is essentially a bet that the market will continue to rally higher than its recent range, analysts said. But the looming prospect of Friday's producer price and retail sales data, as well as next week's consumer price report, provided some resistance to making such a bet.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 10-year notes:

HEADLINE: Struggling to Duplicate a Success;
Levi Strauss Hopes to Match Performance of Dockers

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
Last December, after production had already begun on Levi Strauss & Company's new Slates men's dress pants and only months before the shipping deadline, the company halted production to change the fabric of half the product line, increasing the wool content by 10 percent.
The company says it made the switch only after finding it could use better fabric without increasing the price of the pants. A competitor, Alan Burks, senior vice president for marketing at the Haggar Clothing Company of Dallas, says Levi Strauss was simply scurrying after realizing that Slates looked too much like its unsuccessful Dress Dockers. 
 Whatever the rationale, the switch meant a scramble. Workers were leaving for Christmas, retailers had placed orders based on the original fabric and factories needed fabric to keep up production levels. Patterns no longer met specifications, and dye colors were off.
"Delivering the news was not a pleasant moment," recalled Rita Trumbo, merchandising manager. "I had a room of about 15 people who had put their hearts into the production start of Slates, and this was the last straw. I'm sure there were a lot of hallway conversations and bathroom conversations that were not flattering."
A decade ago, Levi Strauss stunned the clothing world by creating Dockers, casual pants that became a billion-dollar brand. But the company, perceived as one of the world's great merchants, is finding it is not so easy to duplicate that success.
It discontinued Dress Dockers last May after seven years, amid criticism that consumers were confused about the differences between Dockers and Dress Dockers. Sales of the line never exceeded $25 million, estimated Harry Bernard of Colton Bernard Inc., an industry consultant and analyst based in San Francisco. Levi Strauss officials declined to disclose any financial information about Dress Dockers or the cost of developing Slates.
Now, Levi Strauss is having another try. Last August it introduced Slates into 1,500 stores and -- correcting what it saw as an oversight in the introduction of Dress Dockers -- backed the new line with a $20 million marketing budget. Levi Strauss created a new division solely for Slates -- only the third brand introduced in the company's 140-year history -- and hired more than 100 people full time to design and market the pants, which sell for $50 to $80 retail.
Levi Strauss, a privately held company with $6.7 billion in sales last year, estimates that Slates, as was the case with Dockers, will have $1 billion in sales worldwide in a decade (though inflation has made that a more attainable goal). Slates, the company says, will finally establish Levi Strauss as a market leader in the $1.9 billion men's dress pants market in the United States, a category that is being reconfigured by the new trend toward casual attire.
Jann Westfall, president of the Slates division, insists that Dress Dockers were a success and that Slates is a totally new line -- with a different fit, higher quality and wider distribution -- that will "awaken a sleeping giant of a category that we think has enormous potential." Indeed, in its marketing, Levi Strauss seeks to position Slates somewhere between dress and casual pants, equal to either role.
Haggar -- which this month is introducing a segment-straddling product of its own, called the Ultimate Pant -- says Levi Strauss's rollout has been fraught with missteps and, combined with the earlier Dress Docker episode, simply shows that Levi Strauss does not understand the dress pants market.
"I guess we'll see if the consumer is as dumb as they think they are," Mr. Burks said.
Others say Levi Strauss -- with its 18 months of dithering over details from buttonhole sizes to belt-loop widths and its cover-all-bases approach to Slates -- is showing it is not just a jeans manufacturer. While Levi's jeans and Dockers khakis are facing more competition from private-label brands, Levi Strauss is using its deep pockets and marketing muscle to open new niches.
"Levi is a great brand, but they are in a business where their products have been easily duplicated," said Douglas A. Christopher, a retailing analyst with Crowell Weedon, a brokerage firm in Los Angeles.
Competitors predict that success will not come easy for Slates because of the growing complexity of the dress pants market, already dominated by companies like Haggar, Farah Inc., based in El Paso, and Banana Republic, based in San Francisco, a unit of Gap Inc.
"The changing workplace environment for men is making it difficult to figure out what the heck they want to wear," said Peter Simon of NPD Group, an apparel research firm in Port Washington, L.I.
Indeed, the story of how Levi Strauss introduced Slates illustrates an almost comical level of confusion about what this new line should be. Not to mention high anxiety.
Consider the nits that were picked just to come up with the Slates name. The division's marketing group spent four months sifting through 10,000 possibilities looking for a name that it could trademark globally and that could be pronounced in most major languages. It wanted a name that was somewhat masculine and formal -- and something that ended in the letter s, because the company's two other brand names, Levi's and Dockers, end in s.
"What we were looking for was an empty vessel, a word that really had no meaning that we could then fill with meaning," said Nancy Friedman, Slates marketing director.
After selecting Slates, the executives set in motion a plan for concealing the name for several months leading up to the product's debut; just picking the brand's code name -- "Steps" -- took another month.
Among other quirky tests, the marketing team inserted the Slates name into mock news articles to gauge how it would look in print. But the exercise proved unnecessary once the executives learned that Microsoft was publishing an on-line magazine called Slate. Levi Strauss concluded it could only trademark the name against use by other apparel makers; it was too late to choose another one.
Attention turned to picking a logo, leading to another three or four months of haggling. Four freelance designers came up with dozens of possibilities, including a chiseled rock. "It was an easy way to remember the name, but we didn't really want the name to have to do with stone so men would think we only had gray pants," Ms. Friedman said. "Men are really literal."
The company finally chose a sleek interwoven letter S configuration and, after several more months of debate, decided it should go on the inside waistband above the zipper -- so that it would be the last thing a man sees as he puts on his pants.
The merchandising team, meanwhile, was poring over fabric swatches and buttons.
"In our research, we asked men what they expected in a dress pant, what they perceived as a dress pant," said John Sun, Slates senior designer. "We got a range from cotton khaki pants to suit pants and everything in between."
Men were asked to bring their favorite dress pants to a focus group. In many instances, the pants were so ill fitting that "men were pulling the waist below their stomachs," Mr. Sun noted.
So the designers chose to rely on their expertise, and the general comments of focus group participants. They gave Slates pockets that were deeper than the standard, reinforced the waistline and added nontraditional waist sizes like 35 inches.
Next the sales and marketing group needed a way to make Slates stand out in stores that traditionally displayed men's dress pants in warehouse fashion.
"We actually hung out in department stores and observed customers shopping," recalled David Ludd, retail marketing manager. The exercise, he said, confirmed that men generally become overwhelmed in clothing stores and head immediately for the center of the room, which is often so packed with product that moving around becomes a challenge.
With that in mind, the company hired an architectural firm that specializes in designing luxury hotels to create a roomy, circular display.
Then there were the hangers. Executives spent about a month trying to create a new hanger, something that would display the product in a unique fashion. One possibility required too much effort to assemble; another hid the logo; a third crumpled the pants. So Slates pants are in stores on hangers similar to those used by the competition.
With a product to show off, Ms. Friedman turned her attention to proposed commercials for Slates, spending a week reviewing a two-second shot in one spot. In the spot, entitled "Tango," a man in a pair of Slates dances around a grand restaurant with a waitress. Ms. Friedman was uncomfortable with a shot of the woman's leg hoisted in the air as the couple danced.
"I just didn't know if I liked seeing the sole of her shoe in my face," she said. With some prodding, Ms. Friedman voted to let the foot stay.
Only time will tell if attention to such details will help fulfill Levi Strauss's vision for Slates -- or if the experience simply represented a Keystone Cops development program that supports Haggar's contention that Levi Strauss doesn't know what it's doing in this market.
Paul Fitzpatrick, executive vice president and general merchandise manager for men's and children's apparel at Macy's, said Slates had exceeded Levi Strauss's initial sales estimates, although he declined to give specific numbers.
He said Macy's chose to carry the line because the company knew Levi Strauss would support Slates with extensive marketing. Asked how consumers could differentiate among Slates and Dress Dockers and competitors' brands, Mr. Fitzpatrick declined comment.
Al Preziosi, merchandise manager for men's clothing at J. C. Penney, said consumers would notice that Slates was better made than Dress Dockers and offered more of an assortment.
Perhaps, but what is certain is that the heat has been turned up a notch for all of the players in the industry. "It is going to be an intensified marketing battle now to see who is going to dominate that market," said Norman Karr of Jeanswear Communications. "One of the ways the competition is going to become obvious is in price wars. I think it will boil down to staying power."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: Campaign Trail;
THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

 BODY:

Your Dollars at Work
Taxpayers have ponied up almost $210 million to finance this year's primary and general-election races for the White House. Private donors and political parties have tossed in millions upon millions more. Most of it is spent on television ads, salaries and the other nuts and bolts of a national political campaign.
Some of the nickel-and-dime items, on the other hand, can be revealing. 
 Take the backstage expenses that go toward making a speech site worthy of a few seconds on network television. Bob Dole's expense reports suggest a preference for the big, sometimes costly splash. There is a $5,000 bill for fireworks. And a $6,700 tab for an August event in which the Dole campaign bought 10,000 biodegradable latex balloons and 100,000 feet of colored streamers, all for a speech in Pittsburgh by Jack Kemp.
The streamers "shot like giant party poppers" over Mr. Kemp, while the balloons rose from a giant football behind the stage, said Greg Crossey, one of the owners of The Balloon Company in suburban Pittsburgh. "Great visuals," he said.
Bill Clinton, on the other hand, went to San Francisco one weekend this summer. His campaign's expense reports show that the "decoration/paraphernalia/visibility" for the event were provided by Bill Graham Presents, a name that will resonate with children of the 60's like the President. Before his death, Mr. Graham was the world's foremost rock-concert promoter and made San Francisco a locus for stars like Janis Joplin, Bob Dylan and the Grateful Dead. The campaign paid $375.
Or perhaps a campaign is what it eats. According to the August expense reports, the Dole campaign regularly turned to restaurants like Bella Luna in San Diego and businesses like Jack Fackrell Catering in Redding, Calif., to lay out a spread at its political events.
The Clinton campaign usually shopped for food at Kroger's or at places like the Bi-Lo Food Store in Chattanooga, Tenn.
The Natural Law Party and its candidate, John Hagelin, are running on a platform based on the teachings of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the onetime guru to the Beatles. To no one's surprise, they largely patronized Thai and Indian restaurants.
And Ross Perot's Reform Party? The campaign seldom served food. And when it did, it was usually pizza.

Battle Fatigue
Sometimes, usually at the end of the campaign day, President Clinton becomes so caught up in his oratory that he seems to enter a different political dimension. Last week it was in Boston, where he compared the issues at stake in his re-election campaign to the fateful decisions made by the Founding Fathers.
This week it was in Portland, Me., where he disavowed the Founding Fathers altogether.
Mr. Clinton often winds his stemwinders down with a land-of-opportunity aphorism, this one in a Seattle speech: "If you want to be an American, what you have to do is believe in the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights and the Constitution and show up and behave yourself and do right, and you're part of our country."
Fair enough. Now here's how it came out of his mouth in Portland earlier this week, in a 9 P.M. speech to an airport rally: "In this country, it doesn't matter if you believe in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and you're willing to show up tomorrow and be a good citizen, everybody can have a place in America."
Reporters demanded to know whether Mr. Clinton had decided to abrogate the Constitution. They relented after White House aides threatened to brief them on the Constitution that night for an entire hour.

Bridge to Clinton's Page
At the end of Sunday's Presidential debate, Bob Dole showed he was, too, a 21st-century politician by capping his closing statement with his campaign's Internet address: www.dolekemp96.org. Trouble is, he left out the last "dot," after "96," rendering the address unusable.
Some net surfers who tried other variations of the address found this message: "Pssst . . . The past is over. Click below to make the right choice for the future." Following that instruction led them -- voila! -- to the official home page of the Clinton-Gore campaign.
Dirty Clinton cybertricks? Not exactly. The Internet addresses "www.dole-kemp.org" and "www.dole-kemp.com" belong to Internet Online, a Bethesda, Md., company that provides a bevy of web-related services. Michael Mann, president of the company, said it registered the addresses last month, "mostly because it only costs $100."
The company hoped to sell them or the company's services to the Dole campaign or to some other entrepreneur. When the campaign turned it down, it added the link to the Clinton campaign as a practical joke.
By Tuesday, the Clinton link was gone, replaced by an advertisement for Mr. Mann's Internet services. But there is always the potential for a few more hijinks: "We registered 'www.clinton-gore.com' a long time ago," Mr. Mann said.

Nonscience Marches On
"This is not rocket science. There is 'x' number of people on welfare who never seem to get off, but who are physically and mentally able to work." -- President Clinton in Connecticut on Monday, exercising the middle-of-the-road strategy that drives his campaign.
"This is not rocket science. This is a tax cut." -- Bob Dole in New Jersey that same day, exercising the economic strategy that drives his campaign. MICHAEL WINES

Help for Lace Embroiderers

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: HOBOKEN

 BODY:
Northern New Jersey's 120-year-old, $300-million-a-year lace and embroidery industry is experiencing tough times. According to state commerce officials, the embroiderers -- 400 mostly family-run shops in North Bergen and Union City and nearby towns, employing 4,000 people -- have seen sales drop 20 percent over 15 years because of cheaper foreign competition. 
 Yesterday, the State Division of Economic Development announced a nine-point plan to revive the industry, with the help of Federal agencies and private organizations. The plan calls for bridge loans from local banks to ease embroiderers' cash flow problems, marketing advice from the government and technical help to upgrade outdated machinery. TERRY PRISTIN

HEADLINE: Fringe Benefits From Oil Give Alaska a Big Payday

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: PALMER, Alaska, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Politically conservative it may be, but Alaska is the only state in the nation where redistribution of wealth is written into the state Constitution. The Last Frontier State pays people to live here, and never before will so much have been paid to so many.
This week 543,000 Alaskans -- from single-toothed toddlers to urban-phobic homesteaders -- will each receive a check for $1,130.68, their annual share of the oil wealth that has transformed this state since the 1970's. 
 Some will blow it in one night. About a third of the people will bank it. Some 30,000 people will never see it; creditors have first claim on what, for some families, is their only reliable source of income. Thousands of others will sign their Permanent Fund dividend check over to an airline in return for round-trip tickets to places that have more than three hours of daylight in December.
Anyone who can prove a year's worth of residency in the year before the payout is entitled to a dividend. College students who go out of state, but return on a regular basis, are eligible. Any baby born up to the last day of the qualifying year will get a check. A family of four will receive $4,522.72 this year.
For merchants, the fund is a godsend. Stores peg their biggest sales to the dividend payout. Travel agencies do a booming business. Sales of snowmobiles perk up considerably. Bars are full, but that has never been a problem in Alaska.
Even as they make plans to spend this year's check, however, spme Alaskans are questioning whether the state should find some other way to use the fund, rather than give the money away.
What started as oil in Prudhoe Bay, an arm of the Beaufort Sea off northern Alaska, can end up in a little town like Palmer as literally music in the air.
"The Permanent Fund paid for these bagpipes," said Chris Behnke, a 13-year-old freshman at Palmer High School. He stood outside in the shadow of the great spine of the Alaskan Range, his fingers freezing, sending notes to the sky on his vintage instrument. His $990 check last year was just enough to pay for the bagpipes.
"The only income I get is from the fund," Chris said. "Most kids put it into Nintendo. This was my dream. The only problem is, it is not compatible with any other instrument, so I have to practice alone."
Palmer started as a socialist experiment in the 1930's, when several hundred Dust Bowl families from the Midwest were given land to farm here in the Matanuska Valley 40 miles northeast of Anchorage. Most of the farms are long gone, but October never fails to bring a harvest from the Permanent Fund.
"I might do a little traveling on this year's check," said John Schreiber, 81, a Palmer pioneer.
Addicted as they are to oil money, which pays for 85 percent of the state government, many Alaskans now think their annual dividend checks can continue indefinitely even if the North Slope oil wells run dry.
That is because this year's windfall, the biggest payout in the 20 years since the Permanent Fund was established, was earned primarily from things that had nothing to do with oil. Alaskans, as shareholders in what is essentially a state-run mutual fund, own things like an industrial complex in Orlando, Fla., and an office building in Washington, D.C.
The fund, which was established as a rainy-day reserve for the time when the oil companies leave, has grown to $20 billion in principal. Half the earnings from an average year are given back in the dividends. The principal is not touched.
In the year ended June 30 the fund earned $1.8 billion, and slightly more than half of those profits were from the stock market. From an array of outside investments, the fund made six times as much as it took in from oil money. This heralds a day, many Alaskans say, when the state will be free of its dependency on oil, but will remain hooked on the fringe benefits that started beneath the Arctic ice.
"It provides stability, it provides hope for the future and it gives everyone a sense of accomplishment that we turned a nonrenewable resource into a renewable one," said Jim Kelly, a spokesman for the Alaska Permanent Fund, the quasi-public agency that manages the money.
To people outside of Alaska, which has no state income tax or sales tax, the idea that a government agency pays people for simply living in the state seems like a fantasy. Alaska is often compared to Saudi Arabia, without the heat.
"People in the Lower 48 ask me what I do for a living," said Mike McGee, who runs the dividend operation at the Permanent Fund. "I get a big kick out of saying, 'I'm giving away money to people.' "
But on this, the fund's 20th anniversary, a debate is raging among some Alaskans over whether the state should do something else with the money.
"We should use the fund to buy influence as all the other special interests do," Charles M. Springer wrote in a forum in The Anchorage Daily News. He says lobbyists are far more effective than legislators, and could be put to work for Alaska by lobbying for more oil drilling.
Others fear that this tax-free, dividend-rich state is becoming too much of a good thing. "If Alaska becomes so utopian in providing free money and low or no taxes, we might have to pay people to stay away," wrote Jack F. Burton.
That seems unlikely. The cost of living in Alaska is still higher than in almost any other state. Winters are long, dark and cold. Population growth is steady, but not spectacular.
The economy rises and falls on the price of oil, although tourism and fishing are fast-growing industries. The dividend check has become so entrenched that most people see it as simply a right of residency. When the checks are sent out on Wednesday -- most of them deposited directly into bank accounts -- it will be the largest single transfer of wealth of any day in Alaska.
Jack Roberts and Nathan Hocker, fishing in the twilight of an October evening, said they planned to use the money to go on vacation and to bring relatives up from "outside," as the Lower 48 -- the 48 contiguous states -- are sometimes called here.
Michelle Brosnan, divorced with two children, plans to pay some bills. "We give up a lot by living in Alaska," she said. "I don't count on the check. But when it comes, it's a windfall."
Ms. Brosnan does not think the bonus will last much longer, no matter how well the fund has done in the stock market. "The whole Alaskan economy is built on things that we can't sustain," she said. "Why should we think this is any different?"
Some merchants say it would be tough to make it through the year without the dividend check.
"We have a lot of people who come into the store, eyeballing some special gift, and then telling me they'll be back soon as the check lands," said Eric Berwald, who owns North Star Gifts in Palmer.
"People come up in the summer and say, 'You mean they actually pay you to live here?' he continued. "Yeah, they do. But come back in December and you'll see why."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: POLITICAL MEMO;
On Volatile Social and Cultural Issues, Silence

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
The contours of the final weeks of the Presidential campaign seemed clear when this race began a year ago: The Republican candidate would use divisive social issues -- chiefly, affirmative action, immigration and welfare -- to drive President Clinton to the left and ultimately off the edge of the electoral map.
But for all of the hopes Republicans once attached to these three subjects that served them so well in the 1994 Congressional and gubernatorial elections, they have essentially vanished from sight as Bob Dole moves into the last weeks of his Presidential campaign. So have the less prominent but equally volatile social issues of abortion and homosexuals in the military. 
 They did not come up in the course of 90 minutes of debate between Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton on Sunday evening. None are featured in Mr. Dole's television advertisements, and they are rarely, if ever, mentioned in his speeches these days. Nor are there plans, at least for now, Mr. Dole's aides said today, to invoke them in speeches or advertisements in the weeks ahead.
Indeed, Mr. Dole's electoral strategy has become notable as much for what it is not, as for what it is. It is principally about his economic plan to cut taxes 15 percent and, if today's remarks in New Jersey were any indication, sharp attacks on Mr. Clinton's ethics and character. It is not about the kind of issues that Republican strategists and candidates once calculated would bring down a sitting President.
"The whole medley of social and cultural issues utterly disappeared Sunday night," William Kristol, the editor of a conservative publication, The Weekly Standard, said today. "And what's ironic are that those are the issues on which you could make a real case that Clinton is a liberal -- and stayed to the left."
That Mr. Dole has not been able to turn these issues to his advantage is a comment on Mr. Clinton's success in defusing them by embracing them, with welfare being the most obvious example.
But it also suggests just how much Mr. Dole's fellow Republicans in the House let the air out of his tires by compromising with Mr. Clinton on matters like immigration restrictions, before adjourning for their own campaigns.
The campaign's public statements to the contrary, it suggests that Mr. Dole may well have given up on California, a state where tough stands on immigration and affirmative action have proved to be electoral winners, as Gov. Pete Wilson demonstrated in his come-from-behind victory in 1994. And it shows the price that Mr. Dole is paying for aligning himself with two Republicans whose views on social issues are often close to the center of the Republican Party (and, some conservatives might argue, to those of Mr. Dole himself): Jack Kemp, his running-mate, and Gen. Colin L. Powell, who will travel with Mr. Dole again on Thursday in Ohio.
Mr. Kemp and Mr. Powell have been among the party's defenders of the kind of affirmative action programs that Mr. Dole had introduced legislation to abolish as he prepared to run for President. At the time, he was contemplating a field of Republican Presidential hopefuls including Governor Wilson, who endorsed similar moves in California.
For many conservatives, Mr. Dole's performance on Sunday resurrected long-standing concerns about whether Mr. Dole is indeed the true conservative he declared himself to be this past winter as he sought the party's nomination from a generally conservative primary electorate. His choice of subjects on Sunday, and on the campaign trail beforehand, only seemed to confirm their greatest fear -- that he had cast aside social issues, even Mr. Clinton's veto of legislation that bans some forms of late-term abortions.
"That's an issue that strikes home with an awful lot of people," said Lyn Nofziger, a former aide to President Ronald Reagan, who was among those surprised that Mr. Dole never raised it in the Presidential debate. (He mentions it only intermittently while campaigning.)
Why this has happened is the subject of discussion among conservatives, who are beginning to raise questions with which Mr. Dole and his campaign strategists will have to deal with should he not win this election after failing to heed the conservatives' advice. On the morning after the debate, several conservatives sent memorandums to the campaign, asking why Mr. Dole insisted on relying so heavily on economic arguments when the public perception of the economy was so cheery.
"I think the tax cut and the fiscal message is a winning message -- but only if it's complemented with a morals and values message," said Ralph Reed, the executive director of the Christian Coalition. He said Mr. Dole needed "to take some of the cultural wedge issues and use them as a magnet to draw traditional voters."
Part of what is going on is the result of a struggle in Mr. Dole's campaign, among those who believe that his tax cut plan will win out in the end. But Mr. Reed was among several suggesting that the number of people who will switch their vote in this economy is, in truth, minimal.
To a limited extent, Mr. Dole's inability to use these issues reflects forces beyond his control. Mr. Dole, in his announcement speech, said affirmative action was "another Federal policy out of control," and his aides welcomed an anti-affirmative action referendum initiative in California as a way to sharpen their differences with Mr. Clinton.
Since then, Mr. Dole has avoided advertising that position, in part because opposition to affirmative action worries the very constituency with which he most needs to improve his standing: women.
"Quite frankly there are concerns about fostering a debate in a broad sense on an issue that can be divisive," Mr. Dole's communications director, John Buckley, said today.
It is that cautiousness that has bothered Mr. Dole's conservative critics from the start. "The problem is that Dole is spooked on these social and cultural issues," Mr. Kristol said. "He is not comfortable making the case about them. But these are in fact that issues that accounted for the Republican victory in 1994."
