HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
Of Ballistic Outerwear And Other Protections

BYLINE: By Nancy Marx Better

 BODY:
Several months ago, an executive of a New York commercial bank began receiving telephone threats -- at home and at work -- from a disgruntled former employee. He called in Stephen D'Andrilli, president of the Guardian Group International in New York, a security company, which tapped the executive's phone and hired a bodyguard. Soon, the threats subsided.
"This is getting to be a more and more serious problem," said Mr. D'Andrilli, who would not identify the executive. "You have people who feel they have given a lot to a company and they become extremely angry when they are let go." 
 William McCarthy, a former head of the New York City Police Department's bomb squad, agrees. "If you lay people off, they may resort to violence to gain revenge," said Mr. McCarthy, now president of Threat Research Inc., a New York security management company. And former employees have the advantage of familiarity with a building's entrances, exits and general layout -- and staff routines, too.
In fact, spurred by such recent events as the Persian Gulf War and the growth of business opportunities in an unstable Eastern Europe -- as well as the American recession -- executives are increasingly looking for the expertise of the security industry.
The Security Industry Association, a Washington-based group representing companies that sell and service security equipment, reports total 1990 revenues of its members at $9.7 billion, up from $8.8 billion in 1989.
In addition to buying hardware -- ranging from computerized locks to electronic surveillance systems -- executives are rethinking their daily office routines and preparing for emergencies.
"Companies are focusing more on protecting their people, instead of their property," said Bill Zalud, editor of Security magazine, based in Des Plaines, Ill. "There's been an explosion of conferences," no pun intended, added Mr. Zalud, who estimates that the number of conferences natiowide has doubled since 1986, to nearly 500.
Indeed, Mr. McCarthy took to the podium at New York City's Javits Center recently to discuss "Bombs: A Growing Risk to Corporate America" at the annual International Security Conference and Exposition. His audience was composed primarily of executives responsible for their companies' safekeeping. Formerly known as security managers or facilities managers, they now bear loftier titles to reflect their enhanced status. "Corporate vice president for asset protection" is a current favorite.
While most bomb threats are false alarms -- for every contraption that actually explodes, the Federal Bureau of Investigation counts 50 phony alarms -- the number of real incidents is on the rise. In 1990, there were 1,300 bombings in the United States, up from 870 in 1983. A steady 20 percent or so of the targets are commercial buildings, according to statistics from Threat Research.
Among other things, Mr. McCarthy told his audience to analyze packages carefully -- grease stains can indicate a leak from explosives; a mass of stamps instead of metered postage can mean the sender didn't want the package weighed and checked at a post office. "If you think somebody has sent you a bomb, there are four rules to follow," he said: "Don't touch it, don't move it, don't wet it, don't open it." Call security people at the company or the police.
Bombs aside, there are the risks of kidnapping and extortion, rare in this country, but not so rare overseas. "When a top executive travels, you have to make sure everything is protected -- the planes, the cars, the hotels," said Mr. D'Andrilli of the Guardian Group. "Ideally, you go through his itinerary, and check each destination out."
Eastern Europe, while hardly as threatening an environment as, say, the Middle East, is not at all like London or Paris. "There isn't an effective internal response system yet for Westerners who encounter security difficulties," said John Horn, a managing director at Kroll Associates, a New York security consulting firm.
Some executives seem to be taking extreme measures. Hugh Downe Jr., president of American Body Armor and Equipment, a Fernandina Beach, Fla., maker of bulletproof clothing, reports brisk sales of a $500 "executive vest," which can be custom-produced in various fabrics. The company also sells ballistic outerwear, such as the $1,000 London Fog raincoat lined with Kevlar -- a bulletproof fiber developed by DuPont -- that Mayor David Dinkins bought last year.
While most executives don't require such gear, there are instances where it may come in handy. In 1985, the chairman of Deak Perera, the New York foreign exchange firm, was fatally shot at his desk by an irate customer. In 1990, the head of Germany's Deutschebank was assassinated near his office. This summer, two gunmen from an ultranationalist Japanese organization took a Nomura manager hostage in Tokyo.
"Shootings aren't common in offices, but they do happen," Mr. Downe said. He won't reveal the names of any customers who purchased the "executive vest" -- for security reasons, of course -- but describes them as "high-profile" types: "They're the kind of people whose fear of violence is heightened when the international situation is unstable."
Back home, there is also the growing market for supplying countermeasures when community activists, outraged by a company's social or environmental policies, start in with bomb threats. "These people aren't really going to blow up your offices," Mr. McCarthy said. "But they are going to wreak havoc, by making hundreds of people evacuate the premises. By the time they get back to their desks, they're ready to pack it in and call it a day."

HEADLINE: FORUM;
'Insider' -- an International Positive

BYLINE: By JUDITH N. SHAPIRO; Judith N. Shapiro is manager of government issues at the General Electric Company.

 BODY:
The stock market scandals in the United States and Japan have given a bad name to insiders, but in most countries being an insider is still the only way to do business. Companies that fail to establish themselves as "home players" in the foreign markets they want to penetrate never succeed there.
Now, the unprecedented movement toward open markets in Europe -- both East and West -- as well as in Asia and Latin America, is creating a rare opportunity for American companies to become insiders in countries where they once were disadvantaged. As nations from Mexico to Hungary, Germany to Japan, try to remove trade barriers and create more equal conditions for competition, smart American companies -- big and small, in any number of industries -- can finally challenge long-entrenched domestic companies in their own markets. 
 To do so, Americans should first make sure they know the foreign market from the inside out, positioning themselves to take immediate advantage of any political changes that could affect trade or the way business is conducted. It will not do you any good if trade barriers are removed and a competitor beats you into the market with a better product. The longer the foreign market has been closed, the more likely it is that companies are working with dated, incomplete or incorrect information. Insist on good information, preferably from in-country experts.
With this in hand, work to influence change from the inside out, aligning yourself with those in the country who seek economic and political freedom. The process of change is always messy and never risk-free. But the aternative -- alignment with a crumbling status quo -- is ruinous.
By aligning yourself with the forces of change, you stand the best chance to reap the benefits of that change. Companies outside the establishment in their home markets have a shared interest with you in changing the rules of the game. It may seem counterintuitive to build insider status by aligning with outsiders. But such unconventional business alliances make good sense when the status quo is under attack and the influence of established competitors is being challenged by economic and political reforms aimed at making markets more competitive. You can position yourself to become part of the new insider networks as internal lines of power and influence are redrawn.
Influencing change from the inside out is best done in tandem with efforts to lobby Washington -- directly, or through trade associations or industry advisory groups -- to remove barriers to trade.
Your company should also participate as a "home player" in policy debates in the countries where you want to do business. American-style lobbying is usually inappropriate, but foreign governments are increasingly in need of technical advice to execute economic reforms and have begun to establish private-sector advisory groups for that purpose.
Building insider status takes time and effort. Savvy companies used to work within the status quo overseas, arranging special deals and using trade barriers to their own advantage. No more. Savvy companies are the ones aligned with the forces of reform -- the ones turning themselves into the new insiders.

HEADLINE: Egypt Wants Powerful Central Bank

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Sept. 13

 BODY:
The Egyptian Government, confronting the second big scandal in the nation's financial industry in less than three years, is planning to give its central bank sweeping new powers to regulate the industry for the first time in two decades.
Egyptian officials described the new regulations, which will be put before Parliament in a few weeks, as an effort to build up the capital base of the country's banks and monitor their activities. 
 The move to tighten Government control comes in the wake of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandal. The Egyptian branch of the bank, Bank of Credit and Commerce Egypt, has about $400 million invested in B.C.C.I. It is unclear how many other Egyptian banks invested money in B.C.C.I. or how much.
Many bankers say regulation has been long overdue in Eqypt.
"The Goverment had to do something to restore the trust in the banking sector," said Hamed al-Sayeh, a former Minister of Economy.
 
Deep-Seated Banking Problems
 The country's banking sector was teetering on the edge of ruin until earlier this year when half of the country's foreign debt, about $25 billion, was canceled and the remaining payments rescheduled by international lending agencies. The move was made to reward Egypt for its support during the Persian Gulf war. The United States also forgave $7 billion in Egypt's military debts.
But the causes of the problems are deep seated. State banks have often been unable to retrieve loans made to the public sector. Meanwhile, private banks, whose cash flow has often depended on remittances from Egyptians working in gulf nations, are frequently manned by poorly trained personnel who at times engage in questionable financial practices, according to bankers here.
The Government had to inject $600 million into four state-owned banks earlier this year to shore them up and is now trying to cope with the collapse of several investment houses in the last three years. The investment houses, little more than pyramid schemes, wiped out more than $500 million in savings by thousands of Egyptians, many of them of modest means.
 
'Egypt's Last Chance'
 Medhat Bakri, an economist, said of the current predicament, "There is no doubt now that this is Egypt's last chance, and if we let it slip through our hands it will wreak economic ruin for generations to come."
The new regulations, part of the financial reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund, would allow the central bank to veto the appointment of banking executives or official auditors. The central bank would be authorized to force banks that appear to be short of cash to increase their capital base or face liquidation or merger. All banks would have to meet a capital-to-assets ratio for the first time.
 
A Run on the B.C.C.I. Branch
 The law would prohibit banks from lending more than a quarter of their assets to any one client or to own more than a quarter of the shares of any company.
The industry will have five years to meet these stipulations.
The central bank would also act as a general shareholder of the four leading state-run banks, the National Bank of Egypt, Banque du Caire, the Bank of Alexandria and Banque Misr, which together account for about 60 percent of the country's banking activity.
The latest jolt to the banking industry came in July, when Egyptian investors made a run on the B.C.C.I. branch after the scandal enveloped the parent company. The investors withdrew dollars and Eqyptian pounds worth a combined total of $29.4 million.
Subsequently, withdrawals were limited to $1,000 and 3,000 Egyptian pounds (about $900) for each depositor.
The Egyptian branch, 49 percent of which is controlled by B.C.C.I. and the remainder by individual Egyptian investors, has been taken over by a Government administrator and will change its name.
The country's remaining banks, all state-owned or jointly run enterprises, will place five-tenths of 1 percent of their dollar and Egyptian pound holdings with the B.C.C.I. branch to stave off collapse.
 
Prelude to Deposit Insurance
 The stop-gap measure to save the B.C.C.I. branch bank is the prelude, Egyptian officials say, to the country's first deposit-insurance program.
Banks will be required under the law to contribute one-quarter of 1 percent of their holdings to a fund, managed by the central bank, to bail out any other banks that go under in the future.
"One of the positive effects of the B.C.C.I. affair in Egypt is the introduction of, hopefully, a deposit insurance," said Keith Holt, the chief executive of the joint-venture Hong Kong Egyptian Bank. "The other effect, hopefully, will be a strengthening of the monitoring and regulatory role by the authorities."

HEADLINE: Auditing The Auditors -- A special Report.;
How B.C.C.I.'s Accounts Won Stamp of Approval

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
In the spring of 1990, relations between the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and its auditor were badly strained. In a confidential report to the directors of the troubled bank on April 18, 1990, Price Waterhouse expressed its mounting concern about several matters of the "utmost urgency." They included a pile of troubled loans to customers, suspect lending to shareholders and transactions that Price Waterhouse said were "either false or deceitful."
Price Waterhouse told the directors that it had tried to identify all the fraudulent transactions. But, the auditor added, "It is impossible, without an exhaustive inquiry, to know whether this has been achieved." 
 Yet less than two weeks later, on April 30, 1990, Price Waterhouse signed B.C.C.I.'s annual report for 1989, attesting that the accounts gave a "fair and true view of the financial position of the group." The annual report made no mention of false or deceitful transactions or the auditor's other worries.
 
New Light on Role
 Public records, some previously undisclosed documents and interviews with key figures and experts in international banking shed critical new light on the role of Price Waterhouse in the B.C.C.I. case. The accounting firm was eventally instructed by the Bank of England to investigate the shady bank, and its report in June prompted the decision by regulators on July 5 to seize B.C.C.I.
The regulators assert the bank had conducted fraud on a multibillion-dollar scale, using phony loans, phantom deposits and false accounting, starting more than a decade ago. In the United States, based on investigations by Government prosecutors and the Federal Reserve, the bank has been charged with laundering the illicit funds of international drug barons and accused of secretly purchasing American banks.
The documents and interviews show that in its years as B.C.C.I.'s auditor, Price Waterhouse among other things failed to check on the absence of payments on loans that were part of the fraud and missed an opportunity in 1986 to uncover huge losses on trading in financial futures and options that the bank was hiding. When Price Waterhouse became the bank's sole auditor in 1987, it received an unusual warning about the weakness in the bank's management and financial controls from another accounting firm.
The decision by Price Waterhouse to give unqualified approval to the bank's last public annual report -- despite the clear signs of trouble -- has come under scrutiny by Government investigators, lawyers representing depositors and accounting experts.
Price Waterhouse insists that it acted properly and points out that the British Government has praised the firm for the work it did.
But Robin Munro-Davies, managing director of IBCA Ltd., a bank-rating agency based in London, commented: "At the outset, I figured that Price Waterhouse was grossly misled and was not derelict itself. But I'm less and less convinced of that now."
Ian Brindle, senior partner of Price Waterhouse in London, declined to be interviewed for this article. But on the matter of declaring the annual report "fair and true," he told The Financial Times in July, "You simply can't go around qualifying the accounts of a bank without creating all sorts of problems, without the whole thing collapsing." In accounting terms, "qualifying" the bank's accounts would have meant spelling out the auditor's findings and its concerns. Better, Price Waterhouse figured, to work quietly with the regulators to try to repair the damage and avoid the risk of scaring depositors into pulling their money out.
Price Waterhouse in the United States, for its part, says its London office did most of the work on the B.C.C.I. audit and signed its financial statements. Price Waterhouse worldwide, it explains, is a network of 26 separate but related firms. Shaun F. O'Malley, the senior partner in the United States, said in a statement that the firm's London office "has assured us that the work of Price Waterhouse professionals was in accordance with applicable professional standards."
 
Suits Against Waterhouse
 Lawsuits by depositors' charging Price Waterhouse with gross negligence have been filed in Britain, and more are expected. A Senate subcommittee plans to call Price Waterhouse to testify at hearings to explain its role.
"It's obvious that people who relied on Price Waterhouse-approved audits were misled," said Jonathan Winer, an investigator for the Senate subcommittee on terrorism, narcotics and international operations.
Though Price Waterhouse defends its stance, accounting experts contend that the auditor's decision to approve B.C.C.I.'s financial statements while it was uncertain about the magnitude of the fraud was a serious and damaging error in judgment.
"An auditor should not approve the accounts without knowing the extent of the fraud," said Lee J. Seidler, an accounting expert and a special associate director of Bear, Stearns & Company. "But Price Waterhouse appears to have signed a set of accounts without knowing how deep the hole was."
 
The Task
Accounting Firm Faces a Challenge
 The task of trying to audit B.C.C.I. was a formidable challenge. The sprawling private bank had assets of $20 billion and offices in 69 countries. It was chartered in one tax-and-regulatory haven, Luxembourg, and had vital operations in another, the Cayman Islands. Moreover, clues to much of the fraud were in 6,000 secret files kept by the former chief executive, Swaleh Naqvi, who has been indicted in the United States on fraud and money-laundering charges and is being held in Abu Dhabi.
According to standard auditing doctrine, the main responsibility for detecting fraud rests with the management of a company or bank. The auditor's responsibility is to conduct its work so that it has a "reasonable expectation" of detecting sizable misstatements in a company's financial accounts.
In March, Price Waterhouse was told by the Bank of England to plumb the depths of the B.C.C.I. fraud. Under English law, the British central bank, which has supervisors but no American-style examiners, can delegate a bank's reporting accountant to conduct investigations, though it rarely does so.
 
Report Prompted Closing
 The resulting Price Waterhouse report on June 22, 1991, describing "an enormous and complex web of fictitious transactions" prompted the closing of B.C.C.I. less than two weeks later. Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, told a parliamentary committee that Price Waterhouse worked "promptly and effectively throughout the whole of this matter."
Still, the auditor's critics say that over the years it too readily accepted the assurances of the B.C.C.I. management and moved too slowly in addressing problems within the bank.
Some critics suggest Price Waterhouse was reluctant to antagonize a lucrative client that one former bank executive said paid audit fees of more than $3 million a year. But accounting experts reply that a $3 million fee would not have been high for a bank with the sprawl and complexity of B.C.C.I. The real issue, these experts say, may have been whether the fees were enough for Price Waterhouse to make a profit without cutting corners on such a difficult audit.
 
A Warning
Large Losses Are Discovered

When Price Waterhouse became the sole auditor in 1987, it was aware of the difficulties of handling B.C.C.I. For more than a decade, it had audited B.C.C.I. Overseas in the Caymans, where confidential customer accounts with scant record-keeping were the norm. The Price Waterhouse office in the Caymans was the auditor for an even more secretive affiliate, the International Credit and Investment Company Overseas, which a Federal Reserve report termed the alter ego of the bank. Before 1987, Ernst & Whinney had audited BCCI Holdings S.A., the Luxembourg parent company for the group.
In 1986, Ernst & Whinney formally expressed its concern to the management of B.C.C.I. after it was discovered that the bank's London treasury operation had incurred large losses in trading financial futures and options. The treasury was run from London but most transactions were recorded in the Caymans, where Price Waterhouse handled the audit work.
In a letter dated May 29, 1986, Ernst & Whinney wrote to the bank's founder and president, Aga Hassan Abedi, stressing the need for "marked improvement" in management controls and expressing its concern that because the auditing duties were split between two firms Ernst & Whinney was kept at a distance from crucial documents, according to a former B.C.C.I. executive who has a copy of the letter.
 
Asked for Sole Role
 Ernst & Whinney said it would be inappropriate to withdraw for 1986 but declared that it would not be an auditor for 1987 unless B.C.C.I. agreed to make it the sole auditor and to strengthen its management.
By the following spring, little had changed. On April 13, 1987, Ernst & Whinney, as it was finishing its review of the bank's 1986 financial statements, wrote to Mr. Naqvi, the bank's chief executive. It reiterated the need for a stronger management team, improved financial controls and the oversight of a single auditor.
"The problem will not be eased by further delay," the letter stated, according to the former bank official. About a week later, the B.C.C.I. board met and appointed Price Waterhouse as its sole auditor. Shortly afterward Ernst & Whinney passed the two letters to Price Waterhouse.
Another former bank executive, Masihur Rahman, who has cooperated with American investigators, says Price Waterhouse was selected because Mr. Abedi and Mr. Naqvi did not want Ernst & Whinney prying into the files in the Caymans. "Price Waterhouse took a soft and gentle approach, and they did not want to upset that," Mr. Rahman said.
Price Waterhouse says it cannot give a detailed account of its handling of the B.C.C.I. audit, citing client confidentiality. Sue Hurley, the firm's spokeswoman in London, vigorously denied Mr. Rahman's view that Price Waterhouse was lax in reviewing the bank's Cayman accounts. "He has misrepresented the facts," Ms. Hurley said.
 
An Inquiry
A Closer Look By Luxembourg

When the losses from the London treasury operations became apparent in late 1985, the Luxembourg regulators demanded a review of the problem. B.C.C.I. management asked Price Waterhouse in the Caymans to handle the review, which in turn requested assistance from the firm's London office. The inquiry found that significant losses had gone unrecorded and said this was a result of incompetence, not fraud.
But in its June 1991 report to the Bank of England that led to the closing of B.C.C.I., Price Waterhouse stated, "With the benefit of hindsight, it appears more sinister in that it now seems to have been a deliberate way to fictitiously inflate income." The firm did not examine the accounting for previous years because losses were not apparent from the accounts. "Again, with hindsight," the June report added, "we now know that such losses were being concealed." From 1977 through 1985, the total of losses and fictitious profits from the treasury operations was estimated at nearly $1 billion.
"Price Waterhouse seems to have accepted at face value the numbers from the previous years even though they found improper accounting for 1985," said Clive Russell, deputy senior partner of Halpern & Woolf, a London accountant representing depositors.
By early 1990, it was apparent to the auditors and regulators that B.C.C.I. had severe financial problems. A task force of four bank executives, headed by Mr. Rahman, was to review B.C.C.I.'s problem loans. It worked with Price Waterhouse on the inquiry, which graphically portrayed how scant was the reporting and documentation on large loans and how little checking had been done by the management or auditors.
 
Loan Is an Example
 A $150 million loan to Abdul Raouf Khalil, a wealthy Saudi Arabian businessman, is a striking example. Mr. Khalil was one of the front men used by B.C.C.I. to buy control secretly of First American Bankshares in Washington and the National Bank of Georgia, in violation of American banking laws. The task force report states, "The review of this loan makes really sorry reading, and the task force feels that P. W. should have sought better clarification and documentary proofs in earlier years."
A briefing paper for the task force, supplied by Price Waterhouse on March 14, 1990, stated that nothing had been paid on five years of interest and principal, an amount totaling at least $45 million, and that the bank had had no contact with Mr. Khalil during that period. Investigators charge that front men like Mr. Khalil were given money, disguised as loans, to buy First American on behalf of B.C.C.I.
Asked about the Khalil loan, Price Waterhouse officials declined to comment specifically, but noted that most international banks have "hold mail" accounts, in which statements are not mailed to an account holder with a penchant for privacy, and auditors rely on the assurances of management.
Yet a banking expert at a leading American accounting firm says that hold-mail accounts tend to be treated with skepticism by auditors and that efforts should be made to push for some evidence of periodic contact with the account holder, like having him sign statements when he comes into the bank in person to handle a transaction. Besides, the accountant added, hold-mail accounts are typically deposit accounts, not huge loan customers like Mr. Khalil.
 
The Questions
An Increasing Number of Critics

Price Waterhouse has two explanations for its decision to approve B.C.C.I.'s yearly financial statements as "true and fair" in April 1990. First, the firm points to a note to the 1989 annual report saying that the Government of Abu Dhabi took a 77 percent stake in the bank and pledged to "maintain the group's capital base while the reorganization and restructuring necessary for its continuing development is undertaken." That note, Price Waterhouse says, was a warning that the bank had serious problems.
The second explanation is that Price Waterhouse did not want to spell out the bank's problems and the auditor's worries in the annual report because it feared that might provoke a run by depositors.
"They knew they were dealing with a can of worms, and they fudged the issue," said Hugh Aldous, senior partner of Robson Rhodes, a London accounting firm. "By defining their responsibilities narrowly, Price Waterhouse let the whole problem go on longer and probably with greater damage than would have been the case otherwise."
The Government of Abu Dhabi and its ruler, Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahayan, apparently came to share that view. On Dec. 24, 1990, an internal committee was formed to pursue the bank's troubles. Abu Dhabi's Government insisted that a second accounting firm be added, and it hired Ernst & Young (formed in 1989, when Ernst & Whinney merged with Arthur Young). "By then, the Abu Dhabi shareholders clearly wanted an independent perspective," said Caffey Norman, a partner of Patton, Boggs & Blow, a Washington law firm representing the Abu Dhabi interests.
 
Loss of Life Savings
 Mohammed Khasruzzaman, an Omani businessman, deposited $300,000 with B.C.C.I. in London on Aug. 7, 1990, just after Iraq invaded Kuwait, and another $300,000 on Jan. 17, 1991, after the start of the gulf war. Mr. Khasruzzaman said he was concerned about keeping his life savings in Oman at a time of great turmoil in the gulf, and B.C.C.I. had branches in both Oman and London.
Before depositing his funds with B.C.C.I., he says he asked to see a copy of the bank's most recent annual report, for 1989, and took comfort from the unqualified opinion from Price Waterhouse. Last month, the 36-year-old Omani and his wife sued Price Waterhouse for negligence in London. "It's clear that the auditors knew about the fraud when they signed the B.C.C.I. accounts," Mr. Khasruzzaman said. "And that was not clearly spelled out in the annual report. I lost my life's savings."

HEADLINE: Compaq to Show Computers

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Sept. 15

 BODY:
The Compaq Computer Corporation plans to introduce four computers on Monday with several parts that can be replaced when more advanced versions of those parts are produced.
Three new machines that use Intel's more powerful 80486 computer chip are priced from $3,199 to $7,199, offering a wide range of speed and memory. Three versions of the fourth machine, which has an 80386 chip, are priced below $4,000. 
 The company will also announce price reductions of $1,000 on three models using the Intel Corporation's 80386 microprocessor, bringing the retail price on Compaq's basic 386 machine below $3,000 for the first time.
The moves are Compaq's response to inroads made earlier this year by Dell Computer, AST Research and other lower-priced rivals whose machine designs permit customers to plug in more powerful microprocessors when faster versions are produced.
At a news conference scheduled for Monday in New York, Compaq will display replaceable design features for video; memory; input-output, or how information enters and leaves the machne; the internal data links of the computer, known as bus wiring, and for the Intel microprocessors.
The four new machines are in production and their sales have been booked for the third quarter, which ends in two weeks. Lorie Strong, Compaq's vice president for product marketing, said the company had demonstrated the machines to about 70 large buyers, including companies that had bought other brands.
"We went to accounts where the new machines might cannibalize somebody else's sales," she said. "That was part of the criteria."
 
Scrambling for Momentum
 Compaq is scrambling to generate sales momentum. Revenues at the Houston-based company have been virtually flat this year, a casualty of stiff competition, recession and troubles in its distribution channels. On May 15, its stock price fell 27 percent, to $36, on gloomy profit news. The stock closed Friday at $33.875, off 50 cents.
Ms. Strong said the new machines would make Compaq more competitive in the $2,500 to $3,500 price range, where sales for desktop machines have been strongest this year.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Is Surging Again After a Period of Difficulties

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CARACAS

 BODY:
After a hiccup caused by low oil prices and a shift to free-market policies, Venezuela has reclaimed its position as the nation in the Americas with the highest economic growth rates.
The gross national product, which grew 5 percent in 1990, expanded by an annualized rate of 10 percent during the first half of this year, according to figures released here in late August. 
 Memories are now fading of 1989, the rough first year of President Carlos Andres Perez. That year, the economy shrank by 8 percent and a reduction of food and gas subsidies set off riots that killed 300 people.
"We are back to the fastest-growing economy in the region," said Andres Sosa Pietri, president of Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A., the national oil company. "We lagged in the '80s, but now we are back on our feet."
Michael Skol, the United States Ambassador here, predicted, "Venezuela is likely to have a sustained economic boom in the 1990's, with growth rates higher than Chile's."
Although annual inflation continues to hover around 37 percent, optimism is growing. American, European and Venezuelan companies are embarking on multibillion-dollar "megaprojects" involving Venezuela's highly profitable oil and minerals.
And President Perez's determined commitment to free-market policies appears to be bearing fruit, as trade tariffs drop, investment rules ease and the Government starts to sell money-losing state companies to investors.
In early August, the Government accepted a $145 million bid by a consortium led by Iberia, the Spanish airline, to buy a 60 percent stake in the state-owned international airline, Viasa. In October, private companies are to bid for the state telephone company, whose inefficiency has long hampered the economy.
During a visit to New York and Washington scheduled for late September, Mr. Perez plans to discuss with United States officials a timetable for establishing a free-trade agreement. Since taking office in February 1989, Mr. Perez has reduced import tariffs to 10 percent, on average, from 34 percent. In April, Venezuela signed a framework agreement with the United States for trade and investment liberalization.
Leading a Congressional delegation to Caracas in late August, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, said Mr. Perez had shown "great leadership in opening markets and in helping to develop trade between our two great countries."
 
A 'Safe Source' of Oil
 Accounting for about half the growth forecast through 1996 is a five-year, $48 billion expansion program by the national oil company.
Venezuela ships two-thirds of its daily exports of 1.9 million barrels to the United States. With oil production plummeting in the Soviet Union and political uncertainty gripping the Middle East, Venezuela likes to portray itself as a "safe source." To meet growing demand from the United States, the oil company plans to increase production capacity by 20 percent, to 3.5 million barrels a day, by 1996.
Foreign companies are entering new areas of the petroelum industry. In November, about 20 American and foreign companies are expected to submit bids to reactivate marginal fields that have been abandoned in eastern Venezuela. Total predicted production of these fields is expected to be 150,000 barrels a day.
 
Natural Gas Project
 In another project, Government approval is expected later this year for a $3 billion natural gas processing plant to be built with multinational control. Called Cristobal Colon, the project involves Mitsubishi, Shell Oil and Exxon.
"It will be the first time since the nationalization of the oil industry in 1975 that foreigners will have majority equities," said Mr. Skol, the American Ambassador.
The national oil company is also negotiating with American and European companies on multibillion-dollar joint ventures to exploit Venezuela's vast coal and bitumen reserves.
After the privatization of only three banks in two and a half years, efforts to sell state companies appear to have accelerated with the sale of Viasa in August. Fondo de Inversiones de Venezuela, a state agency charged with privatization, is accepting bids for a number of state companies -- a shipyard, a cement company, four hotels and several sugar mills.
But the most keenly awaited sale is that of the telephone company.
With half of Venezuela's demand for three million lines going unmet, it takes eight years to get a telephone installed. Some offices employ secretaries simply to dial and redial numbers. One United States company, Procter & Gamble, gave up and installed a $150,000 private microwave system after moving here in 1987, and other companies have shied away from Venezuela because of weak telecommunications.
"There are a lot of projects in tourism, trade and industry asking for services we can't offer," said Fernando Martinez Mottola, president of the phone company, Compania Anonima Nacional Telefonos de Venezuela.
 
Winning a $98 Million Bid
 In a first step to privatize telephone service, a consortium led by BellSouth Enterprises and Racal Telecom submitted a winning $98 million bid in May to provide 20 years of cellular telephone service.
In October, eight international consortiums are to bid on buying the phone company, which has 20,000 employees, a $600 million debt and enormous growth prospects.
According to the tender, the buyer will have to install an average of 300,000 lines a year over the next five years, and by the end of the 1990's, the wait for a new phone must be no more than a week.

HEADLINE: Israeli Loan Dispute Turns Ugly; Rightist Calls Bush 'Anti-Semite'

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Israel's bitter confrontation with the White House over United States loan guarantees turned nastier today when a Cabinet minister called President Bush an anti-Semite and a liar and the Government vowed that there would be no retreat on its request for American aid.
The Israeli Defense Minister, Moshe Arens, later repudiated the attack on Mr. Bush by his fellow Cabinet member, Rehavam Zeevi, a minister without portfolio from a far-right party. Mr. Arens said that Mr. Zeevi's remarks did not reflect the Government's view or Israeli public opinion. 
 Nonetheless, the vehemence of the language underlined the multilayered passions that have been set loose here by the dispute over the loan guarantees. Valued at $10 billion, the guarantees would be used by Israel to help resettle hundreds of thousands of new immigrants from the Soviet Union.
 
Baker's Visit Begins Monday
 It seems inevitable that the issue will be one of the first to be dealt with on Monday, when Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d arrives here to try to kick-start the faltering American initiative to arrange a Middle East peace conference for next month.
The main obstacle to peace talks has been the seemingly irreconcilable differences between Israel and Palestinian leaders over which Palestinians will be allowed to attend. But before he tries to bridge that gap, Mr. Baker must deal with a sudden rupture in United States-Israeli relations over the loan guarantees, a split that Abba Eban, one of Israel's elder statesmen, said today was the worst that he could remember in 40 years.
Senior officials said they hoped that Mr. Baker would offer a face-saving compromise that could accommodate Israel's desire for immediate aid and Mr. Bush's adamant position that allowing a debate on the guarantees now would undermine the peace process.
 
Israelis Reluctant to Wait
 Mr. Bush has insisted that Congress delay action on the Israeli request by 120 days, and has warned that he would use his veto to block any early decision on the matter. For their part, the Israelis say there is no point in waiting because Mr. Bush has given no sign that he would support the requested aid even after the 120 days.
Their fear is that the President would continue to use the guarantees as "a cudgel," in the words of one official, to keep pressing them on the subject that lies at the heart of the fight: Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's insistence on, and Mr. Bush's strong opposition to, expanded Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
But Mr. Shamir's advisers also fear a head-on collision with the United States, Israel's main ally and the source of $3 billion a year in regular economic and military aid. "The last thing we wanted was a confrontation with the Administration and, God forbid, with the President himself," one said.
 
U.S. Groups Urge Compromise
 Leaders of Jewish organizations in the United States are understood to have advised Mr. Shamir to accept a compromise, and a senior official here said that the Government was willing to do so. But the Prime Minister made it clear that the initiative would have to come from the Americans.
"We will not retreat -- we will stick by our position," officials quoted him as saying at a Cabinet meeting today.
But he also urged his ministers to "calm the atmosphere and watch our words" after Mr. Zeevi asserted at the meeting that Mr. Bush was an anti-Semite and a liar for supposedly misrepresenting Israel's stand on loan guarantees.
Mr. Zeevi is one of two members of Parliament from Moledet, a right-wing party that wants Palestinians out of the territories that Israel has occupied since 1967. His appointment this year as a minister without portfolio caused a political storm, with even some members of Mr. Shamir's Likud Party complaining about letting a person with such views join the Government.
Mr. Zeevi's attack on Mr. Bush was reported outside the closed session by one of his own aides, who said that the minister also accused the President of "cheap demagoguery." But, perhaps chastised by Mr. Shamir's appeal for milder language, Mr. Zeevi emerged from the meeting speaking in softer tones.
 
Raising Doubts on Bush's Role
 "I said he is very close to it, to being an anti-Semite and anti-Israel," he said. His remarks at the meeting were also reported on Israel state radio.
Mr. Arens, the Defense Minister, then appeared on the ABC News program "This Week," during which he repudiated Mr. Zeevi's remarks and said they did not "reflect major opinion within the Israeli Government, or for that matter within Israel itself."
Although Mr. Zeevi's opinions may be extreme, he is not alone here in raising doubts about Mr. Bush's commitment to Israel's welfare and his ability to serve as a fair mediator at peace talks. "A lot of insecurities come to the surface here when they feel cornered," said Harry Wall, the representative in Israel of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
Mr. Shamir insists that Israel is still ready to go to the conference. But he also has warned repeatedly that by raising the issue of loan guarantees when Arab nations themselves had not done so in agreeing to peace talks, Mr. Bush has made it likely that the Arabs will toughen their demands.
A political analyst close to the Government said the Israelis might simply decide to abandon their aid request for now rather than have it "held hostage" by the Bush Administration.
 
Leftists Fault Government
 Beyond the immediate friction between Washington and Jerusalem, the dispute has unleashed other emotions.
On the political right, Parliament members who have been opposed to peace talks all along say the confrontation would justify a decision by Israel to pull out of the process entirely. On the left, politicians and press commentators say that Mr. Shamir and his Housing Minister, Ariel Sharon, brought about the crisis through a deliberately provocative policy of settlement-building.
"The friendship of the United States was one of our greatest assets during the 43 years of Israel's existence," a dozen left-leaning members of Parliament said in an open letter to Mr. Shamir that is to appear in newspapers on Monday. "Through your militant fanaticism, you may negate this asset and turn the friendly attitude of the United States to one of hostility."
"It is certainly clear," they said, "that the peace process and settlement process are opposites."
To some extent, the feelings that have been stirred also touch on Jewish consciousness.
 
Blaming American Lobbyists
 Yossi Sarid, a member of Parliament from the leftist Citizens Rights Movement, attacked American Jewish groups the other day for their campaign on behalf of the loan guarantees, an effort that Mr. Bush caustically criticized when he threatened to veto Congressional action. The lobbying effort, Mr. Sarid said, was a "vulgar mistake" that could increase anti-Israel and anti-Jewish feelings in the United States.
But Mr. Shamir sees American Jews in a different light, and has invoked memories of Nazi horrors in pressing for a strong pro-Israel campaign in Washington. American Jews "did nothing" to save European Jews from mass murder during World War II, he was quoted as telling a group of supporters in Paris on Friday.
"This hangs very heavily on their consciences," he said. "Because of this, they are now very active."

HEADLINE: The U.S.-Soviet Agenda;
Moscow's Economic Struggle Is Paramount, As Baker's Week of Talks Makes Evident

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALMA-ATA, U.S.S.R., Sept. 15

 BODY:
When he was meeting in Moscow with the new K.G.B. chief, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d asked for a small favor.
Would the K.G.B., Mr. Baker asked, please help the leaders of the new Soviet economic council locate and total up all Soviet gold reserves so they could prepare an economic reform plan that the West could seriously respond to? 
 The fact that Mr. Baker was meeting with the K.G.B. boss in his office was a bizarre enough symbol of the way in which the August revolution has transformed the American-Soviet agenda. But that one of his priorities was to enlist the K.G.B. in the economic reform was even more telling.
The old agenda of American-Soviet relations was dominated by arms control and regional conflicts. Mr. Baker has spent a week here working on establishing the new agenda. He has talked with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the change-minded Mayors of St. Petersburg and Moscow, prominent intellectuals, and the leaders of all the republics, including President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan here in the Kazakh capital. And the talks have made it clear that the new agenda reads like this: Economics, economics and then more economics.
 
Quick Successes Needed
 It is not simply because the arms control slate was pretty well swept clean last year with the conventional and strategic arms treaties or because Mr. Gorbachev has been ready to throw overboard any regional conflict -- Afghanistan, Cuba, the Baltic republics and the Kurile Islands -- that might block Western economic aid.
Rather, it is because American officials are convinced that unless the Soviet economy can be improved soon all the positive changes of the past month will not be sustainable and the Soviet Union could easily revert to a boiling pot of ethnic violence, nationalist competition and reactionary lapses.
Baker aides said the overwhelming impression after the week of talks in the Soviet Union was not how radically things had changed but how much needed to be done to make those changes permanent. American officials concluded that Soviet leaders need time to prove that reform pays, but to buy time, they need some quick, concrete successes.
As a result, while the Bush Administration always felt it had a certain stake in Mr. Gorbachev's continued hold on power, American officials feel that much more intensely about the hard-core supporters of change who have moved to the top since the failed coup last month.
"The key thing that has to inform what we do is the fact that we have an enormous stake in these guys succeeding," a senior Baker aide said. "While everything we saw was striking and builds a tremendous sense of hope, it is also true that these people are talking their need to deliver and there is a danger if they don't deliver. Our policy is going to have to be shaped in a way that is designed to help them deliver."
The official added that whether it was Mr. Nazarbayev or Mayor Anatoly A. Sobchak of St. Petersburg, "they have to be able to show that things can improve and that will build their authority and give them more time."
"They are consumed with a sense of urgency," he said.
Baker aides said that since the coup republic leaders they had spoken with seemed to express pragmatism about the need to maintain a degree of economic cohesion, not to mention centralized nuclear controls, even if they asserted more individual independence and identities.
Bush Administration officials have been obsessive in avoiding public statements on what they prefer for the Soviet Union in that regard.
But privately they made clear that they want at a minimum a loose confederation with a single economic space, common currency, and central bank and central fiscal and monetary policies constituting sustainable economic reform. Mr. Baker has also said no economic help is going to be feasible if the republics do not work out a coherent economic arrangement with a central decision-making body that can enforce business contracts and laws.
 
A Degree of Integration
 "When Baker talked to them about the importance of them making their own decisions, but recognizing the benefits of economic integration, it fell on fertile ground," a State Department official said. Among the intellectual architects of reform Mr. Baker heard "a desire to rein in separatist tendencies," the official said.
"Whereas before they wanted the pluralism to develop and for the center to become less weighty, now as they look at some of the outpouring of emotion and some of the impulses, many of them say, 'Let's not lose sight of the value of the center,' " the official said, using the word center to refer to the central Government.
This brings the policy makers to the challenge of the day. For some kind of center to hold, the change-minded leaders in each republic have to establish bases of support and respect, besides those based on nationalist passions.
For American policy toward the Soviet Union that means several things, Administration officials said. Their first priority, they said, will be to make sure that the Soviets get through the winter without serious food shortages and an agricultural team is already drawing up plans for that. But this must be done delicately to insure that the goods get to where they are needed and that handouts do not damage Soviet agriculture.
Also, officials said, they need to organize some projects that will demonstrate early successes while Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a leader of the Soviet transition economic team, and the republics get their economic treaty and reform package together.
"Instead of trying to green the world, we need to plant half a dozen pots," an American diplomat said.
In St. Petersburg, for instance, the official suggested establishment of a shopping street, with Soviet-owned and Western-owned stores, or maybe a new road-building project that could supply jobs and improve traffic.
Another American official said, "We need to take a reform city government, in a major city, and work with it to build a demonstration project that everyone could see."
Second, American officials said, "technical assistance" is going to have to be much more broadly defined, from simply providing economic or agricultural advice to sending American teams to do managerial and entrepreneurial training and help in the development of political institutions.
 
The Army Wants Help
 For instance, the new Defense Minister, Yevgeny I. Shaposhnikov, asked American officials about helping to develop a justice system for the Soviet Army so that Soviet citizens would be convinced that the laws that apply to them would also apply to the military.
But without broader free-market economic reform, technical aid can take the Soviet Union only so far. All week long, American officials stressed to their Soviet counterparts the need to agree speedily on an economic treaty and reform program approved by the International Monetary Fund that would include at a minimum contract and property rights, a macro-economic stabilization plan, price decontrols and a convertible currency.
The Americans said that the Soviets promised that the plan would come "soon," but there is still no sign of the final product.
Mr. Baker strongly hinted that as soon as the Soviets produce that plan, the United States and its allies would come up with some serious cash and credit for a stabilization fund, but he always declined to be more specific.
Mr. Baker and his aides could probably best be described as more hopeful about a Soviet transformation than before the coup, but still highly dubious.
"In the end we can't do it for them," a State Department official said. "It is trite but it is true. They have to get their act together. They have to translate the theory of what they want into reality. It all starts with them."

HEADLINE: Forest Supervisors Say Politicians Are Asking Them to Cut Too Much

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KALISPELL, Mont. Sept. 11

 BODY:
Supervisors of some of the nation's largest public forests say they have come under intense political pressure to cut more timber than the land can handle.
Already, grizzly bears and 20-pound bull trout are in trouble from excessive logging in the forests of the northern Rocky Mountains, biologists say. Now, managers of these forests say they are slowing down the Government's logging program to protect fish and wildlife. But they say they are doing so at the risk of their own jobs. 
 The timber industry, some Bush Administration officials and other politicians argue that trees on the public lands of the Northern Rockies must be logged at a certain level to keep the regional economy afloat. But the Forest Service supervisors say Western senators and Administration officials are trying to force them into unsound land stewardship to benefit the industry.
"The pressure is there, and it is intense," said Orville Daniels, supervisor of the 2.5-million-acre Lolo National Forest in Montana.
Mr. Daniels and other foresters and biologists across the nation say they are caught in a squeeze between science and politics. This week, a Congressional subcommittee began issuing subpoenas to top Forest Service officials, who are to appear at a Sept. 24 hearing, before the House Subcommittee on Civil Service, to determine whether professional land managers are being harassed.
A Federal district judge in Seattle, in issuing an injunction against logging in parts of the Northwest, spoke of "executive branch" meddling in the agencies governing the nation's public forests. The judge, William L. Dwyer, wrote on May 23 that there was "a deliberate and systematic refusal by the Forest Service and the Fish and Wildlife Serviice to comply with laws protecting wildlife."
"This is not the doing of scientists, foresters, rangers and others at working levels of these agencies," continued Judge Dwyer, who was appointed by President Reagan in 1987. "It reflects decisions made by higher authorities in the executive branch of government."
At the center of the Montana dispute is John W. Mumma, a 32-year Forest Service employee, who was forced into retirement at the age of 51 this month after Western Republican senators and timber industry executives complained that he was not allowing trees to be logged fast enough from the Rocky Mountains.
Mr. Mumma oversaw 25 million acres of public land in 13 National Forests in Montana, Idaho and the Dakotas. The first biologist to hold the job of regional forester in the Northern Rockies, he was widely regarded as a reformer, and his ouster two weeks ago is seen by some in the service as a signal that the Bush Administration is caving in to political pressure from the timber industry.
"If they get away with this, the budding reform movement in the Forest Service could be squashed," said Jeff DeBonis, founder of the Association of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics, which he said has 2,000 past and present service workers among its membership.
 
Meeting With Agriculture
 Top timber industry executives met recently with Agriculture Secretary Edward Madigan, who oversees the Forest Service, and complained that Mr. Mumma was not putting enough trees up for sale. Nationwide, only 60 percent of this year's Government timber target has been met, which the Forest Service attributes to environmental appeals. It was Mr. Madigan who ordered Mr. Mumma to take a desk job in Washington this month. He refused the reassignment, and announced his retirement instead. Neither Mr. Mumma nor Mr. Madigan would comment on the move.
Susan Hess, director of public affairs for the Forest Service, said the inability of Mr. Mumma to meet the timber cut was only part of the reason for his ouster. She said his removal as regional forester was not an attempt to stifle dissident voices in the Forest Service, but rather "was due to the general job performance of Mr. Mumma."
Under a typical timber sale, the Forest Service builds the roads and then sells the timber to private logging companies. Most of the trees are clearcut, a method in which all the trees are removed from a given site.
The land that Mr. Mumma oversaw is bigger than most American states, and is perhaps the most sparsely populated area in the contiguous United States. But it supports huge trout, badgers, wolves, mountain goats, mountain lions, large herds of elk and deer, and the only sizable population of grizzly bears outside of Alaska.
It is also an area with large tracts of corporate timberland, primarily that of the Plum Creek Timber Company, whose managers acknowledged several years ago that were cutting far more trees than could grow back to replace them. They said they were not practicing sustained yield, the long-held industry concept of cutting an even amount of trees every year, and then replanting in place of the clearcuts.
Plum Creek owns about 800,000 acres of forest in Montana. The company's leaders now say they are curbing the excesses of the 1980's and are practicing what they call "environmental foresty," -- less clearcutting and more trees left as buffer zones around creeks and streams.
In recent years, Federal and private studies have documented how excessive logging, on public and private land, has affected elk, grizzly bears and trout in the Rockies. For example, heavy tree cutting was found to be a cause of mudslides and sediment buildup in Swan River, just south of here, which flows into Flathead Lake.
The sediment, and the algae that come with it, are so high in some places that it is driving out of the river the oxygen that trout need to survive, according to a study released this summer.
"The Swan is one of the last premier bull trout basins left in the world, and if nothing is done, it will continue to choke on sediment," said Dr. Richard Hauer, a University of Montana biologist, who was a co-author of the study.
 
Effect on Wildlife
 Near Kalispell, in a 459-square-mile corner of the Kootenai National Forest where as much as 70 percent of the land has been clearcut, Federal biologists warned in 1989 that continued high logging could affect grizzly bears, which are a threatened species. The bears have been forced to scatter to isolated high country. Yet logging in that section, the Yaak region, was increased by 30 percent last year, rather than reduced as the Forest Service favored, after staff members of Senator James A. McClure, a Republican of Idaho who retired from the Senate in 1990, met with the Forest Service staff.
Mr. McClure and foresters with Plum Creek said a higher level of logging was needed in the Yaak region and nearby areas because the trees are infested with pine beetles. They argued that it was better to salvage the trees while they have commercial value, a view disputed by other foresters.
In an effort to try to repair some of the land after more than a decade of heavy cutting, forest supervisors throughout the region have been reducing the volume of timber, going below the targets set by Congress.
"We have a good thing going for the future, and I do not intend for us to screw it up for short-term reasons that are not sound," wrote Tom Kovalicky, supervisor of the Nez Perce National Forest in Idaho, in a memo sent to other Government foresters last fall.
Commenting on Mr. Mumma in that memo, Mr. Kovalicky wrote, "John is the only regional forester in recent times who is fighting for resource balance."
But the refusal by Federal land managers to cut as much timber as desired by industry has angered Republican senators like Larry E. Craig of Idaho and Conrad Burns of Montana.
Last May, Senator Craig wrote a letter to F. Dale Robertson, the Chief of the Forest Service, in which he castigated the chief for not cutting trees fast enough in the Rocky Mountain region. "You have serious management problems that must be addressed," Senator Craig wrote in the May 23 letter. "It is my hope that you will move to assure targets are met and line officers are held accountable."
 
Request for Reports
 He told Mr. Robertson to send him summaries each month of what the service was doing to keep sales flowing. "I intend to take increased oversight of the operation of the Forest Service," he said in closing.
In an interview, Mr. Craig said he did not intend the letter to be a direct threat to Mr. Mumma's job. He said the region was in "crisis and paralysis," and that slowing timber sales could eventually threaten jobs.
As for the contention that forest managers cannot cut the amount of timber desired by industry and Congress without harming wildlife, Senator Craig said, "I'm frustrated by that because I don't know if it's just an excuse."
Yet even other private logging companies say excessive cutting by Plum Creek and others caused officials to restrict logging on public land. "It's very much a part of the problem," said Doug Mood of the Pyramid Mountain Lumber Company, a small concern near Missoula.
But Mr. Mood also faulted the Forest Service. "From the leadership, right on down, they don't know what they want anymore in the Forest Service," he said.

HEADLINE: A Bernhardt Biography From a 40-Year Piano Duo

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
She grew up in the demimonde of mid-19th-century Paris, the illegitimate daughter of a Jewish courtesan from Amsterdam. Trained to follow in her mother's footsteps, she instead became an actress, which in those days wasn't much different. She was known for sleeping in a coffin, as well as with hundreds of men.
Her friends and admirers included Victor Hugo, Gustave Flaubert, Gustave Dore, Alexandre Dumas (father and son) and the Prince of Wales. Decades before movies and television, long before the age of huge publicity machines, she achieved international fame on a scale previously unknown. 
 "And she was the greatest actress who ever lived," says Robert Fizdale, the author with Arthur Gold of "The Divine Sarah: A Life of Sarah Bernhardt," which Alfred A. Knopf is publishing this month. "Her acting was extremely stylized, in a way we don't find natural today, but it was very beautiful. Acting reflects the behavior of the time. She wept and fainted onstage, but in her day women often wept and fainted. If she were living now, she would act the way people act now. She would be a great actress today."
Mr. Fizdale, who is 71 years old, and Mr. Gold, who died of lung cancer last year at age 72 shortly after finishing the first draft of the biography, met as students at the Juilliard School in the late 1930's. They became a well-known couple around New York, partners in life as well as in work. They shared an apartment in Manhattan and a home in Water Mill, L.I., and they performed together as an internationally renowned piano duo for nearly 40 years before retiring from the stage in 1982 because Mr. Fizdale was suffering from arthritis.
 
The Start of Writing
 "I felt somehow responsible for ending Arthur's career," Mr. Fizdale says in a gentle and refined voice that seems full of the music he created for so many years. "So I hesitated to break the bad news. But finally I had to. I said I didn't think I could go on much longer because it was painful to hit the keys. And he said: 'Don't worry about it. I'm so sick of flying. I'm sorry about your fingers but I'm not at all sorry about stopping.' "
Even before their career as musicians ended, they had begun to write. Their first book, "Misia," a biography of the Parisian pianist and arts patron Misia Sert, was published in 1980. And after they stopped performing, they published "The Gold and Fizdale Cookbook" in 1984, wrote articles about food for Vogue and were contributing editors of Architectural Digest.
They chose Bernhardt as their second biographical subject, Mr. Fizdale says, "because we liked the idea of writing about performers."
"That's what we were," he says, sitting in the offices of his publisher, "and we thought it was about time for another book about her, because the last ones were some time ago. It never occurred to us to write about musicians. I think it's much more difficult to write about music. You can describe an actor's performance, the gestures they make, but it's very hard to describe music. You run out of adjectives and you still don't give a picture of what it really is. And in any case, I think we liked the idea of getting away from music."
 
Work Apart, Argue Together
 They would work on separate sections in separate rooms, he says, "as far apart as possible," taking a break every hour or so to see what the other had done. "Often we had terrible fights," he says. "But we did that when we gave concerts, too. We were so used to that that we knew they weren't serious." Finishing "The Divine Sarah," he says, was in many ways a race against time for Mr. Gold. "But I didn't know that," he says, as what seems to be the beginning of a tear forms in his eye. "I didn't know he wasn't well. He looked well and worked very hard and we went out a lot. But of course he also smoked so much."
He and Mr. Gold were able to draw on unpublished letters, Mr. Fizdale says, including Bernhardt's correspondence with friends, lovers and her son, Maurice.
First they looked into Bernhardt's difficult childhood, one spent with a mother who didn't like her and in a house constantly visited by wealthy men who after a while were interested not only in the mother but in the young Sarah as well.
 
Making Thin Beautiful
 "An unhappy childhood often makes for a very interesting grown-up," Mr. Fizdale says. "At least it did in Sarah's case. She was obsessed with trying to get her mother to show some affection, and she never succeeded. She might very well not have been a great actress if she had been the favorite child."
But Mr. Fizdale says that he and Mr. Gold did not want to dwell on psychological interpretations. "I think that's for the psychologists," he says. "We just wanted to provide enough information to give an idea that there were psychological problems."
The many men in her life were attracted by the magnetism of her personality, Mr. Fizdale says, as well as by her physical beauty. But it was a beauty that was the complete opposite of the style of the times. Her face was indeed stunning, but in an era when voluptuousness was the fashionable female look and a handsome man was what we today would call a couch potato, Sarah Bernhardt, just over five feet tall, was thin, incredibly thin.
"Audiences at first thought she was ridiculous because she was so skinny," Mr. Fizdale says. "When she raised her arms, people would boo because her arms weren't fleshy enough. The perception of beauty in those days had economic roots. If you were thin, it meant you didn't get enough to eat. And if you weren't thin, it meant you had money. But in the end, Bernhardt made thinness beautiful. It was almost as if she was a model for today's world."
Bernhardt, Mr. Fizdale says, was much more than an actress. She was a sculptor and a painter whose works were exhibited in Paris for more than 20 years. She wrote plays and books. She was an expert at publicity. It was she who arranged the taking and distribution of photographs of her asleep in a coffin and who reveled in the notoriety they created. And unlike most actresses of the time, she was intensely interested in politics.
"When she went to Vienna to perform, she would always be asked by interviewers what the ladies were wearing," Mr. Fizdale says. "And she would say: 'I don't want to discuss that; I want to discuss anti-Semitism in Austria.' Which was a very courageous thing to say at the time, because nobody in Austria wanted to discuss it. And Bernhardt, who worshiped her son and couldn't live without him, didn't speak to him for a year during the Dreyfus affair because he opposed Dreyfus. She was instrumental in getting people involved in the case." Dreyfus, who had been convicted of treason and imprisoned, was exonerated when it turned out that he had been the victim of anti-Semitism and a conspiracy.
 
A Lopsided Judgment
 When Bernhardt died in 1923, at age 79, a crowd estimated at 600,000 to one million people filled the streets of Paris to get a glimpse of her funeral cortege. They were paying homage to a woman who had thrilled audiences with her acting, with her performances in Dumas fils's "Dame aux Camelias" and Oscar Wilde's "Salome"; as both Hamlet and Ophelia; as Phedre and Lady Macbeth, and in countless other parts. Playwrights had created roles especially for her: before there was a "Tosca" by Puccini, there was "La Tosca," written for Bernhardt by Victorien Sardou. Even Marcel Proust was inspired by her; in "Remembrance of Things Past," she was the model for the actress Berma.
Not everyone admired her. George Bernard Shaw considered her acting "childishly egotistical." But D. H. Lawrence called her "the incarnation of wild emotion which we share with all live things."
Her talent, Mr. Fizdale says, cannot be judged by the films and recordings that exist today, because they are played at the speeded-up rate common to her era and seem grotesque.
"In most of the recordings people have heard, she sounds like Minnie Mouse, very squeaky and very fast," he says. "Her golden voice makes no impression at all. But when they are played at the right speed, things are completely different. There's a lot of static, but you get a distinct impression of a beautiful voice. Some of it is so moving that when it's over you want to jump to your feet and cheer. You begin to understand what it was like for audiences to watch her on the stage. The rapture, the excitement they must have felt."

HEADLINE: PRO HOCKEY;
Disarray on Ice With N.H.L. At Crossroads

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTREAL, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Brett Hull remembers his college days, in the mid-1980's, when he could watch big-league hockey on cable television. "It was great," he said. "Every week, on ESPN and USA."
With or without TV this season, Hull wants to see Eric Lindros, the 18-year-old amateur sensation, in the National Hockey League. "We need Eric Lindros," Hull said, "and we need people to get off his case." 
 Like many of his fellow players, Hull is also concerned about terms of the expiring collective bargaining agreement, which restricts free agency and sometimes punishes players who are awarded as compensation. "Scott Stevens," Hull said, citing a recent case, "was treated most unfairly."
Finally, Hull wonders about the N.H.L.'s expansion plans. At least one proposed franchise is having serious financial problems and none of the three have new arenas yet.
"In most other sports, you've got to get a barn first," Hull said, referring to arenas. "If expansion doesn't work, someone has to be to blame."
Hull, as even casual sports fans probably know, is the son of one of hockey's greatest players, Bobby Hull. The younger Hull is a sharpshooter for the St. Louis Blues and is the current goal-scoring champion of the N.H.L., with 86 goals last season. He is also a booster of his sport, which he calls "the best in the world."
Although his league has enjoyed relative stability and modest prosperity for more than a decade, it is at a crossroads -- perhaps a major intersection -- as it prepares for its 75th season, the 25th since its expansion from six teams and into the modern era.
Even as the best players from Canada and the United States conclude the championship round of the Canada Cup this week, the problems facing the league -- the collective bargaining agreement, the expansion difficulties, the lack of a television contract in the United States and the Lindros affair -- cast significant shadows over hockey's ambitious plans for a bright decade in the 1990's.
Despite all the questions, however, there is little sense that the professional hockey business is in peril. Over all, it is profitable. Although they want reform of free agency, few players speak in militant tones about strike possibilities.
"As a union, we're as close as we've ever been," said Brent Sutter, the captain of the Islanders and a member of Team Canada. "This is a very important collective bargaining agreement. There certainly have to be some changes."
The five-year agreement was scheduled to expire tonight at midnight. Negotiators met through the weekend in a hotel in downtown Montreal. The season begins in two weeks.
"The old agreement is so old-fashioned and so out-of-date that it is tough to live by," said Joe Mullen, a veteran of the Pittsburgh Penguins. "They call it 'free agency.' There is none. I found out the hard way."
So did Stevens. When he moved from Washington to St. Louis last season, the Blues had to give the Capitals five first-round draft choices as compensation. When Brendan Shanahan moved this summer
from New Jersey to St. Louis, an arbitrator awarded Stevens to the Devils as compensation.. Others feel slighted in other ways.
"I didn't get a single offer," said Mike Richter of the Rangers, a free agent who is the first-string goalie for Team USA "The compensation would be five first-rounders. A team like Washington has them.
"The players don't want to go overboard. But we wonder: are we missing out? The consensus is we're underpaid. But we're not sure."
 
Average Salary Was $254,000
 According to the N.H.L.P.A., last season's average salary was $254,000, considerably less than that paid to players in other major sports who have more free-agent mobility. Those sports also earn revenue from national television contracts, which hockey lacks in the United States.
For the last three seasons, the N.H.L. appeared on SportsChannel America, a cable network. When SportsChannel failed to expand beyond the limited number of markets it's available in, the league became invisible in many areas of the country.
Even if new nationwide cable contracts are signed, they are expected to yield far less money than the $51 million that SportsChannel paid for the last three seasons. The league president, John Ziegler, says he isn't concerned.
"Our broadcast position is very sound," said Ziegler. "We'll have some kind of contract with somebody."
In the United States, in the late 1960's and early 1970's, the N.H.L. appeared on major, over-the-air networks, CBS and NBC. In the late 1970's and early 1980's, it was one of the first sports to embrace cable, but its exposure has declined while cable has grown.
"Come on," Wayne Gretzky said recently. "You can't tell me our game isn't more exciting than bowling on a Sunday afternoon or women's golf. We can't get on TV? Somewhere, somebody is doing something wrong and they've got to make changes."
Ziegler said the widespread cable exposure of the mid-1980's wasn't especially profitable.
"Broadcasting is not a critical item to our business," Ziegler said, adding that most of hockey's TV money comes from local TV packages and that about two-thirds of hockey's revenue comes from gate receipts.
Other substantial revenue was to come from expansion, with up to seven new franchises paying $50 million to join the league during the decade. San Jose begins this season, with Tampa Bay and Ottawa scheduled for the 1992-93 season.
But after putting up the $5 million deposit, the Tampa, Fla., team failed to make its $22.5 million payment on June 15 and still hasn't done so. Ziegler said over the weekend that "we hit a real hiccup" in the Tampa situation because of the economic recession.
 
The Lindros Factor
 Many promoters, fans and players are excited about Lindros, a 6-foot-5-inch, 235-pound center who is making a major impression this month as a star of Team Canada. Lindros plays with a rare combination of size, skill and aggression, which prompts comparisons to Gordie Howe, Jean Beliveau, Mark Messier and Mario Lemieux. He is, however, reluctant to play for the Quebec Nordiques, the team that made him the first pick in last summer's amateur draft.
"Why should I play for a club that's spent the last 1,000 days in last place?" Lindros said recently. His negotiating stance, bold by hockey standards, has angered some segments of the hockey establishment and has come to be viewed by the Canadian public as an English-versus-French issue.
"It is very important for the Nordiques to either sign him or get some players for him in trade," Gretzky said last week. "But it looks like that is not going to happen."
Ziegler says the Lindros matter is none of his business.
"It would be absolutely inappropriate for me to get involved unless both the player and the club asked me," Ziegler said. "I certainly would like to see Eric Lindros play in the N.H.L. But you have to put one hockey player in perspective. It is a team game. This league has succeeded for 75 years without any particular player."
According to figures provided by the league, attendance last season for regular season and playoff games was 13,786,100, down from 13,935,244 the year before.
 
Absorbed W.H.L. IN '79
 Ziegler has held his job since 1977, back when Jimmy Carter was just getting comfortable in the White House. Ziegler's major achievement came in 1979, when he steered an "expansion" that eventually blended the N.H.L. with the remnants of the now-defunct World Hockey Association. It ended a decade of warring leagues, bankrupt franchises, uneven quality and general chaos.
The N.H.L. says its gross revenue was about $400 million last season from ticket sales and broadcast fees, including Canada and local packages. Profits last season were $15 million, down from $40 million the previous year. But the figures provided don't include revenue from concessions, parking and luxury boxes, which are considerable in some cities.
"My guess," Ziegler said, "is that three or four teams lost money last season and 12 were right on the cusp."'
What, then, is the real problem? With the N.H.L., it may be image, particularly the common misperception that hockey is mostly fist-fighting on ice skates.
To improve its image, the league has hired a specialist, Bill Wilkerson, who is consolidating in Toronto the public-relations operations that used to be scattered across offices in Toronto, Montreal and New York.
Despite all the difficulties, most N.H.L. people see no reason why the league can't thrive for another 75 years.
"The league is upside-down right now," said John Davidson, the former Ranger goalie who is regarded as one of the best television reporters in hockey. "But it will survive. Because the fans are so good. Because the players are so good. And because the sport is so good."

The National Hockey League has no national U.S. television contract, but President John Ziegler says "Our broadcase position is very sound. We'll have some kind of contract with somebody."

HEADLINE: Senator Harkin Joins Race for President

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WINTERSET, Iowa, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa roared into the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination today, scoffing at President Bush as a uncaring plutocrat with political "feet of clay" and casting the election as a stark choice between a government for the privileged and a government for the people at large.
With a fiery address delivered at a rally just south of Des Moines, Mr. Harkin promised a hard and unyielding attack on Mr. Bush, brushing aside all the months of poll data and expert analysis holding that the President will be very tough to beat. "I know there are those who say it's a long shot," said the 51-year-old Mr. Harkin, "that we might as well just call the election off." 
 He paused, then shouted with the anger that has roused many of the party faithful in recent months, "I'm here today to tell you that George Herbert Walker Bush has got feet of clay and I intend to take a hammer to them."
 
Tsongas, Wilder, Now Harkin
 Mr. Harkin, a fourth-generation Iowan, a former Navy jet pilot and a second-term Senator, becomes the third major candidate to declare formally for the Democratic nomination, joining Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia and former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts.
Mr. Harkin has positioned himself as the unabashed voice of traditional Democratic values, a candidate who relishes the prospect of going mano a mano with the President -- not a small selling point in a party where many believe that Michael S. Dukakis lost in 1988 by failing to fight back.
Mr. Harkin's address today was populism with a razor's edge, attacking Mr. Bush -- whom Mr. Harkin almost invariably refers to by his full four names -- as a tribune of privilege devoted to policies that help the rich, insensitive to the hopes and dreams of ordinary Americans. Mr. Harkin described the "supply side" economics of the Reagan and Bush years as a "failed economic experiment" that should be consigned to "the trash heap of history" alongside Communism.
In its place, Mr. Harkin asserted, should come a "percolate up" economics that would emphasize "investment" in people and the nation's infrastructure. And he said the money would be readily available now that the cold war was over.
"If you believe like I do that Europe is rich enough and strong enough and powerful enough to defend itself if it wants to, and we can take some of your wealth and invest it in America -- and build better roads, and better highways, better energy systems, educate our kids, have better health care -- then you take your ballot and you put it in the Harkin box," he said.
 
Made-for-Television Moment
 Mr. Harkin declared his candidacy on the farm of a friend, on a gentle hilltop surrounded by rolling cornfields, a perfect, made-for-television backdrop for his defense of the "the hard-working men and women of America, our farmers, our small-business people, the people who pull the load and pay the taxes."
His audience, about 2,000 strong, was arrayed before him on bales of straw. Many of the Iowans wore T-shirts that declared, "Give 'em hell, Harkin"; other shirts declared, "Tom Harkin -- George Bush's worst nightmare." Everywhere there were flags, and the program began with the Pledge of Allegiance, reflecting the determination of many Democrats never again to let the Republicans seize control of the symbols of patriotism, as they often seemed to do in 1988.
His sleeves rolled up, Mr. Harkin reveled in the chants and cheers of the hometown crowd, and he quickly found his cadence on the makeshift stage. He began with a paean to his hometown of Cumming, Iowa, to the values of small-town America, to the strength of communities. "For the last four years, we've had a different vision of America coming out of the White House," Mr. Harkin said. The Republicans' message, he went on, pits "race against race," and "class against class," and holds that "the few at the top are privileged and deserve special treatment and favors from the government."
The Iowa Democrat said it was time for his party to "turn the tables" on the Republicans with their own once-devastating question: "Are you better off today than you were four years ago?" And the political terrain on which he intends to fight was clear: repeatedly, he said it was time to turn American resources toward American problems, in the schools, the streets, the infrastructure.
 
Redirecting the Vision
 "We're not going to get to that new America," he said, "if we have a President in the White House like George Bush, who thinks that the real threats to our national security are halfway around the world, when they're really halfway down our streets."
The remark reflected a common Democratic theme in the 1992 campaign, a relentless emphasis on domestic issues and a growing demand to redirect spending from overseas to the home front. Governor Wilder has cast the issue as "putting America first."
The Democratic field is still forming, with Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska both expected to make their intentions official in a few weeks.
At least initially, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Harkin are considered intriguing rivals, because Mr. Harkin preaches traditional Democratic values and argues that there is nothing inherently wrong with the party's message, while Mr. Clinton argues that the party must refashion its appeal to regain the middle class. For example, Mr. Clinton argues that the Democrats must try to make government work better and must put more emphasis on personal responsibility in social welfare programs.
But Mr. Harkin's most immediate concern could be Mr. Kerrey, from neighboring Nebraska. If Mr. Kerrey enters the race, as is expected, he could make the Iowa caucuses difficult for Mr. Harkin, who already faces the problem of controlling expectations about how well he should perform in his home state. Some Iowa Democrats say Mr. Kerrey could run well in western Iowa.
Mr. Harkin faces a broader problem: the perception that he is simply another liberal Democrat who is ideologically out of sync with the times. To that suggestion, Tim Raftis, Mr. Harkin's campaign manager, replied, "That charge comes right out of the Republican White House."
Bullishness was in the air around the Harkin camp today, which, by serendipity, launched its pugnacious drive for the nomination in the birthplace of John Wayne.

HEADLINE: Report Urges Science Funds Be Used for Education

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept.15

 BODY:
A report made public today recommends that the Federal Government designate a portion of the $68 billion now spent annually on Federal science research and development for improving math and science education in public schools.
"We're trying to position the Federal Government to be a leader rather than a cheerleader for science and mathematics education reform," said Dr. Rollin Johnson, project director for the Carnegie Commission on Science, Technology, and Government, which issued the report. The commission was established in 1988 by the Carnegie Corporation to study ways to incorporate scientific and technological knowledge in Government policy-making. 
 While the report did not recommend what percentage of the science research budget should be diverted, Dr. Johnson said, "Even 1 percent of the R and D funding would more than double the current Federal spending that is specifically targeted to math and science education."
The report, "In the National Interest: The Federal Government in the Reform of K-12 Math and Science Education," also recommends greater coordination of Government efforts to meet national goals in science education. One of the six education goals that the nation's governors and President Bush agreed to in 1989 was to position American students to rank first in the world in math and science.
"There is no shortage of motivated Americans with good ideas about how to serve our children better," said Dr. Lewis M. Branscomb, chairman of the study group that prepared the report. "But the Federal Government is not yet organized to bring to every classroom in America the best of the ideas."
Interest in mathematics and science education is receiving heightened attention after various reports this year that indicate that American students are performing poorly in those subjects. Business leaders, in particular, are alarmed by the poor mathematics performance because the skill is critical to future jobs if the United States is to compete economically.
Indeed, the role of science and mathematics education is the focus of a workshop at an education conference being sponsored by Fortune Magazine here Monday.
"We realize that there is a crisis in math and science in K-12," said Samuel H. Fuller, vice president of corporate research for the Digital Equipment Corporation, one of the panelists. He said that his company had expanded its educational efforts by providing education and support for people who want to switch to teaching in mid-career.
Thirty percent of the nation's elementary and secondary pupils are concentrated in 250 of the nation's 16,000 school districts, Dr. Johnson said, districts that are often in inner cities where poverty and social problems abound.
The report notes that 60 percent of the mathematics teachers and 40 percent of science teachers do not have college degrees in the subject they teach. The report called for colleges and universities to educate undergraduates for professional careers in math and science, either as teachers or researchers.
The report also encouraged better dissemination of new ideas as well as better distribution of Federal education money.
For example, the report suggests that the Eisenhower State Mathematics and Science Program, a Federal program that provides states with $200 million a year for science and mathematics education, award its money on the basis of competition. Currently 75 percent of the money, which is meant to improve science and math teaching, is distributed by economic and population formulas. Some critics maintain that the money for the program is often spent on building maintenance instead of for improvements.
The report recommends the creation of a joint office through which the Department of Education and the National Science Foundation can coordinate improvements in math and science education.

HEADLINE: Between 2 Worlds: Dominicans in New York -- A Special Report;
Between 2 Worlds: Dominicans in New York

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER

 BODY:
Martin Gomez starts all his mornings in America in the same place, at the foot of the George Washington Bridge, waiting for his ride and his future.
As the commuters from New Jersey begin to flow across the bridge to their jobs in midtown Manhattan, Mr. Gomez and hundreds of other Dominican immigrants are heading the other way, in an alternative rush hour imported from the streets of Santo Domingo. 
 In a caravan of livery cabs, broken-down cars, vans and school buses painted bright blue, they are going to sew dresses in factories, make beds in hotels and scrub office floors in central and northern New Jersey.
Those Dominicans, the largest group of recent immigrants, stand for a new wave of immigration that is transforming the New York metropolitan region. Their economically ravaged homeland, where the average salary is $40 a month, sent more people to New York in the 1980's than any other country.
By an inexact official count, the Dominicans in the city are now 400,000 strong. Their entrepreneurial zeal has apparently bought them most of the city's bodegas and many of its livery cabs, and, to an exuberant merengue beat, they have revived a decaying Washington Heights.
The Dominicans have crowded into tenements that once were home to German Jews and the Irish. But while new arrivals are from somewhere else now, their story is in many ways the same. Their lives are still defined by money: earning it, saving it, and sending it back to their families.
Worker by worker by worker, they send so much home, an estimated $300 million to $600 million a year, that their remittances are the Dominican Republic's second-largest industry. Entire Dominican towns are dependent on money from New York.
All immigrants live suspended between two worlds, the old country and the new. The Dominicans just do so more than most. They may complain incessantly about how bad things are at home -- the incompetent bureaucracy, the daily blackouts, the steep price of everything from plantains to sugar, but they talk just as much of returning. Home is a three-hour flight and a $489 round-trip ticket away.
"The Dominicans are like sojourners, or permanent immigrants," said Luis Guarnizo, a doctoral candidate in sociology at the Johns Hopkins University who has extensively studied and written about Dominican immigrants. "They have two lives, one back home and one here. It adds up to almost no life.
"They come here thinking, 'I'm going to save money, buy a house back home, and go back and start a business.' But life here is more difficult than they think. Time goes by, and their stay lengthens. Because of the bureaucracy and corruption in the Dominican Republic, going back is harder than they expected."
In the strict accounting of Mr. Gomez's existence, there are no meals out, no movies, not even television. Back in the Dominican Republic, he made about $10 a week as a cook. In America, depending on how much overtime he can find, he makes from $1,000 to $3,200 a month cleaning offices and factories. This is where it goes:
*$212 a month for his share of a two-room apartment without a kitchen in Washington Heights.
*$175 a month for meals cooked by a neighborhood woman, including the rice and beans he takes to work for lunch.
*$300 a month to his savings account.
*$300 a month for his wife and three children back in Santiago.
 
'Everyone Is Depending on Me'
 By force of thought, if not fact, he said, "My wife and my children get me up every morning at 5." The pressure is enormous.
"Everyone is depending on me," he said. "Sometimes I don't want to work on weekends, but I have to do it. I have to feed my family, I have to feed myself. I have to pay the rent here -- and there. I have to pay the light bill here -- and there. I don't want to let anyone down."
He budgets $489 in air fare for his yearly trip home. When he has saved enough money, he says, he will build a house and stay in the land of beautiful beaches.
To judge from their rising economic profile, more and more Dominicans, like Mr. Gomez, are wistfully planting both feet on their new land, doing, in their own way, what generations of immigrants have done before them. The Dominicans, redefining the nature of "Hispanic" in a city where the word has long been synonymous with "Puerto Rican," have gone from driving livery cabs to operating fleets of them, from owning bodegas to buying supermarkets. Some have moved from the tenements of Washington Heights to houses in the suburbs.
And after cutting their political teeth on the local school board, the Dominicans last week all but won their own district on the City Council, which is about to expand, to 51 from 35 members, in an effort to give greater political power to the minority groups that now constitute a majority of the city's population.
The primary vote gave the Democratic nomination to Guillermo Linares, a teacher and public-school advocate, who prevailed over two other Dominicans. In November, he is virtually assured of becoming the first Dominican elected to the Council.
"Now we are beginning to put down roots in this country," said Dr. Rafael Lantigua, an internist at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center who was a leader in the drive for a Dominican Council district. "We know the only way to get services in a country like ours, and I say ours because this is our country, is through political empowerment."
 
The Drug Dealers
'It's an Injustice' To Generalize
 Talk to the Dominicans, from Washington Heights to newer communities in the western Bronx; Corona, Queens, and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and the conversation invariably comes around to the same rankling point: the way they have come to be defined as drug dealers in the popular imagination.
"We're not all drug dealers," said Maria Miguelena Barbuena, the main Maria behind Las Tres Marias, a restaurant at 170th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, which is widely popular with Dominican cabdrivers, lawyers and community leaders. "Look at my hands. These are hard-working hands. We are hard-working people."
As the commander of the Manhattan North Tactical Narcotics Team, Capt. Robert Curley is an expert on the young Dominicans who sell cocaine in Washington Heights. He knows that the customers are mostly from the suburbs -- many come across the same bridge that Mr. Gomez and the other workers cross daily -- and that Washington Heights has the heaviest drug traffic in Manhattan.
He also knows that the local precinct, the 34th, had 103 slayings last year, the second highest toll in the city, after the 77th in the East New York section of Brooklyn. The 34th is also more than twice the geographic size of many other precincts.
 
'That Look of Fatigue'
 But, Captain Curley said, "it's an injustice to just equate Dominicans with drug-dealing." He said he had learned the real story of the community by studying the faces of the workers who return across the bridge at the end of the day.
"You see someone in work clothes, with a thermos," Captain Curley said. "You see that look of fatigue. It's something you're familiar with. They get out and wave. In your mind you can just hear the conversation, 'See you tomorrow.' You can tell it's someone coming home from work."
Luis Guarnizo has interviewed nearly 100 Dominican executives in the city, including a handful of drug dealers. He said the pressure to support families back home and the lack of good jobs in New York drove some immigrants into the trade.
To go to New York, Mr. Guarnizo said, many Dominicans borrow $2,000 to $10,000 to finance illegal passages. Mr. Gomez borrowed $5,000 for air fare and to pay off officials for the necessary documents. He spent the first few years in this country paying off the debt.
"They mortgage their family house and borrow money at 10 percent interest a month," Mr. Guarnizo said. "Once they're here, you can't imagine the pressure on them. If they don't keep up with payments, their family will be thrown out of their house back home.
"And back home, everyone has an image of easy money to be made in New York. You want to go back with money. Otherwise your community thinks you're a loser."
One drug dealer had been a laid-off construction worker. "He had spent all his savings," Mr. Guarnizo recalled. "Meanwhile, the offers kept coming in: 'C'mon, forget your moral principles, let's make money.' Finally, he started driving a car for the dealers. He was making $300 a week. Then he moved up to dealing."
After 18 months in the drug trade, the man had enough money to return home and open a legitimate business.
 
The Entrepreneurs
Restaurant Born Of Plantain Stew
 Where better to study Dominican enterprise than Las Tres Marias?
Maria Miguelena Barbuena arrived in New York at the age of 12 and went to work sewing dresses in a factory.
"I had to do it," she said. "My mother was sick, and we were five in the house. My mother was very proud. She didn't want to go on welfare."
Twenty years ago, her mother started cooking a Dominican stew called sancocho for neighborhood customers. The stew, made with plantains, peas and meat, became a Washington Heights staple. Eventually, Mrs. Barbuena borrowed money and started the restaurant.
 
A Dream Met
 "I dream of this, and I get it," she said. "There's nothing more for me to dream."
She has done well enough to be able to move out of Washington Heights, away from the drug dealers, to a house on a quiet block in New Milford, N.J. But, she said, Las Tres Marias could not exist outside Washington Heights.
"I want to be where my people are, where they know me," she said. "Maybe someplace else I fail."
There are actually five Marias behind Las Tres Marias. Working alongside Maria Miguelena are her sisters, Maria Amarilis, Maria Librado and Maria Teresa, and the woman who started it all, their mother, Maria Dulce.
 
Saving $13,000 in a Year
 So why isn't the restaurant Las Cincas Marias? "I don't think it sounds commercial," Mrs. Barbuena said. "Las Tres Marias sounds better."
Twenty years ago, Puerto Ricans owned most of the bodegas in the city. Today Dominicans do.
To acquire his, Julio Trejo, from Puerto Plata, held four jobs at once. He worked days in a lamp factory in Paterson, N.J., and nights cleaning offices. Weekends he drove a livery cab and played drums in a merengue band.
"I didn't stop for anything," Mr. Trejo said. "I saved $13,000 in one year. I had no time to spend it."
He arrived 12 years ago. Two years later, he paid $50,000 for his bodega, El Paraiso on West 175th Street in the Bronx. Today, it costs $150,000 to $200,000 to buy a bodega, said Agostin Garcia, president of the Dominican Chamber of Commerce.
 
'Competition Among the Powerless'
 El Paraiso is no paradise. "You got to work 15 hours a day," Mr. Trejo said. This life leaves him no time for playing in his old band, Los Principes. But he can afford to send his children to parochial school. And he recently opened El Paraiso II nearby, on West 181st Street.
Some people talk of scattered tensions between the Dominicans and the Puerto Ricans, not unlike any other "competition among the powerless," in the words of Angelo Falcon, president of the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy, who grew up in Brooklyn. He related a recent encounter in a bodega. The owner, who is Dominican, was displaying the flag of his country.
"This Puerto Rican walked in and said, 'Why don't you have a Puerto Rican flag?' " Mr. Falcon recounted. "The owner said, 'You're not a real country. At least we're a real country, an independent country.' "
 
The New New Yorkers
'Here Is the Land Of Opportunity'
 Francisca Rodriguez likes to show visitors the view of the George Washington Bridge from her apartment window, and the snapshot of the house she is building in her hometown of Dajabon.
Mrs. Rodriguez arrived four years ago and went to work in the housekeeping department of a midtown hotel. She has never been over the bridge she admires from her window. The boundaries of her New York are defined by her two stops on the No. 1 train, in Washington Heights and midtown.
At night, she watches news of the Dominican Republic on cable television. At the newsstand at 181st Street and St. Nicholas Avenue, she has her choice of 10 newspapers published in the Dominican Republic and flown daily to New York.
Mrs. Rodriguez says she is in New York only until she saves enough money to go home and open a bodega.
She and her 17-year-old son, Elvis, are close. But like many young Dominicans -- and with an median age of 22, they are the youngest of the new immigrants -- Elvis will not be going back with his mother.
"I love New York," he said. Elvis, who is a senior at George Washington High School, said he believes this is the place he can fulfill his dream to be a computer programmer.
 
'I Want to Be Buried Here'
 Maria Miguelena Barbuena is not going back, either. "Even if I die in Santo Domingo, I want to be buried here," she said.
Yesenia Herarte, 19, works six days a week as a cashier at the Key Food store in Washington Heights and moonlights as a youth counselor. Ms. Herarte, who wants to be an engineer, studies English at night.
But on Sundays, she climbs a steep staircase above a warehouse on Webster Avenue in the Bronx and enters a large room filled with people from her hometown, Esperanza, which means "hope" in Spanish. There, the members of the Esperanza Social Club dance, exchange tips on jobs and apartments and raise money to send home.
All over Washington Heights and the Bronx, Dominicans meet in similar social clubs, organized around hometowns. The Dominicans are singularly passionate about baseball, and each club has its own team.
"Here is the land of opportunity -- money and success," Mr. Guarnizo said. "But social life is also important to Dominicans. They talk a lot, sharing, hanging out with friends. Here they work so hard they have to give a lot of that up. They have to strengthen their culture here to keep going in a society that appears hostile. They love their country. They recreate Dominicanness here."
The longer they stay, though, the more important they become as New Yorkers. In an affirmation of that ascent, an estimated quarter-million people gathered along Madison Avenue on a Sunday last month for the annual merengue celebration that is the Dominican Day Parade.
 
Making a New Home
 A deputy city human rights commissioner is a Dominican, Rolando T. Acosta.
Emmanuel Gautreau, from Santo Domingo, was the valedictorian at City College this year. Mr. Gautreau, 33, a former handyman, majored in English and wants to be a teacher.
And year after year, the best high school baseball players in the city are Dominicans. Last year's star, Manny Ramirez of George Washington, was the top pick of the Cleveland Indians in the professional draft.
Dr. Lantigua arrived from Santo Domingo in 1972. "In 1975 I was quoted in The New York Times saying, 'We Dominicans should come here, get expertise and go back to the Dominican Republic to use that expertise,' " he recalled.
Instead, Dr. Lantigua applied his skills and training to the poor Dominicans of Washington Heights. They are his patients at Columbia-Presbyterian. Ten years ago, he founded Alianza Dominicana, a community-service agency. He worked on Mayor David N. Dinkins's campaign and fought for the new Council district.
"We have to make New York New York again," he said. "It was immigrants who did it before, European immigrants. Now, it's going to be a mix of Afro-Americans and Latino immigrants.
"We feel that the American dream is still alive. There is more hope here for all Dominicans."

HEADLINE: Unions Court Old Allies: Immigrants and Unorganized

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
"Welcome to the Williamsburg workers' center," a handwritten sign on the wall says in Spanish.
The place is unprepossessing. Inexpensive wood paneling lines the walls of the three plain rooms. An unmarked red metal door faces out on a quiet industrial street in Brooklyn. But to anyone willing to sign up and pay a $12 fee, the center offers a chance to take an English-language course or find out how to obtain unemployment insurance. 
 For many labor leaders, the modest new center represents an innovative community-based approach to organizing, a model that they hope will enable the labor movement to reverse its precipitous slide in recent decades.
In the last 10 years alone, the proportion of workers in the state belonging to unions dropped, to 25 percent from 39 percent. Nationally, the unionized proportion of the work force fell, to 16 percent from 25 percent, in the same period. Comparable statistics are not kept by New Jersey or Connecticut, but several Labor Department officials said those states had experienced similar declines.
 
Rethinking Organizing Strategies
 Labor experts and union leaders attribute the falloff to a host of factors, from the decline of the manufacturing industries,where unions were often strongest, to what union officials view as the lax enforcement of Federal labor laws.
The changed environment has challenged unions to rethink organizing strategies, to become more creative in trying to stanch and, perhaps, reversing their declining fortunes. Although unions once concentrated primarily on organizing individual work sites, many now take a broader approach, sometimes aiming recruitment at entire communities.
"You can't get out of this mess shop by shop," said Nick Unger, the New York political director of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union. "A shop closes, you organize a shop. Three shops close, you organize one or two. You don't build an institutional memory or a union that way."
The center on Whipple Street in the Williamsburg neighborhood is an example of a union's trying to organize workers by appealing to a broad community. Created last year by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, the center is open to adults in Williamsburg and the neighboring Bushwick. Participants can take classes in Spanish literacy, English as a Second Language and other subjects, from sewing to drama.
They also receive associate membership in the union, which helps them obtain discounts on prescription drugs, among other features. The participants can receive counseling on subjects like problems with immigration or social-service agencies or collecting overtime from a reluctant employer.
The point, of course, is to burnish the union's image in a neighborhood of immigrants from Latin America who provide much of the labor for the remaining apparel manufacturers in the city. There is a long-term goal, as well: to build support for the union campaign to become the official representative of more than 3,000 workers in dozens of garment factories in Williamsburg and vicinity.
Although the center opened early last year, it began to solicit members formally and establish class rosters last month. The organizers, using tactics more typically associated with community organizers than labor leaders, went to churches to describe their plans and leafleted at subway stations and outside factories.
Hilda Sepulveda was among nearly 300 people who have enrolled at the center, in a sliver of a building wedged between a McDonald's restaurant and a church just south of Broadway, the main artery in Williamsburg. She signed up for an English class, Ms. Sepulveda said as she registered, because she thinks it will help her "get a better future, a better job."
"I would like to get ahead," she said, speaking in Spanish through an interpreter.
 
'Encouraged Them to Stick With Us'
 Ms. Sepulveda works at a nearby sweater factory, one of 68 plants that belong to a trade association that is the prime target of the union organizing campaign. She said she might be interested some day in joining the union. For the moment, though, she said she is more concerned about learning English.
Ms. Sepulveda's priorities did not displease the director of the center, Ken Thorbourne. "We're trying to build up the good name of the union," Mr. Thorbourne said. "I'd be happy if we accomplished that. But it's also to gain access to people, to train them, to help them fight for their rights.
"We knew we had to try to become part of the community. We needed to offer people something that encouraged them to stick with us."
The union has little choice but to think long-term. All 68 factories in the Williamsburg association have a union, an independent local called the United Production Workers of America. Some workers in the plants, along with the I.L.G.W.U., contend that the local was created by the manufacturers' association and does not adequately represent employees' interests. Trying to unseat an existing union is a politically challenging and legally complex task.
 
Historical Focus of I.L.G.W.U.
 The I.L.G.W.U. is also seeking to organize employees in other nonunion factories in Brooklyn, many of them quite small. The campaign began two years ago and will likely take another two years, Mr. Thorbourne said. The workers' first vote on affiliating with the union will probably be next year, he said.
The workers' center and the factory campaign is one of the responses to the sharp decline of manufacturing in the New York metropolitan region in the last 20 years, a shift that has hurt many industrial unions and forced them to reconsider their recruiting. Despite the falloff in many industrial unions, an estimated 35 to 40 percent of the workers in the city are unionized, primarily because membership in government workers' unions surged in the 80's.
The I.L.G.W.U. union has set up workers' centers in Los Angeles and San Francisco, its president, Jay Mazur, said. In one sense, the strategy reflects the union's historical focus on immigrant workers and their communities, he said. But it also represents a new thrust in the labor movement, adapting tactics from community organizers and the civil rights movement to produce broader recruitment campaigns.
In many cities the Service Employees International Union has been campaigning to unionize custodians, calling the effort "justice for janitors." It has enlisted churches and civil rights leaders in the effort, which it presents more as a social movement than a conventional union campaign.
 
Rallies for Union Linen
 In New York, among other places, the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, which represents workers in men's apparel factories, has been trying to "think social," in the words of Mr. Unger. Sometimes that takes the form of trying to put economic pressure on companies that use products made by nonunion workers. The clothing workers' union, for example, represents employees in commercial laundries that supply linens to New York restaurants. When the union identifies restaurants using linens from nonunion laundries, it sometimes holds rallies in front of those restaurants.
"We can discuss with their patrons just what they are putting on their face," Mr. Unger said. "We remind them that they are putting dirt to their face and that it's a bad thing to do."
Organized labor's decline has tested unions' resourcefulness. Many unions representing public employees, including those in the city, have long railed without much success against city and state governments that contract public services to businesses.
The Communication Workers of America, which represents more than 40,000 state workers in New Jersey, is taking a new tack. It is trying to organize the workers in private social-service agencies. The union is concentrating its initial campaign on agencies that care, at state expense, for handicapped and retarded people in group homes and community centers. The people who work for the agencies are paid 30 to 50 percent less than comparable state workers, said the organizer leading the effort, Marilyn W. Haith. Among other facets, organizing those workers would shrink the disparity between union and nonunion wages.
The effort began a year ago, and the first affiliation vote is to be held today at an association for retarded people in Atlantic County. Ms. Haith said she expected a vote would also be held soon at a similar center in Union County.
The union hopes to organize an estimated 10,000 workers in private agencies that work for the state, she said.
The campaign, like many ventures by other unions, is in its early stages. "We haven't been successful yet," Mr. Thorbourne said. "We'll see if creativity is the answer."

Bush at the U.N.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The moment has come for the President of the United States to step up to his obligation to form and articulate American foreign policy in the wake of the death of Communism and the breakup of the Soviet Union. The forum is the U.N. session opening this week in New York.
The need for a substantive speech, now scheduled for Monday Sept. 23, is all the more pressing because his last attempt -- his dismaying "Chicken Kiev" speech in Ukraine on Aug. 1 -- betrayed a misconceptual framework. That was the first address by a U.S. President that had to be followed by an op-ed article by his national security adviser to explain that what he said was not what he meant. 
 It came with ill grace for Mr. Bush to implicitly derogate his Presidential predecessors from Truman to Reagan, who waged and won the cold war, for having engaged Soviet leaders "in duels of eloquent bluff and bravado."
Worse was his dire warning to the peoples of Ukraine, the Baltics and other republics seeking independence from central Moscow rule that "Americans will not support those who seek independence in order to replace a far-off tyranny with a localdespotism. They will not aid those who promote a suicidal nationalism based upon ethnic hatred."
That was to shore up the Gorbachev Communist centralizers against the likes of the Yeltsin separatists. Though Brent Scowcroft later insisted no pro-union purpose was intended, the plain truth was emphasized in another line: "America's first system of government -- the Continental Congress -- failed because the states were too suspicious of one another and the central government too weak to protect commerce and individual rights."
Came the putsch and its counter-coup, and the restive republics scrapped the centralism to create just the sort of loose articles of confederation Mr. Bush had instructed them were such a failure in our experience.
Small wonder Secretary of State Baker received such a lukewarm reception in the Baltic republics the other day. (The U.S., shamefully, was 39th to recognize their freedom, just after Mongolia.) The people knew their independence came despite the Bush Administration's historically wrongheaded support of Moscow central.
O.K., so the Bush foreign policy zigged while the world zagged, and the U.S. found itself sadly mispositioned on the central issue of our time. That was last month. This is now; time to abandon the old New World Order based on a Gemini hegemony and to set forward the new New World Order based on a high-flying eagle and a multipolar bear.
Can President Bush come up with a conceptual framework in the short time remaining? Yes, if he stops his frenetic travel and lectern-pounding to focus on his U.N. speech.
For openers, quote President Benjamin Harrison, who said in 1888: "We have no commission from God to police the world." Propose to intervene only to protect vital interests, as when an aggressor builds or buys nuclear weaponry. Invite world participation in our space shield to safeguard everyone from nuclear blackmail or accidental missile launch.
State our intent to increase the momentum for freedom around the world, helping those who root out the Communists still lying in the weeds, creating financial magnets and laws to attract free-enterprise investments. Promise to use our economic retaliatory power to break tariff barriers and crush cartels.
Show how we will provide humanitarian aid in the spirit of our past generosity, expecting our prosperous trading partners to do the same, remembering that help toward self-help is the best help -- no Marshall Plans or grandiose designs, especially when assets are wasted on standing armies and legions of spies.
A week is plenty of time to create the "Bush Doctrine." No State Department Pablum; no 15-minute package claiming leadership without being leaderly; no historic mistakes that call for op-ed clarification.
Take yellow pad in hand, Mr. President, and show how America intends to participate in, rather than continue to observe, the sweep of history in the run-up to the millennium. By rising to this intellectual challenge, you will earn the world's attention at your next great forum, in Hawaii three months from now: aboard the battleship Missouri on the 50th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor.

HEADLINE: Judging Robert Gates: Dialogue - Farewell to the Old C.I.A.;
Just the Man For the Job?

BYLINE: By David L. Boren; David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, is chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The confirmation hearings on the nomination of Robert Gates as Director of Central Intelligence give us an opportunity to look into the future as well as the past. I am not among those who have rushed to a negative judgment about Mr. Gates. He would clearly bring valuable experience to the position, having been both a producer of intelligence after serving in several different positions at the C.I.A. and a consumer of intelligence as a member of the National Security Council staff in the Carter and Bush Administrations.
At the same time, serious questions have been raised about his purported knowledge of the Iran-contra affair that demand thorough examination. I will not reach any conclusions about Mr. Gates's nomination until I have obtained answers to these questions in the hearings, which begin today. 
 It is critical that these hearings also mark the beginning of a valuable debate about the future of American intelligence.
I have no quarrel with those who want to overhaul our current system. An intelligence organization designed to meet the challenges of the cold war can no longer do the job -- and would not be worth what we have been paying for it in the past. While spending on intelligence gathering and analysis will remain considerable, it can and should be substantially reduced.
Some people have called for a rearrangement of the intelligence bureaucracy; others have even urged the dismantling of the C.I.A.
While issues may change, policy makers will always need to make informed decisions based on timely and accurate intelligence. We will always need an institution devoted to the collection and analysis of intelligence.
The broad outlines of the new intelligence mission are already taking shape. There must be more emphasis on gathering intelligence from agents and informants rather than relying so much on technological wizardry. We must have better information providing earlier warning of risks to our national security.
The greatest intelligence failure of the gulf war was our inability to detect more quickly the threat that Saddam Hussein posed to his neighbors. With better forecasts about Iraq's intentions, President Bush could have taken early steps like beefing up U.S. presence in the region to deter Iraq's aggression, perhaps avoiding war.
Too much of our intelligence gathering and analysis are still focused on the Soviet Union. While we should not ignore it or Eastern Europe, we must improve our capabilities in the third world and the Middle East and also devote more attention to terrorism and narcotics trafficking. Money no longer needed for Soviet-related intelligence work, which currently takes up half of the intelligence budget, should be more than adequate to finance these new priorities.
In addition, we need to transfer more resources to and build up economic intelligence. The aggressive acts of industrial espionage by foreign governments -- at times in collaboration with their intelligence services -- are a clear indication of this threat. We have yet to determine how to deter these activities and to set appropriate American countermeasures.
Furthermore, as the line between civilian and military threats to our national security becomes blurred, we can no longer afford to support the separate intelligence empires of the C.I.A. and Defense Department that do not talk to each other. Without cooperation, policy makers receive fragmented intelligence.
Finally, we must place less value on bureaucratic consensus in intelligence analysis, and more on clear predictions that leave room for dissenting views. Current intelligence, as Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf observed, is often "caveated, footnoted, and watered down to the point of being irrelevant."
The next Director of Central Intelligence will preside over the first sweeping redesign of American intelligence since the National Security Act was enacted 44 years ago. As Lincoln said, "We must think and act anew." It is critical that our top intelligence official have the vision and determination to do exactly that.

HEADLINE: Humble Sludge Holds Wealth of Soil Nutrients;
Cleaning L.I. Sound

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A critical point not included in your otherwise excellent survey of the sewage treatment plants for metropolitan New York (The Week in Review, Aug. 18) is that all the plants perform only secondary treatment of sewage. They lack the facilities for tertiary treatment to remove the dissolved chemicals in our sewage, which are devastating the ecology of Long Island Sound. Nitrates in particular cause blooms of microscopic organisms, which use up most of the oxygen in the marine waters. 
 Fish and shellfish cannot survive under these conditions, and Long Island Sound is dying biologically from its western end in New York City on toward the east. Heavy metals from industrial sewage accumulates in lobsters and other marine life, making them unsafe for human consumption. Fin rot and cancers afflict some bottom-feeding fish.
The scientists who have been working on plans to save the Sound's ecology want more sewage plants and more control of land runoff of rain to reduce contamination of the Sound; but of special import for the city, they want sewage plants upgraded to tertiary capability. The cost for doing this for city plants that feed their output into the Sound would be far more than the city can afford in its present financial embarrassment.
The only hope for saving Long Island Sound is Federal aid, amounting over the period needed to expand and upgrade pollution control all along the New York and Connecticut shores to about $10 billion, as estimated by Representative George J. Hochbrueckner of Suffolk County.
As Tom Wicker states (column, Aug. 18), such infrastructure projects should be financed by the Federal Government to prime the pump of real recovery. They would offer a way to reduce unemployment and, with some retraining, provide new jobs for engineers, technicians and managers who will become unemployed as defense contracts are reduced.

HEADLINE: Newark's Housing Stock Can Match That of Most Other Cities;
Blame the Tunnel

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your special report "The Two Newarks: Boom Amid Bust" (front page, Aug. 13) questions whether or not Newark can become "livable" again to match its downtown business zone and regain the population it has lost since World War II. 
 Actually, the death knell of Newark's population, which had grown to about 450,000 at its peak, was sounded long before the war.
When I moved from New York to one of Newark's suburbs in 1920, Newark was a residential as well as a business and industrial city. Its school system was rated one of the best in the country. Newark Academy was an outstanding preparatory school dating back to Colonial times. There were three legitimate theaters and several excellent restaurants. These catered to Newark citizens and to suburbanites.
And then came the Holland Tunnel and the growth of automobile ownership. Suddenly, New York City became too close. The Hudson River was no longer a barrier. Broad Street, Newark, surrendered to Broadway, New York. Newark's downward slide in population started then and has continued ever since. Almost all of the people who work in downtown offices commute from out of town.
Despite optimistic soothsayers, I fear that geography has sealed Newark's fate. Only a 21st century miracle may change it.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends the Day Lower As Gold Posts Modest Rise

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed lower yesterday as traders, discouraged by the continuing weakness in the economy, soured on the currency. Gold prices advanced modestly.
Analysts said that nothing new had developed to influence trading, so investors sold the dollar on expectations that the weakened economy would push interest rates lower. 
 On Friday, the Federal Reserve dropped its discount rate, the interest it charges commercial banks, half a percentage point, to 5 percent, after reports indicated that the economic recovery was stumbling.
The pound gained against the dollar, rising to $1.7385 in New York, from $1.7295 late on Friday. In earlier trading in London, sterling rose to $1.7400, from $1.7320 late on Friday.
The dollar lost ground to the Japanese yen, falling to 133.55 yen, from 134.15 on Friday. Markets in Tokyo were closed for a national holiday yesterday, but in London the dollar was quoted at 134.05 Japanese yen, down from Friday's close of 134.45 in Tokyo.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those late Friday, included: 1.6730 German marks, down from 1.6900; 1.4610 Swiss francs, down from 1.4800; 5.6970 French francs, down from 5.7555; 1,252.00 Italian lire, down from 1,266.00, and 1.13615 Canadian dollars, up from 1.13575.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, gold edged higher, picking up 10 cents, to close at $344.50 an ounce. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $344.30, also up 10 cents.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $345.40 an ounce, up from $344.25 late on Friday, while in Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $345.50, up from $344.00. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.08 to close at a bid $345.52.
Also on the Comex, silver gained eight-tenths of a cent to close at $3.998. In London, silver rose to a late bid price of $4.07, up from $3.98 late on Friday.

HEADLINE: Study Sees Lax Bank Regulation

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
A report released today by Congressional auditors criticizes Federal regulators for what it calls their lax supervision of the Bank of New England before it failed.
The report, issued by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, raises new questions for Robert L. Clarke, the Comptroller of the Currency and the bank's chief regulator, who faces confirmation hearings on a second term later this month. 
 The Boston-based bank, part of the Bank of New England Corporation, a $32 billion banking empire in Massachusetts, Maine and Connecticut, failed earlier this year at an estimated cost of $2.5 billion, making it one of the most costly bank failures in history.
 
Actions 'Too Late'
 The G.A.O. asserted that the comptroller's office had repeatedly played down any criticism of the bank, limited the scope of its examinations, raised no questions about the payment of $400 million by subsidiary banks to their holding company between 1987 and 1989, and took no enforcement actions until 1989, by which time "it was too late."
In a statement, Mr. Clarke did not contest the report's accuracy, but called attention to previous testimony in which representatives of the comptroller's office "acknowledged shortcomings in the agency's supervision of Bank of New England during the 1980's."
Mr. Clarke's statement went on to point out policy and organizational changes carried out by his office "to prevent similar problems from occurring again."
 
A Tougher Hearing
 Mr. Clarke, a former Houston lawyer for banks, has been comptroller for almost six years, a period that has seen a record number of bank failures. His next confirmation hearing is expected to be much tougher than his first in 1985.
There has been criticism from both lawmakers and banking experts that Mr. Clarke softened examination and regulatory policies early in his tenure, helping fuel excessive real estate lending by banks. There have also been complaints that much more recently, his examiners have become too restrictive, helping to create a credit crunch. The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs has been waiting for today's report before it goes ahead with the confirmation hearing, which is scheduled for next week.
The comptroller's office regulates nationally chartered banks, which include most of the nation's biggest banks. Mr. Clarke is also a director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the financially troubled agency that inherits the bad loans of a failed bank in its role as insurer.
In some ways, today's report tells the story of a long-simmering financial fire neglected until the fire was out of control.
It was not until 1989, after deterioration of the New England economy, that the comptroller's office significantly increased the level of staffing at the Bank of New England Corporation's banks, from 50 full-time examiners to 125, the report said.
One year earlier, when the comptroller's northeast district office, based in New York, asked for additional resources, the national office refused, citing problems in Texas banks, the G.A.O. said.
Shortly after the bank failed, Mr. Clarke, after being asked at a Senate hearing if more supervisors had been requested or were needed, said, "I really do not think that the problem was not having enough supervisors" but stemmed from the failure to follow up and be more aggressive.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Clarke, Leonora S. Cross, said Mr. Clarke still held to that view and was probably not aware of the request for additional staffing when he testified earlier this year, since "it would have been handled at a lower level."
Between 1985 and 1988, as the Bank of New England grew rapidly and made large real estate loans, Mr. Clarke's examiners found problems. "However, these problems were not characterized in O.C.C. examination reports as seriously affecting bank operations until 1988, " the report said.
In one of its central complaints, the G.A.O. said it was "concerned that O.C.C. did not expand its scope of examinations when these problems were identified."
 
Lagging Enforcement Action
 Despite the failure of the bank to correct its problems and temper its risky growth strategy, "O.C.C. took no enforcement action to compel corrective measures until 1989," but "by that time the New England economy was declining and it was too late," the report concluded.
Today's report was critical of the comptroller's office for not raising questions when more than $400 million was transferred between 1987 and 1989 to the Bank of New England's holding company from the subsidiary banks. Most of these payments were dividends, which, the G.A.O. found, increased by 131 percent between 1988 and 1989.

Hanson to Buy Beazer In $609 Million Deal

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Hanson P.L.C., the largest industrial conglomerate in Britain, said yesterday that it would buy Beazer P.L.C., the British construction group with vast holdings in the United States, for $2.14 a share, or $609 million.
Beazer said it had recommended that shareholders accept the bid, which requires shareholder and regulatory approvals. 
 Under the deal, Hanson will acquire a building-materials concern that includes the Koppers Company in Pittsburgh and home-building operations in Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. In the United States, Koppers is the biggest producer of sand and gravel and the second-biggest producer of aggregates, the concrete component used in construction projects and roads.
"Our long-term faith in the construction industry is bolstered by our belief that we have reached the bottom of its current cycle of recession," Lord Hanson, chairman of Hanson, said. "And we look forward to developing Beazer's well-established businesses alongside our own."
The announcement raised a number of questions among industry analysts about how the acquisition of Beazer would affect Hanson's relationship with Imperial Chemical Industries, the British chemicals company in which Hanson holds a 2.8 percent stake. The purchase of that stake in June created rumors that Hanson would soon seek control of Imperial.
But James M. Brier, director of investor relations for Hanson Industries, the United States arm of Hanson, said the company's holdings in Imperial Chemical Industries were "for investment purposes only," adding that the latest transaction "does not change the situation in any way."
Carol Neves, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, said Hanson had "enough financial power that this acquisition won't be a big deal in terms of interfering with its plans with I.C.I."
Shares of Beazer soared $2.25, to $8.125, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. It was the most active issue on the Big Board, with 13.5 million shares changing hands. Hanson shares rose 37.5 cents on the Big Board on news of the acquisition, closing at $19.
Last week, Beazer issued a prospectus announcing plans to spin off European operations by selling shares in a new company. Beazer has said it intends to base itself in the United States, where the company has operations in 30 states that supply cement, asphalt and other materials.
Hanson owns Hanson Brick, the largest brick maker in Europe. In Britain, the company is also the largest producer of batteries and the second-largest tobacco company. In the United States, Hanson owns the Peabody Coal Company in Kentucky, the country's biggest coal producer.

HEADLINE: Big Airlines Join T.W.A. in Cutting Fares

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
The Big Three airlines -- American, United and Delta -- wasted little time yesterday matching T.W.A.'s $198 round-trip coast-to-coast air fare, which was announced in newspaper advertisements in the morning. By afternoon, the three carriers announced similar fares, although each added a wrinkle or two of its own.
While subject to a number of restrictions, including availability, T.W.A.'s fare is much lower than anything currently available. It is, for example, $140 less than American's current lowest-priced New York-to-San Francisco round trip, and far below American's $756, unrestricted, fully refundable one-way fare between those two points. 
 Industry analysts said that in lowering its fare, T.W.A., which is facing a financial squeeze, was trying to raise cash when airline traffic is entering into its slack post-vacation season. "I'd be surprised if it's anything but a cash-flow move," said Christopher Tunnar, an analyst with Arthur D. Little, a research firm in Cambridge, Mass.
 
Enticement to Fliers
 But Jim Faulkner, T.W.A.'s director of public relations, denied that. "Traffic always falls off this time of year," he said, "so this was our way to entice people to keep flying." He added that it was too early to know how many people took advantage of the new fare yesterday.
No airline can make money on a $198 round trip coast-to-coast fare, Mr. Tunnar said, but airlines occasionally use such prices to lure passengers into their planes. While the first carrier to cut fares is likely to have no more than a one-day advantage, because competitors feel compelled to follow suit to avoid losing market share, that is usually enough time to bring a publicity advantage -- and, if necessary, provide immediate cash, even if at the risk of long-term financial health.
To qualify for the $198 rates, passengers must purchase tickets no later than this Thursday. Tickets are nonrefundable. Purchases must be made at least seven days in advance of a flight, or within 24 hours after booking, whichever comes first. Travel must be completed on or before Dec. 15 and must include a Saturday stay-over. The $198 fare does not apply to flights on Nov. 26 and 27, and Dec. 1, 2 and 3.
T.W.A.'s discount fare is good on flights from New York, Newark, Baltimore and Washington on the East Coast, and from Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose, Orange County and Ontario, Calif., on the West Coast.
 
Others Add Cities
 American has added Islip, L.I., and Newburgh, N.Y., on the East Coast and Burbank and Long Beach in California. It is also offering a $218 round trip between its East Coast cities and San Jose and Oakland, Calif.
United's plan includes White Plains and New Haven, as well as many of the other cities also served by T.W.A. and American, while Delta's fares are also valid between the major cities, as well as Newburgh.
The carriers were unwilling yesterday to predict the likelihood of future fare cuts, but Mr. Tunnar said he would not rule them out.
"The Fed thinks they have to reduce the prime rate another half-point to stimulate the economy, and the travel industry is much the same," he said. "The No. 1 reason for people not traveling is still the recession -- the amount of money they have left over at the end of the day. Somehow the airlines have to do something to fill up the back of their planes."

HEADLINE: Unusual Labor Pact For Nynex

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The Nynex Corporation announced yesterday that it had reached an unusual mid-contract accord with its unions in an effort to avoid another strike like one in 1989, the industry's longest and most bitter since the breakup of A.T.& T.
In the new labor accord, the first of its kind in the telecommunications industry, Nynex is giving pay increases of 13 percent over the next three years. That compares with a 9.2 percent wage rise in the 1989 three-year contract and 10.3 percent in a 1986 agreement. 
 Negotiated 11 months before the old Nynex contract was to expire, the new pact could provide a model for the "Baby Bell" companies and their unions as those contracts expire next year.
 
7 Previous Strikes
 All of the Baby Bells are heavily unionized. There have been seven strikes at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the Baby Bells since the 1984 breakup. Six lasted less than a month, but the seventh, the 1989 Nynex strike, lasted more than four months.
Nynex's revenue growth has slowed as the recession hurt white-collar employment, and that decline has reduced the number of business conversations and data transmissions. Meanwhile, the phone unions have had trouble recruiting members and the recession has meant widescale anxiety about layoffs, discouraging union militancy.
Nynex, the parent of New York Telephone and New England Telephone, also raised the possibility of layoffs of nonunion, white-collar employees. Nynex said that it planned to reduce by 5 percent its 32,000 management workers through "voluntary transfers, retirements or separations and then, if necessary, involuntary separations."
 
First Manager Layoffs
 Kenneth M. Leon, an analyst at Bear, Stearns who follows Nynex, noted that the reductions represented the first time Nynex had sought to lay off managers, a sign that the Northeastern recession was still battering New York Telephone and New England Telephone.
"Normally, I would regard the Nynex labor agreement as positive," Mr. Leon said. "But this is far from conclusive. It's not at all clear whether these moves will generate profits, and the recession may dim any luster of this accord."
Nynex estimates the cost of the new contract at $240 million, compared with $180 million for the old one.
The Nynex agreement is likely be sent in early October to members of the Communications Workers of America, Nynex's principal union, and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
Contracts for nearly a half-million workers at A.T.&T., GTE and the six other Baby Bells expire next year. News of the Nynex accord was announced on Friday, but no details were given then. The preliminary reaction from other unions over the weekend has been positive, a Communications Workers spokesman said.
In Englewood, Colo., U S West, another Baby Bell company, reacted favorably to the early conclusion of labor talks, but said it was not familiar with the details of the talks. "Over all, it's a positive development," said Debra L. Thomas, a spokeswoman for U S West. That company had a seven-day strike in 1986.
 
Cost of Living Provision
 In the new Nynex accord, union members may also get a modest cost-of-living adjustment in 1994 if inflation cumulatively exceeds 9 percent for two years, as well as preserving the health benefits that were the central dispute in 1989. Nynex is also giving pension enhancements, which would provide the early retirement for thousands of workers that some union employees had sought, while helping to trim the ranks of older workers, whose pay and benefits are more expensive.
The Baby Bells have been hit by slow growth in recent years in the majority of their business -- telephone conversations. Last year, Nynex, the second-largest Baby Bell, after BellSouth, posted revenue of $13.6 billion, up about 20 percent since 1986, or less than 4 percent annually for the last five years.
Profits last year totaled $949 million, down 22 percent from 1986, or an annual decline of about 4 percent. Nynex has said the main reason for the profit drop is high costs, including labor.
 
Covers 57,000 Workers
 The agreement announced yesterday extends until August 1995 a three-and-a-half-year accord that would have expired in August 1992. It covers 57,000 telephone technicians, installers, operators, repair workers and others.
About 60,000 workers walked off the job in the 1989 labor dispute, but Nynex has since accepted the early retirement or not filled the jobs of 3,000 workers for a shrinage of the labor force of about 5 percent.

HEADLINE: World Bank Management Shift Is Seen

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
The new president of the World Bank, Lewis T. Preston, is beginning to assert his control over the organization by imposing a new system of senior management used in American corporations, World Bank officials and economic-development experts said today.
Mr. Preston is said to be replacing the bank's three senior vice presidents with a three-member office of the president. The bank's vice presidents -- currently 14, soon to be 17 -- will report directly to the president's office. Under the current system, each vice president reports to one of the senior vice presidents. The World Bank declined to comment. 
 The bank, which has 155 member nations, lends money for development projects in poor countries.
The new management structure may enable the highly bureaucratic organization to respond more swiftly to events in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The Bush Administration is counting on the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to provide large-scale technical assistance to the Soviet Union for such tasks as designing a new customs service and making the ruble convertible into other currencies.
 
'Reform, or a Power Grab'
 The change may improve the bank's efficiency and seems likely to increase Mr. Preston's influence over its bureaucracy in the process, said Richard E. Feinberg, the executive vice president of the Overseas Development Council, an economic- development research center in Washington. "This is an efficiency reform, or a power grab," he said.
A World Bank official who insisted on anonymity said that instead of "each senior vice president running his own little empire, each vice president would report to a committee." He called the change "a fairly dramatic move."
 
May Speed Up Decisions
 Mr. Preston, the former chairman of J. P. Morgan & Company, replaced Barber B. Conable Jr., who retired at the beginning the month.
The new lines of authority may help Mr. Preston tackle the voluminous paperwork and slow decision making that has increasingly mired the World Bank, Mr. Feinberg said.
The senior vice president for finance, Ernest Stern, will be joined in the office of the president by Attila Karaosmanoglu, currently vice president of the Asia regional office, and Sven Sandstrom. Mr. Sandstrom is the current director of a less influential office of the president than the one Mr. Preston is said to be planning.
 
Impact on Two Senior Officials
 The role of the current senior vice president for policy, research and public affairs, Wilfried P. Thalwitz, 59, is unclear, though Mr. Thalwitz will be staying with the bank, his assistant said.
The shake-up includes the retirement of Moeen A. Qureshi, 62, who is the senior vice president of operations and who had previously expressed a desire to retire. Mr. Qureshi did not return telephone calls for comment.
Mr. Qureshi, a Pakistani, has been the most senior World Bank official from a developing country. His departure "might dilute the developing-country executive role," even if a developing-country official is named to the new office of the president, said the World Bank official, adding that he had not yet heard anybody complain about the prospect of the developing world's losing a representative.

HEADLINE: THE SOVIET TRANSITION;
10 Soviet Republics Agree To Coordinate Food Supply

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 16

 BODY:
The disjointed republics of the Soviet Union agreed today on the need for a common approach to food distribution and foreign aid in order to best survive the winter.
The State Council, the 11-day-old transitional national government that includes 10 republic leaders, agreed at a Kremlin meeting to shape a plan for food supply and exchange, according to Ivan S. Silayev, chairman of the economic management committee. 
 The agreement represented a sign of concrete, if still ill-defined, cooperation by the major republics for reasons of mutual need following the breakdown of the Communist Soviet Union in the four weeks since an abortive coup deepened the national crisis.
"This will allow us to plan centralized food purchases from abroad," said Mr. Silayev, who had feared the problem might be left to separate, discordant republics mainly interested in indulging new-found sovereignty.
 
Economic Union Considered
 Beyond the winter food program, the council, led by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, began considering the draft treaty for the proposed creation of a voluntary permanent economic union of any and all of the original 15 Soviet republics.
Officials repeated that the goal was to have republics signed up within three weeks for such an economic union, which would be based on free market principles of private property, a common currency and banking system, free exchange of goods and services, unfettered migration of labor, and coordinated budget, taxation, debt and tariff policies.
The signing would be followed by several months of negotiations to set precise details of the economic compact. The State Council's intention is to emphasize economic interdependence first, before tackling the complex political differences among the republics.
A critical example of the latter was reported near the disputed ethnic enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, where 16 Azerbaijani paramilitary police were killed and 30 wounded in a weekend clash with Armenian militants, according to the Interfax news agency. The enclave lies within Azerbaijan and is populated by separatist-minded Armenians, a situation that has seen hundreds of people killed in border clashes and village vendettas in the last three years.
Beyond an economic union, the State Council, created in the post-coup emergency as an interim national body, is to eventually fashion a plan for a new, looser political confederation that is expected to attract fewer of the republics. This would be separate from the economic union and based on a new constitution and national elections and rooted in republic home rule.
The 10 republics represented at the Kremlin meeting heard Grigory A. Yavlinsky, vice chairman of the economic management committee, stress that the economic draft treaty clearly recognizes the independence of all the republics.
Mr. Yavlinsky, the chief free-market planner of the interim government, is being counted on by American and other foreign observers to instill some urgency into the current attempts to use the economy to revive the Soviet nation in some new form.
The United States has been emphasizing the need for concrete progress before any large-scale emergency aid might be attempted. But critics within the nation and without have begun complaining that the transitional council thus far lacks a sense of urgency.
Tonight, a council majority was reported agreeing "in principle" to the economic union draft but planning to put off final confirmation until some time after Oct. 1.
 
Food Output Dropping
 The State Council heard more grave statistics on falling food production, which has been dropping lately at an annual rate of 10 to 12 percent, officials said. Beyond the food distribution plan and draft economic union, the council also agreed to fashion a blueprint for reforming the nation's agriculture by the end of the month, Mr. Silayev said.
Among the food shortages, the need for grain and sugar is common to all the 10 republics in the State Council, according to Mr. Silayev, the economic chairman who is also Prime Minister of the Russian federated republic. By agreeing to work out a single food aid plan, he said, the republics demonstrated "we are all now working hand- in-hand."
He promised tabulation of the needs of each republic and promises of exchanges to balance out the shortages and take best advantage of any foreign aid so that the winter, while difficult, might prove free of hunger. The meeting included all the republics but Moldavia, Georgia and the now independent Baltic states -- Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
On the separate problem of control of Soviet nuclear weapons in a looser political confederation, the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, declared in an interview with ABC News that the republic intended to keep its weapons on its territory and exercise joint control over them with the Kremlin. "We can not allow other republics, even the largest of them, to control nuclear weapons on our soil," he declared, referring to the offer by President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian republic to safeguard the weapons on behalf of other republics.

HEADLINE: Largest Insurer in New Jersey, Allstate, Seeks to End Coverage

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG

 BODY:
The Allstate Insurance Company, the largest insurer in New Jersey, said yesterday that it would seek regulatory approval to stop writing virtually all types of coverage in the state.
Blaming years of losses from its core auto-insurance operation, Allstate said its withdrawal would affect insurance covering more than 400,000 New Jersey cars, about 250,000 residences, a number of small and mid-sized businesses and tens of thousands of boats, mobile homes and recreational vehicles. It would also mean a loss of 1,400 jobs in the state. 
 Allstate's announcement, which stunned insurance professionals, was immediately seen as a challenge to Gov. Jim Florio, whose populist message calling for lower insurance premiums and reform of New Jersey's insurance laws helped him win the State House.
 
Deal Seems Unlikely
 The possibility remained that the company and the Governor might reach a political solution, with Allstate receiving some rate increase in return for agreeing to remain in New Jersey, but Mr. Florio's tone yesterday did not make it appear likely.
"We could have kept Allstate in New Jersey by agreeing to the 28 percent rate increase they wanted to charge our drivers," he said. "That wouldn't be fair, and we won't be blackmailed into agreeing."
After Allstate's lawyers delivered nearly 500 pounds of documents to the state insurance department outlining the company's withdrawal plans, the Governor said in a statement: "When I was growing up in Brooklyn, there was always one guy who would say that if you didn't play by his rules he would take his bat and ball and go home. If that's what an insurance company wants to do, we won't back down from out commitment to fairness for drivers and reasonable rates."
It thus appeared likely that Allstate would leave New Jersey. Consumers would not be left high and dry, however, because state law requires Allstate to secure alternative coverage for its customers, but it was widely agreed that the withdrawal of such an important company would bring more uncertainty to a auto-insurance market already in upheaval.
 
Rates Among Highest
 Rates for auto insurance in New Jersey are among the nation's highest, with a typical family paying $1,074 a year for basic coverage, compared with $798 in New York, $719 in Pennsylvania and $555 a year in Illinois. In addition to the high rates, New Jersey's state-run insurance company for motorists with questionable driving records has a $3 billion deficit. Also, Governor Florio recently signed a law that would require auto insurers to accept virtually all applicants.
Faced with this law, and with restrictions limiting their ability to charge premiums based on age, marital status and zip code, as is common elsewhere, a number of other auto insurers, much smaller than Allstate, have filed for permission to leave New Jersey.
State Farm, ranked No. 2 in New Jersey, is seeking to limit its participation in the bailout of the bankrupt state-run insurance company. State Farm wants to set up a new auto insurance operation in New Jersey that would be much smaller than its existing operation.
The cutbacks in New Jersey are part of a much larger trend. Insurers nationwide have been seeking to scale back their coverage, contending that they faced losses that could be traced almost entirely to oppressive regulation. South Carolina, California, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania are only some of the states that have seen insurers pull up stakes. And the carriers involved have included some of the best-known names in the business: Aetna, Travelers, Cigna, the Hartford, and Crum & Forster.
While each company has treated its business differently -- some have pulled out entirely; others have stayed in certain lines of insurance in certain states -- their basic point is the same: The insurers contend that state regulation, particularly regarding auto insurance, has prevented them from collecting large enough premiums to cover claims and overhead and to generate an adequate return.
New Jersey has been an industry battleground. The state, with more cars per highway mile than any other state, has one of the highest rates of accidents and auto theft in the country. As a result, the cost of providing insurance is higher in New Jersey than just about anywhere else, and insurers argue, New Jersey's sky-high rates notwithstanding, exceed revenues from premiums.
Furthermore, they argue, recently passed laws in New Jersey that limit an insurer's ability to set premium rates based on a driver's sex or marital status may seem fair but make little economic sense. Insurers contend that rates overall need to be higher still, and that there should be a broader range of rates.
Then there is the issue of New Jersey's bankrupt state-run insurance company. Better known as the Joint Underwriting Association, or J.U.A., the state-run company came into existence in the early 1980's as a successor to the state's assigned-risk plan. Under that program, motorists with bad driving records were assigned to various private insurers. But with their premiums for assigned-risk drivers held too low by regulators, insurers lost money on their assigned-risk business. So the J.U.A. was created to remove the problem from the private insurers' hands.
 
No Better Luck
 But the State of New Jersey has been no better at producing profits than the insurers: With rates held low, the J.U.A. has long run at a loss. Indeed, the rates in the J.U.A. were so low that in the mid 1980's many New Jersey motorists actually volunteered to be in it, creating a $3 billion deficit.
Faced with this shortfall, Governor Florio has moved to try to get private insurers to bail out the program. But the insurers are resisting and have gone to court to block the Governor's efforts.
Allstate argues that the J.U.A. mess is but one example in a pattern of bad regulation that it says has caused auto insurers large and small to lose money in New Jersey for years. Allstate has lost $450 million on auto insurance in the state over the last 20 years, with $72 million of that in the last year alone.
Acknowledging that the rest of its New Jersey business, including homeowners' policies and coverage for boats, recreational vehicles and mobile homes, is profitable, Allstate said it would like to remain in New Jersey, if it could stopping writing auto policies.
But a New Jersey law that bars an insurer from selecting only profitable business means that Allstate must give up all of its insurance licenses to escape its money-losing auto operation. The law's one exception is life insurance, and Allstate will continue to sell that in New Jersey.
"Under no system would insurance in New Jersey be inexpensive," said Michael J. McCabe, a top Allstate lawyer. "There are simply too many accidents producing too many broken cars and broken bodies. But the regulatory system has not allowed the price of insurance to cover the cost."
Although other auto insurers, including Geico, Kemper, Nationwide and Safeco, left New Jersey years ago, citing the same inability to recover high costs, Allstate is by far the largest carrier to announce a withdrawal. With 435,000 cars protected by its policies, Allstate enjoys a leading 15.9 percent share of the New Jersey market.
Largely as a result, the withdrawal process for Allstate will be drawn out and complex. Essentially, it has three phases.
In phase one, the state's insurance commissioner, Samuel F. Fortunato, will have to review Allstate's withdrawal plans. Mr. Fortunato has the power to assign conditions, like forcing Allstate to continue renewing its customers' policies until it has obtained replacement coverage. In a statement issued late today from Pittsburgh where he was attending a meeting of insurance commissioners, Mr. Fortunato hinted that he would pursue this avenue.
In phase two, Allstate will encourage its customers to find alternative coverage. Given the large number of insurers that continue to do business in New Jersey, many of them profitably, most of Allstate's customers should have no problem finding a new carrier, although the price of new coverage may not be the same.
In phase three, it will be up to Allstate to find a carrier for the customers who are not able to find a new insurer on their own. Under New Jersey law, Allstate would have to stay with its customers for at least five years before it could abandon them.
While most insurance analysts viewed yesterday's announcement by Allstate as serious, and they urged consumers to begin looking for a new insurer, some consumer groups were skeptical, saying it might all be a bluff by Allstate to win new rate concessions. They noted that Allstate had spent tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees to avoid having to participate in the bailout of the state-run insurer. And they noted that Allstate recently filed for a rate increase.
"Are they really going to pull out?" asked Robert Hunter, president of the National Insurance Consumer Organization. "Before Proposition 103 passed in California and rolled back rates in that state, there were the same sort of threats."

HEADLINE: Frito-Lay to Cut Costs, Eliminating 1,800 Jobs

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
After two years of fending off rival snack food companies with price cuts, coupons and costly promotions, Frito-Lay Inc. announced big changes yesterday to lower its cost of doing business.
The battles between market leader Frito-Lay, No. 2 Borden Inc. and Anheuser Busch's third-place Eagle Snacks Inc., have lowered the profits of all the major makers of potato and corn chips, pretzels and other salty snacks. But the competition has been a boon to consumers, who have become less tolerant of price increases. 
 "It's a war and they are all bleeding," Max Busetti, editor of the Food Industry Newsletter in Alexandria, Va., said of the snack companies. "There is no other aisle in the supermarket where the competition is so severe."
Frito-Lay, a Pepsico Inc. subsidiary based in the Dallas suburb of Plano, Tex., said yesterday that it planned to cut 1,800 people from its payroll, about 7 percent of its work force. The company said the move would save $100 million a year, which would permit it to keep price increases to a minimum. The company is also trying to bolster profit margins, which have been sagging this year.
Some analysts applauded the Frito-Lay move, and predicted that other types of consumer-products would also be forced to hold down price increases.
"It is not just the recession," said George Thompson, an analyst with Prudential Securities. "It is not only a fundamental strategic shift for Frito-Lay. It is indicative of what everybody else is going to have to do."
Analysts said that consumers were increasingly value conscious, as evident from the success of discounter retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
The restructuring will result in a $91 million charge against Pepsico's third-quarter earnings to cover severance costs and changes in some Frito-Lay factories.
Pepsico also said another division, Kentucky Fried Chicken, would take a $9 million charge because of delays in the national introduction of its new skinless fried chicken, which has met a lukewarm reception in markets where it has appeared. That will bring the total third-quarter charge to $100 million. In the third quarter of last year, Pepsico earned $336.6 million on revenue of $4.4 billion.
Pepsico stock fell 37.5 cents a share, to $29.125, yesterday in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The cost cutting is designed to shore up the slipping earnings margins of Frito-Lay, which is Pepsi's largest profit producer -- earning even more than the Pepsi-Cola division. Last year, Frito-Lay, whose brands include Fritos and Doritos corn chips and Lay's potato chips, accounted for 42 percent of Pepsi's operating profit.
 
Cuts Follow McKinsey Study
 The reductions had been expected, given that McKinsey & Company consultants had been reviewing Frito-Lay's headquarters operation for months. Still, the cuts were nearly three times what most analysts had expected.
The cuts were especially severe at the company's headquarters, where 800 people, or nearly one-third of the 2,800 people employed there, will lose their jobs.
By streamlining operations, Frito-Lay hopes to grow by building sales at the expense of its competitors.
Analysts say that Frito-Lay made the cuts from a position of strength. In August, the company restructured its regional offices to give more power to executives in the field.
Frito-Lay's chairman, Roger Enrico, a veteran of the price-sensitive cola market from his days as president of Pepsi-Cola, said in a statement, "Our view of the marketplace, and consumers' continual pursuit of products offering the best value, forces us to take a hard look at every facet of our business and take serious action."
 
'Blood Everywhere'
 Other snack food executives were more blunt in their analysis of the market. "There is blood everywhere," said George Waydo, president of Borden Inc.'s snack food division, whose brands include Cheeze Doodles and Krunchers potato chips.
Mr. Waydo said it was unlikely that Frito-Lay's moves would result in a fresh round of price cutting in the industry. "It is not possible to sell potato chips any cheaper," he said.
Mr. Waydo said that Frito-Lay's cost structure was now more in line with the levels of profits in the industry. Borden took a $650 million charge two years ago in an extensive cost-cutting program.
Kevin Bowler, president of Eagle Snacks, said he was not concerned about Frito-Lay's moves. Mr. Bowler said Eagle continued to gain market share from Borden and regional companies. "Eagle has grown at the fastest rate in the industry for the past three years," he said.
Frito-Lay has been discounting its products heavily for months, but the restructuring apparently reflects a permanent shift in the company's strategy.
 
With Price Cuts, 'Nobody Wins'
 Still, some analysts are not convinced price cuts will restore Frito-Lay's profit margins to their historical levels of more than 20 percent.
"When you start cutting prices, nobody wins," said William Leach, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "I'm not sure that it's the correct strategy."
He said that more attention should be paid to introducing exciting new products.
A Frito-Lay spokeswoman, while acknowledging that "price is a major piece" of the changes, said that the plan also called for new products.
The company has said that it also planned to cut its product line by one-third, eliminating poor sellers. "If it is not going to contribute to our business, it is gone," the spokeswoman said yesterday.

HEADLINE: Subic Bay Pact Moves to New Arenas

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA, Sept. 16

 BODY:
After hours of impassioned, even tearful debate in the Philippine Senate over sovereignty, national pride and the role of the United States in the life of its former colony, the Senate vote today to reject a new American lease on the Subic Bay Naval Station leaves the future of the huge base in the hands of the Philippine courts and voters.
The courts will be asked to determine the constitutionality of a proposal by President Corazon C. Aquino for a referendum on the base, the largest American military installation in Southeast Asia. 
 If the courts find Mrs. Aquino's proposal conforms with the constitution, voters will be asked to weigh an initiative intended to overrule the Senate and allow thousands of American troops to remain at Subic Bay for an additional 10 years. Opinion polls suggest that the public supports the treaty.
American officials said today that the Bush Administration had decided to wait until after the referendum to begin a major withdrawal from Subic Bay, a decision that will extend the nearly century-old United States military presence here for at least several months, if not years.
 
'We Do Not Want Servitude'
 The American Embassy in Manila released a statement today that said the United States "stands fully behind" Mrs. Aquino in "her continuing efforts to put in place the new treaty." The treaty for the base expired today.
Senators walked slowly to the podium in the Senate chamber to explain their votes. They made clear that whatever transpired, the rejection of the treaty was a moment of history, a "declaration of independence," some said.
"This is a decision to break off the last shackles of the past," said Senator Tito Guingona, his eyes brimming with tears. "We want friendship with America. We want trade. But we do not want servitude.
"For 500 years this land has been occupied or dominated by foreigners in one form or another. It is time we came into our own, time to become truly self-reliant, time to end our dependence on the United States."
Senator Agapito Aquino, a brother-in-law of the President and the younger brother of her slain husband, Benigno S. Aquino, said the vote would be remembered as the "dawn of our nation's birth."
 
Plea for Independence
 "It is a vote for a truly sovereign and independent Filipino nation," he said. "It is a vote to end a political adolescence tied to the purse strings of America, a crippling dependence."
Mr. Aquino said he decided to vote against the treaty after determining that "I love my country more than I love my President."
Supporters of the agreement said the rejection had, for the sake of a stubborn show of national pride, put at risk the livelihoods of tens of thousands of countrymen and was a needless slap at the United States.
"I disagree with the claim that the base is the last vestige of colonialism in this country," Senator John Osmena said. "To reject this treaty is to reject 100 years of shared experience with the United States."
Supporters of the treaty in the 23-member Senate fell 5 votes short of the two-thirds majority, or 16 votes, needed for ratification. The Senate acted in a show of hands on a so-called nonconcurrence resolution, a motion to reject the treaty. The vote was 12 in favor of the motion and 11 against.
Outside the building, there was an even more spirited debate, as thousands of demonstrators for and against the treaty gathered in heavy rains.
 
Plan for Referendum
 Many of those backing the base arrived by bus early this morning from their homes in Olongapo, the coastal city of 300,000 that adjoins Subic Bay and that will almost certainly be devastated if the base closes. "The city will die," said Daniel Quiambao, 45, an executive who once worked at the base.
On Sunday night, Mrs. Aquino announced in a televised address that she would invoke the Constitution and seek a referendum on the base if, as expected, the Senate rejected the treaty. Reviving the cry of "people power" with which she ousted President Ferdinand E. Marcos in 1986, Mrs. Aquino proposed that "we take the issue directly to the people."
Mrs. Aquino's role in the debate reverses the stand she took in the mid-80's, before being elected President, when she opposed American bases in the Philippines. Her decision to support a new treaty is in large part a pragmatic response to the nation's crippling economic problems, which were compounded by eruption of Mount Pinatubo last June.
The eruption forced the United States Air Force to abandon Clark Air Base on the central island of Luzon after it had been smothered by ash. The shutdown of the base is expected to remove hundreds of millions of dollars each year from the Philippine economy and leave thousands of Filipinos unemployed at a time when the unemployment rate is above 15 percent.
The decision of the Bush Administration to support Mrs. Aquino in holding a national referendum may have put the United States in an awkward position, as a partisan in what may be the most highly charged issue in the general election next year.
American officials insisted that they had not pressured Mrs. Aquino to sponsor the referendum, although they added that many Filipinos would doubtlessly suspect such pressure.
 
Petition Drive Planned
 Under plans outlined by Mrs. Aquino on Sunday, treaty supporters will begin gathering the signatures of 10 percent of the voters, or three million people, on petitions to authorize a referendum.
Specialists in Philippine law say the referendum process will face legal challenges at virtually every turn, beginning with challenges to the validity of the signatures on the petitions, and the vote itself may not take place until the middle of next year.
Perhaps the most important legal challenge will be on constitutionality, and scholars are divided on whether the constitution allows a referendum to overturn a Senate vote on a treaty, as opposed to regular legislation.

HEADLINE: U.N. MAY DEPRIVE THE MAJOR POWERS OF ITS TOP POSTS

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 16

 BODY:
As the United Nations General Assembly prepares to open its 46th annual session Tuesday, negotiators from 22 nations have agreed on a plan that would deprive the United States and other powers of the senior posts they have automatically claimed.
The plan, worked out by 22 industrial and developing countries, including the United States and the other permanent Security Council members, is intended to streamline the unwieldy United Nations Secretariat and increase the power of the new Secretary General to be chosen next month. 
 Diplomats said the plan reflected the end of cold war rivalry between the Soviet Union and the United States. This has paved the way for a less politicized organization that could respond to global problems and be run by impartial civil servants loyal to the Secretary General rather than the governments that posted them here.
 
Regional Issues on Agenda
 The Assembly is meeting at a time when there is no overarching superpower crisis, but when a number of regional issues like those in Yugoslavia and the Middle East need solution.
Although seven new nations will be admitted in this sesssion, raising the total United Nations membership from 159 to 166, the General Assembly still has to choose a president for the session and a new Secretary General.
The draft plan condemns the organization's unwieldy hierarchy, under which 30 to 40 top officials report directly to the Secretary General. It says this structure grew up over the years in a series of "ad hoc responses to specific problems" and as a result of of the "distorting effect" of the cold war.
 
Four Major Departments
 Instead, the draft plan proposes a pyramid-like administrative structure, with the work of the organization divided between four major departments -- political and security affairs, humanitarian and human rights issues, development and environmental questions and management and finance. Each is to be headed by a deputy secretary general chosen by the Secretary General and reporting to him.
These four deputies would then supervise the work of a third layer of about 20 under secretaries with more tightly defined responsibilities.
The United States, France and China have not yet formally accepted all the limits the plan would place on their control over top posts. But diplomats said they were likely to do so, because many developing countries have conditioned their agreement to the changes in the administrative structure to the big powers' making these sacrifices.
The five permanent members of the Security Council -- the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France -- are considering about 20 possible replacements for Javier Perez de Cuellar, who says he wants to step down as Secretary General at the end of the year. The former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees, Sadruddin Aga Khan, and the Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister, Boutros Ghali, are two of the most frequently mentioned candidates.
The 15-nation Security Council, which first selects the Secretary General, hopes to act by the end of October. The candidate it chooses then needs endorsement by the General Assembly.
The Assembly is expected to vote unanimously on Tuesday morning to admit the seven new members, including the three Baltic states, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. The other states being admitted are North Korea, South Korea, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. Assembly members then vote by secret ballot to elect a president for the session.
 
Asian Nations Can't Agree
 Usually, the choice for president of the Assembly, a largely ceremonial post, is worked out beforehand. But this year a problem arose because the Asian nations, whose turn it is to fill the post, could not agree on a candidate.
The Foreign Minister of the Pacific nation of Papua New Guinea, Sir Michael T. Somare, declared his candidacy first and is expected by many to win. But he faces a strong challenge from Saudi Arabia's United Nations representative, Samir S. Shihabi, and a less threatening one from Yemen's delegate, Abdalla Saleh al-Ashtal.
The new administrative plan, now being circulated to General Assembly members, speaks of "a widespread consensus" that the United Nations must be restructured if it is "to provide support for the expanded range of activities which member states expect and the increasingly important role of the Secretary General."
It says it is "unreasonable to impose on the new Secretary General a structure which he or she will find so much difficulty in managing, which reflects past problems not present realities, and which the new Secretary General, as chief administrative officer, has had no input in shaping."
The draft proposal breaks radically with present practice by proposing that no more than one national of any member country may serve as an under secretary general or higher at the same time. And it says no senior official should be succeeded by a national of the same state.
This would end the present system under which the big powers have established monopolies over certain key Secretariat posts, in effect depriving the Secretary General of the power to appoint whomever he wants.
 
Usual Division of Posts
 The United States, for instance, traditionally provides the under secretary general for General Assembly affairs, a post now occupied by Ronald I. Spiers, a former Under Secretary of State for Management.
The Soviet Union takes the top Secretariat post in charge of Security Council affairs, Britain provides the official running peacekeeping operations, France the top economic coordination post, and a Chinese looks after technical help for developing countries.
Many of these officials have had distinguised records of service to the United Nations. Sir Brian Urquhart, for instance, the retired British Under Secretary General, is widely respected as one of the creators of United Nations peacekeeping. But the practice of reserving key posts for nationals of major nations runs contrary to the United Nations Charter's call for an international civil service responsible only to the organization.

HEADLINE: U.S. May Delay Withdrawal From Bases in the Philippines

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is now indicating that it may wait months before withdrawing from its bases from the Philippines, in the hope that President Corazon C. Aquino will prevail in her attempt to extend the lease on the installations, Administration officials said today.
President Bush and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said last week that the United States would make no further concessions on the lease terms and would begin withdrawing immediately if Philippines officials refused to extend the base agreement. 
 But the Administration seemed to modify that stance shortly after Mrs. Aquino spoke in support of the bases at a rally in Manila for renewing the treaty for the Subic Bay Naval Station and vowed to conduct a referendum on the pact if the Senate rejected it.
Polls in the Philippines show 70 to 80 percent of the people favor extending the base treaty.
 
'We Support Her Efforts'
 "It has been our view that if the agreement was rejected by the Philippines, then we would have to withdraw, and I think that remains the case," a spokesman for the State Department, Richard Boucher, said. "What you have now is a situation where President Aquino has continued her efforts to seek ratification of the agreement. We support her efforts to find a way for the Philippine side to ratify the agreement and will continue to follow the process closely."
A State Department official familiar with the negotiations said the battle over bases marked an important juncture for Mrs. Aquino and her supporters in their fight against nationalists who have opposed her administration's economic policies and aid from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
Elections are set for next year, and Mrs. Aquino is seeking to marshal public support to deal her opposition a crushing blow, as well as to avoid poisoning economic relations with the United States.
 
Largest Base in Pacific
 Mrs. Aquino is pushing hard to keep the Subic Bay base, which employs more than 37,000 Filipino workers and pumps more than $344 million a year into the economy.
The State Department wants an American military presence in the Philippines to help anchor the economy there and head off unrest. The United States is also concerned about the cost of relocation.
For the Pentagon, Subic Bay is the largest Navy base in the Pacific and a major ship-repair and supply depot for the Seventh Fleet. Nearby Clark Air Base was closed this year after volcanic ash smothered it. Its functions are being shifted to other installations.
Despite the mutual interests, there is no evidence that American officials engineered Mrs. Aquino's call for the referendum as a device to prolong the American presence. The Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Richard H. Solomon, said in an interview that the referendum is "all her initiative."
Mrs. Aquino faces an uphill fight just to land the measure on the ballot.
 
'Wait and See' Attitude
 The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, said Mrs. Aquino would need more than three million signatures, representing 10 percent of the eligible electorate, to put the issue to a vote. The process could take six months and is certain to face stiff court challenges from opponents of the treaty.
An Administration official said today that the United States would adopt a "wait and see" attitude and seek to avoid any action that could undermine Mrs. Aquino's efforts. "The procedures involved and how they go about that is a matter for the Philippine Government to determine," said Mr. Boucher.
The Pentagon is starting to take its own actions. Navy and State Department representatives are to start talks soon with Asian countries, including Japan and Singapore, about relocating ship-repair and maintenance yards, as well as supply depots from Subic Bay.
Pentagon officials said that Subic Bay could not be reproduced at any one site and that it was considering shifting some functions to bases in Guam, Hawaii and San Diego.
Mr. Solarz estimated that building installations or improving existing ones could cost "a couple of billion dollars." The Pentagon would also be quite likely to pay up to an additional $600 million a year in labor costs if the Navy moves from the low-cost shipyard at Subic Bay, he said.

HEADLINE: New Methods Sought To Dispose of Rockets With No Harm to Earth

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
FOR half a century the wizards of military rocketry have vied to build bigger, better and more deadly missiles armed with warheads of terrifying power. Now they are racing to find innovative ways to tear the missiles apart or divert them to other uses.
The sprawling new enterprise of destruction and conversion has been born of East-West arms control and police actions undertaken by the United Nations in Iraq. All told, it involves thousands of missiles. The scope and complexity of the job are challenging the creativity of scientists, engineers and government officials around the world.
 
The Wake of the Coup
 Moreover, the recent failure of the Kremlin coup and the subsequent purge of Soviet hard-liners has increased calls around the world for a redoubling in the pace of nuclear disarmament, which, if realized, would swell the ranks of discarded armaments. 
 In essence, missiles are big tubes filled with exotic alloys, toxic chemicals and explosive fuels. They can blow up if they get too old or if they are roughly handled. They can create a nightmare of noxious fumes if burned on the ground.
They could be converted for use in launching satellites into space, but the process is costly and tricky. Also, they could then threaten private industry with unfair competition and produce exhaust fumes that might damage the ozone layer.
All aspects of the retirement process are now under intense scrutiny, by both private and government experts. One aim is to make the conversion of missiles as inexpensive and non-threatening as possible. Another is to make missile destruction safer and more environmentally benign, in response to both public protests over missile burning and tough new environmental laws and regulations.
"There are a lot of people scratching their heads, trying to think up innovative technologies," said Dr. Cheryl K. Rofer, a researcher at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. She heads an effort to develop an innocuous way of destroying solid-rocket fuel, which when burned can create clouds of hydrochloric acid and other hazardous chemicals.
The new age of missile deactivation began with the 1987 signing of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Force treaty, under which the United States eliminated 846 short-range missiles and the Soviet Union destroyed 1,846. It picked up this year when the United Nations went into Iraq to oversee the ruination of Saddam Hussein's missile arsenal, the dimensions of which are currently unknown. In the near future, it is to likely to expand greatly to include the destruction or conversion of 2,000 or so long-range missiles under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start, signed in late July by President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
 
Crude Methods Criticized
 The I.N.F. treaty, which pioneered the whole process, also generated strong criticism over its relatively crude methods. For the United States, the easiest and most benign job was taking apart the 21-foot-long ground-launched cruise missiles, which were cut longitudinally by huge saws. Wings and tail sections were severed and the missile's front section, containing guidance equipment, was crushed. Liquid fuel was removed and recycled.
The dirtiest job turned out to be disposing of the Pershing missiles, which were 35 feet long and filled with the standard type of solid fuel, made up of a dense, rubbery binder containing up to 20 percent aluminum particles. A decision was made to fire the engines on the ground, even though their exhaust contained aluminum oxide, titanium dioxide, hydrochloric acid and asbestos. After a test firing in Utah, local opposition swelled as missile exhaust blew across the desert into Salt Lake City.
"The smoke probably added to the pollution already in the valley and may have contributed" to reports of respiratory problems, Burnell Cordner, the director of Utah's Bureau of Air Quality, told state officials.
The thunder of Pershing destruction was centered in Colorado and Texas, and eventually just Karnack, Tex., as protests erupted in Colorado. Even then, the weather had to be just right to avoid an inversion layer that would concentrate clouds of pollutants near the ground.
 
The Possibilities of Oxidation
 "We have safely, and with appropriate environmental safeguards, eliminated all the rocket motors," Lieut. Col. Jeffrey Russell, commander of the Army ammunition plant in Karnack, announced in May after the last firing took place.
Public protests and passage of new environmental laws have helped spur a surge of new military research on benign ways to dispose of missiles, and, especially, solid-rocket fuel. "We consider open burning to be hazardous and unnecessary," said Lenny Siegel, the chief researcher of the Military Toxics Project of the National Toxics Campaign Fund, based in Boston, a private group that helped lead the protests.
At Los Alamos, researchers are studying a novel pressure cooker that heats and destroys solid-rocket fuel in a cloud of dense steam. The process is based on oxidation, in which oxygen reacts with other materials. Oxidation happens slowly in the human body and very quickly in a fire or explosion. The Los Alamos process seeks a middle ground.
To date, a prototype apparatus has processed only minuscule amounts of material, on the order of a gallon an hour. But it is seen as holding promise for large-scale application.
"Can we put these sensitive compounds in the reactor and not have them blow up?" asked Dr. Rofer of Los Alamos. "The answer so far seems to be yes."
The Los Alamos research is financed in part by the Air Force, which has responsibility for the nation's long-range offensive missiles and is exploring a variety of innovative ways to recycle or destroy them. The work is centered at the Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency, at Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City, Fla.
"We think it can have economic and environmental benefits," said Dr. Joseph D. Wander, a fuels chemist at the facility.
 
Police Action in Iraq
 One aim of the program is to investigate new ways to remove rubbery solid fuel from metal casings, the traditional method being a high-pressure stream of cool water, which is slow and inefficient. In one study, super-cold liquid nitrogen is being applied to the fuel, quickly reducing it to a powder that can be processed or recycled. In another, a high-pressure stream of very hot water is played over the surface, rapidly dissolving the fuel. This technique, however, cannot be used on solid fuel that contains nitroglycerine (often used to give an added kick to upper-stage engines) lest it explode.
Surprisingly, the Air Force is even investigating whether special breeds of anaerobic microorganisms, which need no air, can digest some dilute components of rocket fuel. "They convert it to a simple salt," said Dr. Wander. "That process is close to being ready to go."
Not all missile destruction is so sophisticated. In Iraq this year, after the Gulf war, the United Nations began a sweeping police action to destroy all weapons of mass destruction, including any Iraqi missiles with a range of more than 93 miles. Iraq presented 62 missiles for destruction, most of them Scuds fueled by kerosene and red fuming nitric acid. Experts suspect there may be dozens or even hundreds of other Scuds still undisclosed.
Between June 30 and July 7, United Nations personnel presided over the destruction of the missiles and their support equipment, including warheads and fuel trucks. The main technique was pulverization with a heavy weight.
"It was a bulldozer with a big steel bucket on the end," said Col. Douglas M. Englund of the United States Army who is executive director for operations of the United Nations Special Commission operating in Iraq. "They came in and pulverized the aft end, with the motor, and the front end, with the guidance system. It turns out to be a fairly difficult job."
In the near future, the pace of world-wide missile retirement is to pick up under the Start treaty, which the Soviets, despite the current political turmoil, have pledged to carry out. Its terms require the destruction of missile silos, submarines and bombers, but spare missiles, can, under strict guidelines, be reused for other purposes. The question now getting high-level attention in Washington is what to do with the 800 to 1,000 American missiles that will be retired, mainly aging Minuteman 2's and Poseidon C-3's.
Some will be kept for military research and the Pentagon's anti-missile program, officials say. But since Start places limits on how much data can be encrypted during test flights, the Defense Department is unlikely to use the boosters for operations that are considered sensitive.
A vigorous debate is now heating up over whether many of the missiles should be converted into civil and commercial launchers that would be able to loft small payloads into space. Experts such as Dr. Paul J. Coleman Jr., the president of the Universities Space Research Association, say this would be a boon for scientific research. But others fear that a sudden wave of small launchers would be a competitive blow to the nation's fledgling commercial launching industry, which is struggling to survive.
"It sounds good to convert swords into plowshares," said David W. Thompson, the president of the Orbital Sciences Corporation, a small-rocket maker based in Fairfax, Va. "But we think the plows will be fairly expensive and not very good performers." The ultimate fear of his industry, he added, was that "the Government will inadvertently compete with the private sector."
Douglas R. Graham, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for space, recently echoed that concern in testimony to the House space subcommittee. "Without adequate controls," he said, "dumping of government developed 'excess assets' could have devastating effects."
Environmental groups are also leery of a surge in small rockets, fearing an increasing rate of damage to the earth's ozone layer. Experts are divided on the extent of the danger.
In the end, some experts believe many of the missiles covered by the Start treaty will end up being destroyed or recycled, if only because of their age. The Minuteman 2 is nearly two decades old, and is considered by some experts too unreliable for use as a space launcher.
"It's real embarrassing to have one blow up on you," said Dr. Wander of the Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency. "When they get old, you get that kind of problem. It's a matter of how much of a gamble you want to take. I would think that, except for low-priority launches, the missiles will be used for their materials or will be destroyed."

GRAPHIC: Diagram: "Recycling a Rocket"
Researchers are racing to find new ways to tear apart rocket weapons or divert them to other uses. In one experiment, the dense, rubbery stuff known as solid fuel is sprayed with cold liquid nitrogen, reducing it to a powder that might be processed for disposal as it is or broken down for further recycling.
 
Freezing liquid nitrogen causes fuel to crack and shed. Dangerous fuel can be removed more easily.
 
Bacteria digest dilute fueld, converting them to harmless salts. Salts can be buried ro reused.

HEADLINE: THE GATES HEARINGS;
Excerpts From Committee's Hearing on the Gates Nomination

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from today's hearings by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on the nomination of Robert M. Gates to be Director of Central Intelligence, with Mr. Gates's opening statement and questions by Senators David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, and Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska. The transcript was provided by Reuters and the Federal News Service.
 
OPENING STATEMENT BY MR. GATES
 Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, it is a great honor to appear here before you as President Bush's nominee to be Director of Central Intelligence.
I want to thank him for his confidence in me and for the honor of this nomination. I am humbled by it.
I welcome these confirmation hearings to address the many issues that I know you will raise.
Mr. Chairman, here at the outset I want to thank you and the committee for the fair and professional treatment of my nomination. I also want to thank Senators Dole, Kassebaum, Robb and Warner for their kind introductions.
I have been in public service for 25 years. I arrived in Washington 25 years ago this summer with everything I owned in the back of a 1965 Mustang, and no money. The Mustang is long gone, sold before it became a collector's item, and I still have no money.
But I am enriched by a wonderful and patient wife, and two great kids. I believe I still have the idealism that I brought with me from Kansas a quarter century ago; a deep conviction in the greatness of this country, in the uniqueness and wonder of its constitution and in its mission as a force for good in the world.
My decision to commit my life to national service springs from these beliefs.
I also have still the values that I brought with me from Kansas: family, hard work, candor and truthfulness, integrity, obeying the law and a basic optimism about life.
During these 25 years I have worked for six presidents, Republicans and Democrats alike. I served four of them in the National Security Council. I've served eight directors of the C.I.A. I have worked closely and harmoniously with this committee and its House of Representatives counterpart for more than 10 years as C.I.A.'s Deputy Director for Intelligence, chairman of the National Intelligence Council, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, Acting Director of Central Intelligence, and Deputy National Security Adviser.
I have appeared before this committee more than 50 times during that period, so we are not strangers to one another. In short, I do not come before this committee as a new face, but rather, as a nominee with a long track record.
I anticipate that the committee will want to examine both that record as well as my view of the future course of C.I.A. and U.S. intelligence. I think all of the opening statements point to that.
The committees, appropriately, have been looking at the future of U.S. intelligence, its structure and mission in the aftermath of the Cold War, and now most recently, after the revolution in the Soviet Union. Who would have thought that just five years ago we would stand where we are today? Certainly not the intelligence analyst sitting before you. Talk about humbling experiences.
The old verities that have guided this country's national security policy for 45 years, and thus, its intelligence service, have disappeared in an historical instant. Communism is dead or dying. A number of longstanding regional conflicts are coming to an end. The cold war is over. The Communist Party lies mortally wounded in the Soviet Union, wounded by its own hand. And the forces of real reform are at last ascendant in the Soviet Union.
Still, as ever, there are challenges, concerns and risks. The collapse of the Soviet and Russian empire offers the promise of democracy and economic transformation, but it also contains the seeds of grave instability, chaos and civil war, in a country possessing nearly 30,000 nuclear warheads, the most powerful of which are still aimed at us.
We cannot yet divert our attention from the Soviet Union, but clearly our priorities and our concerns have changed.
Meanwhile, a growing number of nations have, or are developing, nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, together with the ballistic missile technologies to deliver them. Some of our allies in that long cold war are now at times serious adversaries in that global marketplace.
Political instability in the third world spawns conflict, famine and chaos, challenging us politically, economically, sometimes militarily and always morally.
International narcotics cartels not only feed growing global demand, but increasingly have the capability to buy governments and rule countries.
Regional conflict and its terrorist stepchildren, as in the Middle East, remain a reality despite our best efforts.
I have been deeply engaged in dealing with all of these problems. I have been by the President's side when we prevented a coup attempt in the Philippines, liberated Panama, defeated Iraq's aggression against Kuwait, saw the Berlin Wall go down, and led the effort to unify Germany and NATO, fostered the Polish roundtable agreement, completed the C.F.E. and START agreements, and played a role in the success of the democratic forces during the recent Soviet coup attempt.
The President and the Congress know that just as some threats have diminished, other dangers remain or have altered shape, just as new challenges and problems have emerged.
The death of Soviet Communism has vastly diminished the danger of global war, but the world remains a very rough neighborhood. Our nation's leaders, at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, have no wish to walk these streets blindfolded.
We approach the close of the most violent century in man's history. Two world wars, a long and hostile peace punctuated by protracted, bloody regional wars, the destruction of ancient empires and the defeat of two inhuman ideologies -- communism and Nazism -- have set in motion vast political, social and economic forces long frozen by totalitarianism and its legacy.
The path to a new and brighter day is finally apparent but will require still American leadership, strength and vision; the willingness to act against those who would prey on the weak, and skillful navigation around the many obstacles that can thwart progress or send newly free but fragile democracies hurtling back into the darkness.
The role of intelligence is to help the President, his senior advisers and the Congress understand and deal with these changing realities. The challenge, then, to C.I.A. and to U.S. intelligence is to adapt to this changing world, not just in places like the Soviet Union and Europe, but to the very idea of change, the idea that for years to come, change and uncertainty will dominate international life, that the unthinkable, and the not-even-thought-about will be commonplace.
For us in intelligence to adapt to such a changing world will require unprecedentedly close collaboration of the President and his advisers, the intelligence community and the Congress.
If confirmed, I look forward to a close partnership with this committee in this remarkably challenging and stimulating process.
Normally a nominee would be circumspect about specific ideas for change. However, my nomination comes at a time when this committee is deeply engaged in looking at the future of U.S. intelligence, and has, as this morning's statements made apparent, considerable interest in my views about the future and what I would do, if confirmed, to help guide C.I.A. and its sister agencies toward the 21st century.
I believe Director Webster's emphasis on flexibility is central to being responsive in a time of radical change and unpredictability.
What follows are my ideas on where we ought to go from here.
First, this remarkable moment in history affords us a not-to-be-missed opportunity to reassess the role, mission, priorities and structure of American intelligence in the aftermath of the cold war. This should not be done off the cuff.
If confirmed I will recommend that the President launch, with the direct involvement of his most senior security advisers, a major effort to determine the intelligence needs of the United States for the next decade or more, to the year 2005.
He should then in my view charge the D.C.I. to identify what the intelligence community must do to meet those needs. The two intelligence committees should have the opportunity to participate even before these proposals come before the Congress.
At a time of revolutionary change abroad, and Governmentwide fiscal constraints at home, U.S. intelligence cannot remain fundamentally unaffected. Accordingly, we, the executive branch and Congress, must reach agreement on mission and priorities. Once these are determined we can then logically address structure and budget.
Admiral Bob Inman, as deputy D.C.I., managed a similar process for the intelligence buildup during the first half of the 1980's. It is time to follow up that effort with an even bolder, much more far-reaching effort.
This effort ought to be completed by the end of the year, in time to influence the next budget cycle.
There are other problems and innovations that must be addressed as we change to cope with a changing and different world. The intelligence budget should be considered by the President, his senior advisers and the Congress, within, but independently, of the defense budget.
We must dramatically expand our clandestine human intelligence collection effort. At the same time, we must consider the implications for our covert action capabilities of a dramatic decline in Soviet aggressiveness and disruptive activities in the third world.
We must remedy the gap between 21st century collection systems, and a 19th century system for informing policy makers.
We publish too much intelligence of questionable relevance to policy makers. Less and better should be the rule.
C.I.A.'s relationship to and support for the U.S. military must be approved. The process by which the information needs of policy makers are translated into intelligence requirements must be strengthened.
The relationship between our national and tactical intelligence programs must be dramatically improved.
Finally, the intelligence community, and C.I.A. in particular, must build on the openness Director Webster has encouraged to develop better popular understanding and support for U.S. intelligence activities.
President Kennedy once said that C.I.A. successes remain a secret while its failures are trumpeted. However, things have gotten out of hand when the most outrageous allegations against the agency are taken seriously, when the honor and integrity of thousands of patriotic public servants are suspect merely by virtue of where they work.
The C.I.A. and its people deserve better. But changing perceptions first requires greater openness by the agency.
I can elaborate on these proposals I've just made, and others that I have in mind. But my point is clear: C.I.A. and U.S. intelligence must change, and be seen to change, or confront irrelevance and growing sentiment for their dismantlement.
I look forward to tackling this challenge with you.
Contrary to popular perceptions of an adversary relationship, Congress has long been a strong supporter of a vital and effective U.S. intelligence service. It was the Congressional intelligence committees that launched the rebuilding of U.S. intelligence capabilities in 1979, and their support helped sustain the rebuilding in following years.
This Congressional support not surprisingly is valued in the intelligence community. But the community also recognizes and values the role of Congress in making intelligence accountable, and in insuring that it operates within the law, and in a manner consistent with American values.
Access to our assessments by Congress -- Republicans, Democrats, liberals, conservatives, moderates -- helps assure our objectivity and independence.
We know that many Americans are uneasy about C.I.A. and U.S. intelligence activities. They understand the need for information, and even on occasion for covert action, but they are uncomfortable with secrecy. And therein lies the value of Congressional oversight.
The reassurance to Americans that the laws are being obeyed and that there is accountability. This then puts a special responsibility on intelligence agencies to be truthful, straightforward, candid, and forthcoming in dealings with Congress.
For more than 10 years, I have had a strong and positive relationship with this committee. I understand and respect its role and that of its House counterpart as surrogates for both the rest of the Congress and the American people. Consequently, a relationship of trust and confidence between the intelligence community and the two intelligence committees is of vital interest and importance.
Accordingly, I commit to you that should I be confirmed, whatever differences may develop from time to time between the intelligence committees and the executive branch generally, or C.I.A. in particular, I would resign rather than jeopardize that relationship of trust and confidence.
Mr. Chairman, that completes my formally prepared statement. Because of the great interest that this committee has and the centrality of Iran-contra to these proceedings, I wanted to add some additional personal thoughts on this subject at the end, that I wrote down last night.
I've just referred to a commitment about trust and confidence. I don't make that commitment lightly. It is a direct outgrowth of watching the constant crises, primarily over covert action, in C.I.A.-Congressional relations between 1981 and 1986, culminating in Iran-contra.
I suspect few people have reflected more than I have on the Iran-contra affair: what went wrong, why C.I.A. played by rules not of its own making and what might have been done to prevent or at least stop this tragic affair. C.I.A. has already paid a fearful price and learned costly lessons.
But today, I want to speak about the misjudgments I made and the lessons I learned. First, in retrospect, I should have taken more seriously after the 1st of October, 1986, the possibility of impropriety or even wrongdoing in the Government and pursued this possibility more aggressively. I should have pressed the issue of a possible diversion more strenuously with Director Casey and with Admiral Poindexter. I should have done more.
Instead, I contented myself with taking the information I had received to Casey and Poindexter, as well as to C.I.A.'s general counsel, and then did not follow up after returning from overseas.
Second, I should have been more skeptical about what I was told. I should have asked more questions and I should have been less satisfied with the answers I received, especially from Director Casey.
Third, I should have pressed harder for reversing the provision in the January finding prohibiting informing the Congress.
At the same time, I believe that the actions I did take were well-intentioned and honest. While differences naturally exist in recalling the details of conversations and meetings at a remove or a distance of months or sometimes even years, the record is clear that I opposed the Iran initiative, I urged notification of Congress, I acted to insure C.I.A.'s compliance with the law. And when for the first time problems were brought to me, I informed Director Casey, consulted C.I.A.'s general counsel and followed the counsel's recommendations.
Even before the Iran initiative became public, I urged full public disclosure. After it became public, I pressed for full disclosure to the Congress. I insured full C.I.A. cooperation with multiple investigations and I began trying to rebuild that relationship of trust and confidence between C.I.A. and the Congress.
Clearly, if I could relive October 1986, perhaps part of November, I would do certain things differently and, I believe, better. And indeed, my actions as Acting Director for more than five months and as Director Webster's deputy for nearly two years demonstrate that I learned the lessons of Iran-contra. During that period, from December 15th, 1986, to spring of 1989, there was not a single crisis of confidence between C.I.A. and the Congress in stark contrast to the preceding six years.
Nor will there be such a crisis under my stewardship if I am confirmed. You will not find a nominee for Director of Central Intelligence more aware of and sensitive to the lessons of that time or more understanding of the importance of a good faith relationship with the Congress.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 
QUESTIONS BY SENATOR BOREN
 Q. When you look back on it, could you identify for us those areas where you think you should have been more skeptical and what additional questions do you think that you should have asked that you didn't ask?
A. Mr. Chairman, I think of two examples that I had in mind when I wrote that portion of those remarks. The first was following the lunch on October 9th, 1986, which Director Casey had with Colonel North and which I joined. I have testified before that at the very end of that lunch and at the end of a discussion of the Hasenfus aircraft [a cargo plane, shot down by the Nicaraguan rebels eight days earlier; Eugene Hausenfus, a civilian adventurer, survived and was captured] . . . I double-checked with Colonel North just to try and cross every "t" and dot every "i" that he wasn't aware through his contacts with the private benefactors of any C.I.A. connection. . . . At the very end of the luncheon as I was getting up to leave, Colonel North, as I've referred to before, a comment with respect to a cryptic remark about Swiss bank accounts and the contras. I walked on out of the room and, a few minutes later, went back into Mr. Casey's office and said, "You know, that just puzzled me and I wonder if there's something that we should be concerned about there, is there some problem or something we should pursue."
And Mr. Casey basically said -- well, I didn't pick up on what he said, or I didn't catch it and -- "There's nothing to it; don't worry about it." And I let it go. And in retrospect, that's the first instance where I believe if I had the opportunity to do it over again I would have pressed him harder and said, "Well, now, no, let's think about this,maybe there's a real problem here."
The second example is after the Director and I met with Admiral Poindexter and gave him Mr. Allen's memorandum of 14, October, 1986. . . . Mr. Casey had advised him to have the White House counsel review the entire Iran initiative, make sure everything was O.K. -- much as I had asked our C.I.A. counsel to review it -- and also to think about making it public, that it ought to be made public.
And I should have, at that point, drawn Admiral Poindexter's attention to the specific reference in the Allen memorandum to the possibility that if Mr. Ghorbanifar wasn't paid his money, one of the allegations he might make against the United States was that the money was going to other projects of the United States and the Government of Israel. I did not push him on that.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Mr. Kerr testified in late August of 1986 that Charlie Allen came to him with his concerns about a possible diversion, and he testified that Mr. Kerr -- he, Mr. Kerr, then discussed these concerns with you. This could have been at least a month, he said, before Mr. Allen brought his concerns to you on October 1, 1986. Do you have any recollection of Mr. Kerr's discussing the diversion with you prior to your meeting with Charlie Allen when he discussed it with you on October 1, 1986?
A. No, sir, I do not. I think that, in fact, Mr. Allen has testified that when he briefed me on the 1st of October that I seemed to be surprised and even startled by the information that had been brought to me. Now that's the extent of my personal recollection. . . .
I've never denied that Mr. Kerr may well have broached this subject with me. I've simply said that I have no recollection of it myself. . . . I've testified several times that throughout the preceding year or so, we had heard rumors about funding, where the contras were getting their funding. We had heard rumors about contributions or donations from foreign countries, from the private benefactors and so on.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Did you hear any rumor or did you become aware of any rumor prior to Mr. Allen's conversation with you on October 1st about the diversion of arms sales to the contras?
A. My memory of this from the very beginning is that the first I heard was from Mr. Allen. . . .
Q. . . . It now appears, however, that at least one other senior C.I.A. official, Alan Fiers, the head of the Central American Task Force, had direct knowledge of the diversion before October 1, 1986. . . . He told Clair George [the Deputy Director for Operations] and the chief of the Latin American division by sometime late August 1986. . . . Did the chief of the Latin American division during this period of time prior to October 1, 1986, or prior to the public disclosure of the diversion, did the chief of the Latin American division ever come to you and tell you about the diversion?
A. He did not.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Did Mr. Clair George ever tell you about the diversion of funds to the contras?
A. He did not.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
QUESTIONS BY SENATOR MURKOWSKI
 Q. Well, I'd like to address Mr. Casey's management style as a Director of Central Intelligence, because I think it's appropriate. . . . Can you explain for me just basically how the agency operated under the structure as dictated by the director, Mr. Casey, as opposed to the organizational chart which clearly shows a structure that one would assume would be a normal reporting structure?
A. . . . I think that the first thing in terms of Mr. Casey's personal style is that this is a man who had begun his intelligence career as an O.S.S. officer in Europe. It was a time when, needless to say, there was no oversight, and even management, I think historians would agree, was fairly slack.
He then made his career essentially as an operator -- as a lawyer operating on his own, and as an author. In essence, he never worked -- or he did not work through much of his career in a bureaucratic structure, although he had several senior Government positions in the State Department and the S.E.C. . . . Actually for the first several years, it was something of an adventure to work for him, because he would pick up the phone and punch a button without much concern for who was at the other end of the line and start shouting instructions. . . .
He also would fail to change the buttons when he'd call again. So he'd call and then about 30 seconds later he'd call again and you'd say, "Yes?" and he'd say, "Who's this?" and you'd say, "Well, this is Bob, and you just talked to me." And he'd say, "Oh, I didn't want you" and then he'd hang up. . . .
I don't think he would have recognized the C.I.A. organization chart the first several years he was there, if a lot depended on it. . . .
I believe that when Mr. Casey came to C.I.A. he came with the view that he in essence would involve himself very deeply in operational affairs. I won't say that he intended to run the clandestine service because he wasn't organized enough to do that, but rather to involve himself very deeply in its affairs. . . .
Nowhere was this more true than on those issues that were a special passion for him, like Central America. And where he would reach down into the organization and basically ignore all of the bureaucratic aspects. . . .

HEADLINE: Spoleto Festival Resolves Its Dispute; Menotti Is Winner

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
Gian Carlo Menotti, the 80-year-old founder and artistic director of the Spoleto Festival U.S.A., has won his 17-month battle with the festival's board. At a tense and sometimes fractious three-and-a-half-hour board meeting yesterday at the Drake Hotel in Manhattan, 10 of the board's 46 members resigned, and 9 others either decided not to stand for re-election or were not nominated.
 Among those who resigned were the festival's chairman, Ross A. Markwardt, and its president, Edgar F. Daniels, the two officers whose resignations Mr. Menotti demanded in a them-or-me showdown this May. Nigel Redden, the general manager, whose resignation was also demanded by Mr. Menotti, left his post last month but is staying on as a consultant. 
 The Spoleto Festival U.S.A., which is based in Charleston, S.C., is widely regarded as one of the most rewarding and expansive summer arts festivals in the United States. During its 15-year history, Mr. Menotti has had frequent clashes with the festival board, but since May 1990 his relations with the board have been particularly hostile, with disagreements over everything from budgets to programming.
At yesterday's meeting, the 19 board members who left the organization were replaced by 14 new members and a new slate of officers. Other candidates are to be considered later. Although Mr. Menotti did not attend the meeting, his principal ally in the dispute, Joseph P. Riley Jr., the Mayor of Charleston, was on hand.
 
Soft Voices Turn Loud
 The public parts of the meeting unfolded beneath a placid veneer of Southern geniality. But after 90 minutes, the new chairman, Theodore S. Stern, moved to shift into executive session before new board members were proposed. With the exception of Mr. Riley, everyone who was not on the board was ejected from the room for an hour and 45 minutes. But raised voices could frequently be heard, and board members who intermittently left the room spoke critically of the proceedings.
"They are going over old history, rehashing every slight and every detail of every previous administration," said an exasperated Mr. Markwardt a few minutes before he returned to the meeting to resign. "They are debating the by-laws, and people are asking questions like, 'What does the board of directors do?' " Another board member who resigned, Bessie Hanahan, described the meeting as "amateur hour."
The dispute between Mr. Menotti and the board started in May 1990, when the composer objected to an exhibition of Conceptual Art proposed by Mr. Redden. The board voted to have the show, "Places With a Past," which proved to be one of the critical successes of the 1991 festival. In October 1990, Mr. Menotti threatened to resign unless Mr. Markwardt and Mr. Redden guaranteed him complete artistic control. At the same time he also objected to a retirement contract the board had offered him under which he would become director emeritus and would continue to direct productions of his own operas.
When the festival opened this May, Mr. Menotti arrived at a board meeting demanding the resignations of Mr. Markwardt and Mr. Redden. Adding Mr. Daniels to the list, Mr. Menotti insisted that if they did not leave, he would. At the time, the three maintained that they were answerable only to the board, which repeatedly assured them of its support. In July, 33 members of the board signed a letter saying they opposed a change in the festival's organization.
What changed, several members of the board said, was that Mayor Riley told them he would not allow the festival to use the city-owned concert halls and other facilities unless Mr. Menotti remained with the festival. And Mr. Menotti refused to alter his resignation demand. Several of the board members expressed bitterness at the Mayor's position.
"The Mayor had told us that he regarded his role as primarily that of a mediator," Mr. Markwardt said. "But he was unwilling to peruse any compromise option that we approached him with. We raised the issue of whether the Mayor could actually stop the festival, but the board elected not to pursue it, and we absolutely did not consider relocating to another city. Our primary goal was for something to emerge from the ashes."
Mrs. Hanahan, one of the board members who resigned, described the Mayor's dealings with the board as heavy-handed and unethical. And Charlotte F. Sloan, in her resignation letter, wrote: "It distresses and outrages me that Mayor Riley, by his ill-timed, inappropriate, thoughtless and autocratic action, has effectively emasculated this hard-working, productive group."
 
The Mayor's Explanation
 Mayor Riley would not respond to characterizations of himself as an autocrat. When asked whether he had actually denied the use of Charleston's facilities to the board, he said:
"Spoleto is the most important development for my city in the 20th century. It brings under the direction of the greatest living opera composer the most comprehensive arts festival in the world, a human-scaled festival that has greatly enriched my city.
"My duty as Mayor was to make sure that this marvelous festival continued at the level of quality and renown that it enjoyed, and it would not have continued at that level if Gian Carlo Menotti had been removed. Also, I felt it would be morally wrong for him to be removed from his creation. I was unalterably opposed to that, and I made it clear that the city, as an important part of the festival, would be opposed to continuing without Maestro Menotti."
Both Mr. Riley and his father, Joseph P. Riley Sr., were among the 14 new board members.
Mr. Menotti's victory will not be without cost to the festival. Several of those who resigned said they would not contribute money to the festival again. That loss is projected in the festival's $5 million 1992 budget to be more than $300,000. There is also a $40,000 loss for tickets to a special opening party bought by A.T.&T., of which Mr. Markwardt is a vice president.
During the meeting's financial discussions, festival officials said that the battle itself cost some contributions from private and corporate donors. In outlining the reasons the festival's 1991 fund drive fell just below its goal, Connie Baldwin, the acting director of development, cited "the softening of the economy, the gulf war and the Spoleto conflict, which was played out in the media."
The impasse between Mr. Menotti and the board has also put the festival behind in its budget planning because he has refused to submit his programming plans. "I have asked Maestro Menotti to at least give us the number of events he would like to have in each category, and he has been unable to do that" said Mr. Redden, who despite his resignation was still required to present the 1992 financial prospectus. Mr. Redden said this had hindered raising money for specific projects. "Special fund-raising," he explained, "requires knowing what the program is before we ask for the money." He added that the festival usually issued its first brochures in October and counted on the money from early ticket sales.
Mr. Markwardt, speaking after he left the executive session, said that during his year as chairman he "felt that it was more important to shape the future than to preserve the past," adding, "But we ran afoul of the preservationists."
Mr. Stern, on the other hand, had been the festival's first chairman, and his return to that post may be seen as an attempt to return to the festival's comparatively untroubled youth.

HEADLINE: Opponents Seek to Curb Banking Changes

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
The leading Congressional opponents to legislation that would sweep away the Depresssion-era regulations that govern the nation's banking industry had their chance today to try to preserve the status quo.
The opposition is centered in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and one of its subcommittees today approved amendments that would retain prohibitions against industrial concerns acquiring banks and would severely restrict the ability of banks to enter the securities business. 
 The amendments are intended to thwart the several measures currently wending their way through Congress, which would dismantle the current banking regulations and give banks broad powers to compete in new lines of business. The changes are being sought by the Bush Adminstration and for the most part have been incorporated in bills already approved by the House and Senate banking committees.
Opposition to the changes is being led by Representative John D. Dingell, the powerful Michigan Democrat who heads the Energy and Commerce Committee, and by Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who heads the subcommittee that passed the amendments.
The amendments will be brought before the Rules Committee, which will decide whether to attach them to the main House banking bill or send them directly to the floor for consideration later this year.
The subcommittee's actions today struck at the heart of the proposed changes. If ultimately enacted, the amendments would bar industrial and commercial concerns, such as I.B.M. or General Electric, from acquiring banks and would place limits on the ability of banks that underwrite securities to make loans to their underwriting clients.
The Adminstration and the banking industry is seeking these changes as a way to bring new capital to a beleaguered industry and to enable American banks to become more competitive globally with international banks that are permitted to both underwrite securities and make loans to corporate customers.
Mr. Dingell, who fears that loosening existing regulations could lead to the kinds of speculative excesses that caused the Great Depresession and other financial panics, is seen as the remaining obstacle to the changes.
 
A Fear of 'Larcenous Scoundrels'
 In an impassioned opening statement, Mr. Dingell walked subcommittee members through a history of banking crises and concluded that the "banks have matured, but the people haven't."
"There are still the same larcenous scoundrels as there always will be," he said.
At today's hearing, the subcommittee voted to accept an amendment that favors the longstanding prohibitions against corporate ownership of banks. The move came after defeat of a proposal from Representative Matthew Rinaldo, a New Jersey Republican, that would have permitted such acquistions if the banks were failing or had already failed.
The Rinaldo measure was defeated by a 15-to-11 vote along partisan lines, with the Democrats opposed and the Republicans supporting. It would have permitted industrial concerns to buy troubled banks and infuse them with sufficient capital to bring them up to the capital requirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
The Adminstration, which is seeking the infusion of private capital into the banking industry on the belief it would reduce the burden of bank failures on the taxpayer, had indicated it could have accepted the Rinaldo proposal as a compromise.
The other major issue taken up by the subcommittee was a provision that would not dismantle the Housing banking committee's repeal of restrictions that separate commercial banking and investment banking and that prevent banks from underwriting securities.
But, while going along with the House banking committee's change, the subcommittee approved an amendment that effectively undercut it. The amendment would prevent banks from making loans to corporate underwriting clients for three months after underwriting securities for that client.

Explaining his premature resignation as head of the New York City School Construction Authority, Gen. Charles Williams says he has "accomplished everything that is needed to get the authority up to speed." That may be true. But he had a full year left on a three-year contract and his agency is only halfway through a five-year plan, amid citywide economic uncertainty. So: Why did he leave, and what's to become of the authority?
The School Construction Authority was created in 1988 as an independent agency to build new schools and renovate existing ones without the rigid Civil Service, contracting and land use procedures that had delayed projects supervised by the Board of Education by as long as 10 years. 
 The authority is responsible for a $4.3 billion capital plan to build 50 new schools and 30 annexes and to renovate 70 other schools over five years. In the interest of efficiency, the State Legislature has exempted the authority from the Wicks law, which prohibits use of a single general contractor for most public construction projects.
Under General Williams, who spent 29 years in the Army Corps of Engineers, the authority has won praise for prompt payment and fair play. It has awarded $1.5 billion in construction contracts and completed 20 new facilities, five athletic fields and two modernizations.
The reasons for the general's departure aren't clear. He was criticized for paying high salaries to top managers and for a bloated administrative staff; the Board of Trustees, which oversees the authority, recently proposed a watchdog committee. General Williams, however, insists he has a better offer from the private sector.
Still, his decision is disappointing, especially since his accomplishments outweighed his shortcomings. Now it's up to Mayor David Dinkins and the trustees to insure a smooth transition so that the critical work of the agency will continue.

Warmer Globe, Greener Pastures?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
LOOKING forward to a winter beach vacation on balmy Cape Cod? There may not be scheduled flights from La Guardia Airport -- the runways are so often flooded at high tide. But the highways are reliable, now that the Rhode Island dikes have been reinforced and bridges all raised by five feet.
This vision of the future may seem unthinkable. While it is widely understood that the accumulation of "greenhouse" gases in the atmosphere could dramatically change weather patterns over the next century and raise the level of the oceans, it is also widely assumed that governments can and must check global warming. 
 But a new report from the National Academy of Sciences dares to challenge this environmentally correct view, examining the prospects for adapting to a warmer, drier climate rather than preventing weather changes. And though the authors draw no conclusions, this provocative study suggests that the warm, new world might not be unpalatable.
In April a separate National Academy panel on global warming plumped what has been dubbed the "no regrets" greenhouse policy. Until the timing and consequences of warming were better understood, the panel concluded, it made sense to cut greenhouse emissions only where the cutting would be free or relatively cheap.
The contemplated reductions, totaling one-third of current emissions, were less than most environmental lobbies wanted and more than the Bush Administration was ready to accept -- and thus represented a pleasing political middle. But it left open the question of how much farther to go if, as expected, the climate continues to warm in spite of low-cost remedial action. The answer, economists say, ought to depend in part on how costly it would be to adapt to climate change.
The new National Academy report, from another panel headed by Paul Waggoner at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, focuses on the adaptation option. While its conclusions are couched in the language of science, the overall impression is sunny: Most societies would probably be able to cope with the 2 to 9 degree Fahrenheit warming now expected by the mid-21st century.
Human health, the panelists concluded, would not be significantly affected. People adapt well to warmer climates -- indeed, migration southward since the invention of air-conditioning suggests that many prefer their world without winter.
Nor is there reason to believe that economic productivity would change much. Manufacturing and most services are relatively insensitive to weather: it is as easy to build tractors in Florida as in Minnesota. Moreover, the life of most capital equipment and structures is short relative to the time frame of global warming, making it relatively cheap for business to change technology or location to accommodate the weather.
Farming and fishing would be more dramatically affected by a warmer and drier climate. But together, these industries contribute a scant 3 percent to America's G.N.P. And in any case, agriculture is far more adaptable than is generally understood; conceivably, higher crop yields from a carbon-rich atmosphere would fully offset the added costs of irrigation and genetic adaptation.
The big-ticket adjustments, the panelists believe, would be protection of coastal areas from flooding and building the capacity to move and store more fresh water. But according to an independent study by the panel's economist, William Nordhaus of Yale, these costs would be spread over decades and need not amount to more than a quarter of 1 percent of G.N.P.
If you sense something is missing here, you are not alone. The perspective of the study is that of economists and engineers: Nature is an economic tool and a playground for humans. Therefore, rapid, irrevocable changes in the global ecology are a liability only to the degree that they reduce productivity or upset the users of the playground.
This position has its appeal if one believes that the value of, say, wilderness or species diversity exists only in the eyes and minds of the beholders. But there is no simple way for the beholders to put a price tag on such intangibles. And many environmentalists are not even prepared to try, as long as the option of preservation is available.
The implicit optimism of the National Academy's adaptation panel suggests that policy makers are going to have a tough time ducking this core issue of environmental values. If the costs of adaptation are indeed modest, it would probably pay to roll with the greenhouse punch. Unless, of course, the intangible losses from rapid ecological change are given great weight -- and societies are ready to spend tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars to avoid them.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Rises $2.10 in a Rally Of Precious Metals Prices

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Precious metal futures prices rallied yesterday amid expectations for lower interest rates and signs that the tide of Soviet metal sales was ebbing.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for delivery in October rose $2.10, to $347.30 a troy ounce; December silver rose 6 cents, to $4.11 a troy ounce. 
 October platinum rose $3.70, to $353.50 a troy ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The markets finished below their highs but the upward move has not necessarily stalled, said Randolph Donney, chief of commodities research at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
"There is a good feel to the metals now; they've been able to hold up under pressure," he said.
Mr. Donney predicted that December silver would make a stab at $4.19 an ounce today after peaking at $4.145 yesterday.
 
Expect Another Rate Cut
 Mr. Donney and Fred Demler, a metals economist with Paine Webber Inc., said metal traders expected the Federal Reserve to make another cut in its discount rate to stimulate an economic recovery. The Fed cut the rate, which it charges on loans to financial institutions, by half a percentage point, to 5 percent, on Friday
Crude oil futures slipped on the New York Mercantile Exchange ahead of a weekly American Petroleum Institute report that showed an unexpectedly large drop of six million barrels in United States crude oil stocks last week. The report may support crude futures today..
Crude oil for October delivery fell 20 cents, to $21.62 a barrel. Heating oil for October delivery dropped 0.95 cent, to 61.11 cents a gallon. October unleaded gasoline fell 0.70 cent, to 61.06 cents a gallon, and natural gas rose 0.3 cent, to $1.598 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Soybean futures ended mostly higher on the Chicago Board of Trade, extending Monday's gains amid rising fears of a damaging freeze later this week in the northwestern corner of the Midwest.
 
Wheat Futures Higher
 Wheat futures rose on signs of stronger export demand but corn and oat futures retreated slightly.
Wheat for September delivery settled 2 1/4 cents higher at $3.31 a bushel. September corn fell 3/4 cent, to $2.51 a bushel. September oats dropped 1 cent, to $1.19 1/4 a bushel. The September soybean contract, which expires tomorrow, fell 1 1/2 cents, to $6.00 1/2 a bushel. The November soybean contract finished 2 1/2 cents higher at $6.11 1/2 a bushel.
Most pork belly futures plunged the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on weakening chart signals and expectations for lower fresh belly prices. The selling pressure spilled over to the hog pit.
Cattle advanced in line with higher cash cattle prices.
Live cattle for October delivery rose 0.18 cent, to 71.70 cents a pound. September feeder cattle rose 0.23 cent, to 85.25 cents a pound. October live hogs fell 0.45 cent, to 45.35 cents a pound, and February frozen pork bellies ended 2 cents lower at 49.07 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: U.S. Output Grew 0.3% In August

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
The industrial sector, one of the economy's few strong spots, grew for the fifth month in a row in August, the Federal Reserve said today.
Production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose three-tenths of 1 percent last month from July. The rise was modest by comparison with a revised six-tenths of 1 percent rise in July and an eight-tenths of 1 percent gain in June. 
 The August rise was led by higher output of consumer goods and business equipment but pulled down by a sharp decline in auto production. Among manufacturing industries alone, output also rose three-tenths of 1 percent.
 
The Strongest Sector
 Although the overall August rise was the smallest since March, when production fell, economists said the gains in the output of goods other than cars showed that manufacturing was still the strongest sector of the economy as it emerges from recession.
"The manufacturing sector is the only area where we're seeing much strength, and we're seeing that continue," said David Wyss, an economist with DRI/McGraw-Hill, a research concern in Lexington, Mass.
At a White House news conference, Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, hailed the growth in output as new evidence that the recovery from the recession that began in July 1990 was under way.
 
General Improvement
 He said the new figures "augment other closely watched data on the economy that also have been improving in general in recent months." Such data, he said, include housing starts, consumer spending, personal income, durable goods and increases in the index of leading indicators.
Over all, the manufacturing sector operated at 80 percent of its total production capacity last month, its highest level since January, the Fed said. Capacity utilization was a revised 79.9 percent in July.
August auto production -- which plunged 9.3 percent after five straight monthly increases -- dragged down the total output figure. Excluding cars, industrial output rose five-tenths of 1 percent. Economists, however, dismissed the decline as a seasonal aberration that often occurs at the end of a model year.
Economists said they were encouraged by a sharp 1 percent gain in consumer-goods production other than cars, which included higher clothing and food output, and with a five-tenths of 1 percent rise in output of business equipment other than cars.
"That should be encouraging," said Mohsen Bonakdarpour, an economist with the WEFA Group, a forecasting concern in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. "That's a sign of a recovery period."
Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, added, "While the August growth rate of industrial production is slower than in preceding months, these figures are favorable in one critical respect: They indicate that the rise in industrial activity is now spreading throughout the economy."
 
Spotty Recovery
 Although economists believe the recession is over, the recovery has been spotty. Job- and income-growth have been slow, consumer spending has been less than robust and retail sales have been erratic, while manufacturing and home building have been strong.
To stimulate business activity, the Fed last Friday cut the interest rate it charges banks and eased other credit to encourage more borrowing and spending.
The lean level of business inventories, which were at a two-year low in July, should also prompt manufacturers to increase production as they begin to run low on merchandise, economists said.
 
Slow to Snap Back
 While applauding the production report today, Mr. Boskin also acknowledged that the economy was slow to snap back.
"We obviously have only been into a recovery for a short period. It is going at a modest pace," he told reporters.
He added that the White House was still worried about a variety of factors that could hamper growth.
"While there is some upside potential for the economy to do even better than we've been looking at, there also are some concerns about the availability of credit, money growth, foreign demand for our exports, should foreign countries slow down even more than they have recently, and so on." he said.
He said that the White House appreciated the Fed's recent interest rate cuts, but that there was concern that the Fed's action might not be sufficient.
 
Annual Car Output Rate
 The output report today showed that car production fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.3 million units in August from 6 million in July.
Production of construction materials rose six-tenths of 1 percent in August after a four-tenths of 1 percent increase in July, the Fed said.
Mining output fell 1.1 percent last month after rising 1 percent in July. Declines in oil and coal production outweighed a rise in mining for metal ores.
Utility output rose eight-tenths of 1 percent last month, mostly because of a jump in electricity production to meet air-conditioning demand. In July, utility output fell nine-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Notes and Bonds Edge Upward

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Comments by Federal Reserve Board officials were the focal points of trading in the Treasury securities market yesterday, where prices of notes and bonds managed to eke out small gains at the close of a generally sluggish session.
Remarks by Wayne Angell, Fed governor, helped to depress prices early in the session. 
 In a television interview, Mr. Angell said that for all intents and purposes the recession was over and that an economic recovery was under way.
With Mr. Angell's comments apparently in mind, traders used a report from the Fed that showed that factory output rose by three-tenths of a percent last month, the fifth consecutive monthly advance, as another excuse to sell securities.
That was the end of the selling, however.
And prices began to rally early in the afternoon after the substance of a Market News Service interview with Robert Forrestal, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, flashed across trading screens.
In the interview, Mr. Forrestal said that it was too soon to tell whether additional cuts in interest rates by the Fed were necessary to spur the economy.
But Mr. Forrestal added the central bank was "poised to do whatever is necessary" to spur the economy out of recession. He added that favorable inflation figures have given the Fed more latitude to ease monetary policy.
"Shortly after Forrestal's comments came out, the market started to improve," said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and fixed-income markets.
 
Housing Report Awaited
 Some analysts said that some of the price improvement resulted from the expectation that a report due this morning on new housing starts will show that activity in this key sector of the economy remained lethargic in August.
"I would be surprised if housing showed any strength," Mr. Stone said. "The decline in mortgage rates could help a bit, but demographics are working against housing. And at the moment it is hard for builders to get financing, particularly for the construction of multifamily dwellings."
Analysts at MMS International noted in their daily market commentary that "weak housing data should effectively revive the underlying bullish tone" in the credit markets.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 102 14/32, up 5/32, to yield 7.91 percent, compared with 7.92 percent late Monday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 29/32 in late trading, up 5/32, to yield 7.59 percent. The 7 1/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 23/32, up 2/32, to yield 7.07 percent. And the 6 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 13/32, unchanged on the day, to yield 6.15 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were basically unchanged.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.17 percent, unchanged from late Monday. Six-month bill rates rose by one basis point, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point, at 5.21 percent.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, M. A. Hanna priced a total of $250 million worth of securities in a two-part offering through an underwriting group led by Salomon Brothers.
The first part of the offering consists of $100 million worth of seven-year notes due Sept. 15, 1998.
The 9 percent notes were priced at $100, or par, 1.58 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/4 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing.
The remaining $150 million were offered as 12-year notes maturing Sept. 15, 2003.
These 9 3/8 percent securities were also priced at $100, or par, 1.75 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
All of the securities are noncallable for life. Both parts of the issue are rated Baa-2 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Merrill Lynch & Company acted as lead manager on an offering of $100 million worth of 15-year notes by KFW International Finance.
The 8.20 percent notes were priced at $100, 58 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The noncallable securities are rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues were little changed in quiet trading.
Heavy issuance of new tax-exempt municipal bonds had little adverse impact on prices in the secondary market for municipal bonds.
Market participants said that prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged to up 1/8 point.

HEADLINE: Money Market Accounts And C.D.'s Decline Again

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposit and money market accounts dropped further in the week ended yesterday, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, a North Palm Beach, Fla., publication that focuses on interest rates.
Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor, like many in the credit markets, had expected the Federal Reserve to lower the discount rate, as it did last week, to 5 from 5 1/2 percent, leading to a cut also in the prime rate by banks around the country. The prime rate is used as a benchmark for setting rates on many consumer and business loans. 
 The new rates quoted by commercial and savings banks have begun to reflect the Federal Reserve move, which is aimed at stimulating the economy.
 
Rates Go Lower
 At the Treasury Department's weekly bill auction on Monday the three-month bill was sold at an average discount rate of 5.19 percent, compared with 5.29 percent the previous week, while the six-month bill averaged 5.22, compared with 5.30 percent.
According to The Monitor, the largest change in rates wase made by Astoria Federal Savings, which lowered its money-market account by 31 basis points, to 5.33 percent from 5.64 percent, and its three-month certificate of deposit by 32 basis points, to 5.43 percent from 5.75 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
Another large change was made by the Midlantic Bank in New Jersey, which lowered its six-month certificate of deposit by 35 basis points, to 5.40 percent from 5.75 percent.
Among the commercial banks in New York, the average yield has been cut 4 basis points, to 4.83 percent for money-market accounts, and the three-month certificates have fallen 11 basis points, to 5.07 percent.
For depositors at savings institutions in the New York area, yields were cut an average of 6 basis points, to 5.35 percent for money-market accounts, and 8 points, to 5.47 percent for three-month certificates.
Nationwide, according to The Monitor, the average yields of 20 major banks outside the New York area have been cut by 6 basis points, to 5.06 percent for their money market accounts, and 7 points to 5.29 percent for six-month certificates.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, September 18,1991. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: Official Says Real Cost Of Bailout Isn't Shown

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
The Government's senior auditor, Charles A. Bowsher, said today that a new prediction that the savings and loan bailout could be costlier and longer than officially recognized suggested that the Administration may be putting off its true costs until after the Presidential election next year.
"What the Administration is asking for is enough working capital and loss funds to get through the election and into 1993," Mr. Bowsher, the Comptroller General, said in an interview during a break in an appearance before the House Banking Committee's Financial Institutions Supervision, Regulation and Insurance Subcommittee. "It's not at all clear that it will be enough." 
 Mr. Bowsher's comment came after Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, told the lawmakers the bailout costs would total $191 billion, in terms of actual annual losses, from 1989 to 1996, or $31 billion more than the Administration had said would be needed.
 
$80 Billion Is Sought
 Treasury officials have steadfastly denied that they are playing politics with the financing by underestimating the costs until after the election. They have said in recent weeks that they expected a new $80 billion appropriation this fall would be sufficient -- perhaps even be more than necessary -- to complete the job.
At a hearing last week, Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson, noting that the Administration had been criticized for past estimates, said it had taken special care to assure an accurate estimate.
"While C.B.O. does not have enough information about the Administration's latest estimates to make a precise comparison," Mr. Reischauer said, "our analysis suggests that the final costs of resolution will be higher, more institutions will be closed and the cleanup job will take longer than the Administration anticipates." His forecasts are considered objective enough to provide the basis for both Democratic- and Republican-sponsored legislation.
Mr. Reischauer said that the Resolution Trust Corporation would probably be resolving the plight of failed institutions through early 1995, three years beyond the period initially contemplated by Congress and the Administration.
He estimated that 1,500 of the nation's savings associations would ultimately have to be closed or merged, which was lower than his previous estimate of up to 1,700, but still substantially above the Administration's projection of 1,000 institutions. Since August 1989, Resolution Trust has seized 651 institutions and sold, merged or liquidated 536 of them.
Measuring the entire expense in terms of 1990 dollars and unadjusted for inflation, Mr. Reischauer estimated that the bailout would cost $155 billion, not including the $60 billion that will be charged to the Government for the rescue of savings associations before 1989.
Since 1989, when a new agency was created to handle the bailout, Congress has authorized $80 billion that officials say will be spent by the end of 1991.
The hearing today was called to create a record and consider the Treasury's new $80 billion request.
Mr. Bowsher was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981 and is widely cited in Congress, although some conservative Republicans have accused him in recent months of making the Comptroller General's office more partisan.
 
40-Year Estimate
 Mr. Bowsher has estimated that when the costs of borrowing money to finance the bailout are also included, the rescue costs could approach $500 billion over the next 40 years. He suggested that Congress consider providing funds only until next August in order to supervise the bailout more tightly, but did not express a preference between that approach and the Administration's request.
Mr. Bowsher also said today that the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress that he heads, would be unable to certify the finances of Resolution Trust. He said that the accounting office would have to issue a disclaimer on the corporation's financial statements and balance sheet because of the inability to verify accurately the value of its assets.

HEADLINE: Rate-Cut Tonic: Good, Not Great

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Lower interest rates are supposed to revive the recovery, but many people wonder whether they will. The Federal Reserve Board's tonic, they fret, cannot fill up empty office towers, clean up bank loan portfolios or alter the need for America's service sector to ax costs and jobs. Besides, if three earlier rate cuts have not done the trick, why should this one?
But business economists say that interest rates have come down substantially and that business stands to be the biggest beneficiary. In fact, the past interest-rate cuts account in part for the recovery in sales and output since last spring. 
 "A significant cut in the discount rate was exactly what you'd hope for to correct our economic problems," said Walter K. Joelson, chief economist at the General Electric Company. Bernard Lashinksy, chief economist at the Inland Steel Corporation, added, "It will help a lot, a real lot."
One reason for economists' confidence that the Fed can get business and consumers to spend more: It already has. The Fed started to cut rates last summer. The result was more or less consecutive monthly gains since last winter or spring in housing, retail sales, industrial production and orders for long-lived consumers goods and capital equipment. Housing starts, for example, are up 23 percent since January.
"There was clearly a turning point." said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company. The recovery cannot be traced to lower rates alone, of course. A rebound in consumer confidence was crucial. So were plunging oil prices, weak raw-material prices and easing wage pressures.
To be sure, lower rates will not magically crank up stalled car sales. Consumers have made it plain that they will not buy cars unless they are offered bargains -- and Detroit has lately been handing them price increases. Nor can lower rates ignite the kind of boom that followed the recession in 1981 and 1982. The Fed is "unlikely to give us a recovery like in 1983," Mr. Joelson said, "but it's a far cry from getting nothing."
Mr. Joelson is counting on the same so-so growth -- about 2.5 percent a year in the nation's gross national product, or the total cost of goods and services sold -- that most forecasters expect for the year ahead.
 
Discount Rate Cut
 The Fed's latest round of cuts, announced last Friday, sliced to 5 percent from 5 1/2 percent the discount rate it charges when it lends money to banks. And, for the second time in recent months, it cut the Federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point. That rate is the one banks are charged on overnight loans.
As a result, short-term rates are the lowest they have been since the late 70's and long-term rates -- corporate bonds and mortgage rates -- are the lowest they have been since the late 80's. The last two cuts in the Federal funds rate represent one-fourth of the distance that the Fed has moved since last winter.
Lower rates should make life easier for corporations and banks as well as debt-burdened consumers and home buyers. "The drop in interest rates, along with the decline in inflation, is like a tax cut," Mr. Kudlow said.
For starters, companies with floating-rate debt will see their interest payments shrink. David Wyss, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, estimates that businesses will have reaped savings from lower interest payments that are equivalent to a 15 percent jump in after-tax profits. "That's obviously a powerful stimulant," he said.
As long as interest payments are half again as large as after-tax profits, "you have to be very, very tight with inventories," Mr. Joelson said. And inventories have continued to shrink after the recession ended in the spring.
 
Inventories Are Helped
 "The more rates come down, the more possibility there is of keeping normal inventories," Mr. Joelson said. "You can't sell from an empty wagon." Even if businesses merely replaced existing stocks, instead of letting them fall further, factory production would get a big lift.
More important, freeing up company cash should encourage the gradual resumption of corporate hiring that began this summer. That would put money in consumers' pockets at a time when consumers have been pulling in their horns. Since consumers are spend 96 percent of after-tax pay these days, a rise in income virtually guarantees more spending.
Lower rates should help shore up capital spending, which typically weakens even as the economy recovers. Buying, say, a $2 million I.B.M. minicomputer would be a lot cheaper. With a two percentage point drop in the prime rate since last winter, Mr. Wyss of DRI/McGraw-Hill said, the buyer would save roughly $40,000 a year on interest charges. "They could afford to hire a new programmer, too," he quipped.
That is critical to makers of capital equipment like General Electric and the Digital Equipment Corporation. "As long rates come down, G.E. crosses its fingers because it's a little shot in the arm for construction," Mr. Joelson said.
Brad Allen, a spokesman for Digital, said: "We're very dependent on capital spending. Lower interest rates will help ease the capital-spending environment."
 
Loosening Up Credit
 Lower rates could also help loosen the credit squeeze, since lower rates typically involve the creation of more bank reserves. Money would become more available for business even if banks are reluctant to extend loans, said James E. Annable Jr., chief economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. That is because "cash earns no returns," so banks will at least invest their cash in T-bills," he said. "The seller of those securities has more money to lend or spend."
No one can say whether the latest rate cut will or will not be enough to clear the way for a sustainable recovery. "Every time rates come down, there's a group that says they have to come down some more," Mr. Joelson said. That group includes Michael Boskin, the President's chief economic adviser, who said yesterday that the Fed might have to lower rates again. The fact is that there is only one way to find out: wait and see.
"The Fed is feeling its way along," Mr. Annable said. "If there's more weakness, they'll do it again."
The economy, most forecasters estimate, expanded this summer, probably at an annual rate of 2.5 to 3.5 percent. Those results, based on preliminary data, are virtually baked into the cake since consumer spending rose smartly in June and July and business has not been cutting inventories as fast as in the spring. But, worries have been focused on the fall. "The great risk was always a collapse in the fourth quarter," Mr. Annable said.
 
Higher Spending by Christmas?
 The effect of the latest round of cuts should start to show up around Christmas. It takes three or four months, on average, Mr. Annable said, for interest payments to adjust and business and consumers to react with higher spending.
Consumers, who have even more debt outstanding than American corporations, reap benefits, too. Their debt, three-quarters of which is home mortgages, currently equals about 93 percent of after-tax income. The average American consumer spends 9 percent of take-home pay on interest payments. Mr. Wyss estimates that half of those are variable payments. "The rate decline since last year has added about one percentage point to Americans' incomes, not a trivial amount," Mr. Wyss said.
The net effect on households is harder to pin down, compared with other parts of the economy. Economists contend that the effect is still positive in the aggregate. For one thing, Mr. Kudlow said, lower rates are instantly capitalized in higher asset values, including bonds, stocks and, most important, housing. "That makes consumers feel more secure," he said.
Further, Mr. Wyss said, a decline in rates redistributes income from the frugal elderly to freer-spending younger families.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Continues to Slide; Mark Dominates Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar continued its slide against many currencies yesterday, losing ground to currencies backed by higher interest rates.
Analysts said the German mark dominated foreign exchange trading. Ronald Holzer, a vice president with Harris Trust and Company in Chicago, said demand for the mark increased as investors poured money into German investments that pay higher yields. 
 The dollar closed at 1.6720 marks in New York, down from 1.6730 late Monday. In earlier European trading, the dollar fell to 1.6705 marks from 1.6725.
The dollar has lost favor with traders since it became clear United States rates were falling, even before the Federal Reserve lowered its discount rate half a percentage point, to 5 percent, on Friday.
For the dollar, "the trend is clearly down right now, based on interest rate differentials," Mr. Holzer said.
Economic statistics released yesterday painted a picture of a stagnant economy and helped undermine the dollar further as traders feared the Fed might have to cut rates even more to stimulate activity.

HEADLINE: U.S. TIES ISRAELI AID REQUEST TO FREEZE ON SETTLEMENTS AFTER TALKS END IN IMPASSE

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Israel and the United States failed today to reach a compromise on the explosive loan guarantee issue. Within hours after the talks ended the Bush Administration signaled that it would refuse to provide the requested help unless Israel agreed to a freeze on future settlements in the occupied territories.
After Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d finished his second day of meetings in Jerusalem with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, reporters on Mr. Baker's flight to Cairo were summoned for an unusually blunt briefing. They were told explicitly for the first time what has been implicit in the Administration's position all along: that it will not give the Israelis the $10 billion five-year loan guarantee for housing for Soviet immigrants without an Israeli agreement to halt future settlements in the occupied West Bank, Golan Heights and Gaza strip. 
 The United States has opposed the settlements on legal and political grounds. The Bush Administration has joined the issue now because it is being pressed by Israel and its supporters to come through with a huge loan program to aid Soviet immigrants. If granted without an agreement on freezing further expansion, the loan program might lead to large-scale settlements, making it much more difficult to work out an Arab-Israeli peace accord.
 
Plans for Soviet Influx
 Reporters traveling with Mr. Baker were told that it was his recommendation that the President go to the American people with a nationwide campaign, including a possible televised address from the Oval Office, "if that is what it takes, because it is their tax dollars that would be supporting settlement activity, which we used to characterize as illegal and which we now moderately characterize as an obstacle to peace."
The sharp words aboard the plane, coming a week after President Bush's tough remarks in Washington, seemed calculated to put pressure on Mr. Shamir to agree to put off Israel's request for the loan guarantees until next January.
The issue of settlements will undoubtedly arise if the loan guarantees are again sought in January, but by then enough progress may have been made in peace talks that the issue would not be as acute as it is now, American officials said.
Washington has been urging Israel and its supporters to agree to a four-month delay in raising the loan-guarantee issue to allow a peace conference to take place this fall without the contentious issue of settlements.
If the Bush Administration sticks to its position, it would mark the first time that any American Government has attempted to use its economic leverage over Israel to get it to halt the building of settlements in the occupied territories.
Successive American Administrations have opposed settlement building since Israel, in the aftermath of the June 1967 war, took control of the West Bank of the Jordan, including the eastern part of Jerusalem from Jordan, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the Gaza strip from Egypt. But not one has ever gone as far to explicitly tie economic assistance to a formal freeze.
Israel has made it clear that it needs the loans to build housing and roads in coming years to care for the huge influx of Soviet Jews. Some 300,000 have entered in the last few years, and a million more are expected in coming years.
 
U.S. Money and Settlements
 Technically, no American aid to Israel can be used in the occupied lands. But the Israelis have been accused of using the American aid to free up other funds for the occupied lands and then asserting that American money was being spent in Israel proper.
The Bush Administration has now concluded, reporters were told, that the only way to make sure that no American money ends up building new Jewish settlements is by insisting on a total freeze on settlements.
That move is bound to generate an explosive debate in the United States between the Administration and Israel's Congressional backers. And that, reporters were told, is precisely why the Bush Administration wants to delay the Israeli loan requests until after the start of a proposed peace conference in October.
Since either Israel will be upset or the Arabs will be upset with the outcome of the coming debate, the Administration wants it to take place after the Arabs and Israelis have been enticed to the peace conference and will have much more to lose if they walk out or scuttle it.
 
Extensive Immigrant Flow
 The issue of Jewish settlements and housing projects in lands that have been predominantly occupied by Arabs is one of the most emotional in Israel, and has been a thorn in United States-Israeli relations for the last 14 years. With the rise to power in Israel in 1977 of the conservative Likud party, which has held that the land taken from Jordan was historically part of Israel, settlement activity has risen significantly.
There are about 225,000 Jews living in the occupied territories, the State Department says, including 90,000 in the West Bank; 12,000 in the Golan Heights, which Israel in effect annexed in 1981; 3,000 in the Gaza strip, and 120,000 in East Jerusalem, which was annexed by Israel in 1967, and the surrounding suburb.
The United States has taken the position that the Fourth Geneva Convention signed at the end of World War II bars an occupying power from settling the land with its citizens. On that basis, the United States has regarded the Israeli settlements as illegal.
The issue has been complicated by the extensive flow of Soviet immigrants in the last few years, and the temptation of Israeli officials to open up the West Bank for settlement even further.
At a news conference last week, Mr. Bush startled supporters of Israel by sharply criticized Israeli lobbying on the loan-guarantee issue. One reason for the briefing today appeared to be to try to dispel any notion that there might be differences between the Secretary of State and the President on how tough to be with the Israelis.
The Administration's assessment, reporters were told, was that if the United States were to let the Israelis have the $10 billion loan guarantees without any prior commitment by Israel to halt new settlements, the Arab countries and Palestinians would not come to the proposed peace conference -- and that is something the Bush Administration could understand. The loan guarantees are a form of insurance to banks and other lending institutions that loans to Israel will be repaid. That allows Israel to get favorable terms.
Reporters were told that if the United States gave the loan guarantees to Israel now, without linking them to a settlement halt, Mr. Baker was confident that the Arabs would not show up.
Paradoxically, no Arab Government has stated that in public. When Egypt's Foreign Minister, Amr Moussa, was asked today whether Egypt felt that way he avoided answering explicitly.
The Israelis told Mr. Baker they would agree to the delay provided that the Administration would promise now that Israel would get the full $10 billion in loan guarantees in four months without any links to a settlement halt.
When asked for the Administration's reaction to the Israeli offer, reporters were told "that is just something we are not going to agree to if we only get one vote" in Congress.
Mr. Baker said he offered the Israelis a six-point compromise proposal of his own that included an Administration commitment to address the loan-guarantee issue in principle after the four-month delay, to press its allies to help with loan guarantees and to compensate Israel for any costs in the delay. But it explicitly did not include a promise of the full $10 billion in guarantees or a way to avoid any link to a halt on settlements.
 
Arab Calls for a Halt
 Reporters traveling with Mr. Baker were told that he does not want "to indicate one inch of flexibility beyond the six points that we have proposed, which are damn forthcoming and you can use the word damn."
"It is a case frankly of not being able to justify in our own minds or to the other parties to the peace process an unconditional $10 billion infusion that does not have any restriction other than the usual boiler plate, which doesn't have any effect on the question of settlements," he continued.
According to American officials, "every Arab Government" that Mr. Baker spoke with during his attempts to organize a peace conference over the last seven months asked him to make a halt on Israeli settlement building in the West Bank and Gaza strip a precondition for their attending the peace conference.
Mr. Baker was said to have told the Arabs that the question of settlements was a matter for negotiations between them and Israel. Moreover, he reportedly did not believe he could get the Israelis to agree to a freeze on settlements in advance of the talks.
Reporters traveling with Mr. Baker were told the Administration thought that, having gotten the Arabs to drop their demand for a halt on settlements as a condition for attending the peace talks, it could not now suddenly turn around and give Israel the guarantees without insuring first that the money would not go into new settlements.
It is precisely because there has to be a debate on the terms of the loan guarantees -- a debate that is bound to alienate either Israel or the Arabs and lead one of the parties not to attend the peace conference -- that Mr. Bush wants the issue postponed until the conference is under way.
American officials said that Mr. Baker still had not received a Palestinian commitment to attend the peace conference or to send representatives who would be acceptable to Israel. The Israelis insist that they not be from East Jerusalem, that they not have any ties to the P.L.O. and that they be only from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, not from the Palestinian diaspora.
American officials are hoping some decision from the Palestinians will emerge from the Palestine National Council meeting in Algiers, the P.L.O.'s parliament in exile, which is tentatively scheduled for Sept. 23.
Mr. Baker, in an attempt to win more support in the United States for the Administration's position, disclosed the elements of the Administration's six-point compromise proposal, which has been circulating on Capitol Hill for more than a week.
He said, "If the Government of Israel would agree to the 120-day delay we are seeking in order that the issue not be the subject of a big divisive debate, with attendant adverse consequences for the peace process, the Administration would agree as follows."
"First that we would work with the supporters of absorption assistance in the Congress in January to find a suitable legislative vehicle."
He continued, "We would agree that we would not ask for a further delay come January. Third, we would be willing to restate our support for the principle of absorption aid."
Fourth, he said, the Administration would try to limit the amount of money that it has to set aside by law in case the Israelis do not repay any of the loans.
Fifth, the United States would compensate Israel for any "out of pocket" expenses that it would incur by delaying its loan requests for 120 days.
Sixth, said Mr. Baker, the United States would press its allies to help Israel with similar housing-loan guarantees of their own.

HEADLINE: The Gates Hearings;
Excerpts From Senate Hearing on Nominee to Head the C.I.A.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from today's hearings by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on the nomination of Robert M. Gates to be Director of Central Intelligence, with questions by Senators Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio; John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri; Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, and Warren B. Rudman, Republican of New Hampshire. The transcript was provided by the Federal News Service.
 
QUESTIONS
By SENATOR METZENBAUM
 Q. I think I'd like to summarize where I think we stand so far. My questions last night were probing inconsistencies between what you said to Congressional committees at various times regarding Iran-contra and what was actually happening in your shop. . . . Frankly, Mr. Gates, one of the most difficult challenges that I'm finding in connection with your confirmation relates to the fact that so much was happening at the C.I.A. and around the C.I.A., and you have pretty much indicated that you didn't know. . . . I was also concerned by your answer as to how you would have handled a direct question in 1986 regarding whether there were undisclosed covert action findings. 
 You said that in such a situation you would have given a slightly deceptive answer: namely, that you lacked all the facts in order to get time to warn [the Director of Central Intelligence, William J.] Casey that you were on the spot. Politically, I can understand why you would want to do that. But you also said that you would not view this answer as misleading, which I found hard to accept. To slightly deceive Congress is to mislead Congress.
You went on to say that you would have gotten back to us quickly with the full truth or you would resign, and that, unquestionably, was a good answer.
But this seems to miss the point. If you were hiding things from us, even for a short time, then how can we ever trust you truthfully to answer a question when it is posed? . . .
Let's go back to the first time that you say you heard about the Iran arms sale. On Dec. 5, 1985, you attended a meeting at the C.I.A., where you learned that the agency had been involved the previous month in supporting an Israeli transfer of U.S. arms to Iran without a Presidential finding [authorization for covert action, required by law]. . . .
Why didn't you immediately voice your objections to your superiors? Why did you not immediately insist on proper reporting procedure with respect to any future covert activity?
A. . . . These were all matters completely outside my area of responsibility, Senator. I make no bones about the fact that I was not knowledgeable about the specifics of the law with respect to the Arms Export Control Act. And so, again, these matters were outside of my area. And I would say to you when it became my responsibility, again as I indicated last night, I promulgated new rules, as Acting Director, forbidding a proprietary to undertake any action on behalf of the Government without presumption that a finding would be required.
Q. Do you have any doubt in your mind that what was being talked about at that meeting was illegal, was improper and that it shouldn't take place? Didn't you have any feeling about that at all?
A. No, sir. And I may say that the Deputy Director at the time, Mr. McMahon, was a man of enormous probity, and I was completely comfortable with the circumstances that were going on at that time.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. You gave written testimony to this committee that you saw a scenario paper from the National Security Council in February 1986 which laid out a schedule for the exchange of arms for hostages. You have described the scenario which predicted the Ayatollah Khomeini would be dead by May of that year as laughable. That was the quality of the intelligence operation that had been taken out of your agency's control. Yet you allowed it to go forward.
At the same time, you, in your words, quote, "lost touch with the project," end of quote, as you became involved with the confirmation process to become Deputy Director of Central Intelligence.
Now the foreign policy implications of an arms for hostages swap with Iran was staggering. The plan being implemented was doomed to be a fiasco. The question is, how could you put your personal agenda over your obvious obligations as a professional to put a halt to this violation of U.S. policy? . . .
A. Senator Metzenbaum, the President of the United States made the decision to sell arms for hostages. He may have made that decision in the context of larger objectives and an opening to Iran and so on and so forth, but that was his decision. It was a policy decision. . . .
It seems to me that it is not the role of C.I.A. to question the policy decision. We should have questioned how our part of that operation was carried out and the fact that it was in violation of all of the procedures and approaches that we normally would take in one of these covert actions. In that area, I think we were negligent as an agency.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. As you mention again your statement yesterday, I do have to reflect upon the fact that nothing is more useful in many instances than to say, "I was wrong, my fault, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have, I'd do it differently."

 	 	 		. . .	 	A. I think that beginning the very day that I became Acting Director -- not today, not yesterday, not when I was nominated for this position now, not even when I was nominated in February 1987, did I suddenly come to these things or learn these lessons. But the record is clear that I learned them immediately, and that beginning when I became Acting Director in the middle of December 1986 I began to put into place the kind of procedures that would insure this kind of thing wouldn't happen again.
And I took actions on receiving information, the illustration that I used yesterday, to insure that the Congress was fully informed when we received information that even suggested the possibility of an impropriety. And that happened, Senator, within a matter of days after I became Acting Director, not in connection with any nomination procedure.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Admiral Poindexter [the White House national security adviser] has twice testified that he approached you in July 1986 with the proposal that the C.I.A. purchase a supply network that had been set up for the contras, and consisted of airplanes, boats, warehouses and weapons. In his deposition he said your response was, "Let me check into it," or something like that. The network was worth over $4 million.
An exchange of communication through the White House computer between North and Poindexter verifies Poindexter's testimony that he had at least one conversation with you about the possibility of the C.I.A. taking over the resupply network when legal restrictions were lifted by Congress. A private network set up or run by officials of the U.S. Government was, of course, in violation of the Boland Amendments [Congressional prohibitions on involvement with the Nicaraguan rebels]. . . . shouldn't it have bothered you that the national security adviser to the President was acting as their broker. . . .
A. Senator, at that time I had no idea that they were anything more than a private group of people who had gotten together to support the contras. I had no indication that there was a violation of law. . . .
I had no idea that there was anything improper or inappropriate going on. I had the view of Admiral Poindexter that he was a completely straight arrow and completely straight shooter.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. I'm afraid, Mr. Gates, as we sit here looking at you as the should-have-been, would-have-been, could-have-been nominee, rather than the man who is, concerns me.
You testified before this committee on Dec. 4, 1986, regarding Charlie Allen's Oct. 1, 1986, approach to you about his concerns regarding possible diversion of monies to the contras [Charles Allen, national intelligence officer]. You told us consonant with the way we -- this is a quote -- "Consonant with the way we had responded to such stories in the past, my first reaction was to tell Mr. Allen I didn't want to hear any more about it. That I didn't want to know anything about funding for the contras." . . .
A. Two points, Senator. First of all, it was agency policy to keep as great a distance as possible between ourselves and the private benefactors. There were clear prohibitions in the Boland Amendment in terms of our relationship with the private benefactors. My initial reaction was in reaction to that policy that we weren't supposed to know, we weren't supposed to have any contacts, it was basically none of our business who was giving money to the contras or how much it was.
Now the second point is that although that was my immediate reaction to Mr. Allen, one of reaction of surprise perhaps to what he said, the fact is that the actions I took are quite different. I told him to see the Director as soon as possible. . . . My actions bespeak a very different approach and a very different attitude.
Let me make one final point on this question, Senator Metzenbaum. As I have thought about my 1987 confirmation hearings, one of the few things that I said in that hearing that I regretted was the statement that we didn't want to know and we shunned information. Unfortunately, I chose in those hearings to speak from an institutional standpoint. I chose to repeat what I had been told by others in the agency had been their approach, when people had come to them or when they thought they might have the opportunity to learn more, that they had shunned the information, they had turned it away, they didn't want to know.
But I don't think there's any example in the record -- and of all the interviews that this committee has done -- of somebody coming to me from the agency and reporting wrong-doing or an impropriety during that period. And the first time I have any recollection of tht happening on October the 1st, 1986, I took an action. And I think that is more important.
Q. Mr. Gates, you don't seem to understand that it isn't enough to just wait for somebody to come and report an impropriety. You are an intelligence officer, you are skilled in this business. . . . What bothers me is that this very intelligent man, this high-ranking official in the C.I.A. and the N.S.C. doesn't say, "Wait a minute. Tell me some more. What did you say? . . . "There is a violation -- possible violation of the Boland Amendment here. I believe we have a responsibility." It was as if you said, "I'm fading into the shadows. I don't want to hear another word about it. See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil." . . .
What would you do about it now?
A. Well, if something like that came to my attention now, Senator, I would first see the naTional security adviser and tell him there was a problem. And if he did not immediately follow up either with the White House counsel or the Attorney General, I would. And if he did not -- or did not want me to do that, I would go to the President.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
QUESTIONS
By SENATOR DANFORTH
 Q. Mr. Gates, I listened very carefully to Senator Metzenbaum's statement that in his view your position at the C.I.A. was like the three monkeys: "Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil." Is it a fair statement ----
A. Absolutely not, Senator Danforth. As I indicated yesterday, within a day or two after becoming Acting Director, information came to me suggesting the possibility that some U.S. Government officials and perhaps a couple of C.I.A. officers had been engaged in arms sales to the contras. That information was characterized to me by people as hearsay, perhaps disinformation and so on. It was my judgment that it warranted greater attention than that, and I directed the individual -- the head of the other intelligence agency -- not only to brief the Attorney General but the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, the acting national security adviser and the chairmen of the two intelligence oversight committees. I believe that that is characteristic of a very aggressive approach toward looking into wrongdoing that characterizes my performance, certainly as Acting Director and also as Deputy Director under Director Webster. . . .
When information first came to me that one of our officers had not -- had violated agency policy in terms of the private benefactors, I notified the chairman of this committee in January 1987. And when it came to my attention a couple of weeks later that that officer may not have told the truth, I was on the phone to Chairman Boren and to the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee within an hour of having learned that information myself.
. . . Frankly, I think that my whole career speaks to a willingness to speak my mind and say what I think. When I was a relatively new analyst, in 1973, I wrote an article for Studies in Intelligence that basically said that the entire way we went about doing Soviet analysis had deep flaws and that we weren't doing it very well.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. It's very interesting to me that some people attack you because they say that your views might have been too strongly stated, particularly with respect to the U.S.S.R., and other people say, oh, you have politicized your views. I don't think you can have it both ways. You have been, haven't you, at odds with various people in various administrations with respect to how your analysis squares with their policy?
A. Yes, sir. That began when I was working with Dr. Brzezinski on the N.S.C. staff in the Carter Administration. It continued in the Reagan Administration and even to an extent in this one.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. I think, Mr. Gates, from your record it's clear that you're a person who is independent and that you call them as you see them. . . .
Let me ask you a question about how intelligence analysis fits in with policy making. I'll just give you one example that to me is an interesting example. Last winter we were facing a vote in the Senate on the question of whether to authorize the use of force against Iraq. A very good debate, very hotly contested on both sides. . . . After a lot of pressure that was directed at the agency, finally the view was expressed, "Well, sanctions are not likely to get Iraq out of Kuwait. I mean, maybe they'll hurt the economy, hurt the civilian population, hurt the Air Force, but not likely to extract these embedded ground troops out of Iraq." That was a kind of bottom line getting all of the murkiness out of the analysis. . . .
As soon as that bottom line was expressed, immediately the rejoinder of those who had, in my opinion, made up their minds that they were against the use of force, their immediate rejoinder was, "Well, the C.I.A. has become politicized." . . .
How can you as Director give us information which is clear in the basis of decision making and at the same time which isn't going to be immediately discounted as being simply a statement of Administration policy?
A. Senator, I think that the provision of briefings and documents, intelligence assesments to the Congress on a continuing basis, so that the people in the oversight committees and in the other committees that receive this material have access to that on a continuing basis, as I've indicated previously, is one sure way of providing a safeguard on the integrity and objectivity of analysis. . . .
But I think that there should be no question about their basic integrity. But I think that provision of this material to the Congress is one safeguard. I think the other safeguard, frankly, is certainly referring to the President who has nominated me, President Bush, is that this President wants the material with the bark off. He wants to know clearly the situation he's getting himself into. And I've never heard him complain if the intelligence is in a different direction than the policy is headed.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. You were very close to President Bush. You've worked in the White House now for some time. He is a person who has served in the job for which you have been nominated. He is a person who is very knowledgable about foreign affairs. . . . Do you believe that as Director of Central Intelligence you would be in any way coopted by virtue of your past relationship with the President?
A. No, sir, I don't. . . . I think that having a Director who has a close personal relationship with the President offers a unique opportunity for the intelligence community to provide relevant intelligence and sharper intelligence to the policy process, and frankly, also to the Congress.
Q. If I could just ask one more question, Mr. Gates, it's the reverse of the prior one. . . . Is the C.I.A. going to be -- under your directorship, is it simply going to be a rationalization for Bob Gates' basic view of the world? How do you guard yourself against maybe not being open to what the thoughts and what the advice and the analysis is of people who are working in the agency?
A. Well, Senator, I would concede that I am probably not the easiest person in the world to work for. I am fairly demanding, and I'm probably, at times, more direct than I -- than I might be in terms of people's egos.
But fundamental to my approach to analysis -- and it begins with the article that I wrote in 1973 -- is my belief that the policy maker must be exposed to alternative points of view, that all points of view have to be heard and they have to be presented. . . .
I have always believed in alternative analysis. I believe that if you look at the record of intelligence failures over the last 20 years, in virtually every instance, it is because there was a single outcome forecast -- it is going to be X or Y or Z instead of telling the policy: Look, we really don't know how this is going to come out. Here are the possibilities, and here is our best estimate. . . .
So I -- the way I would characterize myself is as a person who has strong views, but I am open to different interpretations, and I also recognize and am willing to acknowledge when I've been wrong.

QUESTIONS
By SENATOR BRADLEY
 Q. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Gates, yesterday you were rather disarming in admitting error when you said that you should have taken more seriously the possibility of impropriety or even wrongdoing when you said that you should have been more skeptical, when you said you should have pressed harder, and I'm just curious now, five years later, as you reflect on those failures. Tell me what -- why do you think they occurred? In other words, what part of you didn't assert itself?
A. I think that I was too cautious in approaching the clandestine service, Senator, and also in deferring to Mr. Casey's special relationship with the clandestine service. Having grown up in a different culture, in the analytical culture, knowing that there were some strains and perhaps even a measure of mistrust of me in the clandestine service, I paid attention to other aspects of the work and did not press these issues.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. If we could, I'd like to go back to what was basically the strategic rationale for the Iran-contra operation. . . . This was really initiated by the national intelligence officer for the Near East and Southeast Asia, but you were the manager of the memorandum, and this was a memorandum that basically stated that Soviet's inroads were being made in Iran. And excluded from the final memorandum was both the Soviet section of the C.I.A. and the Iranian section of the State Department. . . .
About a month later, in June of 1985, the Soviets removed the remaining 1,000 technicians. They ceased all deliveries. . . . Yet, this estimate really wasn't changed until February 1986. How do you explain that?
And in the interim, of course, Iran-contra was born.
A. . . . This estimate had two fundamental points. One was that the internal situation in Iran was worse than people had anticipated and raised the possibility of significant tumult before Ayatollah Khomeini died.
The other was that these conditions created the circumstances in which the Soviets might make significant inroads at the expense of the west and the United States, in particular. The first of those points was a direct outgrowth of an estimate or of an assessment done by a directorate of intelligence analyst in late March of 1985. . . .
There was a disagreement, I later learned, in C.I.A. with the estimate's views on the Soviet -- the potential for Soviet achievement. But the analysts weren't excluded from involvement in the estimate. They simply did not have their views accepted.
And for reasons that are not clear to me, those analysts not only did not come to me, they did not go to their immediate supervisor, the director of Soviet analysis, to protest that their views were not being taken fully into account by the national intelligence officer. So I was unaware of this -- of this dispute and the fact that the C.I.A. Soviet analysts felt their views hadn't been fully taken into account.
Q. And that's why there was no alternative view presented?
A. On the Soviet issues, yes, sir.
Q. And why on the Iranian issue was there no alternative view?
A. There was a long discussion at the board meeting about that. Some changes were proposed in the language to try and satisfy the I.N.R. representative. I spoke about it. Mr. McMahon spoke. General Odom of N.S.A. spoke. I think the Director spoke. All trying to say: Doesn't the -- don't the changes that we've made accommodate the -- the view that you all have? The I.N.R. representative said no, and Mr. Casey said, "Fine, take your footnote."
I think at some point after that, I'm -- my own memory is vague on it. But I apparently called Ambassador Abramowitz and talked him out of the footnote. My view was that the footnote, that the change that had been made in the estimate was sufficient, that the footnote was kind of pointless.
Q. But you did call and urged him not to put the footnote in?
A. Apparently so, and I was successful in persuading him that it did not add to the policy makers' knowledge on this matter.
Q. So that there was no alternative view presented?
A. That is correct because I felt that the view that they had, as they had written their footnote, really didn't representative an alternative view.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. I'd like to turn to Iraq, if I could. Could you give me -- what was the intelligence basis for the Administration's response to the gassing of the Kurds? Do you recall August '88? . . . What was -- what was the basis for the kind of lukewarm response? I mean, you know, opposing it, but at the same time not opposing it strongly. Was there a basis in intelligence for that? Was there something about Iraq that -- --
A. Not that I'm aware of, Senator. . . . I'm not quite sure what you're asking me.
Q. Well, let's go down. Let's do another one, and you'll get the drift. We passed an amendment here in the Congress in, I think, '88 that applied unilateral sanctions to Iraq. This is, I think, after the gassing. And the Administration fought to delete those unilateral sanctions in the conference and succeeded in doing so. Was there an intelligence basis for the effort to delete unilateral sanctions against Saddam Hussein?
A. No, sir, I don't think so.
Q. So that the effort to delete them was not based upon any information about his intentions?
A. I think it was based on policy considerations.
Q. Uh-huh. Now, could you tell me, in 1988, Iraq routed Iran, if you recall, and you were the Deputy D.C.I. [Director of Central Intelligence] at that time. Is that not correct?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. Isn't it true that you refocused collection and analytical resources away from Iraq toward other issues in areas of concern after that routing? . . .
A. Our concentration on the Iran-Iraq war had imposed some limitations on our satellite capabilities in terms of some longstanding problems in the Soviet Union and elsewhere, and so once the war was over, we tried to address some of those issues and problems.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. What I'm getting at is here was the end of the war. Iraq was still a problem; at this point, admittedly the most powerful country in the region. And we moved our intelligence resources elsewhere. . . . Was that a wise thing to have done?
A. I believe the intelligence assessment that was done in 1989, Senator Bradley, stated the view that Saddam Hussein and Iraq would be spending the next several years, more likely than not, engaged in rebuilding. Iraq had taken a fairly heavy pounding in the war, even though they won it and had the kind of capabilities that you're -- you're describing. . . .
Q. Uh-huh. Were you responsible for directing this? [the assessment]
A. No, sir, I don't think so.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Another area of real importance in the world, of course, in the new world, is China. And I recall an exchange we had back in 1986 in the committee. . . . What would you do differently to catch that kind of change in China that you did not do to catch that kind of change in the Soviet Union?
A. Part of the problem is being able to measure broad popular sentiment and overall conditions in a country that is fundamentally a difficult place in which to travel or to gather information or to talk to people.
Now I know lots of travelers go to China, lots of travelers went to the Soviet Union. But it certainly is an environment in which people are afraid to talk and often afraid to be candid. I think more can be done through expanded human intelligence collection.
I think part of what can be done is simply to ensure that people are thinking about these problems, that they are sitting down and trying to identify, here are what the different alternative paths may be historically for this country, and here are the indications of what we might see if the country were moving in one or another of those paths, and those indications would then perhaps provide a guide for collection.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
QUESTIONS
By SENATOR RUDMAN
 Q. There are a few areas that I think do need some emphasis here to keep this record straight.
Senator Metzenbaum referred during a long series of questions, both last evening and this morning, to a November-December -- I don't know the exact date -- appearance of yours before the Senate Intelligence Committee, in which you made known your strong feelings about notification.
Then in the questions following that narrative, there was the suggestion that somehow you were disingenuous to the committee, that you fact misrepresented to the Congress your point of view because at the time you were doing that you were aware of an unreported finding. . . . I want to, for the record, refer to Iran-contra exhibit JMP-28, which is on the White House stationary of Jan. 17, 1986. I might say parenthetically that I hope that some day I will never have to talk about this subject again, but I guess it just keeps coming up. It's almost like a typhus epidemic in that anybody within five miles of the germ either died, is infected, or is barely able to survive. . . .
The Jan. 17 White House exhibit I have in front of me was a memorandum for the President of the United States, then Ronald Reagan, from his national security adviser, John Poindexter. It's very instructive, in reading that, to read the last paragraph. . . . It said the following, and I would point out this time you were the Deputy Director for Intelligence. Am I correct?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. That is a very esteemed position but it is hardly the final policy leadership of the C.I.A., is that correct?
A. Yes, sir.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. In the finding itself, in the operative clause, it says the following: "I hereby find" -- this is the President of the United States speaking -- " hereby find that the following operation in a foreign country, including all support necessary to such operation, is important to the national security of the United States, and due to its extreme sensitivity and security risks, I determine it is essential to limit prior notice and direct the Director of Central Intelligence to refrain from reporting this finding to the Congress as provided in Section 501 of the National Security Act of 1947 as amended, until I otherwise direct." . . . Do you feel that as a Deputy Director of Intelligence or as the Deputy Director of Intelligence that you at that point were free to violate that restriction laid on the agency by the President of the United States?
A. No, sir.
Q. Now to carry it a step further, what you have said to us in testimony is that were you to find yourself in that position, you would -- and I'd like you to finish the sentence.
A. I characterize that if I had found myself asked the specific question in April 1986 confronted with the directive from the President I would in effect seek time to go back and say that I had been confronted with this situation, that I had to respond to the committee, and that the only possibilities were either to tell them about the finding or to go back and tell them that I had been directed by the President not to answer the question.
But I would have sought guidance in that way and I would have come back to the committee immediately. I am assuming it would have been the very next day.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. I want to talk about the famous Allen meeting of Oct. 1, 1986 and the memo that was executed pursuant to that. I'm not very anxious to air soiled laundry of the C.I.A. at this hearing, but there is something that really ought to be said here, and I am aware of it. I have been made aware of it, and I want to discuss it with you in as diplomatic terms as I can. You, Mr. Gates, are a product of the intelligence directorate. Am I correct?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. And at the time, Clair George was the director of operations. Am I correct?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. Am I correct that there was -- you characterize it as mistrust, but would I be accurate in saying that the relationship between you and Mr. George was somewhat strained at times?
A. We cooperated in some areas, and we had some strong disagreements in others, yes, sir.
Q. Would it also be fair to say that, although neither of you knew what the outcome be, that you were looked at as people who were upward-bound in the agency and there might have been some thought on someone's part that you were competitors for advancement within the agency? Is that a fair statement?
A. I suppose some may have thought that, yes.
Q. Well, many people thought that, Mr. Gates.
Now, when Mr. Allen came to you with this complaint, he was essentially talking about something that was within the realm of the operations directorate. Am I correct?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. And you were in the intelligence directorate.
A. By that time, sir, I was the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence.
Q. But your background, I should have said ----
A. Yes.
Q. ---- was in the Intelligence Directorate.
A. Yes.
Q. Let me ask you this flat-out question, Mr. Gates. It's -- I've never asked it to you in our private meetings. I saved it for today. During that time when you were dealing with Mr. Casey, who you knew had a rather direct pipeline down to the D.O. [operations directorate] and, in fact, would even bypass the D.O. and go to some of his subordinates, Mr. George's subordinates, such as Mr. Fiers, was it not a fact that you -- one of the reasons you proceeded with extreme caution was that you did not want to get yourself into a situation of antagonizing the operations directorate without adequate and substantial cause to go forward?
A. I certainly was concerned that they not view me as having some sort of a inherent suspicion of them or mistrust of them in terms of their activities and their integrity. I did worry about that, yes. . . .
And I think also it was part of the reason why I moved slowly in involving myself in the activities of the clandestine services. I indicated yesterday only moving to get these briefings on a couple of these operations at the end of July, several months after I became deputy.
Q. Well, I thank you for that answer. It confirms what I have been told by others and what I have thought. And one of the problems of these hearings is they take place in a rather sterile atmosphere, and to try to get the real-life feelings of people who are on-line in the position facing the crisis is a very difficult thing to convey. . . .

HEADLINE: THE GATES HEARINGS: New-Era Espionage;
More Spies and Less Costly Hardware Are at Heart of Gates's Plan for C.I.A.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Robert M. Gates this week committed himself to refashion American espionage for a new era, including some changes, like a steep increase in human, as opposed to electronic, spying, that would reverse decades-old trends.
But he stopped well short of endorsing the kind of wholesale overhaul and cuts in the $30 billion-a-year spy bureaucracy that growing numbers of critics are demanding now that the Soviet military threat has eased. 
 If Mr. Gates is confirmed, as seemed increasingly likely today, his public statements suggest that he will try to streamline and refocus the Central Intelligence Agency and its sister organizations along lines advocated by many critical, but moderate experts. Some of his proposals, like expanding the number of agents gathering intelligence while reducing the reliance on satellites and other electronic systems, have been debated for years.
The Gates blueprint reflects the views of his boss, President Bush, and most members of the Senate Intelligence Committee who are debating whether to support his confirmation as Director of Central Intelligence.
Mr. Gates's proposal of limited changes comes at a time when the C.I.A. and its sister intelligence agencies are under sharper and more sustained attack than at almost any time in their history.
On one hand, Congressional budget-cutters are proposing sharp reductions in spending, arguing that the need for espionage has fallen with the military threat from Moscow. On the other, the agency is being widely accused of misreading the most important sea of changes in recent history, from the end of Soviet-style Communism to the corrupting effect of narcotics on global politics to the rise of Islamic fundamentalism and the military adventures of Iraq. The debate was crystallized on a recent cover of Time Magazine that posed the question, in bold type: "Is the C.I.A. obsolete?"
Mr. Gates is not oblivious to the criticism, and in his testimony this week, he has acknowledged its validity. "At a time of revolutionary change abroad and government-wide fiscal constraints at home, U.S. intelligence cannot remain fundamentally unaffected," he told the intelligence panel on Monday. "C.I.A. and U.S. intelligence must change and be seen to change, or confront irrelevance and growing sentiment for their dismantlement."
Mr. Gates's own proposals for changes implicitly criticize American espionage for pursuing secrets that are no longer important, writing too much about topics that the Government does not care about, and failing to mesh properly with the Pentagon bureaucracy in times of military crisis, like the Persian Gulf war.
But his proposal, given to the panel on Monday and enlarged on today, calls more for reorganizing the system than scrapping it. He also warned in his testimony today that the C.I.A. would be unable to make some wholesale changes, like shifting spies or analysts to environmental problems, because it would lack the money.
Mr. Gates's plan calls for the White House to immediately compile a master list of information deemed vital to national security in the next 10 to 15 years. That list would become a map for budgetary and bureaucratic changes in the espionage agencies in this decade.
Mr. Gates's plan calls for "dramatically" increasing the use of human spies and limiting covert operations, like C.I.A.-backed guerrilla wars undertaken in Central America and Afghanistan. He also proposes to better integrate the duties of the civilian C.I.A. and the warren of intelligence agencies at the Pentagon, so that bureaucratic disputes and communications glitches do not cripple the military in times of crisis.
Some Government officials, including General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of allied forces in the Persian Gulf war, sharply criticized the intelligence bureaucracy this summer for failing to adequately integrate support for troops and aircraft in the battlefield.
Mr. Gates would push to free much of the intelligence agencies' spending from direct control by the Pentagon. That would effectively give him more freedom to spend money where he believes it is needed, because spending for espionage would no longer fluctuate in lock step with each spike or dip in the military's increasingly volatile budget.
 
More Open to the Public
 Finally, in a move that is surely controversial within the C.I.A., he pledges to enlarge on efforts by the last C.I.A. director, William H. Webster, to make the agency more open to the public and Congress. Mr. Gates argued this week that rampant public mistrust of the C.I.A. can only be allayed by making the agency's activities less mysterious and open to distortion.
By and large, Mr. Gates's proposals are not surprising. They are in large part an endorsement of Mr. Webster, who began remaking the agency's public image and sought to expand the number and versatility of its spies and place new curbs on covert activities during his four years as Director of Central Intelligence.
Others are ideas touted by private experts such as Roy Godson, an intelligence expert at the Washington-based National Strategy Information Center, or mentors like Mr. Gates's chief private supporter, Adm. Bobby Ray Inman, retired, a former top C.I.A. official.
They also reflect the reality of 1990's espionage, a profession in which technology no longer reigns supreme and old-fashioned, George Smiley tradecraft is again in ascendance.
 
Spies Versus Satellites
 Satellites, once praised as the miracle workers of intelligence, proved unable to divine the military intentions of a Saddam Hussein or photograph the economic collapse of a Soviet empire. In a time of fiscal austerity, they also have proven too costly for widespread, everyday use; the C.I.A. can hire literally thousands of spies for the cost of one moderately expensive reconnaissance spacecraft.
Mr. Gates's proposals dovetail with recommendations from the intelligence committee, including its chairman, Senator David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, something that cannot help but advance Mr. Gates's confirmation prospects.
Because they almost surely carry President Bush's personal endorsement as well, they stand a good chance of being enacted should Mr. Gates be given the top C.I.A. job.
Two former White House intelligence officials said today that Mr. Gates's ideas have merit.
"I think he gave a realistic appraisal," said Vincent M. Cannistraro, a former C.I.A. officer and intelligence director under President Reagan. "He said about as much as he can say in public testimony without making people jump out of the seventh floor," a reference to the C.I.A.'s executive offices.
Mr. Cannistraro has criticized the agency's response to global changes, even suggesting recently that the C.I.A. could be dismantled and its functions spun off elsewhere.
His former boss in the White House, Kenneth R. deGraffenreid, said today that Mr. Gates's real test would come not in proposing reforms, but in steering them through the bureaucracy.
As director, Mr. Gates would oversee a vast network of espionage agencies that includes the C.I.A., the Defense Intelligence Agency, which performs military analysis; the National Security Agency, which conducts electronic eavesdropping; the National Reconnaissance Office, which launches and controls satellites, and intelligence divisions at the State Department, Treasury Department, Justice Department and elsewhere.
"Given that Gates is a reformer, I don't think those are platitudes. He knows where he's going," said Mr. deGraffenreid, now a private consultant on national security matters.
Mr. Webster was sometimes criticized for failing to push his reforms hard enough, he said. Few believe that the aggressive Mr. Gates will suffer that flaw should he win the top C.I.A. job.

HEADLINE: The Night Guns 'n' Roses' 'Illusions' Became Real

BYLINE: By PETER WATROUS

 BODY:
Monday was a good night to be a teen-age heavy-metal fan in New York City.
At midnight 1,500 people, most of them young, white and male, were lined up outside Tower Records in Greenwich Village. That was the bewitching hour when the two long-awaited new albums by Guns 'n' Roses, "Use Your Illusions I" and "Use Your Illusions II," went on sale across the country. 
 But those who showed up at the downtown Tower and three other record stores in Manhattan witnessed a second special event. In what might be described as a mild publicity coup, Epic Records cashed in on the presale hoopla that Geffen Records had created for Guns 'n' Roses by sending Ozzy Osbourne, its own heavy-metal heavyweight, to the two HMV and two Tower stores to promote his new album, "Don't Blame Me."
"We're here to see Ozzy and shake his hand and buy the Guns 'n' Roses albums," said 19-year-old Russ Porcino of Staten Island. "You're getting two things for one."
Anyone imagining that the demand was a product of a publicity agent's hyperactive mind, however, had only to stand in the line outside the downtown Tower store. For John Gainfort, 27, of Manhattan, who was there with a friend, Mike Torres, Guns 'n' Roses "is the greatest."
"Just about everybody I know is waiting to get the record," he said. "It may be a bit hyped, in that the band took so long to release the record, but it's worth the wait."
Inside the store, fans attacked boxes of the albums, grabbing both volumes. As soon as a photographer or television camera came close, buyers would jump up and shout, holding the albums up in the air, creating perfect photo opportunities and showing their tribal colors.
By 2 A.M., 621 copies of the "Use Your Illusions" compact disk and 224 cassettes had been sold in the downtown Tower store. (The store had no LP's available.) "I didn't think Guns 'n' Roses would do so well," said Mathew Koenig, a regional manager for Tower. "It's the Village, and the Village isn't Guns 'n' Roses territory."
Mr. Osbourne, publicity coup or not, didn't break 100, CD's and tapes combined, at the store.
 
2 hours, 500,000 Sales
 The "Use Your Illusions" CD's sold 500,000 copies nationwide in the first two hours it was on sale, said a Geffen spokesman. Because these sales are coming from the core Guns 'n' Roses audience, it is hard to predict the albums' eventual total sales. But most industry figures interviewed said the CD's have a chance to hit the level of sales achieved by blockbuster albums like Michael Jackson's "Thriller" and Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the U.S.A." And importantly, they, along with a slew of other big records soon to be released, should help the industry recover frpm its current recession.
"It's just amazing; it's just incredible," said Ed Rosenblatt, president of Geffen. "We're sitting on top of the world.
The Camelot chain, based in Canton, Ohio, which had ordered a quarter of a million copies, sold 10,000 copies in the early hours Tuesday at the seven stores it opened at midnight. A spokesman for the chain predicted it would sell 100,000 copies of "Use Your Illusions" in the first week.
Dick Odette, vice president for purchasing for the Minneapolis-based Musicland chain, said: "We opened around 70 stores on Monday night. We had ordered a little shy of a half-million copies, and this is the biggest single release we've ever had. The demand is real. It feels real good."
 
Too Wild for K Mart
 Two of the largest sales outlets for rock records, K Mart and Wal-Mart, refused to carry the Guns 'n' Roses albums. Both chains are known for not selling any records that might be considered controversial or offensive. Guns 'n' Roses, in turn, parodies the language of warning stickers placed on records by the Recording Industry Association of America. The "Use Your Illusions" albums carry stickers that say, "This album contains language which some listeners may find objectionable," followed by an expletive.
Eddie Gilreath, the head of sales at Geffen, was quoted in Billboard this week as saying the company could have shipped a million more copies had the two chains decided to sell the album.
"I think the demand is so high for the record that kids walking into a K Mart looking for the record will just go somewhere else," Mr. Rosenblatt said. "At some point it will hurt, in that parents looking for a birthday or Christmas present may not buy it. But the stores have a great deal more to lose than we do as a record company. It's the image of the band that gets them, and they're frightened."

HEADLINE: THE GATES HEARINGS;
House Votes Bill to Extend Jobless Pay by Margin That Would Defeat Veto

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
The House passed legislation today to provide extra unemployment benefits for three million people who have been out of work at least half a year. The bill, which is similar to one President Bush killed in August, was passed by an apparently veto-proof vote of 283 to 125.
The President was able to block the August bill without vetoing it. The measure passed today was written in a way that would force him to cast a veto if he wants to stop it. 
 The vote on the $6.3 billion measure, which would provide up to 20 extra weeks of benefits for the unemployed in states hit hard by the recession, was 11 votes more than the two-thirds majority required to override a Presidential veto, which the Office of Management and Budget threatened today. Forty-eight Republicans joined 234 Democrats and one independent in support; 107 Republicans and 18 Democrats were opposed.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he would try to bring up similar legislation in the Senate on Thursday.
The measure that died in August attracted much greater Republican support, 70 more than today's, after Republicans were assured that Mr. Bush would be able to kill it easily. The Aug. 2 vote was 375 to 45, with 118 Republicans in favor.
Under the August version, the extended benefits could not go to the jobless unless Mr. Bush both signed the bill and declared an emergency under the terms of last year's budget act to limit the deficit. He signed the bill, saying he wanted to show his sympathy for the unemployed, but refused to declare an emergency, saying, "I won't bust the budget."
Today's legislation would waive the budget act requirements. If Mr. Bush signed it, the benefits would flow, and the deficit would increase. If he vetoed it, Congress would have a chance to muster the two-thirds votes needed to override.
But it is not clear just what kind of bill will be sent to Mr. Bush. Mr. Bentsen, a Texas Democrat, plans to bring up the same bill that was passed in August. That bill would stir less opposition in the Senate, where the rules, or the absence of rules, make it easy for a determined minority to delay action.
Differences in the two bills would be settled in a House-Senate conference. The Senate might give in on the emergency issue. In exchange, it might expect the House to drop its proposal that would make the changes in the unemployment insurance law permanent, not temporary, as in Mr. Bentsen's bill.
 
Bill Echoes Democrats' Theme
 The bill passed today re-emphasized the Democratic theme that President Bush was more concerned with the problems of foreign countries than with those of unemployed Americans. Democrats have complained for weeks that he was quick to endorse emergency status for spending abroad, but not at home.
Representative Thomas J. Downey, the Long Island Democrat who has been the chief sponsor of the House bill, urged passage. "We've spent billions to bail out the S.& L.'s," he said. "We've helped Kurds in Turkey. We've helped the Bangladeshis. It's time to help Americans."
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, talking to reporters as the House voted, said he hoped President Bush would sign the legislation because high unemployment continued even after a recovery began and hundreds of thousands of people each month exhausted their state benefits, which are usually limited to 26 weeks.
"Around the country I don't see anything that could go for any sort of a certainly robust recovery, an energetic recovery or a sharp recovery or vigorous recovery," he said.
Richard A. Darman, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, disagreed, telling reporters after a lunch with Senate Republicans that "the economy has turned" and the Administration felt that legislation to extend benefits was unnecessary.
 
Dole Substitute Backed
 But he said the Administration could support a substitute that Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, plans to offer. It would cost about half as much and provide a maximum of 10 weeks of additional benefits. The Dole bill includes provisions to auction unused radio frequencies, which he said would raise enough money to pay for the additional benefits.
Under the House bill, the new payments would come from a Federal trust fund created to pay extended benefits. The fund, which pays half the current unemployment benefits while a state pays half, now stands at $8 billion.
Benefits can now be extended for 13 weeks beyond the regular 26 weeks in a state when joblessness among its workers who are covered by unemployment isnurance reaches 6 percent. The benefits can also be extended for the same period when the rate reaches 5 percent if the level of the insured jobless exceeds by one-fifth the average level in that state over the last two years.
The unemployment rate among those covered by insurance, about half the work force, is much lower than the total unemployment rate, which was 6.8 percent in August. So under the law as it now stands, those extended benefits are going only to unemployed workers in Rhode Island and Puerto Rico.
 
A Total Unemployment Measure
 Under the bill passed today, the measuring standard used would be total unemployment, not insured unemployment, averaged over the previous six months. In states with 8 percent unemployment, an additional 20 weeks of benefits could be paid to jobless workers. According to the most recent data available, through July, that would add Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan and West Virginia to Puerto Rico and Rhode Island.
In states with 7 percent unemploymengt, an extra 15 weeks of benefits would be paid. Workers in the nation's two most-populous states, California and New York, would qualify, as would those in five other states and the District of Columbia.
In states with 6 percent unemployment, an additional 10 weeks of benefits would be paid, and in all others, five extra weeks would be paid.
All the additional benefits would be paid entirely from Federal money.
Another provision would make people who leave the armed services eligible for 26 weeks of benefits, rather than the 13 weeks that is their limit now. They would also be able to start collecting after one week instead of the current four. Both changes would treat them as civilians are now treated.

HEADLINE: Spiraling Welfare Roll Dominates Dinkins's Report Card

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Issuing the first full-year report card on his administration yesterday, Mayor David N. Dinkins painted a dark picture of New York City's growing social problems and service burdens, dominated by a welfare roll that is climbing to nearly 1 million people for the first time in 15 years.
The Mayor's Management Report, an annual survey that has been issued since the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, found dirtier streets, more homeless families in temporary housing and more children in foster care, spiraling demand for social services for AIDS cases, a drop in the portion of the city's garbage that is recycled and a swelling jail population.
 
No 'Cooking' of Indicators
 But that is not the worst of it. The report covered only the fiscal year that ended June 30 and does not reflect the latest round of service cuts in the $28.5 billion budget adopted in July. For example, those cuts are projected to leave half the city's 59 sanitation districts rated less than 50 percent clean, up from 12 districts now. 
 "It is what it is," said Harvey Robins, the Mayor's director of operations, who compiled the report. When reporters teased him about the tendency of such summaries to "cook" the hundreds of pages of statistical indicators in the most favorable way, he said: "Not only didn't we cook them. This year, we didn't even put them on the stove."
The depth of the city's managerial problems was underlined at another gathering in another room at City Hall yesterday, as administration officials acknowledged that their program to stem the flow of families entering shelters for the homeless had failed to do so. They predicted that by next June, 6,000 families would be living in the shelters, breaking the 1987 record set during the Koch administration. [Page B3.]
The growing welfare roll, amounting to about one-eighth of the city's population, was not unexpected, and accelerates a trend that began in 1990, reversing several years of declines since the early 80's. On June 30, the city had about 937,000 people on the rolls, up from 860,000 the year before. City officials attributed the rise primarily to the recession and expressed concern that it was a harbinger of socioeconomic problems that they would be confronting for years to come.
"You have an explosion in the demand for social services, partly because there are more and more people who are in need," said First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel. "And we don't have resources to support it as much as we would like. It's going to become increasingly difficult, or if we do respond, it's going to have to come from other areas of government. On a global basis, more and more of our resources are going to have to go to solve these problems, unless we can get the Federal Government back into it."
Mary Nakashian, First Deputy Commissioner in the Human Resources Administration's family support administration, said the welfare roll tended to be a lagging indicator of economic trends, because, to qualify for benefits, recipients must first show they have exhausted other options. The city shares the cost of the various public assistance programs with the state and Federal Government, but in the current year the city's share alone is projected to be nearly $700 million.
While the welfare figures show the depth of the city's problems, officials said, they also demonstrate its commitment to confronting them.
 
Some Good News
 "In some ways, this is an indication of the city's capacity to meet needs," Ms. Nakashian said. "We're trying to make sure that people who deserve and are entitled to get on these programs do so."
The report was not without nuggets of good news. More streets were resurfaced, reports of child abuse and neglect fell, more vacant lots were cleaned and there were fewer civilian complaints against police officers.
The city also managed to produce a record 4,173 new or renovated apartments for the homeless, slightly more than the year before, despite cuts in its capital spending. But even this was a sign of the burdens the city faces, since it embarked on building such housing in the 80's only after the Federal Government cut its own efforts.
Mr. Dinkins, who has made efforts to organize other big-city mayors to lobby Washington for more Federal aid, likened Washington's treatment of cities to banks' refusals to make home loans in poor or minority neighborhoods, saying, "The redlining of America's cities by its Federal Government must cease."
The report covered so many fields that few clear themes emerged. In introducing it, Mr. Dinkins said that his administration was committed, amid fiscal troubles, to delivering "the same or greater service for less cost." But when asked to cite two or three examples of that, he groped in vain for an answer, eventually citing a decline in crime, a decline in reports of child abuse and the serving of more meals for the elderly.
"I've got to hasten to say I don't mean I'm satisfied," he said.
The Mayor took pains in his remarks to point up that overall reports of crime fell 4 percent, though murders and manslaughters rose almost 5 percent. Mr. Dinkins said it was not clear whether the city's policing strategies had much effect one way or the other.
Despite the hiring of 1,488 new police officers under the Mayor's ambitious anti-crime plan, the average number of officers scheduled to go on patrol each day stayed basically flat, at just over 10,000, because the new recruits were still in training.
Because of delays and reductions in the city's recycling program, the portion of the city's waste that was recycled totaled just 4.9 percent, down from 6.7 percent the year before.

HEADLINE: A City's Determination To Rewrite History Puts Its Classrooms in Chaos

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Sept. 17

 BODY:
The easy part for the city of Oakland was saying "No" to the social studies textbooks and the vision of multicultural education ordained by the state of California.
Now comes the harrowing task: To rewrite history and do it quickly so that the district's 40,000 elementary and junior high school students do not fall behind while their elders bicker. 
 California, the nation's most populous state and an education maverick, last year sanctioned a new set of social studies textbooks for the primary and junior high grades. But the Oakland school board, overriding the city's teachers and siding with its ethnic advocacy groups, rejected the texts last spring on the ground that the state was bullying them into accepting books that did not reflect a district where 9 of 10 children are non-white.
Since then, amid good intentions but misguided plans, this East Bay city's schools have been thrown into chaos. Two weeks into the academic year, students and teachers face the disorderly reality of learning with no books, old books or books widely considered inferior to the ones that were jettisoned. Meanwhile, district officials and community representatives continue to argue over the new materials -- what they will say, who will write them, and how much they will cost.
 
Students Lost in the Battle
 "The war did not stop with the vote, and the kids may get sacrificed in the battle," said Toni Cook, a member of the Oakland Board of Education, who voted against the books, as did all four black members of the seven-member board. "That, in fact, is the tragedy."
Multicultural education, and a narrower movement in certain urban school districts known as Afrocentrism, is being debated from one end of America to the other. There is little dispute that students should be taught more about the contributions and viewpoints of ethnic and cultural groups other than white Europeans. But there is rancorous debate about how to do that without distorting history or stirring racial discord.
California was the first state to tackle the issue in a sweeping way, with a curriculum overhaul in 1987 that has since been translated, subject by subject, into textbooks. This spring, New York started the same process.
The district-by-district battle over whether to approve the textbooks was bitter here in California, the nation's largest and most ethnically diverse state. But only a small number of districts, Oakland primary among them, rejected the Houghton Mifflin books, which are generally agreed to be flawed but better than the aging texts now in the schools.
 
Copier Machine in Overdrive
 In their place, the Oakland Board of Education selected different texts for certain grades and received state waivers to buy them, even though the alternatives are widely considered, even in Oakland, to be inferior to the Houghton Mifflin series.
But in grades four, five and seven they found no books that matched the new statewide curriculum. In the fourth and fifth grades, where that framework still stresses California and America history, old textbooks have been dusted off, books that date to 1985 and reflect virtually no multicultural perspectives.
In seventh grade, things are even worse because of major changes in the curriculum. There, a hodgepodge of history and geography has been replaced by the study of history from A.D. 500 to 1789, with a focus on non-Western civilizations. The old books make no sense with the new curriculum. And the teachers have no lesson plans, dittos or other materials from years past, and little knowledge of Islamic, Ming Chinese or Aztec history, which they now must teach.
The result is that the rejected text has sneaked into the classrooms. At the Claremont Middle School, for instance, where the Houghton Mifflin books were tested last year, seventh-grade teachers are lining up at the copier machine to duplicate chapters from "Across the Centuries."
"We're in better shape than other schools because we have one set of the books here," said Steven Weinberg, the chairman of the social studies department, who voted for the books when the teachers sent their favorable recommendation to the school board.
But teachers at the Claremont School say they have already used a semester's worth of copier paper in the first two weeks of school.
Teachers with experience in multicultural education are having the easiest time improvising. Take Cheryl R. Washington, a special education teacher at Whittier Elementary School, who also teaches African-American history to youngsters in her neighborhood each Saturday morning. Last week, with no textbooks and using homemade materials, Ms. Washington taught her fourth and fifth graders a different lesson about continents than the one they learned last year.
"We've always said that this is a continent," she said, pointing to Europe on a map. She showed them that it is not a land mass surrounded by water -- the standard definition -- but rather is attached to Asia. "Instead of calling it Europe, some people call it Eurasia. That is another point of view. No view is right, no view is wrong and you might want to talk it over with your parents."
 
Controlling the Curriculum
 At the school district headquarters, far from the realities of Ms. Washington's or Mr. Weinberg's classrooms, the bickering goes on, as it has since last spring when the board split along racial lines and rejected the textbooks.
At that crucial meeting, outnumbered supporters of the textbooks were heckled and called names and some were so intimidated they left without speaking. "Democracy in action," Sheila Jordan, the only white member of the board, said later.
Now the fight is about power more than principle, about whether the insiders from the school district or the outsiders from the community will control the new curriculum. At last week's board meeting, the two sides argued about who would select the supplementary reading lists and who would appoint the review committees. Decisions were delayed, study groups formed and more meetings scheduled.
So far, there is not much to review. The district has issued each teacher a generic geography lesson, appropriate for the grade, which is not very useful and covers only six weeks. The district also plans to use lessons prepared by a county consortium of educators. And the community committee that led rejection of the books is at work on alternative materials.
 
A Worksheet Rejected
 That committee, which has about 100 members, spent the summer writing its own six-week lesson plans for grades four, five and seven. It was a "hairy" process, said Fred Ellis, a professor of education at California State University at Hayward and a leader of the group. Many ethnic organizations participated, each wanting its own group's heritage told in its own way, and decisions were made by consensus.
The district is willing to use the committee's lessons for the fourth and fifth grades, although they are sketchy. But the seventh-grade material has been deemed unacceptable by the district's curriculum department and by some board members.
One section of the seventh-grade material, criticized in many news accounts here, has been withdrawn, Mr. Ellis said. It was a worksheet, headlined "Crimes of a Racist Society," which included pictures of the non-white victims of an accused mass murderer in Milwaukee and an editorial cartoon of Judge Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court nominee.
Another section, unchanged, asks students a series of questions such as: "Why do such enormous inequities of wealth and power exist in the world and within the United States? What might be the economic/political interests of some people for keeping some communities more wealthy than others?"
 
Squeezing in Medieval History
 Other worksheets include articles about toxic dumps in minority communities and polls showing many white people consider blacks lazy.
"These issues of racism are very important and they need to be addressed by students," said Shelly Weintraub, who runs the social studies division of the curriculum department. "But somewhere along the line, we have to teach medieval world history."
The creators of the new materials argue that they are imperfect but pointed in the right direction.
"It's a curriculum in creation," said Kitty Kelly Epstein, an associate professor of education at Holy Names College here and a leader of the committee. "It reflects the struggles and debates of this community. We can go into the classroom with this and evoke the big questions and then modify it based on criticism."
The board shows no signs of endorsing that approach, despite having few alternatives. At each meeting, the combatants seem farther apart; the community reverberates with charges and countercharges.
Ms. Epstein said the state is to blame for the current mess because it tried to force its choice of textbooks on a city that did not want them. The state Superintendent of Public Education, Bill Honig, accused Oakland of "making political points" at the expense of its children.
Board members who opposed the textbooks said the district should not have counted on a rubber stamp vote and should have prepared an alternative to the textbooks. And dissenting members said that the board was unduly influenced by a small but noisy clique.
Ms. Cook noted that there is more than enough blame to go around. "It's been a combination of errors, faux pas and power plays," she said. "And nobody among us should be casting a stone."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
One Red Cent

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Senator Sam Nunn's Armed Services Committee and the Senate cut perhaps $100 million from the Administration's military budget request of $290.8 billion.
Representative Les Aspin's Armed Services Committee and the House did about as much to protect that budget the fiscal year beginning next month. 
 With accounting adjustments and the like, the reductions effectively equal about one red cent. The cuts rank among the very smallest since 1945. Most tellingly, they come at that very moment in history when the Soviet threat has collapsed, when the U.S. deficit soars toward $2 trillion and when America is falling apart.
Why can't Democratic leaders find more than one red military cent to nip from the 1992 budget nearing final passage? Why, when even President Bush -- rebuffing Defense Secretary Dick Cheney -- speaks of "an opportunity for a vastly restructured national security posture," do so many Democrats still speak with such caution about future defense budgets?
Try politics and politics. Democrats still seem to wilt under charges of being soft on defense and tremble from the memory of their wrong-headed opposition to the Persian Gulf war. And they wilt and tremble just when world events should make them bold and visionary, and when Americans are ready to reorder defense and domestic priorities.
The Democrats have another political reason for being timid on the Pentagon's 1992 budget. They made a complicated budget deal with the White House last year that destroyed their political incentive to cut defense. The agreement effectively barred Democrats from shifting money torn from arms to unemployment benefits and highways. A Pentagon dollar saved could be applied only to deficit reduction. And for all the Democrats' yammering about the importance of slicing the deficit, they saw little political payoff in transferring money to a Treasury bank account. In this way the Pentagon budget ceiling worked out with the White House became a floor as well.
George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, says he is willing now to reopen the deal and hit defense, but House Speaker Tom Foley thinks it is too late and too hard to beat a Presidential veto. Mr. Nunn and Mr. Aspin agree with Mr. Foley and have another reason for holding the line: They helped Mr. Cheney set the Pentagon ceiling for 1992 and feel queasy about further U.S. force reductions.
The two chairmen say they are satisfied for now with the Cheney plan to draw down U.S. forces by 25 percent over six years. But those levels were decided upon before the failed coup in Moscow and before the virtual implosion of the Soviet Government and military establishment.
Mr. Nunn promises to look at the Soviet threat again, but not before the 1993 budget. Mr. Aspin agrees and went further yesterday by outlining standards for making larger than planned cuts.
He says he will propose new cuts for next year only if there are further "irreversible" changes in the Soviet Union, specifically only if Moscow dismantles its still mighty military-industrial complex. That sounds good, but it doesn't work.
The Soviets should junk most of this complex (but how much?), and we should not give them economic aid until they do. But if they can't do what's right for them, that does not mean we can't do what makes sense for us. Why tie our interests to their bureaucratic inertia?
Does Mr. Aspin fear that unless virtually dismantled, Soviet factories will crank up and Soviet armies will invade Europe? No, he says, because the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Europe and the collapse of the Warsaw Pact are irreversible. Well, if these are irreversible what is he worried about, a Soviet attack on China?
He clearly does worry about the 30,000 Soviet nuclear weapons. Well, that number will soon be halved, and we still have our matching power. Besides, what are the Soviets going to do, threaten nuclear war to get more Western corn? The demise of the Soviet Union does not suspend the laws of mutual deterrence; it opens the gates to further cuts in nuclear arms to go along with the massive cuts in Soviet conventional forces already under way.
Arise, Congress! Arise, moderates and liberals! You have your country to save and nothing to lose but your seats.

HEADLINE: White House Should Stay With Lead Cleanup

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The failure of the Bush Administration to invest in our children's health is brought home by withdrawal of support for a Federal leadership role in preventing lead poisoning (news article, Aug. 24). This reversal of Federal support for lead poisoning prevention came after pressure from the National Association of Realtors, who predict that lead clean-up would raise housing prices $5,000 to $10,000. 
 Lead poisoning is the most common and socially devastating disease of young American children, resulting in lifelong stupidity for at least 3 million to 4 million future citizens. This invisible epidemic costs the country more than $28 billion. A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control shows that a $32 billion investment in lead poisoning prevention over 20 years would save $60 billion in health-care and special-educations costs, a figure that also takes account of increased income associated with increased IQ.
Lead abatement of an average housing unit of five to six rooms costs less then $3,000. How much more productive it is to spend half as much money on hazardous lead abatements than on the mandatory lifetime costs for children disabled by a preventable, but incurable disease.
The loss of Federal public health leadership will inevitably cost all of us in higher taxes, as we bear the double burden of increased medical and educational costs for the children affected, and the loss of their productive potential.
Yet a concerted societywide effort could virtually eliminate this disease in 20 years.
The Bush Administration should not back away from its own strategic plan. Rather it should create a lead-cleanup superfund to reimburse homeowners for the cost of hazard abatement. This active health policy would both reassure realtors that the housing market recovery will not be jeopardized and prevent the lifelong agony of millions of children and their families.

HEADLINE: On the Runway: Democrats

 BODY:
For weeks now, the best word to describe Democratic Presidential candidates for 1992 was "former." One dropout followed another: Nunn, McGovern, Gephardt, Gore, Rockefeller. And the absence of a campaign impelled this page to try provoking discussion of issues with a series of editorials, "Pinch-Hitting for the Democrats." Suddenly, the field of eager candidates looks like the flight line at La Guardia at rush hour.
Former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts was for four months the sole candidate. Then Gov. Douglas Wilder of Virginia launched his campaign last Friday; Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa took off Sunday; and revving their engines on the taxiway are Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and former Gov. Jerry Brown of California, among others. 
 To citizens dispirited by the endless 1988 campaign, that may sound like the Seven Dwarfs all over again. But this campaign can't help but be much shorter. The New Hampshire primary is only five months away. More important, these candidates can provide what both their party and the public now need most: an argument.
The Democrats, who have occupied the White House for only four years since 1968, need to argue out what they stand for. And the public needs to argue out what America stands for. The collapse of Communism creates a reverberating need to redefine America's enemies, and goals.
There have not in recent years been many illuminating arguments over compelling priorities -- certainly not in the 1988 campaign when Michael Dukakis won the Democratic nomination with a pledge of "good jobs for good wages" and George Bush won election with a campaign chiefly memorable for images of a paroled rapist and the flag.
Public concerns, however, are piling up. Among them are the widely felt disgust with politics . . . the need to recast Federal spending toward the future . . . the crippled health care system . . . the pressures on families, especially poor families . . . racial tension, and justice.
Taken together, the Democrats on, and just off, the runway address all these concerns. Paul Tsongas stands against divisive racial politics and for realistic economics, though in terms that imply perfumed protectionism. Governor Wilder, while standing up for civil rights, reaches out for general support. Senator Harkin starts his campaign full of flags and fight on behalf of traditional working-class liberalism.
Governor Clinton offers a record of achievement in dealing with the problems of children and sets out a creative anti-poverty position. And former Governor Brown sounds like the Outsider Incarnate, speaking for people who feel disconnected from politics.
None of these candidates so far offer much of an international vision, implicitly acknowledging the strength of President Bush's performance in handling the Communist world and the Middle East. None so far have been forced to face up to the need to pay for domestic reforms. All must be regarded as long, long shots.
Yet winning is not the only thing. Democrats may wish they had a better-known, more powerful challenger. Republicans may not like any of these messengers or their messages. But the arrival of all these candidates with something serious to say is a development citizens of all political persuasions can only welcome, for America has a lot to talk about.

HEADLINE: Overdue Loans Rise 2.73%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 18

 BODY:
The percentage of consumer loans at least 30 days past due rose to 2.73 percent in the April-June quarter, the highest level in nearly two years and a sign that the recession is pinching borrowers, the American Bankers Association said today.
The seasonally adjusted delinquency rate for the second quarter, compiled by the trade association from seven types of closed-end installment loans, was up from 2.67 percent in the first quarter and 2.55 percent a year earlier. The rate was the highest since it was 2.88 percent in the third quarter of 1989. 
 But while delinquencies rose for closed-end loans, they fell for bank credit cards and home equity credit lines.
The rate for home equity lines edged down from 0.98 percent in the first quarter to 0.90 percent in the April-June period. Still, it was substantially higher than the 0.75 percent rate a year earlier.
The association said 3.23 percent of credit-card borrowers were behind on their payments, down from 3.34 percent in the first three months of the year but up from 2.36 percent in the second quarter of 1990.
Included in the closed-end rate are two types of auto loans, personal loans, recreational vehicle loans, mobile home loans, property improvement loans and closed-end home equity loans. The delinquency rate is derived from a survey of 800 banks in the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Yields on Money Market Funds Are Mixed

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed for the week ended yesterday, with tax-exempt funds yielding more than they did a week earlier, while the taxable funds yielded less.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist at Donoghue's, said he was somewhat surprised at the mixed signals. 
 "We expect the money market rates to be moving down in response to the Fed's move on Friday," he said, referring to the Federal Reserve's decision to lower the discount rate, which it charges banks for loans. Mr. Frank predicted that investors would continue to seek the higher yields offered by longer-term investments.
 
Tax-Exempt Funds Gain
Nevertheless, yields for tax-exempt money funds rose for the fourth straight week. The seven-day compound average yield rose 10 basis points, to 4.30 percent, with the simple yield up nine basis points, to 4.21 percent. During the same period, the 30-day compound yield rose five basis points, to 4.20 percent, and the simple yield was also up five basis points, to 4.12 percent. A basis point represents one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Donoghue's said the average number of days to maturity of securities held in portfolios had risen by two days, to 61, which Mr. Frank said was higher than it has been in several months.
Donoghue's said the total assets of tax-exempt funds for the week were down by $590 million, to $87.4 billion.
Of the funds monitored by IBC/ Donoghue's with assets exceeding $100 million, the Calvert Tax Free Reserves Money Market fund was the best performer for the second week, with a seven-day compound yield of 5.11 percent, up from 5.02 percent a week ago.
 
Highest Yield in New York
 In New York City, the Salomon Brothers New York Municipal Money Fund continued to have the highest yield of the funds monitored by Donoghue's, as it has for several weeks, with a 4.83 percent seven-day compound rate.
In Connecticut, the top-yielding fund was the Prudential Connecticut Municipal Money Market Series, with a seven-day compound yield of 4.58 percent. In New Jersey, the Calvert Tax Free Reserves, with a seven-day compound yield of 4.92 percent, was the top performer.
Assets of taxable funds rose by $1 billion, to $457 billion. The average seven-day compound taxable yield fell by five basis points, to 5.35 percent, and the simple yield also fell by five basis points, to 5.21 percent. The 30-day compound yield was down three basis points, to 5.41 percent, and the simple yield was also down three basis points, to 5.27 percent.
The average number of days to maturity of securities held in taxable funds in the week was 60 days, up one day from the previous week.
 
Riverside Capital's Lead
 For the second straight week, the taxable fund with the best return was Riverside Capital Money Market Fund, distributed by the Winsbury Company of Columbus, Ohio, with a seven-day compound return of 6.48 percent.
By comparison, bank money market accounts, a main competitor of money funds, fell two basis points, to 5.10 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

HEADLINE: Fed Study Says Recovery Is Missing Some Areas

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 18

 BODY:
A manufacturing rebound is leading the economy out of recession in an uneven recovery that has missed several parts of the nation, the Federal Reserve Board said today.
Except for manufacturing, however, the economy shows little zest as consumers hold onto their money, as housing starts and sales slow and loan activity remains soft, the Fed said in its "beige book" report on regional economic trends issued eight times a year. 
 "The strongest sector of the economy is manufacturing," it said. "Industrial production has provided considerable impetus to recovery, reflecting in part export demand and a reduced pace of inventory liquidation."
Manufacturers in most districts appear optimistic about near-term prospects, the Fed said.
 
Data Used to Make Policy
 The beige book, so called because of the color of its cover, is part of the data the central bank's policy makers use to determine whether to loosen or tighten credit. The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, meets about every six weeks, with the next meeting scheduled for Oct. 1.
The latest beige book, which was prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, is based on information from the Fed's 12 banking districts obtained before Sept. 9 and would not reflect the Fed's credit-loosening moves of last week. On Friday, the Fed cut the discount rate, which it charges banks for loans, to 5 percent, from 5 1/2 percent, and the Federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for loans, to a target level of 5 1/4 percent, from 5 1/2 percent.
One of the economy's most sluggish areas last month, the book said, was in consumer spending, a key sector that accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity.
 
Consumer Cash Shortage
 "As yet, there is little sign of a sizable rebound in consumer spending that will contribute to a strengthening business recovery," the book said. "Retail sales in recent months show only scattered improvement and most retailers are cautious about sales prospects."
Many economists have said consumers are short of cash because of slow growth in jobs and income. Also, the unemployment rate, which stood at a worrisome 6.8 percent in August, makes consumers nervous and unwilling to spend, they said.
Another sour note sounded by the Fed was in the home-building and real-estate sectors, which had been among the few areas of the economy showing improvement.
"Residential investment seems to have lost some upward momentum in recent months, with fewer than half of the districts reporting further increases in housing sales and housing starts," it said.
Despite a recent decline in mortgage rates that has made housing more affordable, home sales and starts have slowed, especially in San Francisco and Chicago, the Fed said.
Commercial construction appears to be at a virtual standstill in many districts, with high vacancy rates and declining rental prices in the New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco regions, it said.
 
Weak Loan Demand
 Although the Fed found some evidence that banks had tightened their lending standards, it also said loan demand was weak.
"Loan activity remains soft in most districts," it said.
Banks in many districts, including New York, are willing to lend, but are facing reduced demand, the Fed said. Credit standards in New York and Chicago have not changed in recent months, but for some loans in the Richmond and Atlanta districts, they have grown tighter, it said.
Tighter credit standards for acquisition and development loans also restricted commercial construction in New York, Chicago and Atlanta, it said.
Farm output, especially corn, has been hampered by hot, dry weather across much of the country, although some districts expect bumper crops of rice and cotton, the Fed said. Farm commodity and livestock prices have fallen in the Minneapolis, San Francisco, Kansas City and Dallas districts, it said.

HEADLINE: Loan Dispute Perplexes Israel's Soviet Emigres

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Sept. 18

 BODY:
Many Soviet Jewish immigrants say they are perplexed and hurt at finding themselves suddenly at the center of American plans to convene a Middle East peace conference.
Most Soviet newcomers feel that their integration into Israeli society and the peace talks are completely different matters that should not be linked. 
 "Many Soviet immigrants can't understand President Bush's position," said Yosef Mendelevich, a former dissident who was released from a Soviet prison 10 years ago and today heads a school where immigrants learn Hebrew.
In one of the most bitter disputes ever between an Israeli Government and an American Administration, Israel has requested that the United States approve $10 billion in loan guarantees to help resettle more than one million Soviet Jews expected here by 1994. Israel has already absorbed more than 300,000 in the last two years.
But President Bush strongly objects to an immediate consideration of the Israeli request because of a possibly detrimental effect on the peace process. He has asked Congress to postpone its debate on the guarantees for 120 days.
 
More Postponements Feared
 "We have only one friend, America," Mr. Mendelevich said. "If it's postponed for 120 days, then it'll be postponed again and again. It means posponing it forever."
In addition, he said, he is afraid that many Soviet Jews will decide to delay their immigration because of absorption hardships here and may get caught in a wave of anti-Semitism amid ethnic unrest in the dismantling of the Soviet Union.
Natan Sharansky, who heads the Soviet Jewry Zionist Forum and is perhaps the most famous dissident, said it was neither appropriate nor effective to link the peace process with the need for humanitarian aid to help absorb the new immigrants.
Ida Nudel, 60, another longtime dissident, said the conflict over the loan guarantees was only on the surface. Miss Nudel, who now lives in a small rural community called Carmei Yosef, halfway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, said the postponement "is really a pretext for a clash over the occupied territories."
President Bush is concerned that Israel plans to continue building settlements in the territories.
 
Many Share Apartments
 Of the 10,000 or so Soviet immigrants who are arriving monthly, few can afford to rent an apartment by themselves because of the housing shortage. Instead, they either share an apartment with other families or are going to impromptu absorption centers in hotels, army bases and mobile-home camps.
In fact, the Finance Ministry now assumes that several Soviet families will rent apartments or even purchase new homes together, and has cut annual Government subsidies accordingly. It is not unusual for three or more Soviet Jewish families to live together in the initial stages of their absorption.
At the Migdal Hair office building in Jerusalem, about 150 Soviet Jewish immigrants are housed in rooms on the top three floors of a former hotel. The voices of playing children echo in the narrow corridors, which are thick with the smell of cooking and medication. The kitchen and bathrooms are communal.
"Here I am, for 11 months I have had to live in a hotel with a roommate -- is this right for a person in old age?" said Leonid Kuperstein, 66, a former electrical engineer who shares a room with another retiree.
"My opinion is that we have to persevere so that Congress will decide in our favor," he said, nodding his head and growing more convinced of his own words. "Yes, you can see the situation for yourself. We need the money."
 
'Only Pennies Get to Us'
 But not everyone agrees with him. Edward Sulemanov, 33, of Tashkent sat across from him and said with equal conviction that Mr. Bush was doing the right thing.
"Mr. Bush shouldn't give us a penny," said Mr. Sulemanov, who was a bus driver but works here in a shoe factory. "America gives us all this money to help, but it doesn't get to us. Only pennies get to us."
Others, more reticent, refused to give their opinion because, they said, they still hardly spoke the native language and did not have a true understanding of what was going on here. All of the newcomers in the hotel spoke in Russian, which was translated into English.
The latest unemployment rates showed that 178,000 people, or 10.8 percent of the work force, were out of work. Among the new immigrants, the unemployment rate is running at 40 percent while many of those who have found jobs are not working in their professions.
"I expected it would be difficult and it's true," said Fima Rutitsky, 55, who immigrated with his wife, Rita, and 24-year-old daughter, Masha, a pianist. All now are sharing a cramped room that they have decorated with maps of Israel in Russian and watercolors by Mr. Rutitsky's brother.
"But I'm happy to put in long hours," said Mr. Rutitsky, a carpenter by profession who has found work as a shoemaker. "Many just can't find a job. It's a bad situation -- especially if you're over 50."
 
'A No-Win Situation'
 Ian Furman, 31, a medical student who came here in an earlier wave of Soviet immigration, said the Government was creating a situation in which many would have to move to the occupied territories because of the high housing prices in Israel.
"The Government's not investing anything within Israel," he said. "But in the territories, they're building villas and roads in the middle of the desert. Whatever money America gives will go there."
Indeed, a few months ago, the Rutitsky family turned down an offer to move to a new settlement because of its remoteness from work and major population centers. So far, fewer than one percent of all Soviet immigrants have chosen to live in the territories.
"I don't think Israel should be settling people in the territories," said Masha Rutitsky, petting a red-striped cat named Gingi. "But we might have to go there because it's cheaper. It's a no-win situation."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in World Trading And Gold Prices Strengthen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose sharply yesterday on worldwide markets as uncertainties in the Middle East and the Soviet Union pushed some traders to the relative safety of the United States currency.
Gold prices also strengthened. 
 On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $348.60 a troy ounce, up $1.90 from late Tuesday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold of $348.20 an ounce, also up $1.90.
Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager for the Bank of New York, said renewed tensions in the Persian Gulf and questions surrounding the health of the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, helped lift the dollar.
"There's no fundamental reason why the dollar is up," Mr. Ryan said, adding that the long-term outlook remained bearish because of the current climate of lower interest rates in the United States.
 
Helped by Turmoil
 But the dollar is often helped by political turmoil abroad, and there was plenty of that reported yesterday.
The White House confirmed that it was sending warplanes to Saudi Arabia to put pressure on Iraq to comply with the gulf war cease-fire. Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, has been resisting a complete United Nations inspection of his country's weapons sites.
Reports from the Soviet Union said Mr. Yeltsin had cut short his workday after complaining of chest pains. Since last month's coup attempt, Mr. Yeltsin has emerged as a powerful leader amid political and economic troubles in that country.
In Tokyo, where global trading begins, the dollar rose 0.32 yen, to a closing 133.95 yen. It was quoted at 134.35 yen in London, and at 134.40 yen in New York, up from 133.85 yen late Tuesday.
The dollar was stronger against the British pound compared with Tuesday's dealings. Sterling fetched $1.7317 in London, down from $1.7425, and $1.7285 in New York, down from $1.7425.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's late quotes, included: 1.6845 German marks, up from 1.6720; 1.4715 Swiss francs, up from 1.4590; 5.7400 French francs, up from 5.6935; 1,260 Italian lire, up from 1,250, and 1.13715 Canadian dollars, up from 1.13615.

HEADLINE: States Act To Combat Shoplifting

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Stores across the nation, under growing financial pressure to stem losses from shoplifting and employee theft, say they are encouraged by the increasing number of states that are acting to give retailers the power to extract payments and fines from thieves they catch in the act.
The New York State Assembly, after two years of strong urging by department stores and other merchants, has voted to have New York join the 31 other states that give retailers the option of handling shoplifting cases much the way cities deal with uncontested tickets for illegal parking. 
 People caught sneaking out of Tower Records with compact disks or stopped by Macy's security guards for slipping wool sweaters under their coats could sign agreements in the store acknowledging guilt. They could then settle their cases by mailing in payments covering the cost of the merchandise and possible additional penalties.
 
A Less-Costly Process
 Proponents of giving merchants this option to filing criminal charges say stores would save time and expense by bypassing the police and courts. And they say shoplifters can put the incidents behind them without getting criminal records.
Suspects who considered themselves wrongly accused could still demand that they either be formally charged with a crime or that the matter be dropped.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has not yet signed the bill. He has until tomorrow to do so, and while, as is often his practice, he has not indicated whether he will sign it, there is no organized opposition to the measure. At least 10 other states are near to having or are considering such laws. Washington State was the first to enact a civil-restitution law, in 1975, but it was the mid-80's before many states began adopting the concept.
Woolworth, A.& P. and other chains say that in states where such laws have taken effect their theft losses in some stores have fallen as much as 80 percent in one year. Retailers and politicians who back the New York bill say it will reduce operating expenses for stores, cut court congestion and hold down the cost of goods to consumers.
"Because the police and courts are so overburdened, crimes of this nature don't get as much attention, and criminals aren't deterred," said Francesco Cantarella, senior vice president and director of government relations for the Abraham & Straus, Bloomingdale's and Stern's chains of Federated Department Stores Inc. "Civil restitution puts the cost of shoplifting where it belongs -- on the shoplifter -- not the stores, not the courts, not the person buying merchandise."
Shoplifting patterns vary widely by type of store and region, and accurate figures are hard to come by. By way of a standard, the retailing industry says it is considered acceptable for "shrinkage" to amount to 2 percent or less of sales. Shrinkage is the industry term for unexplained loss of merchandise from shoplifting, errors in paperwork and employee theft.
Last year, such losses rose at some stores, like specialty apparel retailers, drugstores and home improvement chains, but fell at discount department stores, supermarkets and music and video stores. The 137 retailers in a Price Waterhouse survey reported that the losses fell by 4.6 percent over all in 1990, lowering their shrinkage to 1.65 percent of sales.
Still, with the recession and slow sales severely squeezing many stores' margins, all of them are looking hard at ways to cut any losses.
Abraham & Straus says it spends as much as $6 million a year to prevent shoplifting at its stores but still loses almost $9 million annually to sticky fingers. Its parent, Federated Department Stores, has a strict policy of prosecuting nearly everyone caught shoplifting. Most retailers are not as tough, preferring to avoid the cost and time associated with criminal prosecution.
Some merchants say the civil-recovery procedure is appealing because they would no longer have to hold shoplifters until the police arrive, file paperwork, take employees off the job to testify and pay lawyers to keep track of the prosecution. A big bonus is that the guilty agreement that the shoplifter signs also lets merchants demand the return of the stolen goods, or payment of the retail price, up to $1,500, for damaged or missing merchadise.
And the optional penalties, of up to $500, would help offset the cost of security measures, they say.
Under the procedure, the store mails the shoplifter a notice to pay the amount agreed upon. If he or she pays, there is no criminal record and that is the end of the matter. If the person refuses, the retailer can take the claim for payment to civil court. But even that bypasses the longer and more expensive procedures of a criminal prosecution, now the main recourse of New York retailers.
 
A Doubter's Viewpoint
 Still, not all New York retailers say they would use the procedure. Jim Freeman, general manager of the HMV Music Super Stores on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, said he would prefer stiffer criminal penalties.
"If you have the money to afford those fines, what's the deterrent," he said, adding that he had caught many shoplifters that were carrying large amounts of cash. "If you get a crimminal record, you've got a lot to lose."
He also said that the proposed law would create administrative headaches for retailers. "I can't set up a department to collect the money from people who have been shoplifting," he said. "My main objective is to sell records, not to profit from billing shoplifters."
As to why New York, one of the world's retailing capitals, is only now on the verge of getting a civil-recovery law, legislators and retailers said technical haggling over the penalty provisions had delayed the bill's passage. State Senator John B. Sheffer 2d of Williamsville, who sponsored the bill with Assemblyman Eric Vitaliano of Staten Island, added that perhaps the pressures of the recession had made retailers push harder for the bill.
"It's been a perennial issue," he said. "I don't know why we haven't had more movement on it sooner."
 
Parental Responsibility
 One reason it took until this year to cobble a bill together might have been concerns about parental responsibility for minors accused of shoplifting. Most civil-recovery laws, including the one passed in New York, hold parents and legal guardians fully responsible for paying for merchandise and any penalties when their children are apprehended.
Senator Sheffer said legislators put in a clause directing that if the parents rejected the civil-recovery process and the case went to court, the court should consider the degree to which the parents were supervising the child when the theft occurred.
Of the bill's advantages to retailers, Senator Sheffer said, "Not only can they use it on their own behalf to reduce costs but on behalf of consumers, because the massive cost of shoplifting, about $27 billion annually in this country, is passed on to them."
While merchants say the civil penalties reduce the incidence of repeat shoplifters, some critics imply that the approach is just a slap on the wrist. Peter Berlin, who operates a retail consulting firm that bears his name, said only criminal prosecution would decrease repeat shoplifting.
"I think that civil recovery certainly will help retailers recoup some of the costs of security," said Mr. Berlin, who is also the executive director of Shoplifters Anonymous, which helps repeat shoplifters overcome the habit. "But I think that shoplifters will tell you that it would be foolish to think it would deter them from stealing again." Therefore, he added, halting the criminal prosecution of shoplifters "would be a detriment for everyone."
In states where civil-recovery laws are in effect, retailers are reporting less shrinkage. And they say the laws are a deterrent.
Woolworth reported, for example, that at a store in Boston shrinkage declined 22 percent in 1989, the year that the Massachussets law went into effect, and it fell 39 percent in 1990. At a store in Los Angeles, which also started using civil recovery in 1989, shrinkage declined 26 percent the first year and 80 percent in 1990.
Michael Rosen, vice president for government relations for the New York State Food Merchants Association, said the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company reported that of 1,162 letters mailed to people seized for shoplifting at some of its Michigan stores, 80 percent paid the requested damages. He said only 5 of the 1,162 were caught shoplifting at those stores again.
Mr. Rosen said civil-recovery laws also eliminated a potential source of discomfiture for store owners. They frequently catch regular customers lifting a lipstick or some other small item from their counters and shelves.
"Retailers often know the person or their family and may not want to institute criminal action against them," Mr. Rosen said. The new law would provide "a mechanism so that the person isn't released with no penalty, and it's a means for the retailer to recoup some of his security expenses."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Restaurant Plan Attracts Buyers

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
WILL good restaurants sell meals at 50 percent discounts, even after the recession ends? A lot of stock buyers are betting that they will, a fact that has sent shares in Transmedia Network Inc. spiraling upward.
Transmedia's business is financing restaurants at what would seem to be high interest rates. It gives the restaurant $10,000, a debt that is paid off by providing $20,000 worth of meals to Transmedia customers. The customers pay Transmedia $15,000, a 25 percent discount from face value. 
 Of course, as Transmedia notes, the food and beverages usually cost the restaurant only a third or so of the menu price, and accepting Transmedia members is a way to attract new customers.
If the restaurant goes out of business before Transmedia's customers eat enough meals, or if customers do not patronize a restaurant, Transmedia suffers the loss. But so far the losses have been manageable, and the growth has been rapid. The company now has 60,000 card holders, and 1,000 restaurants, mostly in the New York area. Its share price has soared this year from less than $2 to yesterday's close of $13.25.
But as investors have grown more enthusiastic, some insiders have become sellers. Melvin Chasen, the chairman, sold 56,025 shares at $7.375 a share in July, and his wife sold 30,000 shares.
"I'm not that young a fellow anymore," the 63-year-old Mr. Chasen said in a telephone interview. "I recognize the vagaries of business, as well as the whims of the stock market." He said he and his family still had about 500,000 shares, including options.
Herbert M. Gardner, a Transmedia director and a senior vice president of Janney Montgomery Scott, a regional brokerage firm, has sold 19,000 shares so far this year, at prices ranging from $4.875 to $10.125. Mr. Gardner, who retains substantial holdings through options, is credited with advising the company on going public without an initial offering, via a merger with a shell company. His office said he could not be reached for comment yesterday.
To hear Mr. Chasen talk, there are few limits on the company. "The potential is staggering," he said, reeling off a long list of cities that do not have Transmedia. The North Miami-based company now operates in the New York area and has started up in southern Florida. It has sold franchises for New Jersey and the Philadelphia area.
While profits have risen rapidly, cash flow has advanced less rapidly, because the company must put out new funds for restaurants to join the program. For the 1990 fiscal year, ended Sept. 30, the company reported net income of $308,828, but said operating cash flow was a negative $211,833. For the first nine months of this fiscal year, the company reported profits of $720,518, but said cash flow came to only $16,655.
At current prices, Transmedia is trading at about three times its revenues in the most recent 12 months, and more than 30 times earnings.
Transmedia's success would seem to be dependent on two areas: finding enough consumers to carry and use its cards, and finding enough restaurants to accept them. Among restaurants, that means a stratum of restaurants that are doing well enough to stay in business, but not so well that they do not need the help.
Success in signing up a lot of customers could lead some popular restaurants to drop out, simply because too many meals are being sold at discounts. Richard Roth, an executive vice president of Transmedia's primary competitor in the market, IGT Services Inc. of Miami Beach, said he had advised restaurants not to allow more than 10 percent of their meals to be sold at discounts.
The sales staff that signs up restaurants is paid a percentage of what Transmedia customers spend at each restaurant it signs up. If a restaurant goes under, leaving Transmedia with a loss, the sales representative has 25 percent of the loss docked from his or her compensation.
Despite those restraints, he said, losses from failed restaurants amounted to about $110,000 in the 1990 fiscal year and should be about $200,000 in the current fiscal year, which ends this month.

HEADLINE: New-Home Building Up Just 0.6%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 18

 BODY:
Construction of new housing in August rose for the fifth straight month, but the gain was a sluggish six-tenths of 1 percent, the smallest improvement since May. Analysts said the report today from the Commerce Department suggested that the housing recovery was weakening or possibly stopping.
"These numbers show a housing recovery losing steam, at least through August," said Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association. 
 Michael Carliner, an economist for the National Association of Home Builders, was more pessimistic. "It looks like the recovery has stalled," he said.
Indeed, applications for building permits, which often foretell future activity, fell 4.9 percent in August, to an annual rate of 956,000. It was the first drop since February, when the housing recovery began.
The Northeast and Midwest experienced the only increases in new units, the report said.
John A. Tuccillo, an economist for the National Association of Realtors, said an 11.2 percent increase in starts in the Northeast was one of the bright spots in the report, since new construction there had fallen 26.2 percent in July. Housing starts fell in both the South and the West.
Over all, new construction of houses and apartments in August totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.065 million units, up from a revised 1.059 million a month earlier. The July rate was even weaker than the original estimate of 1.07 million.
 
Slump in September
 In a second report today, the Federal Reserve said the weakness in the housing industry continued into September. Fewer than half of the 12 Federal Reserve districts reported increases in housing sales and starts in a survey completed Sept. 9.
The Fed said the finding came despite falling mortgage rates and lower prices in some areas. The survey found most districts reporting "either little demand for new mortgage loans or slight declines from previous months."
Although housing starts have increased 25.7 percent since their January low, starts in the first eight months of the year remained 20.9 percent below those of the corresponding period of 1990.
The August gain marked the first five-month string of increases since June-October 1980. But it was the smallest monthly gain since a six-tenths of 1 percent rise in May. And although new construction had risen 5.2 percent in June, it slowed to a 2.4 percent gain in July.
Sales of both new and existing homes also fell sharply in July, which Mr. Peach of the mortgage association said caused builders to "think it's time to slow down the rate of increase in new starts."
"Fortunately, conditions have improved quite a bit since early August," he added, saying that interest rates for conventional mortgages had fallen to about 9 percent and that Veterans Administration rates were lowered on Monday to 8.5 percent from 9 percent.
 
A Financing Crunch
 Still, Mr. Carliner of the builders association questioned whether the housing recovery could be maintained. He cited a weak overall economy and difficulty for builders in getting financing for new projects.
Mr. Tuccillo of the of the realtors group also blamed "the banking system paralysis" for the slowdown in starts and said, "Activity will remain restrained by the credit crunch."
Single-family starts, which account for 80 percent of home-building activity, edged up six-tenths of 1 percent in August, to an 892,000 annual rate, compared with 887,000 the previous month. Multifamily starts also rose six-tenths of 1 percent, to a 173,000 rate, from 172,000 a month earlier.
In addition to the gain in the Northeast, starts rose by 8.2 percent in the Midwest, more than erasing a 4.9 percent decline in July.
But starts fell 2.5 percent in the South, unable to keep up with a 13 percent spike the previous month. And they dropped 5.1 percent in the West, after rising 9.5 percent in July.

HEADLINE: Global Push By British Telecom

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 18

 BODY:
In what may be an important bid to capture a lucrative share of the international communications market, British Telecommunications P.L.C. on Thursday will announce details of a new subsidiary that will manage worldwide communications networks for multinational corporations.
The new venture, the Syncordia Corporation, will be based in Atlanta and represents an attempt by the British telephone company to capture some of the big-business customers served by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. 
 The new company will provide a worldwide communications network, capable of transmitting telephone, data and video images and will offer to manage virtually all of a corporation's worldwide internal communications network. In part, the premise of the company is that many corporations now want to have an outside firm manage their telecommunications needs.
 
Possible I.B.M. Deal
 Company officials said they were in "detailed discussions" to supply services for the International Business Machines Corporation in Europe and have already signed two big customers. One is Amadeus, the European airline reservation system owned by five European airlines, which will be linked with the Sabre reservation system owned by American Airlines. The other customer is BP Chemicals, a subsidiary of British Petroleum, which will use Syncordia to link offices in 34 cities over the next several years.
But the new company has gotten off to a somewhat rocky start because British Telecom was unable to recruit two big partners who were expected to be part of the deal.
British Telecom had originally anticipated forming the new venture with the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom. A combination of with the Japanese and German telecommunications giants would have been a formidable new force in the market.
It remains unclear why N.T.T. and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom decided not to join, though officials of British Telecom say they are optimistic about recruiting them at some point.
The new venture will not significantly expand communications services, but it could make them easier and more flexible to use.
Large companies now order all the circuits and services for their private networks, which connect offices on different continents, from one or more long-distance companies. But analysts say these networks have become increasingly complicated and expensive to manage, and many corporations are eager to turn the task over to a single company.
 
Global Corporate Needs
 "We are in a situation where the multinational corporations have seen their overseas businesses grow faster than their national businesses, and they realize their network strategies have been determined more by regional divisions and departments than by a global corporate strategy," said Berge Ayvazian, an analyst at the Yankee Group, a market research firm in Boston.
Gerald W. Thames, president of Syncordia, said large customers can get greater flexibility by subscribing to the new system because they can simply order the services they want and leave the management to Syncordia.
In essence, the large customers would have what resemble global private networks that already link their offices through leased telephone lines, but the services would be offered over the larger, shared network that the new company will be running.
"It is only now, with deregulation taking place around the world and a huge growth in demand that the economics have come about so that a company like ours can be built," Mr. Thames said.

HEADLINE: Where the Recovery Fails to Tread

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: READING, Pa.

 BODY:
The recovery's cold feet have landed here. After spotting the early signs of a rebound three months ago, this diverse factory town that makes everything from bricks to shoe polish to Godiva chocolates is watching business tail off again.
"We thought that June was going to be the end of it, that things were turning around," said Glenn Unger, manager of a Berks Products Corporation building materials store in suburban Temple. But after a fairly active July that matched last year's level, sales in August sagged 8 percent below those of August 1990 and, combined with a "flat" early September, have brought disillusionment about imminent recovery. 
 "We haven't seen it," Mr. Unger said. His company is now severely limiting overtime and, more ominously for this stage of the business cycle, trimming inventories further instead of expanding them.
"We used to carry a pretty good line of plumbing accessories," Mr. Unger said. "But things that don't sell -- well, you re-evaluate, you eliminate, reduce."
Across the highway, Frank Borek's used-car lot is in dire shape. "It's as if somebody put an invisible wall around my place," said Mr. Borek, who last month sold only 14 cars, the usual number for a single August week. With his lease approaching its end, Mr. Borek said flatly: "If things don't improve, I'm out of here. I can't afford to stay."
Throughout the county, where dry weather has inflicted its own damage on 1,900 farms, more than 95 percent family-owned, there is an air of uneasiness. With the end of summer comes the realization that the hoped-for short and shallow recession could linger indefinitely.
Yet this city of 78,300 people, and its environs, on the edge of the Pennsylvania Dutch country does not now exhibit signs of serious deterioration in its economy. Since late last year, The New York Times has been periodically visiting Reading to measure its economic activity as a rough proxy for the nation's economy. Since the latest visit, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to stimulate the economy, but the move was not expected to have a quick impact on business activity.
Last June, several people here believed that the economy had hit bottom and was starting to grow again. But now, as in many parts of the country, the early signs of a recovery are fading, and there is a question as to whether the modest rebound will continue.
The economy "is not getting worse, it's just not getting better," said Bernard M. Markstein, chief economist at Meridian Bancorp Inc., the area's leading bank.
 
Some Typical Views
 Typical are the views of Charles Beddick, sales manager at the A. W. Golden automobile dealership, who calls today's conditions "a struggle." Jack Leifer of Bloom Furniture regards a recent pickup so weak "it's nothing we can hang our hats on." Heidi Czarnecki, a proprietor of Joe's restaurant, says a 20 to 25 percent sales decline has forced this establishment of national reputation into greater reliance on chicken and fish.
And while the recession was unusual in that the service sector has been hard hit and manufacturing has paced the fledgling rebound, few of Berks County's factories are celebrating.
Effects of the downturn now seem to be rippling beyond the business maninstream despite an apparent lack of direct causality.
About 1,240 properties are listed for the county's tax-delinquency sale on Sept. 27, up from about 680 last year, but officials here say they attach little significance to the increase. Nor do they seem unduly concerned that 26 of the Reading Public Museum and Art Gallery's best works, including "The Laundress" and two others by Degas, and Frederic E. Church's "Cotopaxi, Ecuador," have been shipped to Sotheby's Inc. in New York for possible sale to raise up to $10 million.
Both are said to reflect well-established trends, with the museum's plight caused both by long-term erosion of the city's tax base and "mismanagement" that caused a budget crisis, according to Bruce Dietrich, the director. The museum is run by the city's school district.
Jeffrey Squibb, first deputy fire chief, reports only a handful of jobless have moved into engine houses of his largely volunteer department in search of shelter or a possible paid job.
And, unlike traditional recessions when hospitals have been among the biggest financial casualties, late-paying by patients has not reached significant levels, according to Lawrence R. Cobaugh, treasurer of the Reading Hospital and Medical Center, with no prospect of layoffs. With the Government and private insurers picking up increased proportions of costs, only 5 cents of each dollar was paid last year by patients themselves.
Indeed, there are some bright spots in the local economy, some of them resulting from rising demand for such recession-resistant products as surgical equipment and wheelchair batteries. Others involve companies so well heeled as to be able to ignore the business cycle in carrying out market strategy. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., for example, just opened a store here, its 1,628th over all, and the discount retailing juggernaut has already broken ground on the Philadelphia side of town for a second store set to open next year.
One of Reading's economic strengths, in addition to a diversity of industry and renowned outlet stores that attract thousands of busloads of out-of-state shoppers each year, is that no company accounts for more than 2 percent of the area's jobs.
One company doing well these days is the East Penn Manufacturing Company, a privately owned maker of lead-acid batteries for cars, garden equipment and other products, in Lyon Station, near Kutztown. "Our business is the best ever," said Delight Breidegam Jr., the president, after a sharp production cut during the spring that led to the layoff of 250 employees. Recalls had them back by May 1, however, and in July new workers were brought on.
"We're shipping more than we can make," using inventory as well, Mr. Breidegam said, noting that the inability to recycle non-lead batteries had helped raise demand for the old-fashioned kind.
But for various reasons, including taxes and environmental requirements related to the manufacturing process, Mr. Bridegam finds it hard even these days to turn a profit.
"I really think it's coming out" of recession, he said of the economy at large. "The big thing is if we're going to make some money."
At the Bachman Company, producer of pretzels and other snack foods, the cost of flour, potatoes and cooking oil is down by double-digit percentages over last year but these do not necessarily flow to the bottom line since the company finds it must step up spending on promotion. "These are not the times to raise prices," said Joseph F. Welch, the chief executive.
What seems the most improbable spur to the local economy occurred in late June when Birdsboro Ferrocast Inc. began to pour steel castings at its newly acquired plant along the Schuylkill, reviving a foundry dating from 1740 and said to be the oldest in the country. In the early part of the 19th century, Thomas Lincoln and his son, ancestors of the President, hauled Birdsboro iron to Philadelphia in poplar canoes.
The plant, which had been closed since a 1987 strike, specializes in superlarge castings of up to 100 tons, the heaviest of any American plant, used for power-generating equipment and machines for making paper and cement.
"We're going to stop some of this business from going overseas," said A. Albert Broslow, a New York native who formed the group that with the aid of Federal and state agencies and a loan from Meridian Bancorp bought the foundry from the industrialist Victor Posner for $8.6 million. Mr. Broslow said the plant, now operating at about 20 percent of capacity, had had enough inquiries from potential customers, mostly about capital goods, to make him think the economy is probably on the mend.
But such things as a spanking new Wal-Mart -- a not unmixed blessing since it introduces the nation's biggest retailer to what is already a ferociously competitive retail market -- and a revitalized old steel plant can give a misleading impression of the current business climate.
"I don't think there's a second drop coming," said G. Walton Cottrell, vice president and chief financial officer at the Carpenter Technology Corporation, a specialty steel operation that is one of the biggest local employers. "But it's certainly taking a long time to get the nose of this plane up and back to altitude."

HEADLINE: A Window on Deep Israel-U.S. Tensions

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, Sept. 18

 BODY:
The struggle between the Bush Administration and Israel over the question of United States loan guarantees and Israeli settlements illuminates all of the underlying -- often unspoken -- anxieties, tensions and contradictions in the relationship between America and Israel.
The specific issue is whether Israel should receive its requested $10 billion in loan guarantees for housing Soviet Jews without any restrictions or freeze settlement activity in the occupied territories, or whether it should postpone its request for four months -- until after an Arab-Israeli peace conference has begun -- so the explosive issue of settlements can be dealt with then. 
 The Administration hopes it can engineer a trade-off in which Israel might halt settlements in return for concessions from the Arabs, thereby sparing the Administration from having to use its economic stick.
But the struggle in a way is about everything other than the loan guarantees and settlements. It is about Israel's anxiety over America's changing role in the world, about conflicting instincts within the Administration over how to make peace in the Middle East, about the mutual mistrust between Israelis and President Bush, and it is about Israel's inability to face up to its own fateful choices regarding the future of the occupied territories.
At its broadest level, one of the deepest anxieties animating the Israelis in this struggle is their intuitive sense that now that the United States has become the world's only superpower, it is moving, and will continue to move, from being Israel's patron in global affairs to a role as a more neutral umpire, dispassionately mediating between Israel and her Arab neighbors.
It was revealing to note that one of the written assurances that Israel contemplated asking of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d before it would go to a peace conference was some sort of general commitment from the United States to be sympathetic to Israel at the conference, because Israel would have no other friends there.
The Israelis understand that without the backdrop of United States-Soviet competition, America's natural inclination to side with Israel, just because Moscow was siding with the Arabs, is greatly diminished.
 
American Stance on Settlement
 The issue has brought to the center of Israeli politics a question that Israeli leaders have been trying to avoid since they captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan Heights in 1967. What to do with those territories?
For nearly 20 years, or since Israelis began settling those lands, successive American Administrations have opposed Israel's settlement-building in the occupied terriories. They have called those Jewish housing projects everything from illegal to obstacles to peace.
But one move no Administration has ever taken is to act on its principles and tell the Israelis that unless they curbed their settlements the United States would limit economic assistance in some way.
Precisely because no American Administration would ever do that, the Israelis have been able to have it both ways -- settlements and American aid, and no confrontations with Washington.
 
Uncomfortable for Some Leaders
 President Bush has decided that he wants the United States to put some teeth into its own principles. The President has told the Israelis that they will not receive their loan guarantees now without severe restrictions on their settlement activities in the occupied territories.
That has naturally put American Jewish organizations in a difficult position. To stand with the President is to appear ready to sacrifice housing for Russian immigrants over a point of principle.
But to stand with Israel risks making the question of aid to the Jewish state a subject for a national debate in the United States, which makes many Jewish-Americans uncomfortable.
Many Israelis and many American Jews who support what Mr. Bush is doing believe he made one major mistake in deciding to draw the line on the question of the housing-loan guarantees rather than on what Israel's de facto annexation of the West Bank -- where 90,000 Jews live in place of a handful 20 years ago -- is doing to the country generally.
 
'Conceived as a Democratic State'
 "What Bush should have done," an Israeli political theorist, Yaron Ezrahi, said, "is frame the issue like this: 'The whole rationale for Israel, the whole reason we Americans and Jews around the world support it, is because it is conceived as a democratic state where a Jewish majority can thrive and achieve its full potential.
He continued: "How can any friend of Israel, therefore, stand by and watch as Israel engages in a settlement policy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip -- home to 1.7 million Palestinians -- which can only turn Israel into a binational state with a permanent civil war between Arabs and Jews and with a government that can only control the Palestinians by repressive means?'
"Shamir has no answer to that," he said.
That Mr. Bush or Mr. Baker did not make such an argument may derive in part from the fact that neither seems to have much emotional attachment to Israel. That does not mean that they are intrinsically hostile, as some Israeli officials recently contended. It does mean, though, that Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker insist on dealing with Israel as just another pragmatic foreign policy question.
But Israelis are a people that dwell alone. If someone does not love them, they think that the person hates them. There is no emotional middle ground for them. Although the Bush Administration's whole approach to peacemaking is almost entirely based on terms dictated by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, the Israelis nevertheless see the Bush Administration as hostile. The reason, a former State Department official said, is "the head-heart split."
"When I think your heart is not in the right place, it doesn't matter where your head is or what you're saying," he explained. "It is never going to be enough. If I know where your heart is, then I'm not going to worry about the details so much. American Jews just don't believe that this Administration's heart is in the right place. They always want to wrangle over the details."
American officials counter, though, that precisely because there is no middle ground with the Israelis, the choice for Washington is either to be perceived as an enemy or let Israel dictate American policy. George P. Shultz, the former Secretary of State, was adored by the Israelis, but Bush Administration officials argue that was because he never confronted them with hard choices.
 
To Coax to the Bargaining Table
 Finally, the new case illuminates the fact that Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker have always been tugged by two somewhat conflicting instincts about how to make peace in the Middle East. The instinct that guides their strategy most of the time is that if the United States can just find Israel an Arab partner or partners for peace and coax them all to the negotiating table, it can produce a change in Israeli behavior -- including on the settlements question.
But at times another instinct intrudes. It is both a resentment at the way Israel has consistently ignored Washington's position on settlements and a feeling that Mr. Shamir is not really serious about peace and ultimately needs to be prodded with a bit of a stick.
In effect, the Administration is applying both instincts at once. It is trying to coax Israel to the bargaining table, which requires a certain finessing of hard choices and lots of reassurances. And the United States is trying to induce Israel to halt its settlements, which requires Israel to face up to the hardest choice of all -- but a choice that will ultimately be essential for any real peace.
The question, which should be clear in a few weeks, is whether those competing instincts will complement each other or negate each other.
The ambiguous way that the Administration first raised the issue is illustrative of its conflicting instincts and impulses. President Bush began by asking Israel to postpone its request for the housing loans for 120 days, to avoid an inflammatory debate. But he never said what the debate would be about.
 
Threat of Restrictions
 Then, on Tuesday, after Israeli officials had spurned a compromise proposal by Mr. Baker, reporters on his aircraft were told for the first time that if the Israelis insisted on pressing the issue and not accepting the delay, the Administration would have to insist on severe and unprecedented restrictions on Israeli settlement.
Indeed, many reporters took that to mean Washington would insist on a "freeze" before agreeing to the loan guarantees. Today, however, at a news conference in Damascus after talks with President Hafez al-Assad, Mr. Baker, in answer to a question, said he had not "discussed either publicly or privately a settlement freeze" in connection with the loans.
Although Mr. Baker would not say what formulations he had used, he did say:
"We have asked for a delay, because we want to avoid the question of linkage, not promote it. It is not new information that the Administration believes that when Congress debates the issue of absorption aid to Israel in the form of guarantees or otherwise, we have a right to know and a right to ask how that aid and how those guarantees would be used, and we would expect to ask how that aid would be used."

HEADLINE: Botanist's Quest: Plants for All Ills

BYLINE: By ANNE RAVER

 BODY:
DR. JAMES DUKE is one of those rare botanists who actually eat what they preach. He loves to watch the evening primrose open within 60 seconds. But he also munches its seeds, which are high in tryptophan, an essential amino acid that can relieve pain and depression.
Purple coneflowers thrive in his rather rumpled wild garden in Fulton, Md. He eats their roots to boost his immune system. 
 To cure a cold, he mashes up the stems and leaves of forsythia. To help strengthen weak capillaries, he makes "rutinade" from violet and buckwheat flowers, lemon grass and rhubarb stalks, and herbs high in rutin (anise, camomile, mint, rosehips).
He makes lemonade from wild May apples and has even written a little song about it:
 
 Penobscot Indians up in Maine
 Had a very pithy sayin':
 Rub the root on every day
 And it will take your warts away!
 . . . I'll venture to prognosticate
 Before my song is sung:
 This herb will help eradicate
 Cancer of the lung.
The 62-year-old Dr. Duke, a jungle explorer, a blue grass bass-player, a punster-poet and a writer-researcher for the Federal Department of Agriculture, will be discussing his research with four other prominent scientists Saturday at a daylong symposium on "Plants for Health and Healing: Their Role in Modern Medicine" at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx As both an economic- and ethnobotanist, Dr. Duke is well versed in the monetary values and folk uses of plants. His lecture will focus on the disease-fighting power of phytochemicals found in everything from soybeans to licorice root and pansies, which he grazed on all summer to counteract anti-inflammatory drugs he took most of this year for a slipped disk and a later back operation.
He is collaborating with the National Cancer Institute on both its AIDS and cancer-screening programs and its $20 million "designer food" program to prevent cancer.
Spring finds him wandering the woods outside the Agriculture Department office in Beltsville ("known only to bikers and weird botanists," he says) for wild ginseng. And in fall, pruning yew bushes. "The seeds are poisonous, so you have to be careful not to swallow them," he said, picking a few red berries from his own shaggy hedge at home. He popped them into his mouth and spat out the seeds. "The pulp doesn't have much taxol," he said, "but the needles may have as much as 100 parts per million taxol."
Taxol, an anti-tumor agent, may prove a powerful treatment for advanced ovarian cancer; it shows promise against breast and lung cancer.
The Agriculture Department is harvesting the Pacific yew in the Northwest, and the Food and Drug Administration has permitted Bristol-Meyers to manufacture taxol from the bark and use it experimentally. But this forest is already threatened by overlogging.
So here's this resident witch doctor for the establishment, who says taxol is staring us in the face in our own backyards. He recently cut a branch from a yew on the Agriculture Department's grounds and sent it to the cancer institute for analysis.
"The needles had 80 parts per million of taxol," he said. "There's no reason to kill those trees out West when we can just give our hedges a haircut."
Of Dr. Duke's yew specimen, Dr. Kenneth Snader, a chemist at the institute, said: "It's a very useful addition to our search," but added, "I'm not convinced it's going to replace other programs."
Dr. Duke has long rambled the rain forests of South America, observing which leaves and roots the natives used for ailments, then using them himself. In the late 1950's, he explored Peru and Panama for the Missouri Botanical Garden. But it was a three-year stint in Panama for Battelle-Columbus Laboratories of Columbus, Ohio, in the early 1960's, that most impressed the young Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina.
"The Atomic Energy Commission had hired Battelle to predict what radioactive materials would end up in the food chain if we dug a canal with nuclear devices," Dr. Duke said in his Alabama drawl, "so they sent me down there to figure out everything everybody was eating."
He lived in the forests and traveled up and down the rivers. He watched native fishermen mash up Clibadium, which is in the daisy family, and throw it in pools of water to stun their catch. "They'd just float to the top and could be easily picked out by hand," Dr. Duke said.
He was also impressed with a relative of the black pepper family that eased his own toothache.
But these days Dr. Duke is concentrating on familiar plants close to home. The common soybean, for instance.
"The isoflavones in soybeans have the most promising potential for arresting breast cancer," said Dr. Duke, who has helped the cancer institute to focus on the most potent of the 10,000 soybean varieties. But drug companies, he said, don't want to know that plain old plants can cure disease.
"If you and I go around sucking on licorice root, which can guard against ulcers, that's not going to make any money," he said. "No drug company wants to prove feverfew will prevent migraines, if they make $2 billion a year off migraines." Feverfew is an herb.
Dr. Herbert Pierson, a toxicologist at the cancer institute, agrees. "Every prescription drug that's making a profit has a patent on how it's synthesized or formulated in a dosage form,' he said. "There's not much financial interest in something that we can grow on a windowsill."
Which is one reason the institute is pursuing its $20 million "designer food" program. If scientists can identify the most powerful disease-fighting components of plants, these phytochemicals can be used to fortify food.
On a number of afternoons, Dr. Pierson has trailed after Dr. Duke, crushing up wild garlic mustard and eating the buds of tiger lilies. "They look like miniature bananas and have a sweet, nutty flavor," Dr. Pierson said. Like many flowers, they are high in the substances that strenthen cell membranes.
"He actually practices what he preaches," Dr. Pierson said. "Nobody should underestimate his knowledge. He knows from folkloric use that these things aren't used by chance, that they've survived the test of time."
Dr. Duke has written 10 botanical manuals, 200 scientific papers and two popular books on the medicinal uses of plants: "A Field Guide to Medicinal Plants," (Houghton Mifflin, 1990), written with Steven Foster, and "CRC Handbook of Medicinal Herbs" (CRC Press, 1985). And now he is working feverishly to complete an electronic data base that cross-references the nutrients and chemical constituents, ecology and folk uses of 1,000 plant species.
What he has done, Dr. Pierson said, "is going to be one of the most useful tools for the health food industry and interested pharmaceutical companies, because nobody else has taken the time to go through the massive amount of information and put it in a user-friendly form."
Less than 2 percent of the wild plants in the rain forest have been thoroughly analyzed for medicinal applications. The May apple was long used by Native Americans to treat venereal warts. And a few years ago, etoposide -- a semisynthetic derived from the plant -- was approved to treat testicular cancer. It's now being studied as a treatment for lung cancer.
Down South, they are called raccoon apples. And Dr. Duke has been "rassling the raccoons" for them for years.

HEADLINE: The Price of Hope: Medicine's Disputed Frontier - A Special Report;
Patients and Insurers Clash On Therapy's Outer Limits

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
Last fall, two months after the birth of her second child, Marie McCook of Philadelphia discovered she had breast cancer that had spread into her neck. Her prognosis was poor, but her doctors told her she was a suitable candidate for a dangerous, unproved and costly therapy under study, a bone-marrow transplant that would allow them to bombard her body with huge, otherwise lethal doses of anticancer drugs.
She grasped the slender reed. "I feel it has given me an opportunity at a possible cure," Mrs. McCook, 35 years old, said of the $100,000 procedure. It was performed this spring at the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center, and while her cancer has melted away, she will not know if she is cured for years. The bills were paid by her health insurance company, which is supporting the study.
 
Denial and Near Death
 Evelyn Harper, 47, with two children, learned last fall that her breast cancer had invaded her eyes and liver. A resident of the Virgin Islands, she sought treatment in Los Angeles, where doctors said she too should consider a marrow transplant.
But her insurer, like many around the country, said it would not cover an experimental therapy. In February she appealed, sending reams of data provided by her doctors arguing that the procedure might give her a 20 percent chance of surviving cancer-free for years. At the end of May the appeal was denied. By then the cancer had spread too widely to consider a transplant and now, with no hope of effective treatment, she is near death.
"That might not have sounded like a big chance of success, but it's a lot better than nothing," said her husband, Dennis Harper. "It seems like the insurance company holds you off as long as possible, waiting until it's too late for a transplant. That's not right."
Whether insurers should pay for marrow transplants has already become tinder for bitter lawsuits, poignant talk shows and an emerging political movement of breast cancer patients. The debate exemplifies the wrenching issues that may increasingly bedevil American medicine in an era of fast-changing, enormously expensive treatments and rising concern about costs.
 
Benefits vs. Costs
 Health experts and government leaders, as well as insurers, hope to tame runaway medical expenses through more stringent assessment of new treatments and by weighing their benefits and costs.
The concepts sound sensible and uncontroversial -- until they are applied to real people, especially with life-threatening diseases like breast cancer, and to promising treatments being urgently refined, like marrow transplants.
Grueling ordeals that put patients through at least three harrowing weeks of hospitalization, transplants have already proved useful against certain cancers of the blood, and insurers generally pay in those cases. Doctors are now trying the therapy in patients with several other kinds of cancer, including ovarian, testicular and especially breast cancer.
Some patients have shown encouraging responses, but many have not. The mortality rate from the procedure itself, while improving, is still 5 percent or more. All the researchers agree on the need for more research, but they put different shades on the same skimpy facts.
"For the right patient, I think it should be considered a therapeutic option," said Dr. William P. Peters, director of the Duke University Medical Center's marrow transplant program, a leader in research on transplants for breast cancer and a critic of insurance companies that refuse to pay when the procedures are performed at experienced centers.
Other experts are skeptical. "We have raised the public's expectations far beyond what is supported by the published data," Dr. I. Craig Henderson, director of the breast evaluation center of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, wrote in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute this summer. "We have no evidence as of yet that any patient will be cured by this therapy who would not have been cured by more conventional treatment."
Hundreds of women with breast cancer this year will endure the transplants and accompanying blasts of drugs. Researchers believe at least 10,000 women a year, of the more than 40,000 who die from breast cancer annually, may be good candidates if the procedure is shown to help more than it hurts.
 
Clinical Trials Under Way
 Most women whose cancer is caught in early stages are cured with conventional treatments, including removal of the cancerous lump or the entire breast, along with drug therapy and radiation. For them, there is no reason to take on the risk and travails of a marrow transplant. Many more women are ruled out as transplant candidates by age and condition. Because it is so demanding on the body, the procedure is seldom tried on women older than about 55, or on those with other medical problems.
Firm answers about effectiveness are several years away: controlled clinical trials, comparing patients receiving transplants with similar women receiving conventional chemotherapy, have just begun.
The procedure is becoming safer and less expensive, but even at best, research suggests, it will never offer a miraculous cure for patients with advanced breast cancer; it will, however, raise their odds of survival.
For advanced breast cancer, it appears that transplants will, at best, keep 10 to 20 percent of the women cancer-free, said Dr. Edward A. Stadtmauer of the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center, who is treating Mrs. McCook in a study comparing transplants with traditional drug therapy. And that success rate may fall, he said, as more patients are followed for more years.
"That still would be wonderful," he said. "But we also have to look at quality of life, toxicity and costs. I have to say I still don't know which group in the study is going to do better. There is truly no right answer in 1991."
With known therapies offering little, some patients see the unknown in a different light.
"There's a whole list of things that could go wrong, and yes, it scared me," Mrs. McCook said. "But I also have two small children, and the chance of not being here in 10 years also scares me."
 
The Controversy
State of the Art Or Experimental?
 Insurance companies have long said they do not cover unproved therapies, but they have often paid for innovative, unapproved uses of cancer drugs. In decades past, too, they started paying with little question for costly new procedures, like coronary bypass operations, that were widely adopted with little evaluation. But today, expensive new procedures receive much closer scrutiny.
The official position of the insurance industry on transplants is clear enough. "We are not saying this is too expensive and it shouldn't be covered," said Naomi Aronson, director of technology assessment with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association in Chicago.
"We are saying that procedures need to be evaluated so that precious health care resources can be used for things that are effective." If studies provethat transplants improve survival, Dr. Aronson said, the companies will pay.
 
Many Insurers Are Paying
 To speed the search for answers and perhaps fend off lawsuits, many Blue Cross affiliates and, in the Philadelphia area, U.S. Healthcare, a large health maintenance organization, have agreed to contribute to the costs of patients' receiving transplants in certain clinical trials.
In practice, after hearing pleas or threats from doctors or lawyers, many insurers are paying transplant bills for some breast cancer patients, but many, too, are denying coverage. Recently, some insurers have begun writing policies that specifically exclude coverage of marrow transplants for breast cancer.
Cancer researchers, as well as desperate patients, are angry.
"It's unfortunate, because basically they are holding transplants for breast cancer up to a different standard than other costly procedures," said Dr. Karen H. Antman, director of the transplant program at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Insurance officials deny they have a double standard.
"It will be impossible to do studies unless patients have coverage," Dr. Antman added.
Ellen Hobbs, a 36-year-old breast cancer patient in Sacramento, Calif., said: "What's the difference between experimental and state of the art? The doctors told me that traditional chemotherapy would be ineffective."
"This country spends a lot of money fixing up people with no hope," said Mrs. Hobbs, who had a transplant in June and became politically active after fighting for months, with the help of a lawyer, before persuading her insurer to pay.
Now receiving radiation therapy in followup treatment, she is doing well so far, but, like Mrs. McCook, cannot know her long-term prospects since cancer cells can lurk in the body for years before resurging.
 
The Transplant
Bombarding Body With Cancer Killers
 For such a trying ordeal, the transplants involve a series of undramatic steps. Doctors have long suspected that in some patients they could kill cancer in the body by dousing it with enough toxic drugs. The problem was that this would kill the patient, too, by destroying the marrow cells that generate vital red and white cells and platelets in the blood.
In autologous marrow transplants, as these are called, some of the patient's own marrow cells are extracted from bone or blood and frozen; outside donors are not needed. The patient is then subjected to several days of intensive chemotherapy, 10 times the normal dose. Her marrow cells are reinjected, and the real drama begins.
For weeks, until the reinjected marrow begins producing new blood cells, assuming it does, the patient lives without much of an immune system, susceptible to vicious fungal, bacterial and viral infections.
"It is horrible," Mrs. McCook said. "Everything just hits rock bottom. I had temperatures of 105, vomiting, bowel problems and I needed morphine. You lose your hair and your appetite, you lose your taste buds. You get depressed."
 
Vulnerable Period Shortened
 Until recently all patients spent more than a month in the hospital and transplant-related mortality at some leading centers was over 20 percent, most often from infections. But the recent availability of growth factors, manufactured versions of natural body chemicals that stimulate the marrow cells, has shortened the period of critical vulnerability, reduced hospital stays to as little as three weeks and pulled down death rates to 5 percent to 15 percent at various centers.
The growth factors have also pulled down the cost, which is attributable more than anything else to the length of the hospital stay. Dr. Antman said cost for some patients at some centers was down to $70,000 or less. Dr. Peters believes that over the next several years the price could fall to $25,000 or less.
 
The Results
Encouraging Signs But Doubts Persist
 Right now, transplants are considered worth risking for the several thousand women each year whose cancer has spread to 10 or more lymph nodes, meaning that they a high chance of relapse after normal therapy. It is also considered worth the risk for the smaller number of women with large tumors that cannot be surgically removed or with inflammatory tumors and for the tens of thousands of women whose cancer has already spread to other parts of the body, who are rarely cured.
Among those groups, only some can even potentially benefit. Before a transplant is considered, a woman is given a course of conventional chemotherapy. Only those whose tumors shrink in response to lower doses, studies have found, may potentially be helped with the all-out attack of high doses and a marrow transplant.
 
Will Remissions Last?
 In a positive sign, studies indicate that women receiving transplants are far more likely than others to show a good short-term response -- disappearance of detectable cancer.
The open question is whether these remissions will last.
Dr. Peters and other researchers point to encouraging recent results from studies involving limited numbers of patients. In one recent study at Duke, among 59 women whose cancer had spread to 10 or more lymnph nodes but not more widely, three-fourths were cancer-free after four years, he said. With conventional therapy, he said, he would only expect about one-fifth of such patients to be cancer-free.
Among a group of 45 transplant patients whose cancer had already spread to distant sites beyond the lymph nodes, he said, 20 percent are cancer-free after an average of four years. With conventional therapy, almost none with such advanced disease would be cancer-free at that point, he said. Of another group of 22 women with advanced cancer who were early pioneers with the therapy, three remain cancer free after five to eight years.
But others say figures like these, while intriguing, may easily mislead.
"The question is, what would have happened to those same patients if they had gotten conventional chemotherapy," said Dr. David M. Eddy, a health economist at Duke University who is a consultant to insurance companies. "I can show you individual patients who received conventional therapy who also survived 5 or 10 years."
Among other problems with existing comparisons, the patient groups may have differed in important ways. "The transplant patients are very healthy, good candidates for treatment," noted Dr. Bruce D. Cheson of the National Cancer Institute.
Dr. John H. Glick, director of the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center, says four or five years is not long enough to say a patient is cured of breast cancer. "Some of the advocates are speaking too soon," he said.
 
The Outlook
Weighing Lives Against Costs
 Within three or four years the clinical trials should yield convincing evidence about the comparative effectiveness of transplants, although it will take longer to know whether cures are achieved. If a statistically significant survival benefit is shown, even for a few years, then the insurance dispute may fade away.
But, depending on how dramatic the trial results are, divisive questions of cost versus benefit may persist.
"If there is a big difference in survival, then it will be persuasive," said Dr. Cheson of the National Cancer Institute. "But if there is only a small advantage for transplants, it's still going to be an individual decision the physician will have to make with the patient."
Even the insurance industry has shied away from the more explosive, but ultimately unavoidable issue for American medicine: How good does a treatment have to be to make it worth the price?
 
Benefits to Bring Pay
 In the case of marrow transplants, insurance companies have said that if studies yield proof of benefit, they will cover the procedure whatever it costs. But some experts wonder whether this approach will remain feasible, or even wise.
"I think they should take the cost into account, and weigh it against the benefits," said Dr. Eddy, the health economist. "I think in five years they will do that, but they don't now."
"Somewhere, some time, someone will have to judge what additional benefit is worth what additional cost," Dr. Eddy said. He acknowledged that this would be treacherous new terrain for government, insurers, doctors and patients who, like Mrs. McCook, put a value on hope itself.
"Society has had very little experience doing this," Dr. Eddy said.

HEADLINE: Slanting of Intelligence Becomes Issue for Nominee

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 18

 BODY:
The possible shaping of intelligence to fit the foreign policy goals of an administration has emerged as an important issue in the confirmation hearings of Robert M. Gates, raising questions about the integrity of the intelligence process.
Mr. Gates, nominated to be the Director of Central Intelligence, was accused this week by Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, of bending intelligence assessments while serving in senior positions at the Central Intelligence Agency in the 1980's, either to fit his pessimistic view of the Kremlin or to please his bosses. 
 Mr. Gates, currently the deputy national security adviser, has defended his conduct, but acknowledged that in at least one case involving Iran he had acted to suppress dissent so that the C.I.A. and the other intelligence arms of the Reagan Administration could present a unified interagency view to the White House.
On Friday, as the Senate Intelligence Committee continues its examination of Mr. Gates's fitness for the top intelligence post, it will hear in a closed session from former and current C.I.A. officials who will argue both sides of the issue.
Two former analysts, Melvin Goodman and Jennifer Glaudemans, are expected to testify that Mr. Gates, as a senior intelligence official working under the stewardship of William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence from 1981 to 1986, actively suppressed dissent and contributed to an atmosphere of intimidation among the agency's analysts.
Despite the assertions, the prospects of Mr. Gates's confirmation appear promising, unless there are startling new revelations in an open session on Thursday and the closed meetings scheduled for Friday and Tuesday.
But the committee hearings have spotlighted a particularly sensitive intersection between intelligence agencies and policy makers. The shaping of intelligence into a convenient rationale for policy goals is considered a serious breach of an analyst's obligation to provide dispassionate conclusions and predictions, regardless of what the policy makers want.
While these standards of neutrality have not always been honored in the face of White House pressure, President Bush, a former Director of Central Intelligence himself, has instructed the intelligence services to reach independent judgments and to stay out of the policy-making arena.
"Casey and Gates changed procedures and rewrote key judgments," said one former intelligence analyst who insisted on anonymity. "Analysts who didn't pursue the policy agenda were basically ordered to get on board. It was a corruption of the process."
Such tailoring, known at the C.I.A. as "cooking the books," is extraordinarily difficult to prove. What one analyst considers slanting another analyst may simply believe is an honest difference of opinion.
"The other word for tailoring is editing," said Herbert Meyer, a former special assistant to Mr. Casey and a former senior agency analyst, who shared Mr. Gates's hardline views on the Soviet Union. "That's what Bob got paid to do. He didn't just sign things that landed on his desk. People who accused Casey or Gates or me of cooking the books have never come to grips with the fact that in each instance where an accusation was made our conclusions turned out to be correct."
 
Report on Pope to Be Scrutinized
 The committee will hear assertions on Friday that Mr. Gates, as a senior C.I.A. official, skewed an agency assessment in April 1985 that concluded that the Soviet Union's intelligence agency masterminded the 1981 assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II.
Critics of the report have said that Mr. Gates was so intent on presenting the report as the unanimous view of the agency that he deleted dissenting opinions written by other analysts and ignored data that stated that the assassination attempt was inconsistent with K.G.B. operations, instead basing the conclusions on flimsy evidence.
Mr. Gates sought to deflate the accusation in advance on Tuesday, when he told the committee that after the report on the assassination attempt was issued he ordered one of his officers to write an "attack" on it and asked the C.I.A.'s Project Evaluation staff to review the entire record. But former agency officials familiar with the post-mortems said the investigation, even though it was watered down, indicated that Mr. Gates had misrepresented the report's conclusions.
 
On Arming Iran
 Another issue that may be examined further will be a classified interagency "estimate" on Iran prepared by the National Intelligence Council under Mr. Gates's chairmanship in May 1985.
On Tuesday, Mr. Gates admitted for the first time that he had pressured the State Department to go along with the analysis, completed just before the United States began to secretly sell arms to Iran. The report warned of mounting internal instability in Iran and concluded that Moscow had made significant inroads into the country at the expense of the West.
In addition, despite a long-held policy of trying to prevent arms sales by any country to Iran, the report argued that the degree to which Washington's allies, including Israel, "can fill a military gap for Iran will be a crucial measure of the West's ability to blunt Soviet influence."
The report, which varied widely from previous analyses on Iran and was reversed the following February, became the basis for a formal directive on Iran that urged the United States to provide "selected military equipment" to Iran.
 
Dispute Over 'Footnote'
 In his testimony, Mr. Gates recalled how he had persuaded Morton I. Abramowitz, then the State Department's director of intelligence and research, not to insert a dissenting opinion in a "footnote," although Iran specialists in the State Department continuted to hotly contest the report's conclusions.
"So that there was no alternative view presented?" Senator Bradley asked.
"That is correct," Mr. Gates replied, "because I felt that the view that they had, as they had written their footnote, really didn't represent an alternative view."
Mr. Abramowitz declined comment today, but a State Department official involved in the controversy said Mr. Gates had pressed the point at Mr. Casey's behest.
In his two days of Senate confirmation hearings, Mr. Gates argued that the issue of tailoring assessments was highly subjective, and presented himself as a boss who eagerly sought out alternate views.
"When I was a young analyst I was absolutely convinced that the refusal to accept my analysis was politically motivated by the people on the seventh floor at the agency," Mr. Gates told the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday, referring to the executive suites occupied by the Director of Central Intelligence and his top aides.
"At the other end of the spectrum, as a policy maker, I have been absolutely convinced at times that the C.I.A. and the intelligence community went out of their way to stick their thumb in the eye of the policy maker and to make them look stupid."
 
Differences With Shultz
 He spoke publicly for the first time about his differences with former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who told the Iran-contra committees in July 1987 that long before the Iran-contra affair emerged he had "come to have grave doubts about the objectivity and reliability of some of the intelligence I was getting," a criticism that aides to Mr. Shultz have said was leveled at Mr. Casey and his deputy and protege, Mr. Gates.
Mr. Gates said he believed that Mr. Shultz was referring to the agency's negative assessments of the Philippines in the wake of the overthrow of President Ferdinand Marcos, Angola under its current government, and to a lesser extent, the Soviet Union.
Mr. Shultz, now a professor of international economics at Stanford University, declined to comment on Mr. Gates's nomination, but senior officials who worked for him said the battles with Mr. Casey and Mr. Gates included genuine differences of opinion as well as a feeling that some of the intelligence had been shaded.

HEADLINE: Ceramic Vessels, Painted

BYLINE: By LISA HAMMEL

 BODY:
Although Rudy Autio is one of the elder statesmen of modern American ceramics, he continues to try new ideas. Sixteen of Mr. Autio's recent works can be seen at the Helen Drutt Gallery New York, 724 Fifth Avenue (near 57th Street), through Oct. 26.
In the early 1970's, after two decades of decorating his pots with abstract patterns, Mr. Autio decided to paint figures on the surfaces of his vessels. His renderings of male and female nudes, horses and other creatures became more distinct over the years, while the shapes of his pots turned increasingly abstract. 
 The pots have now passed tabletop size and are on their way to monumentality; they stand close to four feet high. To his hand-built cylinders, Mr. Autio adds protuberances that evoke such shapes as the ventricles of the heart. They become some part of the anatomy of his figures -- the stretching arm of a woman, perhaps, or a man's bent leg.
There is an expansiveness in Mr. Autio's more recent work. Not only are the vessels larger, but the painted figures seem almost weightless.
Much of American ceramics today has roots in Japanese traditional pottery. At Gallery Zero (11 Rockefeller Plaza), pieces by major Japanese potters who work within traditional modes can be seen. Through Sept. 28, 30 pieces by Kiyotsugu Sawa are being shown. Mr. Sawa works at Shigaraki, an old pottery center near Kyoto.
Shigaraki stoneware was put on the map in the first half of the 16th century, when it was discovered and favored by influential tea masters who were then establishing the ritual of the Japanese tea ceremony. The tea masters considered the rustic, unpretentious ware appropriate for the contemplative tea ceremony, which is meant to remove the participant from the distractions of everyday life.
The ware certainly does have a coarseness of texture and an unfussy form. But it no longer seems simple. For centuries the Japanese have seen art in this ware, which is born of the local granitic clay and baked in special wood-fired kilns.
Among the specifics that are valued are the bold shapes of the tea leaf jars, with their natural shiny ash glazes set off against pebbly surfaces; the rosy orange hue of the clay itself, often with scorch marks from firing; the economically incised surfaces, which look as if grasses had been pressed into the body, and the dramatic cracks in pieces that have split in the firing.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says That Obstacles to Soviet Loans Will Be Overcome

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 18

 BODY:
Senior American officials studying the crippled Soviet economy said today that the Bush Administration expected to solve the problem of American banks' resistance to $500 million in Government-guaranteed loans needed to sell American grain to the needy Soviet Union.
"We don't think that's going to be a problem," said an official traveling with a special delegation led by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan. "The President made his mind up." 
 Anxious Soviet officials are pressing for as much quick foreign aid as they can get to shore up their food stocks for the winter.
They are trying to make a case to visiting delegations from the United States and elsewhere that they are making progress with their transitional government and its emergency plans for national reconstruction afterthe aborted Kremlin coup last month.
"We retain a sense of optimism," Mr. Brady said after conferring with Ivan S. Silayev, chairman of the transitional government's economic management committee. Officials planning solutions to the nation's economic and political crisis were "serious and realistic," Mr. Brady said, adding that he found little evidence of the"games playing" of the past in elaborate plans for renewal.
 
Winter Does Not Wait
 Talking with reporters before meeting Mr. Brady, Mr. Silayev invoked the ultimate Soviet alarm for urgent action. "It is winter, and it does not wait," he said. He estimated that the winter will be free of hunger if enough is done in the way of domestic preparation and foreign aid.
The larger task of building economic and political bonds among the separate republics of the now defunct Soviet Union will take 10 to 15 years, by the latest estimate of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
The Soviet leader, who is head of the transitional State Council in which he is joined by 10 leaders of the nation's republics, offered the estimate in the newspaper Izvestia. He said that "within the next two or three years" new government processes and positive chan ge should take place. This was as close as anyone has come to offering a time frame for the latest emergency promises of reform, which remain vague on details and timing.
 
Silayev to Stay
 For this national task, Mr. Silayev finally made clear his own plans, reversing a previously announced decision that he would return to his post as Prime Minister of the Russian federated republic, the nation's largest and most populous. Instead, he chose to stay with the transitional union government as economic chairman and informal Prime Minister under the State Council, the decision-making body that Mr. Gorbachev heads. The council is to rule the nation until a new constitution and new union treaty can be worked out.
Mr. Silayev said a factor in his decision to stay was the wish of the Russian federation's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, who had received a commitment from President Gorbachev that since Russia contains a majority of the Soviet nation's population, land and wealth, the post should be held by someone from Russia.
Mr. Yeltsin, now the key official in engineering reconstruction plans among the suddenly sovereign republics, caused a flutter in Moscow today by feeling ill at work and taking the day off. Early reports circulated that he had suffered "heart trouble," but they were later denied. Such phrases are used very loosely here to cover a variety of moods and non-cardiac illness, and Mr. Yeltsin's office said he was expected to be back Thursday to open a session of the Russian Parliament.
Soviet and Russian officials have asked for more than $20 billion in aid from Western nations and Japan in recent weeks. But theBush Administration has been having trouble obtaining simpler, smaller guaranteed loans from American banks wary of the Soviet nation's creditworthiness.
The first $600 million of these loans finally had to be obtained through foreign banks. The Bush Administration is seeking lenders for another $500 million worth planned for Oct. 1, although Mr. Silayev said after speaking with Mr. Brady that he hoped the process might be speeded up, along with the final installment of $400 million due in February.

HEADLINE: JORDAN CAUTIOUS ON PEACE SESSION

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Sept. 18

 BODY:
On the eve of a visit here by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, senior Jordanian officials expressed pessimism that the American effort to assemble a Mideast peace conference next month can yield concrete results resolving the 40-year Arab-Israeli conflict.
With more than 30 percent unemployment, an $8 billion foreign debt and a cutoff of Arab financial aid, Jordan is facing the burden of caring for a new flood of impoverished Palestinian refugees being expelled from Kuwait at the rate of 34,000 a month. Jordanian officials are angling for rewards in exchange for attendance at the peace talks. 
 Crown Prince Hassan said in an interview that it was "high time" for incentives to be made to Jordan in order to enlist its help in the peace process. He warned that further financial or political pressure on Jordan by the West or hostile Arab countries, who are punishing Jordan over its support of Iraq during the Persian Gulf crisis, will be counterproductive.
 
Incentives and Limits
 "Jordan and the Palestinians have been squeezed to the limit," said Prince Hassan, who is heir to the Jordanian throne.
"There is a recognition of the centrality of Jordan's geopolitical role," the Prince said. "But I've said time and again that if that role is going to be triggered by pressure, then that is not enough. The time has come for some form of incentive and understanding. If pressure is the medicine, certainly we have been over-medicated. We don't want the patient to die."
He also stressed that there are limits to the accommodations that Jordan can make to facilitate the peace process, especially if they come at the expense of Palestinian representation at the talks and Palestinian national demands. He stressed that Jordan has a large constituency of Jordanians who are of Palestinian origin and whose sentiments cannot be discounted. Palestinians living in Jordan are variously estimated at 50 to 60 percent of the country's population.
 
'Threshold of Reconciling'
 "When speaking about pressure, I would like to remind, in whatever way that is possible, that we also are clearly under constituents' pressure," the Crown Prince said.
A prominent Jordanian businessman who requested anonymity said that "we would have a revolution on our hands here" if Jordan were perceived to have signed "the death certificate of the Palestinian state."
Both the United States and Israel have ruled out any participation by the Palestine Liberation Organization in the talks and there has yet to be an accord on who will represent the Palestinians. The United States has proposed that they be included within a Jordanian delegation, something that Jordan has yet to agree to.
Jordanian officials also said it was high time for an Arab reconciliation that would bring Jordan back into the Arab fold and end the ostracism of Jordan by Arab countries that sided with the United States against Iraq.
"We are on the threshold of reconciling with our enemy, Israel, but we have not not yet reconciled amongst us," Foreign Minister Abdallah al-Nusur said on Monday.
The Arab gulf countries, primarily Saudi Arabia, have suspended their annual aid of $500 million to this country. Saudi Arabia has also ended its free supply of oil to Jordan, forcing the country to buy its oil from Iraq.

HEADLINE: Essay;
The Trial of Casey

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
On Nov. 10, 1982, the day Leonid Brezhnev died, as all the sages of Congress and media thumbsuckers were speculating on the Kremlin succession, Director of Central Intelligence William J. Casey sent a C.I.A. assessment to President Reagan.
The last sentence of that memo concluded with the Director's personal judgment: "As for me, I bet Andropov on the nose and Gorbachev across the board." 
 Horseplayers know that on the nose means "to win," and across the board is a hedged bet "to win, place and show," or to come in among the first three. Bill Casey's intelligence judgment was sound: the K.G.B.'s Andropov won, and his protege, the little-known Gorbachev, was placed in the line of succession after the apparat chik Chernenko.
That's the sort of valuable prediction that we pay Directors of Central Intelligence for. Casey was extraordinarily good at that, but you would never know it from the ghoulish impeachment trial now going on in the guise of Senate confirmation hearings of Robert Gates.
Looming in the background is the contemptible charge that this lifelong patriot, while running the 1980 Reagan campaign, conspired with Ayatollah Khomeini to delay the release of American hostages lest credit go to President Carter. That's a late hit by political sore losers.
His widow, Sophia Casey, has shown me documents about his suspicions that Mr. Carter would pull an "October surprise." In a Nov. 2, 1980, memo to Reagan, Casey dismissed a potential Carter ransom effort as likely to be seen as "a desperate last attempt to manipulate the hostages again for political benefit"; Casey's judgment was that "we should say very little and leave it that way."
As C.I.A. chief, did he comprehend the Soviet threat and incipient economic rot? Yes to both: when he reported at the outset that Moscow was behind state-sponsored terrorism, doves clucked indulgently -- but now we're getting the evidence of how right Casey was. And even when C.I.A. analysts led the dovecote to misread the Soviet economy, he was on target with his personal assessment of Kremlin economic weakness and inability to cope with our arms spending pressure.
What about the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan contras from sales of arms for Iran? I have no doubt that Bill Casey personally supervised Ollie North's illegal operation, backdated findings, wrongfully misled Congress and brought deserved shame on his agency and President.
My old friend and I had a severe falling-out about that time, but now I believe this arrogance and degeneration of judgment in his final years had much to do with a tumor destroying his brain.
In the Gates hearings, we are hearing only of the diseased, temperamental Casey, not of the healthy, insightful hard-liner who contributed so much to the victory over Communism. Nobody, not even Senator Warren Rudman, is willing to provide such perspective during the Senate's first posthumous impeachment trial.
Mr. Gates cannot defend his old boss and patron if he wants to be confirmed. On the contrary, he must distance himself from Casey's concluding lawlessness, despite pockets of guilty knowledge all around. The nominee properly admits he should have known more of the illegal diversion, should have told his boss he had a need to know; frankly the likelihood that he would then have blown the whistle is remote.
Let's assume Mr. Gates has an excellent forgettery and was deft enough to stay on the frayed fringe of guilty knowledge. Assume also this frustrated careerist will keep his sworn word to resign rather than obey a Presidential order to pull the wool over Senate oversight -- a promise he refused to make last time up. Should he be confirmed?
Yes. He's a cold fish but he knows his stuff about economic intelligence, and if anybody's eyes have been lifted to the necessity of truth in covert action, it's O. Ye Gates. Unlike the bad Casey, he has little political backing to be arrogant about; like the good Casey, he remained vigilant toward the Soviet Union when even his colleagues went starry-eyed.
Casey's impeachment in absentia is not the American way. The time for Senate overseers to kick a man is when he is up and causing trouble, not when he is safely in his grave.

HEADLINE: A Cowardly Vote for the Jobless

 BODY:
House Democrats displayed neither courage nor sense on Tuesday when they voted to extend unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed without raising taxes to pay for the plan. By raising the deficit, the bill would effectively violate last year's tortuously negotiated budget law, paving the way for further violations as the delayed pain from deficit reduction takes hold.
The plight of the unemployed is serious. Each month more than 300,000 Americans exhaust the standard 26-week limit for unemployment benefits; these families can face loss of their homes or apartments, if not worse deprivation. The House bill would extend benefits for up to 20 additional weeks, at a cost of over $6 billion. 
 The problem is that Congress refuses to pay -- a fiscally reckless evasion of last year's deficit-reduction law, which required that new programs be paid for by new taxes or by compensating cuts in other programs. The House Ways and Means chairman, Dan Rostenkowski, offered a plan to raise payroll taxes on high-paid workers, but his fellow Democrats wouldn't go along.
Some tried to mask political cowardice as virtue, contending that tax hikes would worsen the recession. But the claim is false: since the new revenues could be immediately returned to the private economy in the form of higher benefits, the Rostenkowski plan would not dampen spending.
The House bill is similar to one Congress approved in August; this one, however, eliminates the loophole that allowed Mr. Bush to sign but not institute the new benefits. That invites a certain Presidential veto.
The Senate now has the opportunity to make the bill right. By adopting the Rostenkowski plan it can help the unemployed, make the payroll tax fairer and preserve the deficit-reduction law. But it will take more guts than were demonstrated this week in the House.

HEADLINE: Albany Shouldn't Cut Corners in the Courts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Sept. 6 report that New York State budget cuts would make it necessary to lay off 495 court employees should be of serious concern to this state's citizens.
The resulting substantial closing down of civil parts of the courts will cause further unacceptable delays in the resolution of citizens' claims. Justice delayed is justice denied, and such delays will have an adverse effect upon the already faltering economy of the state. 
 I respectfully offer alternative suggestions to Chief Judge Sol Wachtler, who is one of the finest chief judges New York State has ever had, as well as to the Legislature and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
It is not clear whether or not the layoffs include employees of court administration. If not, such layoffs should first be directed in the area of court administration, in substantial numbers, before any reduction takes place in the number of employees in the civil parts, which will directly affect the rights of litigants.
The public interest would be better served if the saving involved in the pending layoffs of 495 vital court employees were instead to be made by modest reductions in the individual staffs of the state's more than 200 legislators. The saving might also be made through other very possible legislative economies, which I prefer not to enumerate. The Governor should act to find the funds to avoid further deterioration of the courts.
The courts of New York State have been seriously overburdened with criminal and civil litigation, and shamefully treated by the legislative and executive branches of government for too long. Some 20 years ago, Chief Judge Stanley H. Fuld helplessly complained that the courts were being starved.
If the approaching layoffs seriously impair the proper functioning of the courts, as they apparently will, and if no relief from the other branches of government is forthcoming, the judiciary must resort to the courts, its final alternative.

HEADLINE: From Unemployment, Into Self-Employment

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

DATELINE: SUDBURY, Mass.

 BODY:
When Susan LaCroix, an out-of-work chef from Lowell, Mass., visited the local office of the Massachusetts Department of Employment and Training in April of last year, she was intrigued by a notice saying some would-be entrepreneurs could collect unemployment insurance benefits while they started their own businesses.
Ms. LaCroix, 33 years old, had recently lost her job at the Appleton Inn in Lowell, and she knew finding another chef's position would not be easy in the dismal Massachusetts economy. Having long harbored a dream of owning her own business, she applied to the helping-hand program. In a lottery of 587 applicants, Ms. LaCroix and 104 other people across the state were chosen. 
 The 24 weeks of benefits provided a cushion as she set up Epicurean Catering in the kitchen of the Lowell Girls' Club. Supported by her biweekly unemployment checks, as well as seminars, workshops and counseling supplied by the state, Ms. LaCroix has built a profitable business.
"The program really allowed me to focus on my business and get it started," Ms. LaCroix said. "It provided great support and gave me the time to pound the pavement to develop new clients."
State officials said that 60 percent of the 105 participants in the first program were considered successfully established before their 24 weeks of benefits ran out. Nils Nordberg, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Employment and Training, estimated the program had already saved the state $125,000 in unemployment benefits.
The program, called the Massachusetts Enterprise Project, is part of a series of demonstration projects set up by the United States Department of Labor to find ways to get unemployed workers back into jobs. Two state projects, the one in Massachusetts and one in Washington, have focused on self-employment, and the Labor Department has spent more than $1 million on them.
In Washington's program, which started in 1989 and ended last year, each participant in the state received a one-time up-front payment averaging $4,200 from a Federal research grant. Data on the success of the program are still being gathered.
Stephen Wandner, director of these experimental projects for the Labor Department, said the Massachusetts program had been offered to all 50 states. Only Oregon and Minnesota also expressed interest, he said, but they backed out when told they would have to make up any shortfalls by dipping into their unemployment insurance funds. Massachusetts, however, decided to go ahead.
Participants in the Massachusetts entrepreneurs' program are not required to actively seek jobs in order to receive benefits.
Besides drawing upon state unemployment insurance money, Massachusetts also found partners from the business community. The Boston-based Shawmut Bank, for example, provided more than $100,000 in small-business loans, while individual business executives donated their expertise for counseling. And the owner of an office park provided office space for seminars.
 
Beach Towels and Energy Audits
 Michael Cass, a 37-year-old former roller-coaster operator at an amusement park in Springfield, Mass., said the program allowed him to start manufacturing and selling a product that is a combination garment, beach towel and slipcover for beach chairs. Mr. Cass has patented the product and is hoping to sell a large order to the Hyatt Hotel chain.
Ted Davis, a 45-year-old mechanical engineer from Brimfield, Mass., lost his job at Combustion Engineering Inc. in Windsor, Conn., when it was acquired by Asea Brown Boveri A.B., the Swedish energy giant, in 1990. After being accepted in the Enterprise Project, he started a company that performs energy audits and consulting.
"I had actually incorporated before I joined the project," Mr. Davis said. "But the business never got off the ground." He said the state program "allowed me to work on my business without worrying about looking for a job and coming into the unemployment office."
After initial success, he said, the recession cut into his business. Still, he says, "I'd rather take a night job and keep the business going than return to what I was doing before."
Pamela Cole was laid off as a software consultant by one of the many computer companies outside Boston on Route 128. Now, with state help, she has begun a service of photographing horse-and-carriage competitions and selling her work to contestants. "Revenues are increasing all the time," said Ms. Cole, a 47-year-old New Bedford resident.
Mr. Nordberg, the state employment commissioner, said he was happy with the results thus far but added that it was too early to call the program a success. Small business failures are legion, he noted, and it will be several years before the new entrepreneurs can demonstrate that they have created established businesses.
Massachusetts lost 157,600 jobs between July 1990 and July 1991 and currently has about 120,000 people drawing unemployment benefits. "We are constantly looking for alternative ways of getting people back to work sooner," Mr. Nordberg said.
 
Self-Employment a Trend
 The Massachusetts plan exemplifies a growing interest in self-employment as a career option. "The idea of self-employment as an alternative has not been well explored in this country," said Bonnie Dallinger, director of the Enterprise Project. "But there has been a growing interest in it over the last 10 years by such disadvantaged groups as single women, minorities and the unemployed."
In a report published last October, Mr. Wandner of the Labor Department noted that most Western European nations had already set up self-employment programs as alternatives to unemployment compensation. The Massachusetts project was modeled after a successful program in Britain.
In the last decade, self-employment has grown tremendously in the United States. The Small Business Administration says the number of sole-proprietor and "micro" businesses rose to 13.8 million by 1986 from 9.73 million in 1980 and continues to grow. A more recent survey of nearly 3,000 new businesses by the National Federation of Independent Business showed that 50 percent of all new businesses had two employees or less, and only 10 percent had more than 10 employees.
The survey, in fact, showed that contrary to popular belief, the new businesses survived: 77 percent were still operating after three years.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rise Tied to Concern On Soviets and Persian Gulf

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose slightly in light trading yesterday, influenced largely by political uncertainty in the Soviet Union and increasing tension in the Persian Gulf.
Gold prices were mixed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery was quoted at $348.30 a troy ounce, down 30 cents. A late bid at New York's Republic National Bank quoted gold at $348.25, up 5 cents. 
 Currency traders said the dollar traded in a narrow range throughout the session, and found little inspiration from a new report on the United States trade deficit.
The Commerce Department said the July trade gap climbed to $5.9 billion, the biggest imbalance since January. It was 55.6 percent higher than a revised June deficit of $3.79 billion.
Jerry Egan, chief currency dealer for the Bank of Boston, said the trade report activated a slight selling of the dollar, but that it recouped the losses later.
 
Haven for Investors
Curtis Perkins, a trader for the Chemical New York Capital Markets Group, said traders bought dollars on reports that the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, was experiencing poor health, and the imminent movement of American warplanes to the Persian Gulf to enforce the cease-fire agreement with Iraq.
International investors typically buy dollars in times of unsettling events as a safe-haven investment.
The German mark is under particular pressure because of Germany's economic ties with the Soviet Union. Many financial analysts believe the Soviet Union will have difficulty repaying its Western debt, and they speculate Germany's economy could be hurt as a result.
The dollar rose slightly against the mark in active trading, closing in New York at 1.6885 marks, up from 1.6845. In late European trading, the dollar closed at 1.6892 marks, up from 1.6808.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7280, from $1.7317 late Wednesday. In New York, sterling cost $1.7300, more expensive that $1.7285 late Wednesday.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.45 yen, closing at 134.40 yen. It was quoted at the same rate in late trading in London and New York, unchanged from late Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's late quotes, included: 1.4755 Swiss francs, up from 1.4715; 5.7525 French francs, up from 5.7400; 1,264 Italian lire, up from 1,260, and 1.13525 Canadian dollars, down from 1.13715.
In the precious-metals markets abroad, gold rose in London to a late bid price of $348.75 a troy ounce, up from $348.10 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, it rose to a closing bid of $348.50 an ounce, up from $348 late Wednesday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose 98 cents an ounce to close at a $349.69.

HEADLINE: Claims Filed By Jobless Show a Drop

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 19

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell in early September, but the drop was largely dismissed as a fluke related to the Labor Day holiday.
In the week ended Sept. 7, first-time claims for unemployment benefits were filed by 402,000 people, a decrease of 17,000 from the 419,000 recorded for the previous week, the Labor Department said today. 
 It was the lowest level of new claims since the last week of July, when there were 400,000 people making their first trip to unemployment lines. The drop of 17,000 was the biggest improvement since a decline of 21,000 for the week ended July 20, when claims fell to 404,000.
Because the first week of September included Labor Day, however, there were only four days to file claims, and analysts therefore hesitated to read too much into the decline.
In addition, the number can be extremely volatile from week to week. Economists generally prefer to see a substantial drop in claims for at least three or four weeks in a row before declaring that hiring is increasing.
Robert Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company, said the four-week average of new claims was at 416,000, only a slight improvement from the previous four-week average of 423,000.
"It's still indicative of a labor market that's anything but buoyant," he said. "Employers are hiring reluctantly and still looking for ways to shave costs."
Still, the 400,000 level of early September is far better than the peaks of spring, when more than 500,000 people a week were filing claims.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Getting the Benefit Of Military Cuts

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE primary economic benefit to the United States of the collapse of the Soviet empire is, potentially, the opportunity to make deep cuts in military spending and use the savings to eliminate the budget deficit, tackle domestic problems, or some combination of both.
Of total American military spending, about 60 percent has gone to block the Soviet threat to Western Europe and deter Soviet nuclear attack. Yet military spending is still running close to $300 billion, in real terms nearly what it was in 1989, the year the Berlin wall came down and the Warsaw Pact collapsed. 
 And Pentagon plans call for total military spending, including atomic energy and the strategic weapons stockpile, to come down only 22 percent over the next five years. Measured in constant 1992 dollars to eliminate effects of inflation, military spending is projected to decline from $295.2 billion in the 1992 fiscal year to $252.5 billion in 1996. Pentagon planners call this plan their irreducible minimum and say further cuts would jeopardize national security.
But a new study for the Brookings Institution, "The Post-Cold War Defense Program," by William W. Kaufmann of Harvard and John D. Steinbruner, director of foreign policy studies at Brookings, contends that much deeper cuts in military spending could be made over the next decade without weakening national security -- and with important economic gains. The test of the United States as a superpower, they say, "will be whether it can now arrive at a more realistic balance between its military and economic power."
Their "low option" plan for cutting the military budget calls for spending of $2.2 trillion over the next 10 years, compared with $2.5 trillion in Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's plan. But the Kaufmann-Steinbruner study maintains that the Cheney projections are too low, because they do not take into account real increases that will be required starting in 1997 for next-generation weapons procurement planned by the Pentagon. Allowing for such additional costs, the authors project the Pentagon's spending plans to reach a total of $2.8 trillion over the next 10 years, or $620 billion more than their low option plan.
That plan would achieve its savings by scaling back both nuclear and conventional weapons. In the nuclear area that would include reconfiguring the B-1B bomber from a penetrating bomber to a less expensive cruise missile launcher; terminating the B-2 bomber program at 15 aircraft; deferring deployment of the small intercontinental ballistic missile, and reorienting the Strategic Defense Initiative to a research effort.
For nonnuclear forces, the low option plan calls for continued upgrading of current combat aircraft, while delaying production of next-generation successors; postponing a range of capabilities aimed at enhancing the Army's ability to contain a Soviet attack; extending the life of the C-141 airlift aircraft and terminating the C-17A, and canceling the SSN-21 attack submarine and procurement funds for two new aircraft carriers.
Despite these cuts, the plan would enable the United States to respond in the same way it did in the Persian Gulf war, except that four carrier battle groups would be used, instead of the six stationed in the Persian Gulf.
Deeper cuts in military spending could be achieved, the study said, by adopting a "cooperative security" arrangement in which the leading military establishments, including the Soviet Union's, would be organized to prevent aggressive actions anywhere in the world. International regulations would guide the movement of forces, concentration of tactical aircraft and the nature of research activities. This arrangement would impose not only new global responsibilities on America's allies but also "a meaningful shift in the assumptions used to guide investment in U.S. forces."
Cooperative security, by relying more on other nations' forces and slowing down reaction times, could bring total United States military spending down to $2 trillion over the next 10 years, helping to save a total of $800 billion.
By the year 2001, American military spending would be less than half its current level. The huge cut would reduce the drain on national savings, stimulate capital formation and economic growth, create more jobs and provide resources to meet other critical national needs.
But the cooperative approach would demand exceptionally committed leadership, here and abroad. It would require countries like Germany and Japan to increase their global responsibilities. And it would require the United States to accept restraints on its freedom to take unilateral actions. For the United States to accept such restraints would be, the authors say, "internally very difficult," but they insist that "international events mandate a serious effort to make this transformation and are likely to compel the United States to debate it as a viable security option."
President Bush's effort this week to force Saddam Hussein to comply with United Nations resolutions shows how hard it would be for the United States to accept collective restraints on its freedom of action -- and how important it is to be perceived as acting in the common interest of peace-seeking countries. The big military savings and economic gains will demand political vision and large concepts of what is involved in creating a new world order.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Narrowly Mixed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were narrowly mixed, and interest rates were little changed again yesterday. Market participants sold securities for a time after the Government reported that the merchandise trade deficit rose sharply in July and that initial unemployment claims fell slightly in the week ended Sept. 7.
The effects of the reports were not long-lived, however, and buyers emerged at the lower price levels. 
 Traders said that most of the activity was being conducted by Wall Street professsionals.
"Over all, I don't think the true investment community is doing anything, and won't be shaken out of the market until or unless the economic numbers start painting a much different picture," one government securities trader said. "The gyrations we are seeing right now are merely a function of dealers either being too long, or being too short."
Another set of generally weak money supply statistics also failed to provoke much of a reaction.
Late yesterday the Federal Reserve reported that two of the three measures of the nation's money supply fell during the week ended Sept. 9.
M-2, the monetary aggregate the Fed tracks most closely, rose by $2.6 billion during the week.
Before the announcement, Wall Street analysts had been expecting that all three aggregates would show large increases.
For example, most economists had projected that M-2, which fell very sharply in the week ended Sept. 2, would rise by more than $6 billion.
 
30-Year Bond Offering
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 102 14/32, up 3/32, to yield 7.91 percent, compared with 7.92 percent late Wednesday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 7/8 in late trading, down 1/ 32, to yield 7.60 percent. And the 6 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 3/8, unchanged on the day, to yield 6.16 percent.
In the secondary market for short-term Treasury bills, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.18 percent late yesterday, up two basis points, or two one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 5.23 percent.
The Treasury held its monthly auction of new one-year bills yesterday.
Bids at the auction produced an average yield of 5.57 percent on the new bills, up from the average rate of 5.36 percent at the one-year bill sale a month ago.
Companies continued to take advantage of the current low and stable interest rate environment by offering new debt issues.
Among the issues priced yesterday was a $350 million offering of 10-year guaranteed bonds for the Victorian Public Authorities Finance Agency, the financing arm of Australia's state of Victoria.
The 8.45 percent securities were priced at $99.933, to yield 8.46 percent, 86 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager for the offering. The securities are rated AA-2 by Moody's Investors Service and AA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The size of the offering could expand, because immediately following the pricing Victoria announced it was making a tender/exchange offer for a total of $350 million bonds maturing in 1998 and 1999.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, the Phillips Petroleum Company offered $300 million worth of 30-year debentures at competitive bid.
A bid from a group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company won the securities, which were reoffered to investors with a coupon of 9.18 percent, and were priced at $100, or par, 1.24 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds at the time of pricing.
The securities, which are noncallable for 10 years, are rated Baa-1 by Moody's and BBB by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, dealers said that prices of most issues rose by about 1/8 point in active trading.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt bonds said that prices of most widely quoted municipal issues were little changed at the end of a fairly quiet session.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of one-year Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Widened During July

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 19

 BODY:
The nation's foreign-trade deficit widened sharply to $5.9 billion in July as soaring imports overwhelmed a modest rise in exports, the Commerce Department reported today.
The sudden deterioration, which followed a June deficit that was the lowest in eight years, was generally anticipated by analysts, many of whom cautioned strongly against interpreting the $2.4 billion jump in imports as a sign of current economic strength that reflected a pickup in consumer demand. 
 "We're seeing very weak consumer spending," said Richard D. C. Trainer, chief market economist at the Bank of Tokyo. He noted that the trade figures covered July and that data already out for August had shown weakness in retail sales and other aspects of the economy.
But while there was considerable agreement on these points, analysts differed as to what the import surge did represent and whether they should be encouraged or discouraged by the $300 million rise in exports in July.
Michael P. Niemira, an economist at Mitsubishi Bank, dismissed the import rise, saying it mainly reflected relatively late shipments of Christmas-season merchandise to cautious importers who had been hesitant about building up their holiday inventories. Others said it might reflect optimism by businesses stocking up for what they hope will be a buoyant post-recession holiday season.
 
Growth Estimate Is Trimmed
 Elliott Platt, a senior analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, took a decidedly dim view of today's figures, contending that they implied that the recovery from recession was "off to a slower start than we had thought." He said he was trimming his estimate of third-quarter growth in gross national product to a 1 percent annual pace, from 1.5 percent.
"These numbers seem to suggest that trade will be a drag on the economy in the current quarter" because more of the nation's demand for goods was met by foreign suppliers and less by domestic ones, he said.
But Willard A. Workman of the United States Chamber of Commerce, expressing a minority view, said the big advance in imports of consumer goods and automobiles "suggests there may be some easing of American consumers' concerns about the U.S. recession" and that higher imports of capital goods reflect plans by industry to make investments.
 
Exports Called 'Static'
 Still, Mr. Workman was downbeat about July exports, which he called "relatively static" because of generally sluggish global economic activity.
Mr. Trainer also called exports "somewhat disappointing" even though they rose to their third-highest level on record. But Mr. Niemira said he was encouraged that exports did not decline as he had thought they would.
Imports totaled $41.2 billion, up 6.2 percent from $38.8 billion in June, with consumer goods rising $1.1 billion, and the categories of motor vehicles, parts and engines, and capital goods each rising $600 million. New cars from Japan edged up only slightly, but the overall American deficit with Japan surged to $3.8 billion, from $3.2 billion in June and $2.4 billion in May.
Exports were $35.3 billion, up eight-tenths of 1 percent from June's $35 billion, with the biggest increase a $400 million gain in industrial supplies and materials and the biggest decline a $700 million loss in capital goods.
The Commerce Department revised the June data to show a trade deficit of just $3.8 billion, $200 million better than the initially reported deficit, which had been the lowest since June 1983.
The $1.7 billion June surplus that the United States enjoyed with Western Europe dwindled to almost nothing in July, while deficits increased with China (to $1.3 billion, from $1 billion), with Taiwan (to $900 million, from $700 million), with Canada (to $500 million, from $400 million) and with Hong Kong (to $300 million, from $100 million).
The surplus with Mexico rose to $400 million, from $300 million, and remained unchanged with the Soviet Union, at $100 million.
 
Oil Imports Drop
 Reflecting a decline of four million barrels and an average price drop of 31 cents a barrel, the nation's bill for imported oil edged down to $2.9 billion, about half the total deficit, from $3.1 billion in June.
In advanced technology products, the American surplus was $2.2 billion, compared with $3.6 billion in June, the report also showed.
Without seasonal adjustment, the overall July deficit was $7.7 billion, double the $3.9 billion recorded for June. On a seasonally adjusted constant-dollar basis, the deficit swelled to $5.8 billion, from $3.7 billion. Using a three-month moving average, the deficit in current dollars rose to $4.8 billion, from $4.4 billion.

HEADLINE: A Fuel-Efficient Grab for Power

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 19

 BODY:
About 18 years ago, the Honda Motor Company got a lot of attention when it displayed its Civic, which had an unusual, fuel-efficient engine that satisfied pollution concerns.
In two weeks, Honda will introduce a Civic model whose engine could have a big impact on a current debate: whether fuel-efficient cars need come only in small packages. 
 The 1992 Civic VX, which can comfortably seat up to five people, is equipped with a four-cylinder engine that Honda expects to get a Government fuel-efficiency rating of 55 miles a gallon on the highway and 48 miles a gallon in the city. That would compare with the rating for the Geo Metro, among the most fuel-efficient cars sold today, and other mini-cars that seat only two people comfortably and accelerate relatively slowly.
But perhaps most important, Civic's VTEC-E engine with 94 horsepower is more powerful than the power plants found in many comparably sized cars.
The new Honda Civic, which is expected to be priced at about $10,000, means that Honda engineers may have accomplished what Detroit auto makers had long maintained would be difficult or impossible. It has married a highly fuel-efficient engine with a relatively roomy car that performs suitably for normal everyday use.
Detroit, in fact, is concerned that the fuel-efficient Civic VX may become a powerful weapon in the hands of those who favor stiffer auto fuel-efficiency standards. Within the next few weeks that issue is expected to intensify as Congress begins to debate pending energy legislation.
"The numbers seem to be there, and if the performance is good, this car means that the Japanese have opened a new chapter in the debate, and all the old responses are simply not appropriate," said Leon Mandel, publisher of Autoweek magazine.
"If you are a legislator who's only interested in fuel savings and the environment, then this is going to be a devastatingly persuasive argument," he added.
 
An Improved Lean Burn
 One of the more striking things about the engine is that it does not involve any brand-new technology. Honda used a so-called lean-burn approach that mixes more than the usual amount of air with gasoline. In the past, lean-burn technology has achieved lower fuel consumption. But the engines have also provided less pep because the engineers have found it difficult to stabilize combustion and precisely control the mix of air and gas.
Honda appears to have overcome these problems with the lean-burn VTEC-E by incorporating sophisticated control mechanisms developed in Honda's Formula One race-car engine. The mechanisms open and close piston valves with a high degree of accuracy and variability, providing better pickup at low engine speeds and more horsepower over all. The name VTEC-E is an acronym of Variable valve-Timing and lift Electronic Control system-Economy.
The Civic DX with the VTEC-E engine will be built exclusively in Japan and will begin appearing in American showrooms in October. Other Civic models will continue to be built in Honda plants in Alliston, Ontario, and Marysville, Ohio.
The new car is larger than the subcompact Civic it replaces -- almost large enough to be classified as a compact and roughly equivalent in size to the Toyota Tercel or Chevy Cavalier. Early reports from auto magazines judge the Civic peppy, comfortable and efficient.
But the General Motors Corporation, the domestic auto maker with the most extensive engine-research effort, has been throwing cold water on Honda's new vehicle ever since the engine was announced in late July. G.M. engineers contend that the engine does not represent a big technological breakthrough, and G.M.'s Washington lobbyists do not want their adversaries in the fuel-efficiency debate using it as a rationale for tougher Federal corporate average fuel efficiency, or CAFE, standards.
Honda does not want stiffer fuel-efficiency rules any more than domestic auto makers. But if the standard is raised from the current 27.5-miles-a-gallon fleet average that each auto maker is required to meet, Honda wants to avoid one of the pending Congressional proposals: a national fleet average that would be set a standard for the industry as a whole, with each manufacturer required to improve by the same percentage over current levels. G.M. and Honda, for example, might both be required to make their fleets, say, 10 percent more fuel efficient.
Honda sees such a system as punishing the most fuel-efficient manufacturers, because the percentage approach would mean that the auto maker with the highest current miles-a-gallon average would have to make the greatest mileage improvement. "The percentage approach punishes the one who does the most in fuel efficiency," said a Honda spokesman.
Domestic auto makers oppose stiffer fuel-efficiency standards, too. But if the standard is to be raised, they say a percentage increase is preferable; their fuel-efficiency averages tend to be lower because they are full-line producers of large and small cars.
A G.M. spokesman said the company's engineers had studied and become quite familiar with lean-burn technology, but he said it could only be used on very small engines. Moreover, lean-burn engines emit abnormally high amounts of pollution from oxides of nitrogen, making the engine too dirty for new, stricter clean-air standards.
Indeed, Honda cannot sell the high-efficiency Civic VX in California, where current clean-air rules are most stringent. Instead, Honda will sell a Civic VX in that state with less fuel-efficient engines. Elsewhere, Honda will sell the VTEC-E as well as alternate engine types. Honda engineers, meanwhile, are continuing work on a new catalytic converter that might solve the engine's pollution problem, a spokesman said.
 
The Bryan Proposal
 Senator Richard Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, has proposed raising the industrywide fleet average to 40 miles a gallon from the current company-by-company target of 27.5 miles a gallon. The new level, to be achieved through the percentage-increase method, would be required by the year 2001. Senator Bryan's supporters are expected to cite the VTEC-E as proof that technology can still bring great improvements in fuel efficiency.
Dan Becker, a lawyer for the Sierra Club, an environmental lobbying group, said the VTEC-E and other recent announcements of fuel-saving technologies -- like a new type of engine camshaft developed at Clemson University -- "blow the credibility of the U.S. auto industry out of the water."
American auto makers have long argued that the only way they can meet the most extreme fuel-efficiency proposals currently before Congress is by making tiny, slow cars that are unsafe in crashes because of their smaller mass. But other legislators, armed with claims by scientists and environmentalists, have argued that the automotive industry is simply dragging its feet on engine development.
Honda's latest Civic, the fifth generation of the car since the first version appeared in 1973, stirs memories in Detroit and Washington of the first Civic's CVCC engine. The CVCC was the first engine to meet Federal emission standards without a catalytic converter, a startling development in an era when the Big Three were bemoaning the expense and difficulty of catalytic-converter technology, and environmentalists were pressing for stiffer emission standards.
The Civic, moreover, was the most fuel-efficient car on the road during the nation's initial panic over gasoline availability, during the 1973-74 Arab oil boycott. In its own way, the 1992 Civic VX three-door hatchback could prove as ground-breaking as the first Civic.
 
An Evolving Philosophy
 Honda's business philosophy has changed slightly over the last year with the promotion of Nobuhiko Kawamoto to president and chief executive. Mr. Kawamoto, a former racing engineer who was once head of research at Honda, has been preaching the need to make the company's vehicles ever more responsive to such growing environmental concernss as energy depletion, air quality and recycling, said Shigeaki Kato, a Detroit-based Honda spokesman.
Although the VTEC-E engine has limitations, in that it will be available in only one car model and cannot be sold in the state with the most auto buyers, Mr. Kato said Honda was nevertheless intent on introducing it. The company, he said, wants to gauge customers' reaction and demonstrate that the auto maker's environmental concerns are genuine, not merely a response to looming legislation.
Mr. Kawamoto was to have delivered a speech in August that was canceled after the death of the company's founder, Soichiro Honda. The text sought to convey the company's sense of its mission. "We must focus our attention," it read, "on the balance between what seem to be the opposite needs of reducing emissions and improving fuel efficiency while providing performance characteristics that improve the overall driving experience."

BYLINE: THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Friday, Sept. 20

 BODY:
Palestinians suddenly softened their stand today after indicating Thursday that they could not yet agree to accept Washington's invitation to a proposed peace conference because the Bush Administration was unwilling to meet some of their minimum political demands.
In a surprise reversal early today, West Bank Palestinian leaders suddenly decided to resume talks with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d about their terms for the conference and sent one of their senior negotiators, Hanan Ashrawi, to Amman for talks with Mr. Baker. 
 Palestinian officials said Thursday that they were still seeking assurances from the United States that their right to "self-determination" will be guaranteed before they go to the conference. They also wanted assurances that during any period of autonomy for Palestinians on the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip they, rather than the Israelis, would have control over basic resources, and that the United States would support an interpretation of United Nations resolutions that would enjoin Israel to trade land for peace. While Mr. Baker is willing to give Palestinians general assurances consistent with previous American policies, they do not go far enough in any of these key areas to satisfy the Palestinians.
In a joint news conference in Amman Thursday, Secretary Baker and King Hussein of Jordan implored the Palestinians not to miss the opportunity to attend this peace conference, tentatively scheduled to begin next month. Mr. Baker vaguely hinted that if the Palestinians did not agree soon to attend on the terms being offered by Washington, the conference might have to start without them -- although that was not what the United States wanted.
It was the first public indication from the Secretary of State that he is having difficulties enticing the Palestinians to the talks, having already won the conditional support of Syria, Jordan and Israel.
Addressing the Palestinians, Mr. Baker said: "I believe that this is the best opportunity that has presented itself for a long, long time, and I also think that it is going to be a long, long time before the bus ever comes by again. And if this opportunity is missed, in my opinion, Palestinians have perhaps the most to lose, because Palestinians have perhaps the most to gain from taking advantage of this opportunity."
King Hussein, for his part, said: "Time is short. This opportunity may not come again -- ever."
On Monday, the Palestinian representatives from the West Bank and Gaza Strip met with Mr. Baker in Jerusalem to discuss a draft letter of assurances that the Secretary was prepared to give them regarding Washington's position on the conference and what the Palestinians could expect.
The Jerusalem talks, however, were inconclusive, and Mr. Baker suggested that they meet again while he was still in the area. The Secretary suggested the Palestinian representatives come to Amman during his stopover here.
Upon Mr. Baker's departure from Jerusalem on Monday, a senior American official told reporters that it would be "a real test of Palestinian intentions" toward the peace talks if they showed up in Amman Thursday. American officials were clearly disappointed not to find them here.
Palestine Liberation Organization officials said Chairman Yasir Arafat ordered the three Palestinians who have been negotiating with Mr. Baker during his stopovers in Jerusalem not to meet with him in Amman, because Mr. Baker had refused in his meeting with Palestinians on Monday to give them the assurances they had been seeking about the outcome of the peace conference.
Arab diplomats say there is another issue as well. If Mr. Arafat is going to sanction non-P.L.O. Palestinians to take part in a peace conference, he wants to be compensated with an end to the political and economic boycott of the P.L.O. that has been mounted by Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf Arabs since Mr. Arafat came out in support of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
However, at 2:30 this morning, Jordanian officials contacted Mr. Baker and told him they had been informed that Miss Ashrawi was ready to come from her home in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank to meet him in Amman for further discussions. This move was apparently ordered by Mr. Arafat after heavy pressure from Arab governments who have been telling the P.L.O. that they will never have an American Administration more sympathetic to their cause and should not alienate Washington.
American officials are hoping that Miss Ashrawi will also use her visit to Amman to begin talks with Jordanian officials on forming a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation to the peace conference. Such an alliance could expedite the convening of the talks.
 
Syria Is 'Eager'
 American officials say that Syria is "eager" for the conference to begin and may well be ready to go to talks with Israel, even without the Palestinians. At a news conference in Damascus on Wednesday the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, pointedly refused to rule this out. The participation of Jordan, however, where the majority of the population is of Palestinian origin, is much more uncertain.
King Hussein would find it very difficult to attend without a joint Palestinian delegation approved by the P.L.O.
According to a senior P.L.O. official, Mr. Arafat does not believe that Syria or Jordan would dare sit down with Israel, without Palestinians in attendance.
Mr. Baker has negotiated with the Palestinians through Faisal al-Husseini and Zakaria al-Agha, as well as Miss Ashrawi. They, in turn, took their instructions from the P.L.O. in Tunis.
During the seven meetings Mr. Baker has held with the Palestinians in Jerusalem, they have raised several points that they wanted to be assured of before they attended the conference. Since the United States is refusing to let the Palestinians be represented at the talks by the P.L.O., it has been very important for the three local leaders to try to extract from Washington certain symbolic assurances that would compensate for the fact that their preferred representative would be barred from the negotiations as a concession to Israel.
Mr. Baker is now in the process of distributing similar assurances to Syria, Israel and Jordan -- the other key participants.
"The truth is," said a senior Administration official involved in the talks with the Palestinians, "after they lay out their symbolic demands, they have been quite reasonable. They would like to come. But nothing ever gets nailed down with them. We think they have given in on a point and then two meetings later it gets raised again. No one knows what is settled and what isn't with them. Everybody is getting a little bit impatient."

HEADLINE: 2,500 Connecticut Workers Are First Round of Layoffs

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 19

 BODY:
Layoff notices went out to about 2,500 state workers today, the first wave in what could rise to 8,000 dismissals as Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and labor unions battle over an unraveled package of concessions linked to the state's new income tax.
The layoffs, and the threat hanging over every state agency that more could come soon, have made the pain long promised by Connecticut's budget troubles suddenly and uncomfortably real. 
 Earlier this week Mr. Weicker accused the union members, who were his allies in lobbying for the wage tax, of reneging on a $346 million package of wage and benefit concessions. Union leaders in turn said the administration was looking to force the layoffs to convince disgruntled residents that the tax would be accompanied by significants cuts in state spending.
Both sides repeated their arguments today, with Mr. Weicker saying concession talks must produce "real savings" and labor leaders saying that the state wants blood for blood's sake. After eight hours of talks, the Governor's representative described the two sides as "very far apart."
And workers like Patty Constantine, a clerk in the Department of Environmental Protection's accounting division, found themselves in the middle.
 
Bumping and Confusion
 "I'll just be on the unemployment line," said Ms. Constantine, a 40-year-old single mother who got her pink slip this morning.
Mr. Weicker has said that 5,500 more layoffs could be necessary if unions do not agree to givebacks, including giving up a raise already being received by nearly half the workers. And the prospect of even more pink slips rose today when Republican leaders in the General Assembly announced a drive to repeal the income tax.
Their proposed replacement budget, though not fully drafted and considered a longshot by many legislators, would include much deeper cuts in state spending than any previously proposed budget -- and would cause, they conceded, more layoffs.
The pink slip received by Ms. Constantine is the first step in a prolonged process. Most state worker get four to six weeks between notice and removal from the job, depending on the terms of their union contracts. And many who were given notice today will not lose their jobs because their seniority will allow them to "bump" someone with less seniority onto the layoff list.
Because many people now on the layoff list will bump their way off it, the impact on state services and even the final number of dismissed workers won't be known for several weeks.
"We don't know how far this is going to go," said Ann Overby, a senior clerk at the Department of Consumer Protection who got her notice today. Ms. Overby has been in the Department for 14 years and has already decided to use her right to bump. "We may get in a position where I'm out the door also."
Ms. Constantine said, "I'm just going to hold on to a little faith that like the last time it won't come to fruition -- hope springs eternal."
Department administrators and agency commissioners said the layoffs would not go unnoticed by residents using state services. At the Department of Motor Vehicles, an agency that many residents deal with, 295 people got notices, about 8 percent of the 3,900 member work force.
 
Thinking of Snow
 In other departments, the losses were even greater. At highway maintenance office, for instance, 230 people got notices, or about 11 percent of the 2,000-member staff. Transportation Commissioner Emil H. Frankel said that snow removal would take longer if those layoffs go through: Secondary roads in rural areas would probably have to wait 24 to 48 hours for a snowplow while resources were concentrated on main roads.
At the Department of Consumer Protection, where 20 out of a total of 174 workers received notices, Commissioner Gloria Schaffer said that the measuring scales on home heating oil trucks, commercial bakers and retail food markets would get far fewer spot inspections than they do now.
As employees gathered to commiserate, there were scenes of compassion. At the Department of Public Works' public safety division, where two officers out of 15 got notices today, one stepped forward to take voluntary retirement to open up a job.
 
'Try Not to Think'
 "I've been there, I know what it is to be laid off," said Officer Michael Dellaripa, 70 years old and a state employee for 18 years.
But his decision probably won't help Jose M. Agosto, a fellow officer who got his pink slip this morning. Mr. Agosto, who is 35, has about three months less seniority than the other laid-off officer and will thus be second in a line of two to fill Mr. Dellaripa's old spot. "You try not to think about it," Mr. Agosto said.
Some people can't help thinking about it. Lori St. Amand, a 28-year-old communications officer at the Department of Environmental Protection, did not get a notice but expects to get laid off anyway -- she bumped someone of the layoff list last time, and now there are only three people in her job class with less seniority.
Ms. St. Amand and her husband are applying for a mortgage to buy a house in Berlin, and are meeting this week with bank officers.
"It's worse having been through it once before," she said. "Do you continue with the plans you've made and hope for the best, or -- well, what else can you do?"
Negotiatons about 6:30 P.M., with no plans to meet again until next Monday. "We are very far apart on some very key issues, including wages and job security," said Saranne P. Murray, the state's chief negotiator.
"My members are saying, 'Don't give in,' " said Steven Perruccio, president of the 7,000-member Connecticut Employees Union Independent.

HEADLINE: THE GATES HEARINGS;
Text of Gates's 1984 Memo to Casey On 'Straight Talk' About Nicaragua

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 19

 BODY:
The following is the text of a memorandum from Robert M. Gates, then the C.I.A.'s deputy director for intelligence, to William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, made public today by Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio. It was dated Dec. 14, 1984.
1. It is time to talk absolutely straight about Nicaragua. To recap where we are: 
 -- Based on all the assessments we have done, the contras, even with American support, cannot overthrow the Sandinista regime. Whatever small change they had to do that has been further diminished by the new weaponry being provided by the Soviets and Cubans.
-- The Soviets and Cubans are turning Nicaragua into an armed camp with military forces far beyond its defensive needs and in a position to intimidate and coerce its neighbors.
-- The Nicaraguan regime is steadily moving toward consolidation of a Marxist-Leninist government and the establishment of a permanent and well armed ally of the Soviet Union and Cuba on the mainland of the Western Hemisphere. Its avowed aim is to spread further revolution in the Americas.
-- The FDN [Nicaraguan Democratic Force, the main contra organization] has been denied American assistance. Without further assistance by February, all the information we have suggests the contras are going to begin heading into Honduras. The Hondurans will then be faced with some 12,500 armed fighters (whom the Hondurans see as closely allied with Alvarez [General Gustavo Alvarez Martinez, the chief of the Honduran armed forces], thereby potentially unsettling Honduras itself).
-- Flight of the contras into Honduras will be followed not only by their families but presumably by a second wave of refugees and others who, seeking abandonment of American efforts to force the Sandinistas to alter their regime, will see the handwriting on the wall, determine that their personal futures are in peril and leave the country. It is altogether conceivable that we could be looking at an initial refugee wave from Nicaragua over the first year of 150,000 to 200,000 people (the [illegible ] the contras alone could account for 50,000).
-- Failure of the United States to provide further assistance to the resistance and collapse of the contra movement would force Honduras to accommodate to the Nicaraguan regime. One result of this would be the complete reopening of the channels of arms support to the Salvadoran insurgency, thereby reversing the progress made in recent months.
-- These unsettled political and military circumstances in Central America would undoubtedly result in renewed capital flight from Honduras and Guatemala and result in both new hardship and political instability throughout the region.
2. These are strong assertions but our research as well as the reports of our people on the spot (for example our COS [chief of station] in Honduras) make it possible to substantiate each of the above points.
3. What is happening in Central America in many ways vividly calls to mind the old saw that those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it.
-- In 1958-60 we thought that we could reach some sort of an accommodation with Castro that would encourage him to build a pluralistic government in Cuba. We have been trying to do the same thing with the Nicaraguans, with the same success.
-- In Vietnam, our strategy consisted of a series of measures applied very gradually and over a long period of time. With each step of new U.S. involvement the gradual approach enabled the enemy to adjust to each new turn of the screw so that by the end of the war, even in the face of the most severe bombing, the Vietnamese had developed enormous tolerance. Half measures, half-heartedly applied, will have the same result in Nicaragua.
-- In 1975, the United States President announced that American assistance to UNITA in Angola was in the national interest of the United States and strongly urged the Congress to support military assistance to that group. The Congress turned it down, thereby not only proving that the United States would not involve itself in any significant way in the third world to combat Soviet subversion and activity but, moreover, that the Congress could effectively block any moves the President did wish to make. The Boland Amendment and the cutoff of aid to the contras is having the same effect again, showing the Soviets and our third world friends how little has changed in nine years, even with a President like Ronald Reagan.
In a variety of places, including Vietnam, negotiations in effect became a cover for the consolidation and further expansion of Communist control. While they might observe whatever arrangements were reached for the first weeks or as long as American attention (particularly media attention) was focused on the situation, they knew they could outlast our attention span. Usually within a relatively short period of time they were openly violating whatever agreements had been achieved.
4. The truth of the matter is that our policy has been to muddle along in Nicaragua with an essentially half-hearted policy substantially because there is no agreement within the Administration or with the Congress on our real objectives. We started out justifying the program on the basis of curtailing the flow of weapons to El Salvador. Laudable though that objective might have been, it was attacking a symptom of a larger problem in Central America and not the problem itself.
3. It seems to me that the only way that we can prevent disaster in Central America is to acknowledge openly what some have argued privately: that the existence of a Marxist-Leninist regime in Nicaragua closely allied with the Soviet Union and Cuba is unacceptable to the United States and that the United States will do everything in its power short of invasion to put that regime out. Hopes of causing the regime to reform itself for a more pluralistic government are essentially silly and hopeless. Moreover, few believe that all those weapons and the more to come are only for defense purposes. Only when we acknowledge what the objective is in Central America can we begin to have any kind of rational discussion on how to achieve it. As long as one maintains the fig leaf of curtailing the flow of arms to El Salvador, all other efforts can easily be politically dismissed.
6. Once you accept that ridding the continent of this regime is important to our national interest and must be our primary objective, the issue then becomes a stark one. You either acknowledge that you are willing to take all necessary measures (short of military invasion) to bring down that regime or you admit that you do not have the will to do anything about the problem and you make the best deal you can. Casting aside all fictions, it is the latter course we are on. Even new funding for the contras, particularly in light of the new Soviet weaponry, is an inadequate answer to this problem. The contras will be able to sustain an insurgency for a time but the cost and the pain will become very high and the resistance eventually will wither. Any negotiated agreement simply will offer a cover for the consolidation of the regime and two or three years from now we will be in considerably worse shape than we are now.
7. The alternative to our present policy -- which I predict ultimately and inevitably is leading to the consolidation of the Nicaraguan regime and our facing a second Cuba in Central America -- is overtly to try to bring down the regime. This involves a mustering of political force and will, first of all within the Administration and second with the Congress, that we have not seen on any foreign policy issue (apart from our defense rearmament) in many years. It seems to me that this effort would draw upon the following measures:
-- Withdrawal of diplomatic recognition of the regime in Managua and the recognition of a government in exile.
-- Overt provision to the government in exile of military assistance, funds, propaganda support and so forth including major efforts to gain additional support in international community, including real pressure.
-- Economic sanctions against Nicaragua, perhaps even including a quarantine. These sanctions would affect both exports and imports and would be combined with internal measures by the resistance to maximize the economic dislocation to the regime.
-- Politically most difficult of all, the use of air strikes to destroy a considerable portion of Nicaragua's military buildup (focusing particularly on the tanks and the helicopters). This would be accompanied by an announcement that the United States did not intend to invade Nicaragua but that no more arms deliveries of such weapons would be permitted.
8. These are hard measures. They probably are politically unacceptable. But it is time to stop fooling ourselves about what is going to happen in Central America. Putting our heads in the sand will not prevent the events that I outlined at the beginning of this note. Can the United States stand a second Cuba in the Western Hemisphere? One need only look at the difficulty that Cuba has caused this country over the past 25 years to answer that question.
9. The fact is that the Western Hemisphere is the sphere of influence of the United States. If we have decided totally to abandon the Monroe Doctrine, if in the 1980's taking strong actions to protect our interests despite the half of criticism is too difficult, then we ought to save political capital in Washington, acknowledge our helplessness and stop wasting everybody's time.
10. Without a comprehensive campaign openly aimed at bringing down the regime, at best we somewhat delay the inevitable. Without U.S. funding for the contras, the resistance essentially will collapse over the next year or two. While seeking funding from other countries to the contras could help for a time, it is essential to recognize that almost as important as the money is the fact of the United States support both from an economic and political standpoint. Somehow, knowing that Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore are behind you does not carry the same weight. Economic sanctions surely would have a significant impact in the initial months, but unless accompanied by a broad range of other actions this impact will diminish over time and we will find ourselves with a Nicaragua even more closely attached to the Soviet Union and Cuba than we have now.
11. All this may be politically out of the question. Probably. But all the cards ought to be on the table and people should understand the consequences of what we do and do not do in Nicaragua. Half measures will not even produce half successes. The course we have been on (even before the funding cut-off) -- as the last two years suggest -- will result in further strengthening of the regime and a Communist Nicaragua which, allied with its Soviet and Cuban friends, will serve as the engine for the destabilization of Central America. Even a well funded contra movement cannot prevent this; indeed, relying on and supporting the contras as our only action may actually hasten the ultimate, unfortunate outcome. -- ROBERT M. GATES

HEADLINE: Higher Food Aid Would Tax Soviet System of Distribution

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
American experts said yesterday that Moscow's doubling of its request for food aid to $14.7 billion for the coming year would, if granted, be a greater challenge to the Soviet Union's ability to distribute the food than the West's ability to supply it.
Last year, the Soviet Union's total food imports were $9.8 billion. About half of the total was imports of grain like wheat and corn, with the remainder being meat, soybeans, dairy products and other foodstuffs. In the past, Moscow has paid for these imports mainly from the hard currency it earns by exporting commodities like oil and gold, and by borrowing from Western banks. 
 Yet with oil and grain production down and Western banks reducing their loans to the troubled Soviet economy, Moscow is being forced to ask the West to help it meet its needs for food and fodder for livestock.
But American experts contend that even if the West agrees to a massive dose of food aid, it might not help people in the Soviet Union much.
 
Problems of Distribution
 "The problem isn't so much shortages as pricing and distribution problems," said Keith Crane, a senior economist at PlanEcon, a Washington-based consulting firm.
For example, Mr. Crane noted that the price of agricultural commodities sold by private cooperatives in the Soviet Union is 18 times the prices offered by the state. Consequently, farmers in the republics are holding onto their crops rather than sell them to a central Government whose authority in economic as well as political matters is widely questioned.
The distribution difficulties were stressed in a speech Wednesday night by Frans Andriessen, the European Community commissioner for external affairs. He cited the great difficulties in organizing the distribution of even the $300 million in food aid agreed to by the Community last December, noting that most of that has not yet been distributed.
Commodity markets in the United States showed little reaction to the new food request from the Soviet Union. Analysts said that the request was vague and that there was no indication what the Western response might be.
 
Excess Capacity in West
 Moreover, judging from Mr. Luzhkov's explanation of Moscow's request for aid from the Community, it appears that much of the request is for financing and not immediate food that would quickly deplete commodity stockpiles.
And unless there is a huge and unforeseen demand for immediate supplies, the West should have the capacity to meet increased demand for foodstuffs through planting unused farmlands and dipping into stockpiles.
"There's plenty of excess production capacity in grains in the United States," said David Lehman, an economist at the Chicago Board of Trade. "We should be able to easily mmet the demands of the Soviet Union."

HEADLINE: Market Unmoved by Iraqi Export Action

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The world oil market appeared to take little notice of the United Nations' decision yesterday to allow Iraq to resume limited exports, because buyers had been expecting the move for weeks. But experts said Iraq could still cause a price jolt, because President Saddam Hussein might not go along with the conditions tied to the sale or because bureaucratic problems could delay exports.
In the long term, however, a return of Iraqi oil to world markets would tend to push prices lower, and some analysts believe that this United Nations decision, which covers a six-month period, is likely to be the beginning of uninterrupted sales by Iraq.
 
$1 Billion in Parts

 The United Nations said Iraq could export $1.6 billion worth of oil over six months, which at current prices comes to about 500,000 barrels a day. This is a substantial increment on world markets; for example, the combined quotas of all the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is now 22.3 million barrels a day. OPEC is scheduled to meet on Tuesday in Vienna, and the organization may set a new quota based on anticipated demand for oil and production from around the world, including Iraq. 
 Before the war, Iraq's quota was 3.14 million barrels a day, but according to Thomas Blakeslee, an oil expert at Pegasus Econometric Group, of Hoboken, N.J., "they need approximately $1 billion in parts to get production back up to those levels." Mr. Blakeslee said 500,000 barrels a day is the maximum that the country could export now; others put the figure slightly higher.
The exports would be through a pipeline across Turkey, which before the war handled 1.2 million barrels a day, according to Mr. Blakeslee.
Iraq will face problems in re-entering world markets, experts say. "All the other sellers have locked their markets up," said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, in New York. "They're going to have to force their way into the system," he said. Normally an exporter can offer a buyer continuity, he pointed out, but all Iraq can offer is price, so the price will probably be lower than usual.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil promised for delivery next month closed yesterday at $21.76 a barrel, down 8 cents. Before the war, Kirkuk crude, the type that Iraq would be exporting, usually sold for $2.75 to $3 a barrel below the price on the Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: Havana Closes Communist Congress to Outsiders

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 19

 BODY:
Faced with a severe economic and political crisis, Cuba has announced that for the first time in the 32-year leadership of President Fidel Castro the coming congress of the island's ruling Communist Party will be closed to foreign delegations and journalists.
The departure from previous practice, a number of experts on Cuban affairs said, reflects a sense of uncertainty within the Cuban leadership bordering on disorientation after the announcement by the Soviet Union last week that it was withdrawing its troops and ending its economic subsidies to the island. 
 But some of the specialists noted that the decision also reflected a growing view in Cuban society and elements of the party that fundamental changes were needed. They pointed out that in announcing the decision to keep the congress closed to outsiders Cuban officials said they were anxious to allow delegates to express their opinions without inhibition.
"It seems they are intent for the first time in having a serious discussion rather than a simple ratification of the official line," said William LeoGrande, an expert on Cuban affairs at American University in Washington, referring to the congress that begins Oct. 10. "They know they must come out of this with at least a modest program of change."
With vital Soviet aid to Cuba dwindling and endangered and the Communist system that Havana adopted three decades ago in virtual eclipse around the world, Mr. LeoGrande and other experts said the Cuban leadership now faced the daunting task of formulating a persuasive message of hope to a population whose living standards have sharply plummeted over the last two years.
"They have got to come out of this congress with some sort of program that convinces the people that things are somehow going to get better," Mr. LeoGrande said.
Originally scheduled for early this year, the congress, Cuba's fourth since the formal adoption of a socialist, one-party system in 1972, has already been repeatedly delayed as serious shortages of most foods and consumer goods have worsened and events abroad have propelled Cuba further into isolation.
At preparatory meetings with grass-roots members last year, Cuban officials privately acknowledge, harsh criticism of everything from the country's leaders and system of government to restricted personal freedoms and growing material hardships was voiced by many participants. As the complaints grew more numerous and louder, the local meetings were quietly canceled.
But as signs of discontent among Cubans have continued to grow in recent months, the 65-year-old Mr. Castro has delivered increasingly stern warnings both to would-be reformers and dissidents against attempts to bring about fundamental changes in Cuba's tightly controlled political system. Particularly strong language has been used to condemn market economics and multiparty pluralism.
Nonetheless, experts here who closely monitor Cuban developments say that despite these warnings there have been signs that Cuba's dire economic situation is forcing consideration of a number of innovations, among them the limited reintroduction of private enterprise in the agriculture and service sectors.

HEADLINE: U.N. PERMITS IRAQ LIMITED OIL SALES FOR CIVILIAN NEEDS

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 19

 BODY:
In the most significant easing of its Gulf war trade embargo so far, the Security Council authorized Iraq today to sell $1.6 billion worth of oil over the next six months to buy food and other essential civilian supplies and to compensate victims of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
But the carefully phrased resolution said all the money raised by these oil sales must be paid directly to the United Nations, which will earmark one-third for compensation payments and make sure the rest is spent only on imports approved by the Security Council. [Excerpts from the resolution, page A10.] 
 The decision followed a report on Iraq's humanitarian needs, which was prepared by an expert team that visited the country under the direction of Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the United Nations official in charge of humanitarian affairs in the Persian Gulf. The report said the country faced "critical" shortages of food, medicine and other supplies as a result of the embargo and recommended that Baghdad be allowed to sell $2.5 billion worth of oil to buy them.
 
'An Affront to Sovereignty'
 It is not clear whether Iraq, which sees the new resolution as an affront to its sovereignty, will agree to sell any oil under the strict terms the Council is imposing.
Iraq's United Nations representative, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, told the Council the new resolution confronts Baghdad with two choices "one more bitter than the other."
Either the country refuses to pump any oil and continues to endure the privations of the Council's trade embargo, he said, or else it abandons "sovereignty" over its natural resources in return for what he called "a limited respite."
The decision on oil sales came as the Security Council continued to wait for Iraq to say whether it would allow the United Nations inspectors searching for Iraqi arms to use helicopters in their quest or whether it would refuse, risking a new armed confrontation with the United States and its allies.
The United States has warned that it may send armed helicopters and warplanes to escort the inspectors unless Baghdad guarantees them safe passage anywhere inside Iraq.
The new Council resolution was adopted with 13 members in favor, Cuba opposed and Yemen abstaining. The measure says the actual oil will be immune from seizure by those with financial claims against Iraq.
It gives Iraq the responsibility for finding buyers for its oil and pumping the supplies from its northern oilfields down a pipeline through Turkey to the Mediterranean coast. Buyers will pay directly into a special escrow account controlled by the United Nations Secretary General to keep President Saddam Hussein's Government from getting its hands on any of the money.
Iraq may then order from foreign suppliers the food and other essential humanitarian goods it needs. Once these orders have been approved by the Security Council committee overseeing sanctions, the Secretary General will release money to pay for them.
But inspectors appointed by the United Nations will oversee both the pumping and selling of the oil as well as the purchase and distribution of the imported goods to insure that they conform with the Council's terms.
In fact, only about $1 billion worth of oil revenues will be available for humanitarian imports because the other $600 million will be used to start paying compensation to the victims of Iraq's invasion as well as for paying for the cost of finding and destroying its weapons of mass destruction, returning stolen property and demarcating the frontier with Kuwait.
 
'No Quarrel With the People'
 The United States representative, Thomas R. Pickering, said the new resolution showed the international community's "concern for providing Iraqi civilians with humanitarian assistance."
Britain's representative, Sir David Hannay, said the resolution showed the Security Council has "no quarrel with the Iraqi people who have suffered greatly at the hands of their leaders."
Speaking for France, the Council's President, Jean-Bernard Merimee, called on Iraq to accept the payment mechanism and start selling oil as soon as possible in order to meet its humanitarian needs.
Whether Baghdad will do so remains unclear, however. In August Iraqi officials warned Prince Saddruddin that they would never sell their oil if the revenue was all taken away by the United Nations, saying this was an intolerable insult to the country's sovereignty.
And since then Ambassador Anbari has continually denounced the payment mechanism the Council has been designing as unacceptable to Baghdad.
Many diplomats, however, say they believe Iraq will start selling oil in the end, just as it has eventually accepted all the Council's Gulf war resolutions after first denouncing them and refusing to cooperate.
Failure to take up the Council's oil sale offer, they argue, would leave President Hussein personally responsible for his people's privations and rob him of the chance to strengthen his own position by alleviating their suffering.
Nevertheless, many say they believe President Hussein is testing the Council's will to enforce its resolutions, believing that the international community is growing tired of the Gulf crisis and becoming distracted by events in the Soviet Union and elsewhere.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
Helmick Mess Could Hamper U.S. Pursuit of the Gold

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
Robert Helmick's resignation on Wednesday as president of the United States Olympic Committee after questions about his business relationships has undermined the stability of the organization, say some Olympic officials, who fear that the situation could affect public confidence in Olympic efforts and financial support.
By yesterday, the committee was moving quickly to limit damage from the episode, which began earlier this month when Helmick admitted to other U.S.O.C. officers that he had worked as a paid consultant to groups seeking greater ties to the Olympics. 
 A meeting of the 22-member executive committee was arranged for Monday in Colorado Springs to discuss procedures for electing an interim president to serve through next year, when the Winter Games will be held in France and the Summer Games in Spain.
At the same time, Harvey Schiller, the U.S.O.C. executive director, who was drawn into a controversy of his own earlier this week with the United States ski federation, said he would press forward to strengthen ethical guidelines and provisions that require officers and staff members to disclose relevant business ties to the Olympics.
He also said a growing number of officials was supporting the idea of creating an external review process. Arnold I. Burns, a former United States Deputy Attorney General, was hired last week to review Helmick's business affairs.
 
Worried About Preparation
 But while the initiatives were gaining momentum and other Olympic officials expressed optimism that the ordeal would pass quickly, more than a few raised concerns that training by United States athletes for next year's Olympics and revenue streams that support their preparations could be affected.
Their concerns were especially critical in a period of economic sluggishness, in which Americans -- many of whom balk at the notion of professionals' competing in the Olympics -- are being asked to support Olympic efforts now certain to include athletes like Michael Jordan, the basketball star, who earns millions of dollars in salary and product endorsements.
 
Counting Money Before It's In
 One official, who insisted that his name not be used, said that the U.S.O.C. had expected to spend $18 million from the sale of 1992 Olympic coins for improvements to the Olympic training complex in Colorado Springs. Construction is scheduled to begin in February.
But public perceptions of mismanagement, unethical behavior or chaos at the top, he said, could reduce the sales, anticipated to be more than $25 million. He and others also wondered whether corporate executives might decide to reduce their spending on Olympic programs until issues of leadership are sorted out.
The concerns were exacerbated on Tuesday when the United States ski federation accused Schiller of offering additional money in grants in exchange for ski passes and equipment. He denied the accusations.
Confidence in the leadership seemed to be further eroded when the International Olympic Committee announced yesterday that three of its members would investigate Helmick's business arrangements. Helmick has been an I.O.C. member since 1985 and on its 12-member executive board since 1989.
"They might take the position, 'Well, this is something I had better wait and see who comes in,' " said George Steinbrenner, one of three U.S.O.C. vice presidents, referring to possible reaction of corporate leaders. "These guys want to see confidence in the ability to lead."
Chuck Foster, the U.S.O.C. secretary, said it was incumbent upon the remaining officers to act quickly in assuring sponsors, who contribute a large part of the $298 million four-year budget, that Helmick's problems do not permeate the organization.
"We have to call the sponsors; that's the primary thing," Foster said. "We also need a plan to reassure the American people and athletes that things are going along as scheduled."
The first change is likely to be the election of an interim president, although no clear favorite has emerged. On Monday, the executive committee is expected to set forth the process for identifying candidates and schedule the election. Schiller said the election would probably be held during the next meeting of the board of directors in late October.
That person would serve through the Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, next year, after which a nominating committee would be appointed to produce candidates for full four-year terms.
Several individuals with strong ties to the Olympics have expressed an interest in the position on an interim or longer basis, including William Simon, a former U.S.O.C. president; Anita deFrantz, a former Olympic rower who was named to the I.O.C. five years ago; Michael Lenard, a U.S.O.C. vice president, and Foster, a former official in the United States Figure Skating Association.
Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees, who was brought into an Olympic leadership position by Helmick three years ago, has disavowed any interest in the presidency, as the interim or four-year successor to Helmick.

HEADLINE: Auctions

BYLINE: By Rita Reif

 BODY:
Auction fever flared briefly last Friday during an afternoon sale of 19th-century furnishings and bric-a-brac at Sotheby's in New York. Midway through the dispersal of elaborately carved and gilded commodes, chairs and chandeliers, a bidding duel in the pre-recession style developed between two dealers vying for a pair of damaged seven-foot stone candelabra, which Sotheby's had estimated would bring $6,000 to $8,000.
It was when the numbers reached $150,000 that the contest narrowed to two dealers: Carlton Hobbs of London, whose brother, John, placed bids for him from there by telephone, and Bernard Steinitz, who flew over from his Paris gallery and bid in person. They battled on, propelling the price to $330,000 -- more than 40 times Sotheby's presale estimate -- and Mr. Hobbs became the new owner. 
 Mr. Hobbs said by telephone from London this week that he disagreed with the description in Sotheby's catalogue, which states: "A pair of gilt-bronze jasper torcheres, third quarter of the 19th century, possibly Russian."
"They're earlier, made probably between 1800 and 1810 at a French factory, Sarreguimines, in Lorraine," he said. "Sarreguimines invented a paste of pulverized stone that, when polished, had the authentic appearance of stone with a glasslike surface -- the finish on these candlesticks."
Mr. Steinitz disagreed with both Sotheby's and Mr. Hobbs on various points. "They may not be Russian; they could be Swedish," he said this week by telephone from Marseilles, France. "But the shape has nothing to do with French style. I am pretty sure they are foreign, not French."
The only matter on which there was any consensus this week among the bidders, watchers and dealers in 19th-century furnishings was that Sotheby's presale estimate for the torcheres was ridiculously low. "I was really astonished by the estimate," Mr. Steinitz said. "They are incredible quality, very rare. Anybody could see they are very special."
Mr. Steinitz said the candelabra -- soaring Neo-Classical columns of a purple-red stone, flecked with pink and banded with gilded bronze flowers, grape vines and leaves -- are far more impressive when seen in person than they appear to be in the catalogue.
Both torcheres are chipped on the bases and the tops, and the base of one candleholder has been broken in three parts and repaired, said Elaine Whitmire, Sotheby's specialist in 19th-century furnishings.
Mr. Hobbs was not seriously concerned by the chips. "They can be repaired," he said. What does matter, he said, is where, when and of what the candleholders were made.
"It was clear in the catalogue photograph that this was no ordinary stone," Mr. Hobbs said. After studying the photograph with a very strong magnifying glass, he said, he decided that the torcheres were probably made of a paste of pulverized stone in a special process that was developed before 1802 at Sarreguemines.
"Having seen Sarreguemines stone in three vases at Trianon, I thought this was a good possibility," he said. "The condition report I had from Sotheby's bore this out. I also asked the opinion of a couple of people in New York. I haven't seen the candlesticks yet, so I can't be that emphatic, but I bet they are Sarreguemines." He also said the bases of the candleholders and the vases at the Grand Trianon at Versailles are all bell-shaped.
Yesterday, Mr. Hobbs was shown a magazine article reproducing a watercolor drawing of what appears to be an identical candelabrum from the National Archives in Paris. The article, by Denise Ledoux-Lebard, a writer on period French furniture, says the candelabrum in the drawing is similar to one presented to the Empress Josephine by the town of Dieppe.
Ms. Whitmire said the unidentified sellers are descendents of Henry C. Gibson of Philadelphia, an heir to a distillery fortune who owned them in the 19th century and died in 1891. They were unable to identify the torcheres or to say when they were acquired for the Gibson mansion on Walnut Street.
Before the sale, she said, she changed her mind about only two matters. "The torcheres are marble, not jasper," she said. "And I said then that they might sell for about $50,000."
On the rest, she stood firm. "I have to go by my gut reaction: I still think they are Russian. I have nothing to go on that would suggest anything else. Russians were doing things a little bit later than the French. Originally, I thought they were made in the 1860's. Now, I think they may be from 1835 to 1850. As for the glasslike surface, some marbles have that, too."

HEADLINE: Film Festival: The Spirit Is the Focus

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
IN years to come, the 29th New York Film Festival, which opens at Lincoln Center tonight with "The Double Life of Veronique," may be remembered as the festival that got religion.
It's not that the 33 films representing 20 countries preach any kind of consistent doctrine; their attitudes toward spiritual and religious matters could hardly be more diverse. It is that an unusual number of this year's selections touch on issues of religious identity, faith and mystical connection and explore a split view of human existence that might be described as spiritual versus technological. 
 Two of the American selections, both of which will soon have commercial releases, have already raised eyebrows and provoked debate after advance screenings.
The novelist Michael Tolkin's first film, "The Rapture," which plays Sept. 30 and Oct. 1 at the 17-day festival, tells of the conversion to fundamentalist Christianity of a Los Angeles telephone operator (played by Mimi Rogers) who gives up her promiscuous life when she accepts Jesus. The film goes on to imagine an Armageddon in which the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are seen galloping across the heavens in sequences that suggest a low-budget parody of "Close Encounters of the Third Kind."
David Mamet's "Homicide," which closes the festival on Oct. 6, stars Joe Mantegna as a Jewish homicide detective who is caught in ethnic and ideological crossfire that involves militant Jews, neo-Nazis, angry blacks and his non-Jewish fellow officers, who he feels look down on him. Epithets fly across the screen, and the film bares chasms of hate.
But if religion has a strong place in both films, it creates more problems for the characters than it solves. Neither film ends happily.
For Mr. Tolkin, making a movie without a pat feel-good ending was one of his goals.
"In the 70's, I saw no conflict between loving a movie like 'Close Encounters,' which I saw five times, and loving Fassbinder," he said recently. "But as Hollywood discovered that absurd happy endings worked with audiences, the need for them became a kind of drug that masked Reaganism and voodoo economics. Movies began to feel like Nuremberg rallies where the audiences were united against a scapegoat. I didn't want the audience to be a mob at the end of the movie. That's why I decided to make a negative spectacle. 'The Rapture' is as much a response to 'Close Encounters' and 'E. T.' as it is about fundamentalism."
Mr. Mamet said recently that the themes of "Homicide" emerged almost unconsciously while he was adapting a more conventional police story based on the experiences of his cousin Eddie Mamet, a New York City police captain.
"The older I get, the more my material comes from unlooked-for places," the film maker and playwright said from his home in Boston. "It would be easy to capitalize on a certain technique and just write 'American Buffalo' and 'House of Games' again.
" 'Homicide' was something I was fighting against. I was writing a cop story, and out of nowhere came this bizarre story of a Jewish police detective. After 10 days, I decided that maybe it was the story I should be following. Both as a citizen looking around the city in which I live and also as a Jew, it's disturbing to see what looks like not only a resurgence of racial hatred, but a legitimization of racial hatred."
Two of the documentaries in this year's festival also deal with issues of Jewish cultural identity. "The Other Eye," a documentary co-directed by Johanna Heer and Werner Schmiedel, which will be shown Wednesday, evenhandedly examines the life and work of G. W. Pabst, an Austrian film maker who directed some early film classics and later worked in Hollywood. His reputation went into eclipse after he returned to Austria in 1939 to direct films for the Nazis.
Alan Berliner's documentary "Intimate Stranger," which will be shown Oct. 3, investigates the cosmopolitan life of his grandfather, a Palestinian Jew who was brought up in Egypt and after World War II kept his family in Brooklyn while he worked in Japan in the textile business.
 
Mystical Motifs
 Mystical and allegorical motifs run through many of the other selections as well. Krzysztof Kieslowski's "Double Life of Veronique," which opens the festival tonight with screenings at both Avery Fisher and Alice Tully Halls, imagines a bond between two young women, one in Poland, the other in Paris, who are identical, lead similar lives, and mystically sense each other's existence in the world. The film, which stars Irene Jacob in the dual roles, represents a marked departure in mood by the Polish director whose dour 1987 film, "A Short Film About Killing," scrutinized homicide and capital punishment with a relentless clinical intensity.
"By having the same person play two different persons, I wanted to express a human message, to show that we are all alike and at the same time completely different," the director recently said, speaking through an interpreter.
"The central idea of the film is the question of communication between two people that is not obvious. It's something you feel without understanding where it comes from. I think we all have it."
 
Direct and Indirect

Atom Egoyan, the young Canadian film maker who wrote and directed "The Adjuster," which will be shown Thursday and Sept. 28, explores what he describes as "the difference between the way one represents oneself and the notion of mediated dealings and emotions in a society overwhelmed by representational devices."
Noah Render, the film's title character, is an insurance company representative who helps families figure out their property losses after a catastrophe. He is so solicitous that he is viewed by clients as almost a saint. His wife, Hera, is a government-employed movie censor who secretly tapes the pornographic films she classifies. The couple lives in the model home for an uncompleted housing development that has been abandoned. Noah's clients are put up in a motel that Mr. Egoyan said he was tempted to name the Ararat.
The film was inspired, he said, by a fire that destroyed his parents' home two years ago on New Year's Eve.
"From out of nowhere came this person who said he was the adjuster," he recalled. "I began to fantasize what would happen if someone in that job felt so distant from his own life style that he used his function to comfort himself. And I thought it would be interesting if his mate were someone involved with protecting life style by judging images you cannot see."
 
Shakespeare Plus
 Allegorical references also run through "My Own Private Idaho," Gus Van Sant Jr.'s film, which will be shown next Friday and Sept. 28, about two young male prostitutes from the streets of Portland, Ore., who go to Italy in search of the mother of one of them. Mr. Van Sant's screenplay directly connects the story to Shakespeare's "Henry IV." Its Falstaff character is a cocaine-snorting chicken hawk, and its King Henry a wheelchair-bound urban mayor. In several scenes, the characters express themselves in an updated style of Shakespearean verse.
Mr. Van Sant said he was inspired by the Orson Welles movie "Chimes at Midnight," which was also based on the Shakespeare play. The actual plot, he said, emerged from the confluence of two short stories and a screenplay he had been working on simultaneously.
"The world that Shakespeare was creating really seemed to relate," he said recently. "There are certain things about Portland and the Northwest that are kind of medieval. It's in the buildings and in many of the people who live there and what they wear. The overall theme of the movie is about home and family and displacement and searching for that."
Shakespeare comes to the fore in Peter Greenaway's "Prospero's Books," an iconoclastic interpretation of "The Tempest" in which John Gielgud not only portrays Prospero but voices most of the other characters' dialogue as well. The interpretation treats the events of the play as a fantasy in Prospero's mind that is so potent it actually affects events. Using advanced video technology as well as film, Mr. Greenaway creates surreal scenes that dramatize Prospero's seething imagination and also suggest that the actor, the playwright and the character are synonymous. The movie, which will be shown Sept. 28 and 29, takes its title and some of its thematic imagery from the books that Prospero took with him when he was exiled from Naples. The film's most important addition to Shakespeare's text is its illustration of the 24 books that are mentioned in the play but are not described.
"I don't think there's much point in making historical movies just to make historical movies," Mr. Greenaway said recently. "What makes this particular project relevant to the end of the 20th century is the concern for knowledge. What do we do now that we know we can manipulate DNA and have the secrets of the hydrogen bomb?"
Similar themes are explored in the Japanese director Jun Ichikawa's film "No Life King," which will be shown Sunday and Monday. The drama centers on a children's computer game that is reputed to kill those who play against it and lose.
Richard Pena, the program director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, which presents the festival, and the chairman of the film selection committee, described the movie as "a portrait of the savage heart of technological Japan."
"Beneath this extraordinary, brightly lit and controlled present, there is amazing superstition and myth that is literally driving that society," he said recently. "The children are surrounded by machinery, but the driving forces in their lives are the curses that are associated with these machines."
Even "Beauty and the Beast," the festival's tribute to Walt Disney, fits the magical mood of this year's festival. The two showings of the studio's newest animated feature on Sept. 29 and Oct. 2 will be the first time the festival has screened a work in progress. The print to be shown is about seven-eighths finished. The unfinished parts demonstrate the steps of the animation process, from pencil sketches to fuller drawings. The film includes six songs by the team of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, who composed the score for "The Little Mermaid."
Putting together a film festival suffused with so much spiritual and magical imagery was not a deliberate intention of the selection committee, which included several critics and Mr. Pena and Wendy Keys of the Film Society, Mrs. Keys said.
"We're not even aware of those threads until after we've made our selections," she said. "But as often happens, when we actually assess our final selection, it's astonishing that these trends emerge."
Summing up the mood of this year's festival, Mr. Pena suggested that it expressed "a post-80's sensibility."
"It has something to do with the lack of guarantees, of there being strict structures to obey or even ideals to work toward," he said. "In a larger sense, it has something to do with the collapse of things in Eastern Europe. A lot of the films are about having your legs suddenly cut out from under you and looking for new guarantees and new structures. That leads to the theme of search."

HEADLINE: The Puzzling George Bushes

BYLINE: By James Reston; James Reston is former chief Washington correspondent and former executive editor of The New York Times.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The most interesting questions about President Bush near the end of his third year are why he makes the appointments he does and why he loves to fight at home and concentrate on making peace and refereeing fights abroad. Both involve his attitude toward the responsibilities of Congress, and the record indicates that he regards Congress not as a partner whose advice and consent are required by the Constitution but as a barrier, even a nuisance, to be overcome.
 He's a puzzle. He is always appealing for unity and a kinder, gentler America, and then choosing officials and policies he knows are bound to raise a storm. He chose Senator Dan Quayle to be Vice President, John Tower to be Secretary of Defense, John Sununu to be chief of staff, Clarence Thomas to sit on the Supreme Court and Robert Gates to be Director of Central Intelligence, and wondered why anybody objected. 
 In the process, he said, and said again, that in choosing Judge Thomas he never even considered his race. This was widely regarded here as the most remarkable and ridiculous statement since he insisted that Mr. Quayle was the best qualified Republican to be Vice President. Meanwhile, he rejoiced in the end of the cold war and a future new world order, and then nominated Mr. Gates, a cold war spymaster, who inevitably revived the old contra controversies the President was urging everybody to forget.
 The Republican convention, despite its doubts, approved Mr. Quayle. The Senate rejected Mr. Tower. Mr. Sununu didn't have to get anybody's approval except the President's, and even the President has been embarrassed by Mr. Sununu's muscular right-wing politics and bad manners.
Mr. Bush's punishment for insisting on what he wants and vetoing what he doesn't want is that often he doesn't like what he gets. Incidentally, he probably won't like Clarence Thomas, if he gets him on the Court, for Judge Thomas hasn't been faithful to anybody's agenda in the past, including his own.
If so, this will not be a new experience for Mr. Bush. He always seems to win "great victories" and then wonder what, if anything, he got out of them. He invaded Panama and got Manuel Noreiga, and now doesn't know what to do with him. He snookered the country into war in the gulf to punish and get rid of Saddam Hussein, but after more than 100,000 enemy dead, which was scarcely noticed, that scoundrel is still presiding over the wreckage of Iraq, including its nuclear installations. And now Mr. Bush apparently is thinking about going back in. He "saved" Kuwait for "democracy," then rescued the same old family autocracy there.
But he's happy with the result, for he came out of these two wars with more popularity than when he went in, widely proclaimed as a wizard in the conduct of foreign policy.
 So you have to give him credit -- about $200 billion a year! He vowed to deal with the budget deficit without taxes ("Read my lips!") but sort of reversed himself. He declared war on drugs; announced he would be "the education President"; lectured the Soviets from the back of a golf cart on the glories of sharing power; blamed the Democrats for the homeless, unemployed and budget and trade deficits -- and, funniest of all, sold this package to the people with such success that the Democrats' big hitters all decided they would rather "spend more time with the family" in 1992 than challenge him.
Few people will weep for these dropouts, who don't have the will to fight for their convictions or the courage to fail. But this only emphasizes the problem about Presidential appointments, for George Bush, in a confusion of loyalties, is likely to choose Mr. Quayle for more four years, if the convention, in a customary fit of absent-mindedness, lets him get away with it.
Like most Presidents coming into their 70's, even George Bush will have to pay attention to his fluttery heart and rely more on the people he appoints to help him with the decisions he has to make.
Far more important than what happens to Messrs. Thomas, Gates, Quayle or even Bush is what happens to a country that is so casual about the way it appoints the people the President needs to help him reach decisions.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Reclaiming the Victory

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Spare us the astonishment and indignation that the Bush Administration puts on about Saddam Hussein's naughtinesses. Maybe then we will see how to get rid of the man.
Did Mr. Bush, after keeping Saddam Hussein in power, truly believe that he would accept defeat, out of sheer gentlemanliness? Did Mr. Bush think that after Saddam so carefully hid all those missiles and chemical and bacteriological weapons he would hand them over to U.N. inspectors, to make their day fruitful? 
 Mr. Bush called Saddam a Hitler. Did he believe the fellow would become a reformed Hitler?
The Administration might be cynical but it is not stupid. The U.S., having defeated Iraq militarily, fled victory. The reason was that Saudi Arabia and Syria wanted us to do so.
They were justifiably terrified that a relatively representative government might emerge in Iraq out of the rebel movements -- and that it would be contagious. So the U.S. signed up with the evil idea of allowing Saddam Hussein to remain in power along with his terrorist Baathist political party and the gang around him. It did have the wistful hope that one of the gang would put a bullet in his brain. Nobody obliged. Saddam Hussein lives and maneuvers in growing power, he, the party and the gang.
This is embarrassing to Mr. Bush. But he will not admit error. A President? But a lot of the rest of us can -- Americans like myself who thought Mr. Bush really meant not just to save the Kuwaiti rulers but end Saddam Hussein's tyranny, just because he said so. We are lucky trust is not a crime in this country -- nor brings death as it did to the Kurds.
Done is done. But ending the befogging mock astonishment might give us clarity to see what to do now.
First, stop playing mouse to the Saddam cat. He grabs every chance to defy the U.N., for military advantage and to preen before the Muslim world. He carried out arms-collecting raids in contemptuous violation of the U.N. cease-fire line. He showed U.N. inspectors weapons and nuclear facilities -- when they knew the exact sites. He blocked them with bullets or bureaucracy from hunting for what they could not pin down. And he continues to use war and terror against the Kurds and Shiite rebels.
Sending planes to protect the inspectors will stop him -- once. Then he will move again, and again, as long as he is in power.
Short range, a small but permanent and powerful military base in Iraq could provide continuous protection for U.N. operations. It would remind Iraq that its leader has sacrificed their sovereignty.
But as Senator Albert Gore, the Tennessee Democrat, and a handful of other members of Congress say until they are hoarse, the basic policy toward Iraq must change.
One pistol, though a happy thought, will not be enough. Iraq would remain under his fellow-killers and their party -- like killing Hitler to promote Goring.
What's needed is what Mr. Bush has not come up with -- a political strategy, understood by Americans and Iraqis, to remove Saddam Hussein and his state despotism.
The U.S. should give full political and public opinion support to the Kurds -- and to the Shiite rebels too, instead of assuming no Iraqi dissidents want or can be trusted with freedom.
Food and medicine from Iraqi funds should be sent into Iraq and distributed by U.N. specialists -- particularly to rebels and their families -- under guard, without Saddam Hussein's permission.
War crimes tribunals should try Saddam Hussein and his top leaders in absentia, making it clear to all others that to stick with them is to invite the noose. Defectors should be protected, and rewarded.
Military action may be needed on a spot target basis. But if the U.S. at last uses its political and economic power against him, with the clear ethical goal of ending his tyranny, the war damage done to Iraq already should make repeated massive attacks unnecessary.
To accomplish the end of the tyranny, Mr. Bush must concede that Saddam Hussein and his gang are the agents of disorder and instability, not their victims. Only so can the victory be reclaimed and the Persian Gulf war justified.
Otherwise, Saddam Hussein will continue to rule in Iraq, and continue to grow in power until he is ready to fight again -- Saddam, the son of Saddam or the clone of Saddam.

HEADLINE: Don't Tie U.S.-Soviet Relations to Cuba

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The thrust of "Fortress Cuba, Lonely Cuba" (editorial, Sept. 8) is on target. Cuba is no longer a problem to anyone but itself. Its troops are out of Africa. For all practical purposes, the guerrilla wars are over in Latin America. And the United States need no longer fear a Soviet military threat mounted from Cuba; indeed, as affirmed by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Moscow is beginning to reduce its military presence on the island. Further, the Cuban economy is in dire straits; the time when it might have been an attractive model for other Latin states has passed. 
 Thus, as you point out, it would be folly for the Bush Administration to listen to the hard-liners who wish to intervene militarily to topple Fidel Castro. Fortunately, no evidence suggests the Administration intends to go that far. Quite the contrary, President Bush recently stated publicly that the United States has no aggressive intentions against Cuba -- one of the reasons, surely, that the Soviets can begin to withdraw their troops.
In other ways, however, the Administration is listening to the hard-liners. Indeed, its Cuba policy seems to be dictated by the ultraconservative Cuban American National Foundation. Does it make any sense, for example, to spend some $20 million a year of taxpayer money for TV Marti to transmit into a black hole? If Cuba is no longer a problem, why should we waste our money? And wasted it is. TV Marti is neither seen nor heard in Cuba. The answer to why we do it is that TV Marti was and is the foundation's baby. The foundation wants it, and so the Administration turns backflips and members of Congress salivate to comply.
The same is true of the amendment sponsored by Senator Connie Mack of Florida, which will again make it unlawful for United States subsidiaries incorporated abroad to trade with Cuba even under carefully delineated conditions. Aside from an initial cost to the Cubans in going over to other suppliers, the amendment will harm the Cubans almost not at all. They will simply turn to the other suppliers. But it will cause us tremendous problems with such countries as Canada, which rightly sees the amendment as nothing less than a demand for extraterritoriality.
Why do it then? So that the Florida Congressional delegation, joined by most of their colleagues from the other 49 states, can pander to the foundation. Never mind that it harms the national interest; it lets our lawmakers strike anti-Communist postures. It is a habit of which they apparently cannot break themselves even in this post-cold-war world.
Finally, given that Cuba is no longer a significant problem, would it make any sense to make the suspension of Soviet-Cuban trade a precondition to an expanded relationship with the new Soviet Union? (And despite the Administration's talk of billions in continuing Soviet aid, Moscow and Havana have for some time been conducting their trade largely on a commercial basis; Mr. Gorbachev's statement of Sept. 9 simply reaffirms that economic ties will move increasingly in that direction.)
Relations with the Soviet Union (or Russia) are of fundamental importance to the United States; the Cuban issue is a minor irritant. Making the second hostage to the first at this crucial moment in history would be irresponsible.

HEADLINE: THE GATES HEARINGS;
Memo Shows Gates Sought Big Anti-Sandinista Effort

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 19

 BODY:
In a 1984 memorandum, Robert M. Gates, who was then Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, proposed an extensive American campaign to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government, including bombing raids on Nicaraguan military targets.
"These are hard measures," Mr. Gates wrote in the memo, which condemned even President Ronald Reagan's efforts in behalf of the Nicaraguan resistance as "half measures, half-heartedly applied." 
 "They are probably politically unacceptable," Mr. Gates said, "but it is time to stop fooling ourselves about what is going to happen in Central America."
He predicted that Nicaragua would become "another Cuba," fostering Soviet expansion, and that Washington would have failed again to prevent the spread of Communism, as he said had happened in Vietnam.
 
Memo Addressed to Casey
 The memo of Dec. 14, 1984, was written to William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence. It was released today by Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, during the hearings on Mr. Gates's nomination to the post held by the late Mr. Casey.
Mr. Gates was not asked publicly about the memo today and it was not clear what his motives were; he may have been intending to be deliberately provocative in an effort to open the debate on Nicaragua policy that he said was lacking. Mr. Gates advocated overt actions, not secret ones, and did not recommend circumventing the Congressional ban on American aid to the contras fighting the Sandinista government.
But his analysis and his proposals went further than Mr. Casey himself and underscored Mr. Gates's hard-line views on Soviet expanionism, which some of his Senate critics say led to his more recent conclusion that the changes in the Soviet Union were not genuine and lasting.
The memo also strikes at questions raised by some Democratic senators about whether Mr. Gates, as the senior official in charge of intelligence analysis, stepped outside that role and crossed the line between providing neutral analysis and advocating policy positions.
 
'I am Quite Surprised'
 After Mr. Metzenbuam read out portions of the memo at today's hearing, John McMahon, Mr. Gates's predecessor as Deputy Director for Intelligence, said: "I am quite surprised by what you read and I don't know what prompted Bob to do that."
In the memo, Mr. Gates concluded, "The contras, even with American support, cannot overthrow the Sandinistas."
"The truth of the matter is that our policy has been to muddle along in Nicaragua with an essentially half-hearted policy because there is no agreement within the Administration or with the Congress on our real objectives," Mr. Gates said.
Mr. Gates said Washington should move beyond its then-stated goal of halting the arms flow to the leftist rebels in El Salvador and work overtly to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government, doing "everything in its power short of invasion to put that regime out."
He said this should include four measures:
*Withdrawing United States recognition of the Nicaraguan Government in favor of a government in exile.
*"Overt provision to the government in exile of military assistance, funds, propaganda support and so forth."
*Economic sanctions that could include a quarantine, "combined with internal measures by the resistance to maximize the economic dislocation to the regime," an apparent reference to a campaign of sabotage.
*"Politically the most difficult of all, the use of air strikes to destroy a considerable portion of Nicaragua's military buildup (focusing primarily on the tanks and the helicopters)."
"If we have decided totally to abandon the Monroe Doctrine, if in the 1980's taking strong actions to protect our interests despite the hail of criticism is too difficult," Mr. Gates wrote, "then we ought to save political capital in Washington, acknowledge our helplessness and stop wasting everybody's time."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Continues to Decline While Gold Has Mixed Day

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar, weighed down by interest rate concerns, continued its slide against the major foreign currencies yesterday.
Gold prices were mixed, rising in New York after falling overseas. 
 Analysts said the dollar was hurt by statements by a German official that interest rates in his country will remain at their high levels.
The official, Wilhelm Nolling, president of the state central bank of Hamburg, also said rates could go higher if labor unions received wage increases in their next contract negotiations.
Mr. Nolling's comments lifted the mark and helped take a further toll on the dollar, which has been falling recently along with United States interest rates.
The dollar, like all currencies, draws support from higher rates, which increase foreign demand for American investments. So as rates drop in this country or rise overseas, the dollar tends to slide.
The Federal Reserve's decision a week ago to lower its discount rate half a percentage point, to 5 percent, has taken a heavy toll on the dollar. An article in The Wall Street Journal yesterday, which said the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates further to stimulate growth in the money supply, did not augur well for the dollar.
The dollar fell to 1.6845 German marks in New York, from 1.6885 late Thursday. In earlier European trading, the dollar fell to 1.6850 marks from 1.6892.
Overseas traders said the absence of any fresh economic news and the approach of a holiday in Japan on Monday kept activity light. Many traders in New York and other foreign exchange centers were squaring their positions in advance of the weekend.
The dollar fell to 134.15 Japanese yen in New York from late Thursday's 134.40. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar closed at 134.72 yen, up 0.32 yen, and in later London trading, it was quoted at 134.25 yen.
The British pound rose to $1.7315, from $1.7300 late Thursday. In London, sterling rose to $1.7290 from $1.7280.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's prices, included: 1.46985 Swiss francs, down from 1.4755; 5.7395 French francs, down from 5.7525; 1,260.00 Italian lire, down from 1,264.00, and 1.13445 Canadian dollars, down from 1.13525.
Gold prices edged higher in New York after falling overseas.
On the Commodity Exchange, gold picked up 20 cents and closed at $348.50 a troy ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $348.30, up 5 cents.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Copper Tops $1.10 a Pound For First Time in 5 Months

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Copper futures prices topped $1.10 a pound for the first time in five months yesterday as industrial users scrambled to lock in supplies.
Copper for delivery in September rose 3.10 cents, to $1.101 a pound, on New York's Commodity exchange. It was the highest settlement of a near-term copper contract since April 19. 
 Analysts said United States copper users were seeking to rebuild their stocks after letting them drop during the recession, but most available supplies are not conveniently situated.
The situation has aroused speculation that some industrial users will take delivery of copper through the September futures contract, which expires next Thursday. The price of September deliveries has risen about 10 percent in the last month.
The market's strong tone is strictly "a near-term phenomenon," said Stephen W. Platt, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
"Once the pipelines are filled and the cash metal moves to market, we'll probably see some renewed selling," he said.
But William O'Neill, senior futures strategist with Merrill Lynch Futures, saw the possibility of a longer-term rally as a result of expected declines in copper exports from the Soviet Union and Zaire and firming demand in Europe, North America and the Far East.
Grain and soybean futures prices dropped on the Chicago Board of Trade after a whipsaw session in the soybean market linked to uncertainty over the extent of frost damage in Iowa and Minnesota.
Wheat for delivery in December settled 3 1/2 cents lower at $3.30 1/2 a bushel; December corn fell 3 1/2 cents, to $2.50 a bushel; December oats were unchanged at $1.29 1/2 a bushel, and November soybeans fell 4 1/2 cents, to $5.99 a bushel.
Live cattle futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in profit taking after Thursday's strong gains. Feeder cattle and hog futures ended mixed but pork bellies plunged in a late round of pre-weekend profit taking.
Live cattle for October delivery finished 0.30 cent lower at 73.37 cents a pound; September feeder cattle rose 0.03 cent, to 86.40 cents a pound; October live hogs fell 0.28 cent lower, to 46.57 cents a pound, and February frozen pork bellies dropped 1.65 cents, to 49.47 cents a pound.
Most energy futures rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange, helped by news that shipments of Soviet petroleum products from Odessa had been halted and on word that Brazilian oil workers will continue an 11-day old strike despite a court ruling that it is illegal.
Light sweet crude oil for October delivery rose 21 cents, to $21.97 a barrel; October heating oil ended 0.65 cent higher at 62.50 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline fell 0.09 cent, to 60.90 cents a gallon, and October natural gas rose 7.2 cents, to $1.742 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: BTR Bids $2.55 Billion for Hawker Siddeley

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 20

 BODY:
In the third major takeover bid in Britain in five days, BTR P.L.C, an industrial conglomerate, offered about $2.55 billion today for the Hawker Siddeley Group P.L.C., a diversified industrial manufacturer.
Hawker Siddeley's board said it would fight the bid. The businesses of the company, whose sales totaled $4.2 billion last year, include electric motors and power equipment, instruments and controls, batteries, rail and industrial goods, and servicing aircraft engines. 
 Analysts said the unsolicited bid confirmed their view that the takeover market in Britain, which had been moribund since the end of 1989, was coming back to life. "We will not necessarily go back to the boom of 1989, but we will see a slow upsurge in large bids," said Philip Healey, the editor and publisher of Acquisitions Monthly, a British magazine.
The analysts cited several reasons that the takeover boomlet was occurring now -- falling interest rates and a rising stock market, which make it easier to finance acquisitions; the economic recovery in the United States, a large market for many British companies, and the widening belief that the British recession has bottomed out.
"The takeovers tell you that corporate U.K. is fairly confident about the prospects for a recovery," said Michael Armitage, an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company.
The BTR bid follows two others by industrial conglomerates: Williams Holdings' $1.2 billion hostile bid for Racal Electronics, an electronics and security company that is expected to be only marginally profitable in its current fiscal year, and Hanson P.L.C.'s $606 million friendly bid for Beazer P.L.C., the troubled construction and building materials company.
Hanson, Williams and BTR all have reputations as shrewd buyers of industrial companies. They typically have not overpaid and have succeeded in improving the profitability of the parts of the acquisitions they have kept by exercising tight management.
In the last three weeks, 11 bids have been made for publicly held British companies, with a total value of more than 3.1 billion, or about $5.35 billion, Mr. Healey said. That compares with a total in the first eight months of the year of 2.8 billion. The 11 include BTR's friendly $34 million bid for Rockware Glass Ltd., a British glass and packaging manufacturer, and American Brands' hostile $494 million bid for Invergordon, a whisky distiller.
Analysts also see as potential takeover targets: Allied-Lyons P.L.C., Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. and Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C., the big food and drinks companies that might interest other food giants; the Asda Group P.L.C., a British supermarket concern with dismal profit margins; Pilkington Glass Ltd., the glass manufacturer, and Amec, a construction company, which would both profit from an economic upturn.
"Many people are looking around for cyclical companies that would benefit from an upturn and whose profit margins are not so great and could be improved," said Philip J. Wolstencroft, an equities strategist at Smith New Court Securities Ltd.
 
Reasons for Bidding
 In bidding for Hawker Siddeley, BTR's chairman, Sir Owen Green, said he thought his target, whose profits have been falling in recent years, could do better under BTR. "Hawker Siddeley shareholders have endured their company's underperformance for a decade," he said.
But Hawker Siddeley said its management was in the middle of a program to improve profitability by cutting costs and fine-tuning its businss mix. The analysts said both assertions had some validity.
In trading on the London International Stock Exchange today, Hawker Siddeley's shares rose by 1.18, or about $2.04, to 7.58, or $13.08. That inidcates investors think a higher bid will come from BTR or someone else: BTR offered Hawker Siddeley shareholders a package of cash and BTR shares that it valued at 7.41, but which was worth 7.27 based on BTR's closing price today, or 7 in cash.
In London, BTR's shares closed at 4.10, or $7.07, off 13 pence, or 22 cents.

HEADLINE: Now, When You're Out You're In

BYLINE: By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO

 BODY:
A few years ago, it was just about impossible for a fashion newcomer like Byron Lars to get a foot -- let alone a dress -- inside a major store. Lars? Who had ever heard of him? But last winter the 26-year-old designer packed up the eight samples that were his entire spring line, marched into Henri Bendel and walked away with an order for 80 pieces.
Now his second collection, for fall, is in 10 stores around the country, including Bloomingdale's in New York, which put his witty clothes in its Lexington Avenue windows in July. 
 Mr. Lars is one of the recent brood of fledgling designers to benefit from retailers' new receptiveness toward unproven talent. In the last year or so, major stores long dominated by names like Klein and Armani have been giving valuable floor space to designers like Gemma Kahng, Gordon Henderson, Todd Oldham and Zang Toi.
Before the buyout wave and the recession hit the retailing industry, unknowns like them had trouble getting store buyers to take their calls. Now the stores are banking on such young designers to bring in the customers without driving up their costs .
The stores are finding that the eager new designers can often save them the expense of accommodating the major names. Prominent designers can impose minimum orders of $100,000 or $200,000, and not only demand their own in-store boutiques but even dictate the size and decor. Giorgio Armani expects his departments to look like his stark, ultra-modern Milan boutique; Calvin Klein wants soothing beige and brown furniture. The store is expected to foot the bill, and how can a store say no to any of the world's top designers?
Young designers set no minimums, said Joan Kaner, senior vice president and fashion director of Neiman Marcus. "They're thrilled to sell you one piece, just so they can be in a big store," she said. "You can pick just what will work for your store and expand later based on performance, delivery and quality."
Ellin Saltzman, senior vice president and corporate fashion director of R. H. Macy & Company, said that to distinguish themselves, stores were looking for fresh young names. "The stores got so much alike with all the same designers," she said. "They now realize that the safe route of the tried and true is not necessarily the only way. So they're looking for a gimmick, some way to be different. It's a new attitude."
 
Returning the Calls
 New designers appreciate the change. "When we started two years ago," Gemma Kahng said, "we couldn't get anybody to come see us. We called and called and called, and they didn't even return our calls. Then we got some press, and the stores started calling us." Her colorful clothes with oversize jeweled buttons are now in many major department and specialty stores, and she expects her wholesale volume to reach $2 million this year.
Traditionally, newcomers have relied on specialty stores willing to take a chance with a small order of five or six styles, which got the designers started but allowed them little room for growth. Then, two years ago, Lynn Manulis of New York's venerable Martha Park Avenue boutique opened a shop totally devoted to a new generation of designers. Called Martha International, it offered clothes by Christian Francis Roth, Carmelo Pomodoro, Charlotte Neuville and Randolph Duke. Soon, department stores decided they were missing out on a good bet.
A store can put a few styles from each of several young designers together in one department and see what sells. Macy's Northeast put a New Signatures department in the Herald Square store in New York last year as an experiment; it was successful enough to be expanded to Macy's San Francisco and the company's Bullocks stores.
 
A Growing Trend
 Henri Bendel, which was once well known for discovering new talent, has made its new store on Fifth Avenue a showcase for young designers.
Nordstrom, the Seattle-based retailer with more than 60 branches, has a department called Savvy where newcomers can get a tryout. Byron Lars is there this fall, along with Gemma Kahng, C. D. Greene, Anna Sui and Randolph Duke. "I look for items, not names," said the Nordstrom buyer, Carrie Fahey, who was one of the first to give Randolph Duke a break.
Mr. Duke, in business three years, said Nordstrom had saved his operation. "When you first start, it's good to have the anchor of one department store," he said. "Our anchor was Nordstrom. There was one season where we would have gone under if we didn't have paper from Nordstrom. "
At Bloomingdale's, Byron Lars received the most lavish promotion of any new designer since Isaac Mizrahi. Although Mr. Mizrahi beat the odds by attracting major retailers to his first show three years ago, he had the advantage of the contacts with store executives that he developed as an assistant designer for Perry Ellis and Calvin Klein. Mr. Lars, a native of San Francisco with limited experience as a freelance designer, was an unknown quantity.
"We don't normally do windows and ads for a new talent," said Kalman Ruttenstein, Bloomingdale's vice president for fashion direction. "This is the first time since Isaac Mizrahi that we pulled out all the stops for a new designer. But we think our customers will respond to Byron. His clothes have a street humor, but they're also very sophisticated and cut beautifully."
What sets the designs by Byron Lars apart is his way of adding an ironic twist to the classics. He uses striped cotton for a shirtdress, adding a man's necktie but also a seductively draped skirt, and he cuts rustic buffalo plaid into feminine full-skirted shapes for coats. The dresses retail for $325; the coats for $750.
Gambling on new designers is not without its risks. Customers are often reluctant to spend $800 on a jacket by someone they have never heard of. Because it can cost more for a small manufacturer to produce a garment than for a big company that makes thousands of each style, a young designer's clothes can end up priced as high as a well-known designer's.
A store has to be patient, said Mara Urshel, a senior vice president and general merchandise manager of Saks Fifth Avenue. "You know up front that the merchandise will not walk out of the store the first day," she said.
Mr. Ruttenstein of Bloomingdale's agrees. "You can't just buy the clothes and let them sit there," he said. "You have to promote them, and let the customer know about them. And you have to be prepared to give them a few years before you can make money with them."
Another risk for stores is that untried talent is often undercapitalized. "You may place an order, and it's never sent to you," said Ms. Kaner of Neiman Marcus."
 
A Sudden Demise
 That has happened to stores that ordered fall merchandise from Michael Leva, who suddenly closed his four-year-old business in July. Faced with a doubling of orders, he could not raise enough capital to buy the fabrics and pay the contractors.
Mr. Lars hopes to avoid that danger. He sought professional advice from Mary Ann Wheaton, who is in the business of helping to introduce new lines. She determined that he could afford to ship to just 10 stores for fall. "The hard part for a designer to understand," Ms. Wheaton said, "is that there's a big danger in being immediately successful and growing too quickly."
But by and large, the new designers are thoroughly professional. Andrew Basile, the fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman, said today's young designers were more aware of the need for well-made, high-quality clothing as well as fresh ideas. "They know they must present a clean, clear point of view that marries value and quality with creativity and ingenuity," he said. "This has all happened in the last two years. It's all come together in one moment."

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Are Higher in Active Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Bond prices moved higher in active trading yesterday, as participants in the Government securities market pared positions of shorter-term maturities in favor of longer-term issues.
Traders said some of the swapping was done as preparation for next week's auctions of new two-year and five-year notes. In addition, an article in The Wall Street Journal yesterday may have been responsible for some bond purchases. 
 The article said weakness in the money supply growth, if it continued, could force the Federal Reserve Board to cut short-term interest rates again soon. It cited the rise in M-2 reported by the Fed on Thursday -- an increase that was smaller than most analysts had expected.
However, release of the unexpectedly weak money supply figures provoked little or no response on Thursday.
Whatever the reason, "it seems that people are extending" out the yield curve, one government securities trader said.
"There was a steady stream of buying," said William V. Sullivan, Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. A favorable inflation outlook, a "sense that the economy could flounder," and low short-term interest rates are compelling arguments for investors to purchase longer-dated issues, Mr. Sullivan said.
In the secondary market for Treasury notes and bonds, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 102 23/32, up 1/4 point, to yield 7.88 percent, compared with 7.91 percent late Thursday and 7.93 percent on Sept. 13.
With economic fundamentals favoring lower bond yields "it now seems quite likely" that long-term Treasury yields will fall to 7 3/4 percent in the near term, said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, president of Ramirez Capital Consultants. Bond yields have not been that low since August, 1989.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 1/8 late yesterday, up 1/4 point, to yield 7.56 percent. But prices of the 6 3/8 percent two-year notes rose by just 1/32, to 100 13/32, to yield 6.14 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates posted a very slight decline.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.17 percent, down one basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 5.22 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by two basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.22 percent.
New-issue activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market remained strong, as just under $2 billion worth of securities were priced.
The pricings were dominated by a $1.5 billion global offering of five-year notes from the World Bank.
The 7.25 percent notes, which mature Oct. 1, 1996, were priced at $99.897, to yield 7.275 percent, 20 basis points over the prevailing when-issued yield on the new five-year Treasury notes to be auctioned next week.
Goldman, Sachs & Company and Credit Suisse First Boston acted as co-lead managers for the underwriting. The securities are rated triple-A by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. acted as lead manager on a $200 million offering of 12-year notes from American Brands.
The 8.50 percent notes, which mature in 2003, were priced at $99.70, to yield 8.54 percent, 98 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-3 by Moody's and A-minus by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, market participants said that prices of most issues were little changed in slow trading.
Municipal bond traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues in the secondary market for tax-exempt bonds rose by about 1/8 point.

HEADLINE: Cars Are Ready, but Buyers Stall

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 20

 BODY:
Jeffrey P. Rampinelli, a car dealer in Ann Arbor, Mich., readily ticked off the reasons why the sluggish new-car sales market should be picking up: dealer inventories of new 1992 models are building nicely and consumers' confidence about the future is improving. Some manufacturers are offering low-interest car loans and rebates on some models. "Everything is in place for good things to be happening," said Mr. Rampinelli, who sells Nissans and Chevrolets.
But good things are not happening for Mr. Rampinelli and thousands of other dealers. Mr. Rampinelli's business is off 40 percent so far this year from a lackluster 1990. Many analysts had predicted that by now car sales would be steadily perking up. 
 Sales had started to climb in May and through part of the summer, but then fell back to the sluggish pace recorded in the first months of the year. Earlier this month, sales of domestically made cars were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of roughly 5.4 million cars, compared with 7.1 million a year earlier.
There are many reasons a steady upturn has not materialized, dealers and economists say. Shoppers still lack confidence about their income security for the short-term, and for good reason. Real income is growing, but only slightly, and a record portion of it continues to go toward payments on debt. Many people even remain "upside down" on their auto loans -- owing more on the cars they are driving than the cars are worth as trade-ins. Thus, these potential buyers do not have enough money for a down payment.
At the Andean Motor Company, a Chevrolet and Geo dealer in Cumming, Ga., customers who have negative equity account for "at least half, if not more" of the people who come in the door, said Jim Otwell, the dealership's owner.
"People feel less wealthy because they are less wealthy," said Tom Webb, chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Association.
The affordability of new cars is also affected by sticker prices, which are higher on new models partly because expensive safety features, like air bags and anti-lock brakes, are becoming standard equipment on more models. Rebates and other incentives are intended to blunt the effect of higher prices, but consumers have become so accustomed to the incentives that they are reluctant to buy without some sort of markdown.
Sticker prices have put off Gene Hartman of Moline, Ill., who may delay his plan to swap his 1989 Taurus for a Chrysler New Yorker in April if the trade-in offer isn't high enough. "It disturbs me that the cars are running for more than what I paid for my house about 30 years ago," he said.
The Federal Reserve Board has been trying to stimulate the economy by gradually whittling down interest rates. But consumer loan rates have not dropped much, and interest rates on new-car loans have been stuck at a lofty 11 percent level.
Banks are reluctant to lower their car loan rates, in part because of a rising number of delinquent car loans, according to the American Bankers Association. A survey of member banks showed that the percentage of delinquent car loans rose to 2.87 percent in the second quarter, the highest level since the early 1980's.
 
Short-Term Gloom
 Ray Green, who owns five dealerships in Illinois, for both foreign and domestic makes, said shoppers coming into showrooms lacked confidence in the economy, although they were optimistic about the future.
Bill and Joan Powell of Hampton, Ill., recently went shopping at one of Mr. Green's dealerships for a Chrysler mini-van to replace their tiny year-old Geo Metro. But the couple, who are in their 50's, decided to put off the purchase until next year because "we're worried about the economy," Mrs. Powell said. She added, "We're just going to wait and see."
Their outlook squares with the findings of Richard T. Curtin, head of the University of Michigan's consumer confidence survey, who said consumers' attitudes about their short-term finances were much gloomier than their expectations of the future.
One in four families surveyed recently by the university reported a decline in income in the last year, dampening spending plans.
Mr. Curtin and others noted that interest rates on vehicle loans had declined little over the last year, despite repeated drops in the Federal Reserve's discount rate, the rate it charges banks for short-term loans. For example, rates on 48-month new-car loans now average 11.52 percent in the nation's largest cities, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, down less than one percentage point from the rate of 12.28 percent a year ago.
The Fed, meanwhile, has dropped the discount rate by two percentage points since December, including a cut on Sept. 13 to 5 percent, from 5 1/2 percent. Some consumers, including retirees, are watching their investment income drop with the discount rate as the rates paid on bank certificates of deposit and Treasury securities decline.
Auto industry analysts say credit is loosening for car shoppers applying for loans. But Mark Herrmann, who owns Mark Buick-GMC Truck in Yonkers, said his biggest problem selling cars was that many of his customers were unable to secure car loans.
Auto makers recorded their best sales years in the mid- to late-1980's, and many buyers during those years should now be ready for new cars. If this came true, Mr. Webb said demand for cars could yield sales of about 15 million vehicles this year; actual sales are predicted to be roughly 12.5 million.

HEADLINE: Casting Lines, and Faith, in the Harbor

 BODY:
A garbage barge steamed down the Arthur Kill a few hundred yards from where Orlando Lopez was fishing on a bright September afternoon. Debris floated in the water -- a rotting sneaker, some chunks of wood -- as he cast his lure and waited for his lunch to swim by.
The murky channel, which runs between storage tanks and crumbling warehouses on Staten Island and in New Jersey, was so polluted in the 1960's that scientists tested the water by seeing how long it took fish to die in it. 
 But mostly because of better sewage treatment, the Arthur Kill and the rest of the waters around New York City have become cleaner over the last decade. Fish and crabs are thriving, so much so that fishermen from a small wooden pier in Bayonne, N.J., to larger ones along the waterfronts of Brooklyn and Harlem say they are increasingly eating what they catch, sometimes ignoring local health advisories warning of the possible dangers.
 
'Tastes Like Normal Fish'
 "It tastes like normal fish," said Mr. Lopez, 27 years old, who had caught one silvery snapper and four blue crabs after fishing for a half hour at the marina in Elizabeth, N.J. "You go to the supermarket, you don't know were it came from."
Knowing that the harbor has long been a dump for sewage, spilled oil and other pollutants, many New Yorkers might consider eating these fish about as appetizing as chewing gum found in an ashtray.
But health officials and harbor experts say many types of fish are safe to eat if properly cleaned, prepared and consumed according to local health advisories. In fact, blue crabs from the Hudson north of the city are being served to diners today in a Manhattan club.
 
Advisories and Warnings
 Patrick Healey, a 33-year-old mortuary sciences student who was watching Mr. Lopez and another dozen or so fishermen, only recently overcame his fears and began buying blue crabs from the old men on the marina.
"I used to say, 'These people will be a night light,' " he said of the pollution. But the crabs were cheap, "very sweet and tasty," he said.
He said he did not know that New Jersey advises against eating crabs from the Arthur Kill, even though New York State issues warnings only to restrict how many are consumed. Although the Federal Government tests the fish, the advisories are considered under the purview of the states because the fish are so close to shore.
"I figured they wouldn't let us eat them if they were bad," Mr. Healey said.
There is a paradox, however. Although sewage treatment has made the harbor look much cleaner -- and increased the levels of life-giving oxygen -- the water still contains high levels of heavy metals like copper, lead and mercury as well as potential carcinogens like PCB's.
"The problem is not that the fish aren't there and that they aren't catchable but that there are contaminant loadings that the state says make them unhealthy to eat," said Andrew Willner, the bay-keeper of the New York-New Jersey harbor for the American Littoral Society, a conservation group.
New York and New Jersey issue similar health advisories for fish consumption, warnings that many fishermen disregard (if they know about them at all). Many say health officials are overly cautious.
"Ain't nobody dying from it," said Arthur Williams, 49, a Wallington, N.J., fisherman who grew up in a family of 19 children and who happily ate fish from the harbor with no apparent health problems.
But Mr. Williams's attitude worries some experts who are concerned about the cumulative impact of pollutants on the health of people they call sustenance fisherman -- often poor people who fish in the harbor as a way to save on grocery bills.
Sarah Clark, a scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund, said the harbor's contaminants have not been shown to have caused cancer or other illnesses. But the risk is real, she said, because health problems may surface years later, after pollutants have accumulated in the body.
The New York State Department of Health advises that women of childbearing age and children should not eat fish from the harbor and that no one should eat the fish more than once a week.
 
New York's 'No' List
 It also advises against eating American eel in most parts of the harbor and warns against consumption of nine other species in the Hudson: striped bass, white perch, carp, goldfish, brown bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, white catfish and walleye. No more than six blue crabs from the Hudson should be eaten a week, the Health Department advises.
Christopher Letts, a former commercial fisherman who is now an educator with the Hudson River Foundation, called the warnings a "worst-case scenario." For many species, he said, proper cleaning and preparation -- like cleaning crabs thoroughly before boiling and filleting and removing all fat and skin from fish -- can considerably reduce risks.
He said the effort to catch and clean what swims in the harbor is worthwhile can open an eating experience rooted more deeply in nature than finding a new restaurant down the street. Today, he is participating in a festival at the Amazon Club off Pier 25 in lower Manhattan where Hudson crabs will be served, in part to demonstrate that they are safe to eat.
 
Plain, or in a Sauce
 Mr. Letts eats the crabs plain: no butter, seasoning or even salt. "That would be like putting something on wild strawberries," he said.
The specialty of Philip Russo Sr., who fishes off a pier in Weehawken and said he has been fishing and eating from the harbor all his life, is blue crab spaghetti sauce. "Just the crabs in the sauce," he said. "Garlic, oregano, pepper, oil and tomatoes. It's good. A lot of people go for that."
But many more of the harbor fishermen are like Roy Manganelli, a 50-year-old real-estate broker from Park Slope who was recently fishing off the 42d Street pier in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, next to the skeletons of three charred steel piers on the Gowanus Bay. He said he only recently began eating what he caught, after seeing the water improve.
"The water is a lot cleaner now than it was 10 or 15 years ago," said Mr. Manganelli, who eats snapper and porgies fried in his secret egg batter and wine sauce. "But I guess it's what you don't see that kills you."
 
Some Still Aren't Sold
 Few along the waterfront have taken up fishing and eating what they catch with the enthusiasm of Alan Ehrhardt, who is 25 and unemployed. He not only fishes nearly every day from the India Street pier on the East River, tucked in amid the warehouses of Greenpoint, Brooklyn, but he also swims there.
"The water is very clean," he said, dripping after a quick dip. "About 12 years ago I used to come down here with M-80's and blow up the water rats," he added, referring to the powerful firecracker. "That was the only thing here then."
Now he catches snapper, bass, flounder and herring. He has even seen sea horses. He sat fishing on the pier with his brother, father and a friend the other day, using a pair of needle-nose pliers to pluck the meat from a few dozen crabs they had caught and boiled the day before.
Plenty of other fishermen remain hesitant, even weekend salts who have been on the water all their lives.
"Are you crazy? I don't even like to put my hands in the water," said Charlie Herbst, a 40-year-old firefighter from Hillside, N.J., who was fishing with a friend in a small rowboat off Liberty State Park. "The only fish I eat comes in a can: round fish. With a lot of onion."

HEADLINE: No Name, Few Clues: The Case of 'Baby Hope'

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
On a scorching weekday morning in July, Bob Perdue, a highway maintenance supervisor, was working with two of his crew on the southbound lanes of the Henry Hudson Parkway on the skinny northern neck of Manhattan.
Beyond the right-hand shoulder of the road, just north of the Dyckman Street exit, the land falls steeply away to the Hudson River. There, at the base of a tree, half covered with branches and leaves, he saw it -- an iridescent blue picnic cooler. 
 The find began one of the most mystifying cases in the memory of the 34th Precinct detective squad. Even in a precinct that often leads New York City in killings, homicide No. 79 of 1991 stands out.
Inside the cooler, under full cans of Coca-Cola, was the decomposing body of a child, a malnourished little girl who, tests later suggested, had been sexually abused. After nearly two months of intensive investigation, detectives have not only been unable to identify any suspects; they also still have no idea who the girl is -- and why her parents or relatives have apparently never reported her missing.
"It's hard for me to believe that nobody knows who she is," said Detective Joseph Neenan, the officer in charge of the case. Usually, he said, the police put out flyers with detailed descriptions of children who are missing. "We have the opposite," he said. "We have her. We don't know who she is."
The search for the identity and the killer of Baby Hope, as the police call the child, has touched a nerve both in the investigators and in the public, eliciting pledges for funeral expenses and even gifts for the dead child.
The search also stands as a paradigm of the way a major homicide case is worked: Top pathologists, missing-person specialists and detectives -- stymied by blind alleys -- have joined forces to capitalize on the slimmest of clues. Investigators have chased down tips from nearly 100 hot-line calls, roused children from their beds to verify that they were not missing, canvassed Coca-Cola deliverers, hunted for a lone carload of supposed witnesses and even warily consulted a psychic.
"No other case gets to you like a child's case," said Jerry Giorgio, a veteran homicide detective who over three decades has worked on some of the city's biggest cases. "Does it make you stay longer?," he asked. "Work harder? Absolutely!"
 
A Few Small Clues; Many Big Questions
 The search began on July 23, a Tuesday, when Mr. Perdue, working for the Jana Construction Company of Yonkers on the stretch of roadway north of Dyckman Street, sighted the Igloo cooler about 50 feet down the hill along a path through the underbrush. The workers had been bothered for days by a foul smell from the woods, and he ordered two men to investigate.
The cooler was covered with torn-off tree branches. The men tipped it over, spilling out some liquid, the soda cans and a black plastic garbage bag. A strong stench drove them away, but they returned with a shovel and cut open the bag. They saw a leg and an arm, and fled to report the find.
All the police could see at first was that the body was a child's, tied up, doubled-over, with a cord running from the neck to under the knees. The features were decomposed. "If that was my child I wouldn't have known who it was," said Detective Neenan.
In the police lab, technicians found no fingerprints. The prints may have been coated or erased by the caustic body chemicals.
But if the facts were few, investigators had some ideas. The very location suggested something to them. "We were confident it was someone from the New York area," Detective Giorgio said. "That area was known by whoever put the body there."
And from the Igloo company, detectives learned that the cooler was made in 1989 in East Houston, Tex. The company was able to determine that 79 coolers of that batch had been shipped to New York State. But the dealers did not keep records of purchasers.
Detective Neenan took photos of the body to the Police Department's art unit for a sketch. Officer Robert Philios, one of the artists, was not optimistic. He had no distinct features to go on.
The next afternoon, the Medical Examiner's office called with preliminary autopsy results. The black-haired child, who was white and possibly Hispanic, was about 4 years old and stood 3 feet 2 inches tall. The remains weighed 20 pounds, 5 or 10 less than when she died, pathologists estimated. Eye color and blood type were no longer ascertainable.
She was nude except for an elastic hair band with two colored balls, suggesting that she may have worn her hair in a pony tail. She had no broken bones and no discernible bruises, although the decomposition made it hard to tell. Her condition suggested that she had been in the cooler three to five days, but could have been there up to two weeks if there had been ice in it. Death was attributed to "homicidal asphyxia" -- smothering.
Sgt. Mark Giffen, who works in the examiner's office and is a licensed mortician, filled out the face with cotton. "For the first time," said Detective Neenan, "I could see a child."
Based on new photographs, another department artist, Frank Domingo, was able to make a sketch that highlighted what was probably a distinctive facial feature: parted lips and prominent front teeth. Depicting the child as gaunt from malnourishment also seemed to age her well beyond her years; she looked almost teen-aged. But with little else to go on, the sketch was released on July 25, along with a hot line number, (212) 598-0071.
 
In a Deluge of Calls, One That Tantalizes
 Predictably, detectives were deluged with calls -- 66 in the first four days. One woman said the picture resembled the daughter of her cousin, a drug addict in East Harlem. "I haven't seen the girl in months," she said.
Another caller urged detectives to look for a woman and two men in an apartment on West 107th Street. "Ask them about the cooler," he said. Detective Giorgio tracked down the apartment's occupants. One was a healthy young girl. The caller, he surmised, was a disgruntled neighbor.
Improbably, three callers in widely separated parts of the metropolitan area alerted the police to the same woman who, all said, was notoriously abusive of her daughter. She may have been -- but the daughter was alive.
Three days into the investigation, Detective Giorgio took a call from a woman dialing from a pay phone. She said she had seen something on the parkway about two weeks earlier, but, she said, her family didn't want to get involved.
The detective coaxed out a few details. The woman said she and her family had been driving past the site on Sunday morning, July 14, when they saw a man and a woman walking north on the east side of the parkway, carrying a cooler.
That was all she was going to say. Detective Giorgio begged her to stay on the line. At least, he appealed, she could tell him what they looked like.
In the background he could hear what sounded like store noises, perhaps a cash register. The woman was out shopping somewhere, he guessed. He offered to call her back. "No! No!" the caller replied, sounding panicked. She dropped in some more coins and let slip that she was from Westchester.
She refused to say more, but finally agreed to call back using a pseudonym, Judy Brown.
She didn't call. In desperation Detective Giorgio gave the story to the Westchester papers, appealing for Judy Brown to call. A few days later, a younger-sounding woman hesitantly called -- the daughter, Detective Giorgio surmised. She described the couple on the road as Hispanic, possibly "Mexican or South American," the man about 5 foot 6 in his 40's with a light brown complexion and dark hair. He was wearing a brown sports jacket. The woman, she said, was about the same height and age. She had a light brown complexion and shoulder-length dark hair. She was wearing a gray dress and high heels -- hardly picnic attire, the detective thought.
The description prompted questions: Why were the couple walking along a highway? How did they get there? If by car, where did they leave it? If by foot, didn't other people see them?
It remains a tantalizing clue. But no other witnesses have come forward.
 
Computer Codes And Lab Analysis
 On July 29, detectives spoke to Coca -Cola's regional manager of technical services, Thomas Smith, who told them of an inked code on the bottom of cans that shows where they were made. But the markings were missing on the cans. Tests indicated they had not been erased but had probably dissolved from the putrifaction in the cooler.
But Mr. Smith was able to read another code on the cans' sides showing that they were made in Danbury, Conn., on June 18, and shipped to the Coca-Cola plant on East 149th Street in the Bronx near the Hunts Point Market. Detectives Neenan and Giorgio visited the market at 4:30 the next morning, giving Coca-Cola deliverers 6,000 fliers with the girl's sketch.
On Aug. 1, the Medical Examiner's office called in a consultant, Peggy C. Caldwell, a forensic anthropologist affiliated with Rutgers University. She urged investigators to expand rather than narrow the field. She said the child was not necessarily Hispanic, and, judging from the fact that she had all her baby teeth but none of her adult teeth, was anywhere from 3 to 5.
Ms. Caldwell also said that when a body decomposes in a small space, blood tends to discolor the teeth. The girl's teeth were only slightly discolored. She concluded that the body had started to decompose elsewhere and that it had been put in the cooler later, perhaps to move it.
On the basis of Judy Brown's date of July 14, detectives sealed off the southbound parkway on Aug. 4, also a Sunday, stopping motorists to hand them leaflets and the sketch of the girl. The aim was to make contact with the woman or her relatives, who might be making regular Sunday excursions to the city, as well as any other witnesses.
In all, on that day and others, some 10,000 leaflets were distributed.
A tip came from an informant that someone was going around the neighborhood showing a photo of a man said to be the killer. The family wanted the killer alive, the story went, and was willing to pay $15,000. Excited, detectives fanned out, but discovered that the man in the photo was wanted in connection with a drug vendetta; the little girl was being invoked as a way of smoking him out. Frustrated and disgusted, they abandoned that trail.
On Aug. 28, the Medical Examiner's office reported dramatic new information. Laboratory tests now revealed traces of semen, suggesting that the girl had been sexually abused. The tests yielded little more. But the results strengthened suspicions that the killer may have been a close male relative, the father or stepfather, in keeping with a pattern often seen in child sex abuse cases. The fact that the family had not reported the child missing buttressed the idea.
The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Arlington, Va., helped prepare a new picture, using a computer to mesh various facial characteristics, which Officer Domingo then fashioned into a new sketch that was released on Sept. 11.
 
Now, Officers Search For New Approaches
 Along with the false leads, the case has elicited an outpouring of compassion. Close to two dozen callers, including representatives of a funeral home and a cemetery, have offered to pay for the girl's burial when her body is eventually released by the Medical Examiner's office. One young woman who wrote that she was single and unemployed also offered money and sent in a pink ribbon for the child, whom she said she was calling "Ariel."
"I call her 'Ariel' after 'The Little Mermaid,' " she wrote, "because all little girls want to be a little mermaid. Please put the ribbon in her hair. She deserves it."
Like his men, Lieutenant Reznick went back to the scene several times, looking for missed clues. "Usually I get a sense of what took place," he said. But this location was hard to read. Why there? "If you look around," he said, "there are a million and one other places they could have gone."
He acknowledged that some of his men have talked to a psychic, who has visited the site and "calls periodically if she has a dream."
"Green comes to her, the color or a name, an old-type station wagon and an underpass," Lieutenant Resnick said with a shrug. "But God forbid she tells you something you ignore that turns out to be good."
Now, he is looking for unconventional approaches. Watching a video of "Kindergarten Cop" with his sons gave him the idea of tapping schools for help. Perhaps teachers around the city could ask pupils about family members and neighbors, on the chance that one might mention a missing sister or friend. He said the Board of Education has agreed to try it.
One night last week a caller phoned in another tip on the case involving a car in the Bronx. It would prove to be another dead end, but Detectives Neenan and Giorgio and the Lieutenant set off to check it out.
"You got the cuffs, Joe?" Detective Giorgio asked. "Just in case."

HEADLINE: Wasteful Taxes on Waste

 BODY:
Nearly all the 48 contiguous states ship some of their garbage to landfills in other states. This traffic in garbage is environmentally and economically sound. Even so, some states are asking Congress to pass a law restricting interstate shipments. It's a perverse idea.
In the past few years, eight states have passed laws imposing tariffs or bans on imported garbage. After the courts found that these laws violated the interstate commerce clause, the states asked Congress to let them levy tariffs on trash. The proposed law would use a sliding scale, assigning lower tariffs to wastes that are shipped between contiguous states and higher tariffs -- more than $50 a ton in some cases -- to wastes that are sent to distant states. 
 About 15 million tons of garbage were shipped in interstate commerce from 43 states and the District of Columbia in 1989 and 1990, 8 percent of the total municipal solid waste. Officials who seek authority to tax imports say they want to keep their own landfills free of imported wastes. They're also eager to avoid political criticism for taking in outside garbage.
Yet tariffs would be counterproductive, for two reasons. Tariffs on shipments between states are bad economics whether they apply to shipment of garbage, television sets or anything else. They're also bad environmentally, in part because they would make the financing of large, state-of-the-art landfills much more difficult to arrange.
Environmentally acceptable landfills require heavy capital investment. But the tariffs would discourage, if not end altogether, the out-of-state shipments on which landfill owners depend to recoup their large initial investment.
That, in turn, would prolong the life of small, insecure landfills that do not meet modern standards, and deprive depressed rural areas of a chance to increase their own tax revenues. The tariffs would also inhibit efforts by railroads eager to increase rail transport of solid waste.
The tariff issue has arisen now partly because Congress is moving to re-authorize the national solid waste management act, known as RCRA. Instead of imposing tariffs, RCRA should be modified to stimulate the replacement of inadequate dumps with large, modern, high-technology landfills, to which all states alike would be eligible to ship their garbage without penalty.

HEADLINE: Europe Gives Up on Yugoslavia

 BODY:
Yugoslavia's murderous conflicts defy easy resolution. But that's no justification for walking away from them, as Western Europe's leaders have now all but done.
The failure of European institutions to respond more effectively to the first forcible change in European borders since World War II is all the more disheartening since similar, but more dangerous, conflicts could easily emerge from a fracturing Soviet Union. It's now up to the United Nations to impose an equitable peace. 
 Serbian and Croatian leaders have contributed to the escalating Yugoslav violence, but in unequal measures. Croatia's President, Franjo Tudjman, alienated his republic's Serbian minority with nationalistic rhetoric and legislation.
But Serbia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, far more gravely affronted international rules of behavior by arming rebel Serbian militias and using the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Army to enforce huge territorial claims.
Militarily, the conflict is a mismatch in Mr. Milosevic's favor. Yet at best, all he can hope to win is an enlarged but ruined country, shunned by its neighbors and populated by revenge-seeking minorities. At worst, Serbian aggression could trigger wider war.
Bulgaria and Greece have longstanding rival claims to Macedonia. Austria and Germany have already come under heavy domestic pressure to defend Slovenia and what remains of Croatia. Hungary has begun talking about the need to defend its airspace against Yugoslav Air Force overflights and worries also about the fate of ethnic Hungarians now under Serbian rule.
The European Community's mediation efforts failed when the Yugoslav parties refused to stop fighting. With no armed force of its own, the Community was hardly in a position to separate rival armies. At that point, community leaders referred the matter to the Western European Union, the organization that coordinated participation in the Persian Gulf war. But Britain strongly opposed any armed peacekeeping effort, and so the Union decided not to become involved.
Incredibly, some European leaders act as if they can simply wash their hands of this catastrophe in the inflammable Balkans. All that grandiose talk in recent months of new collective security arrangements in a post-cold-war Europe now appears to be just that, grandiose talk.
Hope for heading off further disasters lies with the United Nations. Canada, Austria and Australia have asked it to take up the Yugoslav crisis.
U.N. tradition also favors direct involvement only after a cease-fire has come into full effect. U.N. action is further complicated by the fact that the Yugoslav federation, though now a political fiction, remains a member state. That makes the conflict nominally an internal affair.
But the U.N. Charter permits more decisive action, as shown repeatedly in Iraq. Such action includes not only armed intervention but enforceable economic sanctions and disarmament measures.
At a minimum, the U.N. and its member states, including the United States, can drop the paralyzing pretense that federal Yugoslavia still exists. That would free the world body to stop what is already a shooting war between two states and threatens to involve more.

HEADLINE: Soviets Should Try Henry George Land Plan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Since the unsuccessful Soviet coup, Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Boris N. Yeltsin are accelerating the transition from socialism to the market. 
 In July 1908 Count Leo Tolstoy proposed that Russia adopt Henry George's principles of land value taxation to solve some of Russia'a economic and social justice problems. These ideas by George, an American economist and a contemporary of Karl Marx, are still relevant today.
After the Czar abdicated, land taken from the nobility and unoccupied land were divided and taxed on their value. To reward enterprise, no tax was applied to crops or improvements (buildings). Large landholdings were eliminated "to promote the reconstruction of the economy based on the free union of toil and land."
Fired by Marx's ideology, Lenin rejected this reform. On Nov. 8, 1917, the second Congress of Soviets declared: "The right to private property in the land is annulled forever." He was the first to denounce two million prosperous peasants and proclaimed: "Merciless war against these kulaks! Death to them."
Huge, inefficient state collective farms should now be broken up and the land placed into private title. The peasants should pay a tax based on land value, excluding improvements, to promote production and efficiency.
Tolstoy saw the importance of the land issue in Russian life. He knew that reconciliation would require a new concept, neither capitalist nor socialist, but a synthesis of both. Now, 80 years after his plea for a land policy based on the ideas of Henry George, the Soviets have another opportunity.

BYLINE: By GEORGE JOHNSON

 BODY:
DISCOVERING: Inventing and Solving Problems at the Frontiers of Scientific Knowledge, by Robert Scott Root-Bernstein. (Harvard University, $15.95.) Measured in terms of money spent or papers published, 20th-century science is undergoing an explosion of growth. So, the author asks, why are there so few truly astounding discoveries? Last year our reviewer, Marcia Bartusiak, said this book, which is written in the form of a conversation among six voices, is "sometimes frustrating, chaotic and, in several places, obscure, but it is also surprising and thought-provoking."
MARY SHELLEY: Romance and Reality, by Emily W. Sunstein. (Johns Hopkins University, $15.95.) Though she was best known for writing "Frankenstein" at age 19 and for her brief marriage to Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Shelley's life was far from over when he died. This book "promises to be the definitive biography," Carolyn Heilbrun said in The Book Review in 1989: "Ms. Sunstein is to be praised for looking anew at so misunderstood a life." Johns Hopkins University has also republished THE GODWINS AND THE SHELLEYS: The Biography of a Family ($16.95), in which William St. Clair brings to life the political and cultural world of Mary Shelley's father, William Godwin. "The reader comes away with the feeling that he has witnessed a panorama of intellectual history," Leslie A. Marchand said here in 1989. 
 THE TELEPHONE BOOK: Technology, Schizophrenia, Electric Speech, by Avital Ronell. (University of Nebraska, $20.) Beginning with Directory Assistance instead of a table of contents and ending with Yellow Pages instead of notes and an index, this book casts the seemingly mundane activity of talking on the telephone as a symptom of a schizophrenic society whose main cultural activity is talking to itself. Last year our reviewer, Robert Coover, called the book "rhetorically provocative and typographically dazzling," though he said "static and disorder threaten to overtake the text."
LOW CITY, HIGH CITY: Tokyo From Edo to the Earthquake, by Edward Seidensticker. (Harvard University, $14.95.) From the beginning of the reign of the Emperor Meiji in 1867 to the earthquake that all but obliterated Tokyo in 1923, Edward Seidensticker shows how Japan began its emergence as a world power. "A stylist of great attainments, Mr. Seidensticker has a nice way with an aphorism, and his prose is studded with observations that linger in the memory," Robert C. Christopher said here in 1983. Harvard University has also published a paperback edition of Mr. Seidensticker's sequel, TOKYO RISING: The City Since the Great Earthquake, in which he laments the passing of some of the old ways. Last year our reviewer, Jay McInerney, called the book "a loving elegy to a lost city."
DEMOCRACY AND ITS CRITICS, by Robert A. Dahl. (Yale University, $17.) At the end of this examination of democracy, a political scientist reflects on how to insure that self-government thrives in the next century. In 1989 our reviewer, Robert N. Bellah, called the book "a work of extraordinary intelligence and, what is even rarer, a work of extraordinary wisdom."
BANKS AND POLITICS IN AMERICA: From the Revolution to the Civil War, by Bray Hammond. (Princeton University, $24.95.) A former Federal Reserve Board official shows what it was like when American banks operated without Government control. In 1957 our reviewer, Louis M. Hacker, called this "an important book filled with all sorts of wise remarks illuminating our early national history in all its many facets, political, literary and economic, as few recent historical works have."
PALESTINE AND ISRAEL: The Uprising and Beyond, by David McDowall. (University of California, $13.95.) A Middle East scholar traces the roots of the intifada and Israel's suppression of it. Last year our reviewer, Benny Morris, said "the major strengths of Mr. McDowall's book are in his analysis of the present and projections for the future."
DOWNTOWN, INC.: How America Rebuilds Cities, by Bernard J. Frieden and Lynne B. Sagalyn. (MIT, $14.95.) One of the most important lessons urban planners have learned, the authors say, is how to revitalize America's downtowns by turning them into shopping malls. Last year our reviewer, Edward A. Schwartz, called this book "the most insightful commentary on up-to-the-minute urban development that has appeared to date."
THE ARROGANCE OF FAITH: Christianity and Race in America From the Colonial Era to the Twentieth Century, by Forrest G. Wood. (Northeastern University, $16.95.) Of all the world's religions, the author argues, Christianity has been especially racist because of its "inherent inability to leave other people alone." Last year The Times said the tales of how the Bible was used to justify the persecution of blacks and Indians "make perversely fascinating reading."
IS SCIENCE NECESSARY? Essays on Science and Scientists, by Max F. Perutz. (Oxford University, $9.95.) When these essays and book reviews by the man who unraveled the structure of hemoglobin were published in 1989, our reviewer, Robert Kanigel, said the author "emerges as a decent, committed scientist who takes a layman's delight in the lives and work of other scientists."

HEADLINE: STAGE VIEW;
The Last of the One-Man Shows

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
When Joseph Papp announced last month that he was appointing JoAnne Akalaitis to succeed him as artistic director of the New York Shakespeare Festival, he also announced, almost incidentally, that he would retain the title of "producer." It remains to be seen whether the post will prove honorary or real, but there has been nothing symbolic about Mr. Papp's identification with the role of producer until now. Joseph Papp has been the most important producer in the New York theater, period, for most of his 35-year-long career. In recent seasons, as the other most significant producers of his generation stopped producing altogether (Harold Prince), left New York (Roger Stevens), died (Richard Barr) or reduced their output to a trickle (David Merrick), Mr. Papp has been the only giant left on the field.
This is why his illness-induced departure at age 70 has thrown the already reeling New York theater community into a deeper funk. There is much love for the man himself, a famously impossible character whose stormy, larger-than-life personality is the very essence of theater. There is much uncertainty about the future of the New York Shakespeare Festival, the institution Mr. Papp created in his own image and built into the most influential theatrical organization in the United States. But Mr. Papp's semi-retirement also baldly dramatizes the increasing decline and possible extinction of the theatrical tradition, that of the impresario, which he represents. 
 Without producers like Mr. Papp, the theater cannot thrive in New York, on or Off Broadway. Rather than a lack of theatrical talent, it is the dwindling of the producers' ranks that is most responsible for the New York theater's current state of depletion and disarray. On Broadway, where most independent producers have long since been driven away by skyrocketing costs, the concomitant decline in production is by now an old story. As Mr. Papp demonstrated, nonprofit companies Off Broadway need producers, too -- whether they call themselves artistic directors or not -- to create activity and excitement. But nonprofit companies are not geared to creating producers, either -- Mr. Papp had no in-house heir apparent -- and much of a generation of young producing talent has been lost to the film, television and music industries. Ms. Akalaitis, 54, whose primary theatrical experience has been as a director, must rise to the role of producer if the Shakespeare Festival is not to become another casualty of the New York theatrical malaise.
What is a producer? It is almost easier to say what a producer is not. A producer is not a playwright or, most of the time, a particularly gifted director. (Mr. Papp did direct on occasion, but often out of necessity and never, in my experience, memorably.) A producer does not have to be an intellectual, a businessman or a manager. No specific training is required. Magic is, even if it is only pulled off with mirrors and smoke. What a producer does, usually out of view, is cause plays to be produced and induce people into attending those plays. A producer is not an artist but makes it possible for artists to do their best work and find an audience. To accomplish this, a producer must have the cunning of a master politician, the wiliness of a snake-oil salesman, the fanatical drive of a megalomaniac and, given the eternal precariousness of the New York theater, nerves of steel. It doesn't hurt, either, to have some taste and a consuming passion for the stage.
Mr. Papp is the most spectacular case in point. He has all these attributes and then some, including an idealism that led him to fight for freedom of expression throughout his career, from his refusal to cooperate with the House Un-American Activities Committee through his earliest struggles with Robert Moses to pursue Shakespeare in Central Park, his 1973 altercation with CBS over the broadcast of the anti-Vietnam War play "Sticks and Bones" and his recent battles against the National Endowment for the Arts. To appreciate fully how great a producer Mr. Papp has been, however, one cannot merely note the familiar laundry list of landmark shows and fervent causes associated with his name but must understand that he leaves the New York theater an almost completely different place than he found it.
 
The Past Is Prologue
How the Power Changed Hands
 In 1956, when Mr. Papp, still supporting himself by working as a stage manager at CBS, presented his first free Shakespeare production at the East River Park Amphitheater, Broadway was the be-all and end-all of American theater. It was a vintage time for Broadway, too -- since arguably the greatest American musical, "My Fair Lady," the greatest American play, "Long Day's Journey Into Night," and the most revolutionary modern play from abroad, "Waiting for Godot," all opened in Broadway houses in 1956. But a decade later, Mr. Papp, having turned Shakespeare in the Park into an institution, opened his indoor theater complex, the Public, and with his very first production, "Hair," started a complete reversal of the power equation of the New York theater.
When "Hair" moved to Broadway, it helped prove that a nonprofit company's theatrical experiments could be the commercial theater's lifeblood, especially at a time when the Broadway theater had fewer and fewer ideas of its own and was increasingly out of touch with the new audience that "Hair" representatively tapped into. By the time "A Chorus Line" moved to Broadway from the Public in 1975, less than a decade after "Hair," it had become standard practice for Broadway theater owners to turn to nonprofit theater companies, whether Off Broadway or beyond New York, for the plays and musicals that could fill their houses. That "A Chorus Line," the quintessential Broadway musical, had originated Off Broadway was the final blow to Broadway's once unchallenged position of supremacy. Today, virtually all Broadway plays and musicals are transfers from nonprofit theaters like the Public, the only perennial exceptions being Neil Simon plays and London imports.
While Mr. Papp was hardly the first and certainly not the sole author of this revolution, he was the most visible and successful of its firebrands. He did not invent either Off Broadway or the nonprofit theater movement, both of which predated his arrival, but he consolidated the new system and made it flourish. He not only gave Broadway the hit musicals to which it is addicted -- a role never contemplated by the early Off Broadway movement -- but he also supplied it with prickly yet crowd-drawing plays like "That Championship Season," "For Colored Girls" and "Plenty."
Paradoxically enough, he beat Broadway at its own game by reviving the lost arts of high-stakes artistic gambling and nonstop promotion that had once made the Great White Way an electrifying venue. His motives, to be sure, were different than those of most commercial producers. He was not out to make money for himself (though he was not always above searching for patently commercial projects to shore up institutional deficits, especially with his post-"Chorus Line" musicals). He believed in a truly public theater -- one that, ideally, would not only have free admission (achieved in the park, not at the Public) but would also cater to many tastes, including those excluded from Broadway by high ticket prices and middlebrow, middle-class values. He wanted a racially and ethnically diverse theater on both sides of the footlights, one that might change, or at least nudge, the world.
Even so, he practiced many of the same skills that had once defined razzle-dazzle Broadway entrepreneurship. Though he did not need to hunt down investors eager for glamour and profit, he did have to solicit contributions from public and private sponsors looking for civic prestige. Though he did not have to fill seats to meet his payroll, he did have to fill seats to keep the Shakespeare Festival in the public eye -- for without prominence, his theater could not attract exciting artists and its essential philanthropic subsidies. Most important, Mr. Papp, like any prolific commercial producer, had to gain the loyalty of writers, directors and actors of all sorts, unknown and famous alike, and he had to do it by the sheer force of his personality and that of his theater, not by financial inducements that could hope to match Broadway's, let alone Hollywood's.
 
Entr'acte
An Autocrat Partial to Schmaltz
 When Mr. Papp had been in the service in World War II, he was called "Mr. Show Biz" for the variety entertainments he produced (and sometimes emceed) for the stateside United States Naval Reserve. And Mr. Show Biz he remained. Just as he broke Broadway's rules, so he broke Off Broadway's, refusing to strike the notes of pious altruism and cultural high-mindedness that have inflated too many of the pioneers and apostles of the nonprofit theater movement (and some of their theaters) into pompous bores.
Mr. Papp wrote his own ticket. Like an egomaniacal showman out of the Ziegfeld era, he chomped a cigar in television commercials, plastered his name (and sometimes his picture) over advertisements and marquees, gave outrageous interviews and announced grandiose projects that never materialized. He actually put together a nightclub act, performed with top hat and tails and drenched in schmaltz, in the late 1970's.
Nor did Mr. Papp shy from public squabbles with city officials and journalists when he wanted publicity or felt his theater or others, including Broadway's, were threatened. If there is a critic Mr. Papp did not yell at in the Public lobby -- certainly I was not exempt -- chances are Mr. Papp did not read him. Probably few playwrights or directors, no matter how sacrosanct, were exempt from the Papp fury, either.
Make no mistake about it: Mr. Papp sold his shows to the hilt, even if the goal was not to line his own pockets. Not the least of his achievements was to sell the public on Shakespeare, for without Mr. Papp's Shakespeare productions, as wildly variable as they are and always have been, it is hard to see what would have kept the canon a continuous presence in the New York theater, as opposed to the classroom, over 35 years.
Like most great producers in any branch of show business, Mr. Papp was an autocrat; there were no committee decisions at the Shakespeare Festival, as there had been at the fractious, short-lived Group Theater of the 1930's, whose goals Mr. Papp's company sometimes shared. And he had his own strong tastes, which were esthetically conservative and politically progressive, not unlike the activist theater, at the Group and elsewhere, of the Depression he grew up in.
The plays closest to Mr. Papp's heart, Shakespeare's always excepted, were those that challenged the establishment about issues like the Vietnam War, race relations and the AIDS crisis and revealed the lives of the underclass. Yet his curiosity compelled him to reach out in other, seemingly contradictory directions. For all his preoccupation with the theater of current events, Mr. Papp was sentimental enough about the past to revive the likes of "The Pirates of Penzance" and "Cafe Crown." For all his championing of American writers (and distinctly American productions of Shakespeare), he embraced English and European playwrights whose social activism echoed his own (notably Vaclav Havel, David Hare and Caryl Churchill). For all his apparent affection for naturalistic agitprop, he encouraged theater that experimented in form, including that of the Mabou Mines, the troupe that introduced him to his successor, JoAnne Akalaitis.
What other producer right now, in the nonprofit or commercial theater, could attract (and work with) talents as varied as Michael Bennett and Richard Foreman, Miguel Pinero and John Guare, Linda Ronstadt and James Earl Jones, David Henry Hwang and Wallace Shawn, Meryl Streep and Eric Bogosian? The mix served Mr. Papp and the New York theater audience equally well because the Shakespeare Festival's more commercial work inevitably helped underwrite its more daring experiments, just as those hits would also lure some of their mainstream audiences into becoming subscribers who would then sample the offbeat productions on the Papp schedule.
This was smart producing of the old school updated for a new age. However inadvertently, the Papp program at the Public echoed the Theater Guild's between-the-wars seasons in which ground-breaking premieres of Shaw and O'Neill would mix with an unconventional, unexpected musical hit like "Oklahoma!" In both his flair for publicity stunts and his eclectic producing schedule, Mr. Papp was not even so far removed from a Broadway archetype like David Merrick, who would use some of the cash generated by a "Hello, Dolly!" (and, in his case, the tax advantage of a nonprofit foundation) to bring New York an angry John Osborne play or the shocking Peter Brook "Marat/Sade."
Who will fill the leadership role of producer in the New York theater now? On Broadway, where producing today is mostly the province of theater owners who book and bankroll shows without creating them, the last attention-grabbing showman, Cameron Mackintosh, is British and only interested in musicals. The other New York producers able to muster more than one show a season are, like Mr. Papp, the artistic directors of nonprofit Off Broadway companies, many of which were founded in emulation of the Public. While none of these producers has yet operated at Mr. Papp's epic scale, Lynne Meadow, at the burgeoning Manhattan Theater Club, and Andre Bishop, soon to move from Playwrights Horizons to Lincoln Center, are poised to expand their already important roles in a brighter economy.
 
The Curtain Rises
A Solo Spotlight, A New Performer
 As for Ms. Akalaitis, she is in an impossible position under the best of circumstances, given the act she must follow, and the circumstances are awful, given the Shakespeare Festival's financial crisis. An ambitious, if uneven, stage director with a knack for stirring up controversy but scant record of collaborating with living American playwrights, Ms. Akalaitis is smart enough to know that she cannot imitate Joseph Papp and must follow her own instincts. But are her instincts those of a producer?
The answer will have little or nothing to do with her talents as a director. If she's doing her job to the fullest, she probably will be directing infrequently anyway. Nor will her producing prowess have much to do with her abilities as an administrator, or her nose for possible Broadway transfers, or her public positions about the Palestinians.
The proposition is simpler than that. Ms. Akalaitis has six theaters at her disposal, five in the Public Theater complex on Lafayette Street and one in Central Park, and her success or failure will ride on her ability, in a highly competitive environment, to attract the broad spectrum of artists and audiences required to make life happen in them. Working in the nonprofit arena, she should not be under any obligation to find the next "Chorus Line," which cannot be divined in any case. But Ms. Akalaitis does live in the real, all-too-American theatrical world; she is not working in a basement performance space or, conversely, in a utopian state-supported theater.
One need look at the season schedule of any company of similar size to the Public, from Arena Stage in Washington to the Goodman Theater in Chicago to the Guthrie in Minneapolis, to see that artistic directors, however different their own creative personalities, follow the Papp example of reaching out to many tastes, many artists.
Ms. Akalaitis will soon be buffeted on all sides by demanding subscribers, board members and donors, with all their various interests. She will have to give them and other audiences reasons to come to her theater by engaging them, challenging them, provoking them and maybe even, on occasion, entertaining them. She cannot cause a stir with every production, heaven knows -- the Public has traditionally been the site of as many fiascos as any other long-running theatrical institution -- but with the sum of what must be diverse, searching and professional seasons. It will take time, though how much time the increasingly pressed board of the Festival can or will give her is a fiscal and temperamental matter known only to them.
One hopes that JoAnne Akalaitis will be the producer that no less an authority than the man who appointed her thinks she can be. If she is, the New York theater will then only have to find a good half-dozen more like her if it is to begin to fill the almost unfathomable void in vision, energy and sheer guts left by the exit of Joseph Papp.

HEADLINE: A Look at the New South Africa

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN; CHRISTOPHER S. WREN is the Johannesburg bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
THERE is a country of sunshine, sandy beaches, verdant mountains, flaming sunsets and star-blanketed night skies, a land of friendly people and exotic wildlife as marvelously diverse as Creation itself. It is a place where the dollar stretches twice or three times as far as it does on Cape Cod or in the Bahamas, where a good dinner can cost less than $20, a bottle of vintage wine $5 and an air-conditioned B.M.W. sedan rents for hardly more than a Volkswagen at other vacation destinations.
Before you rush to book a trip, there is one more detail you need to know -- the place is South Africa. 
 So many visitors have remarked on the landscape of South Africa that the late writer Alan Paton used their response as the title for his novel, "Ah, but Your Land Is Beautiful!" Beautiful, undeniably, but for years avoided by all but a handful of American tourists because of a system that legislated the worth of its citizens according to the color of their skin. The affront to human dignity created by apartheid drastically reduced South Africa's desirability as a vacation destination; tourists want to believe the best of the places they pay to see.
"I believe that without apartheid, South Africa would be much farther down the road than it is," said Spencer Thomas, the executive director of the South African Tourism Board in Pretoria.
With the dismantling of apartheid undertaken by President F. W. de Klerk, South Africa is getting second looks from travel agents as an enticing and little-known destination. Only the sporadic outbreaks of violence in the segregated black townships, removed from the tourist centers, continue to undermine its appeal.
President de Klerk's reforms have gone far toward eliminating the problems of marketing South Africa to tourists. "We've received several inquiries from investors saying, 'We believe tourism has a great future in South Africa. Tell us how to get involved,' " Mr. Thomas said, though he declined to identify the investors.
Most tourists will travel for the scenery and wildlife. Many Americans have heard of luxury resorts like Mala Mala near Kruger National Park, in the eastern Transvaal, but cheaper outdoor adventures abound, like the trail walk through the Umfolozi wilderness reserve in northern Natal to view the rhinoceroses, lions and other game. The three-day walk, run by the Natal Parks Board, currently costs 400 rand, about $140, including food, shelter and armed guides -- and, not suprisingly, it has a six-month waiting list. There are tent safaris in other national parks, rafting or kayak excursions on the Orange or Tugela Rivers and hikes in the Drakensburg, a mountain range in southwestern Natal, whose windswept peaks reach 10,000 feet. For those who prefer to laze on a beach, Plettenberg Bay, Cape Province, offers South Africa's answer to St. Tropez, where the local jet set go to winter.
For American tourists, the political stigma is no longer the main barrier to a visit, but rather the distance to be traveled and the cost. At present, there are no direct flights to Johannesburg from the United States. The journey from New York requires two overnight flights and a day between them sitting in some European airport. Although the trip is less strenuous with a stopover in London, Paris or Lisbon, Mr. Thomas said most overseas visitors want a direct flight.
Direct flights seem inevitable once South African Airways and a reciprocal United States carrier, yet to be named, renegotiate the landing rights abrogated in 1986 when the United States Congress imposed a sanctions package. The sanctions were repealed in July this year. Austrian Airlines, China Airlines in Taiwan and Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong have recently inaugurated regular flights to South Africa.
The full fare for what adds up to 20 hours of flying from New York is expensive -- currently $2,353 one way from New York -- though excursion rates can bring the round-trip price down to $2,100. Once in South Africa, the tourist will find that the rand, now worth less than 36 cents, will buy in Johannesburg's hotels, restaurants and shops what a dollar buys in the United States. The rand is weak against the dollar -- presently about 2.86 to $1; some years ago the rand was worth $2.
Not everyone has avoided South Africa and its relatively low prices. According to the Government statistics, over a million foreigners visited in 1990, although many were not ordinary tourists. They generated nearly $1 billion in foreign exchange earnings and supported 300,000 local jobs. Over half of these visitors came from neighboring African countries, including 255,998 from Zimbabwe, crossing the border to shop or see relatives. Other foreigners came on business. Fedhasa, an organization representing the South African hotel, restaurant and beverage industries, regards only about a quarter of the foreign visitors as conventional tourists.
"The true tourists are where we see the greatest expansion," said Peter Hearfield, the executive director of Fedhasa, estimating that their number could quadruple to one million in three years. The Government is studying how to sell South Africa as part of a regional destination that would include Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia.
Americans accounted for 47,425 visitors in 1990, or nearly 11,000 fewer than in 1985, before the sanctions. By comparison, 135,404 traveled from Britain, many of them to visit relatives, and 83,443 from Germany. Americans still need a South African visa, and for years every applicant was scrutinized as a potential anti-apartheid agitator; now getting a visa takes two or three weeks.
With 17 African airlines now serving South Africa, Mr. Thomas said, he also anticipated a growth in tourists from other African countries. "They are a very important source of revenue for us," he said. "I think the markets in black Africa have been underestimated in the past."
Many travelers from other continents, of course, will be attracted by winter sunshine. Because South Africa is in the Southern Hemisphere, winter in New York becomes summer in Johannesburg. Summer is hot, with lots of humidity around Durban and showers in the afternoon around Johannesburg. The winter generally is more akin to California's mild weather. Cape Town can be ideal in January and February when Durban, another port city, swelters in the high humidity of the Indian Ocean. Horst Witt, head of Senator Travel Service in Johannesburg, sends his clients on the Garden Route, a lush coastal drive from Port Elizabeth to Cape Town, from October to April, and to Kruger National Park, one of the country's great game reserves, from May to October.
With nearly 92,000 hotel beds nationwide, South Africa offers a sophisticated infrastructure, its telephone system and roads superior to those in almost any other African country. Service is another matter; tourists find it uneven at restaurants, stores, banks and even the state-owned South African Airways. Attentive service is not a tradition and South Africans are not used to catering to tourists. "Presently a service ethic is lacking and standards are perceived to be dropping in most sectors of the industry," said a government study released in June.
However, hotels like the Mount Nelson in Cape Town or the Royal in Durban rank among the world's best in service, luxury and ambiance. Other hotels popular with tourists include the Carlton in Johannesburg, the Cape Sun in Cape Town and the Burgerspark in Pretoria, and there are many first-class, smaller country inns like, for example, the Coach House in Tzaneen in the eastern Transvaal. Holiday Inns is the only major hotel chain so far. Americans are likely to admire the luxury of the Blue Train, which makes the 900-mile trip between Johannesburg and Cape Town and has been compared in its opulence to the old Orient Express. Because of the distance and cost involved in a visit, travel specialists expect South Africa to continue to attract individual tourists rather than group tours.
For all the world attention focused on apartheid, the irony is that a tourist may never see it. Hotels, restaurants, theaters and sports events are integrated in the cities. Johannesburg, with its throngs of black shoppers, looks as unself-conscious in its variety of people as New York. The drab black townships, where the political violence has occurred, have been tucked well out of sight of the tidy white suburbs.
It is possible to see the high spots of South Africa without ever confronting squalid squatter camps fashioned from cast-off shipping crates, corrugated metal and plastic. The apartheid legacy is not something that the Government is eager to market.
Even so, private entrepreneurs run tours to Soweto, the country's largest and most famous township, and the tour guides, who live in Soweto, talk candidly and sometimes angrily about conditions there. The Natal Museum in Pietermaritzburg is one of several museums assembling a permanent exhibition demonstrating what life for the black majority has been like under apartheid. Johannesburg's Market Theater complex (which has drawn racially mixed audiences for years) offers plays by Athol Fugard and other South African playwrights that grapple with the apartheid experience. And South Africans, black and white, seem almost eager to share their thoughts and experiences with visitors.
The Government has committed itself to developing the country as a vacation destination, in part to generate more jobs for blacks. "Travel, tourism and hospitality have a vital role to play in solving many of the socioeconomic problems facing our society in the years ahead," President de Klerk told a Fedhasa meeting in August. However, although the Government has done a study about promoting tourism, it has yet to set aside any funds for that purpose.
The uniqueness of South Africa is characterized in one lovely nature preserve that ends abruptly at the Cape of Good Hope, not quite the southernmost tip of Africa. That distinction belongs to Cape Agulhas, a less dramatic promontory some 65 miles to the east. But from the old lighthouse atop the cliffs at the Cape of Good Hope, one peers into what pre-Columbian navigators supposed was the edge of the world.
Beyond the ragged rocks throwing up towers of sea spray lies a slate blue sea that stretches beyond the horizon toward Antarctica's frozen shores. The sandstone cliffs below are populated with hundreds of Cape cormorants, hardy brown waterfowl with wingspans as formidably sleek as a jetfighter's. Tucked below the headlands between the Cape of Storms and the Cape of Good Hope lies a crescent of bright sand as fine as salt. The rolling dunes give way to the moors, where one passes ostriches and baboons, and sometimes zebra and antelope.
Alan Paton's friends got it right: this land is beautiful.
 
 
 
TOUR AGENCIES REPORT SURGE OF INTEREST FROM CLIENTS
 Tour operators in the United States say that interest in South Africa had increased considerably by the time the United States suspended its economic sanctions against South Africa this summer.
According to the South African Tourism Board, 1990 was the first year that the number of foreign visitors entering South Africa surpassed the one million mark. Of those, 59,503 were from the United States and Canada, compared with 46,058 in 1987 when sanctions were firmly in place.
"When Mandela was released, South Africa was put back on the map," said Jacky Keith, whose Boston-based Esplanade Tours now offers eight South African itineraries. In the nearly two months since the lifting of sanctions, Esplanade and other companies, including Safariworld in New York, which started offering tours to South Africa two years ago, have noted a "tremendous" increase in inquiries.
Many of these inquiries are hedged with a wait-and-see attitude, but if political reforms keep coming, said Gil Zalman, president of Safariworld, "South Africa may become the main tourist attraction in Africa by 1993 or 1994."
People interested in going to South Africa may wish to bear in mind the State Department's travel advisory (July 19, 1991), which cautions that the "political situation in South Africa remains unsettled," and the potential for right-wing, pro-apartheid violence may increase.
The advisory notes that tourist areas, such as game parks and beaches, are unlikely to be affected.
Visas, which can be obtained from the South African Embassy and consulates in the United States are free. At least two weeks, preferably one month, should be allowed for processing.
The South African Tourism Board, 747 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017; telephone (212) 838-8841, can provide a list of the more than 20 companies that offer tours from the United States. They include the following:
Abercrombie & Kent International, 1520 Kensington Road, Suite 212, Oak Brook, Ill. 60521; (800) 323-7308), which suspended all its South African tours when sanctions went into effect five years ago, is resuming them next year.
Discoveries of Southern Africa, a 15-day exploration of South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana, combines visits to Johannesburg and Cape Town with game-viewing in Chobe National Park in Botswana and sightseeing at Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe. Prices are not yet available.
Esplanade Tours, 581 Boylston Street, Boston, Mass. 02116; (800) 628-4893, offers a 21-day Grand Tour of South Africa, which includes a three-night safari in Kruger National Park, a cultural tour through Swaziland and Zululand, a trip down the scenic Garden Route, which runs along the Indian Ocean between Port Elizabeth and George, and a ride on the luxurious, blue-painted
Blue Train from Cape Town to Johannesburg.
The cost is $5,663, round trip from New York and other East Coast cities. Departures are monthly.
Safariworld, 425 Madison Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017; (212) 486-0505, has a 15-day Discover South Africa tour, which includes visits to all the major cities, two nights on the Garden Route and a trip on the Blue Train. Land cost: approximately $2,600, subject to change. Monthly departures.
Sartravel, 1100 East Broadway, Glendale, Calif. 91205; (800) 727-7207, offers a 16-day tour that includes stops in Johannesburg, Durban, Cape Town and a three-day safari for $2,595, round trip from New York. Departures on Nov. 18 and 25.
South African Airways, (800) 722-9675, which, at this time, does not fly out of North America, can arrange connecting service with many American carriers through European cities, including London, Geneva and Paris.
The round-trip economy fare from New York starts at $2,099 and allows a stay of from 13 days to two months. The airline expects to have direct service from New York before the end of this year. -- SUZANNE MacNEILLE

HEADLINE: New Mexico's Mysterious Anasazi Ruins

BYLINE: By DAVID LASKIN; DAVID LASKIN is a frequent visitor to the Southwest.

 BODY:
THE blinding sun searches deep into the crevices of rocks that were hewn, dressed and arranged centuries ago. The patterns and placement of the broken walls stand in perfect harmony with the surrounding land forms. A lizard scurries out, then freezes on a stone that was darkened ages since by the soot of ceremonial fires. If it wasn't for the pinon pines, the scrub juniper and the sheer canyon cliffs, one might almost imagine oneself at some remote Greek ruin hidden away in Thessaly or the Pelopennesus. But this is New Mexico, and these are the ruins of great towns built by the prehistoric Anasazi people.
For 1,000 years, from about A.D. 500 until their dispersal around 1500, the Anasazi, whose name is a Navajo word that means "the ancient ones," lived in pueblos and cliff dwellings built in the canyons and high mesas of the Four Corners region (where Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah meet). Visitors to northern New Mexico will find no better introduction to the beauty and the enduring mysteries of Anasazi culture than the 34,000-acre Chaco Culture National Historic Park and the 32,000-acre Bandelier National Monument. 
 Chaco, a rather grueling day trip (ending with 20 miles of dirt road) or easy two-day trip from Santa Fe or Albuquerque, was the ancient center of Anasazi civilization and contains the most extensive Indian ruins north of Mexico. Bandelier, less than an hour's drive from Santa Fe, affords a rare opportunity to view Indian ruins in a magnificent setting of mountain, canyon, river valley and pine forest. The Four Corners region contains a number of other important Anasazi ruins, notably Canyon de Chelly National Monument in Arizona, Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado and Hovenweep National Monument in Utah. But Chaco and Bandelier together reflect the full range of Anasazi architecture and design, and their ingenuity in adapting strikingly different terrain to suit their needs. And the drive from one to the other crosses some of the most spectacular scenery in the Southwest.
Ten centuries ago, Chaco was the Rome and the Mecca of Anasazi culture, the spiritual and political capital from which hundreds of miles of roads radiated to outlying pueblos scattered through a region the size of Scotland, the economic hub to which merchants journeyed from as far as Mexico to store and trade beans, corn, copper, pottery, macaws and turquoise. Thirteen separate pueblo villages of as many as 800 connected rooms rose from the floor and rim of the broad, low-walled canyon. Hundreds of people lived and worked here, and no doubt thousands came each year as pilgrims, artisans, traders, perhaps even as tourists.
Yet the first word that comes to mind when you enter Chaco Canyon today is wasteland. From the north, dirt roads approach the canyon through an arid plateau of sagebrush, greasewood, juniper scrub, a few dilapidated Navajo churches, distant glimpses to red mesas. As far as the eye can see there is no escape from the withering desert sun. Time itself seems to fall away as one moves across this forbidding terrain.
Abruptly, a few miles inside the park gate, the road twists and plunges, and one finds oneself in the sheltered, reassuring embrace of a canyon. The sudden descent into this other world is a bit like falling down Alice's rabbit hole, an impression that is enhanced by the sight of strange heaps of stone thrust up like miniature mountain ranges from the canyon floor. On closer inspection, these turn out to be the first of the Chaco ruins.
The main ruins at Chaco are Pueblo Bonito (beautiful town) and Chetro Ketl (a word of unknown origin and meaning), the neighboring towns where Anasazi architecture and workmanship reached their peak. Here is the logical place to begin an exploration.
The aspect of Pueblo Bonito that strikes you most immediately is its monumentality. Shaped like a vast D measuring some 500 feet across, Pueblo Bonito was very likely the largest structure in the Southwest when it was completed in the late 11th century. But the pueblo derives its power from more than size alone. After you have spent some time wandering through the ruins, you come to see that Pueblo Bonito is a carefully and intricately planned city, its form perfectly aligned with the canyon wall behind it and the pattern of its connected chambers as complex and finely articulated as a honeycomb -- but a honeycomb made not of pulp but of sandstone. Like the great Gothic cathedrals of Europe, which were built a short time later, Pueblo Bonito consumed the lives and artistry of generations of workers, yet the overall effect is a grand, hypnotic unity.
Balancing the monumentality of the pueblo's design is the exquisite, almost gemlike fineness of the masonry work. Every wall is sheathed inside and out in a kind of abstract mosaic of flat, smoothly dressed sandstone pieces that shade in tone from salmon to oxblood. Masonry styles changed over the centuries from a rather crude stacking of slatelike fragments to an incredibly beautiful pattern in which a single layer of large rectangular stones alternates with multiple layers of slender chinking stone chips. It comes as something of a shock to learn that the Anasazi covered all of their stunning masonry work with mud plaster.
Chetro Ketl, though roughly contemporary with Pueblo Bonito, differs markedly in design. Shaped rather like a massive E, the pueblo once had a colonnaded gallery that ran for some 90 feet along its front face. Archeologists speculate that this structure, unique in Anasazi buildings, may show the influence of Mexico's Toltec civilization, the forerunner of Aztec culture.
The plazas of both Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl are studded with stone-lined sunken cylindrical structures known as kivas. It is believed that the Anasazi, like their Hopi and Zuni descendants, used kivas as places of worship, ritual and ceremonial gathering. But important questions remain unanswered at Chaco: Why did the pueblos have so many kivas, as many as 40 at Pueblo Bonito alone? How did the so-called great kivas (often measuring more than 60 feet across), differ in use from the smaller kivas? Why, if the kivas served a religious function, were some of them filled with rubble or garbage?
At Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl one must content oneself with peering down into the kivas, but across the canyon at the ruins of Casa Rinconada, the great kiva -- the largest one at Chaco with a diameter of 63 1/2 feet -- has been partly restored and opened to the public. Shorn of the flat timbered roof that once rested on immense pillars of ponderosa pine, its stone fireboxes cold and bare, its ceremonies of smoke and drums and flickering light fallen silent long ago, the great kiva now inscribes a perfect circle in the desert sky, strangely reminiscent of the oculus in the dome of Rome's Pantheon.
After the intensity, the harsh grandeur and the desolate magnificence of Chaco, the serenity of Bandelier comes as a blessed relief. Situated at 6,000 to nearly 7,000 feet and surrounded by the rounded blue humps of the Jemez Mountains, Bandelier has the hushed, sheltered aura of a secret enclave, a "literal paradise . . . a walled garden," as the art historian Vincent Scully called it. The ever-flowing Rito de los Frijoles (bean creek) runs along the canyon floor, supporting a ribbon of delicate green in the center of the canyon. Stands of mature ponderosa pine climb the brown slopes, their high branches casting patches of precious shade. Meadows of tall rustling grasses run right up to the foot of pink tuff cliffs that are as pocked and pitted as Swiss cheese. The holes in the stone are the result of the erosion of pockets of gases that were trapped in the volcanic ash that settled over the region a million years ago.
To travel from Chaco to the ruins at Bandelier is to move from the center of a civilization to an outpost, from the pinnacle to the decline. Though Bandelier's pueblos, cliff dwellings and kivas date from a later period than those at Chaco, they are inferior in workmanship, design, scale and technology, reflecting the general decline of Anasazi culture after the break-up of the Chacoan system in the late 12th century. For the casual visitor to Bandelier, however, there is ample compensation for the quality of the ruins in the beauty of the setting.
Most visitors to the national monument stick to the easy mile-long loop trail that circulates through the main ruins, leading from the visitor center up into the canyon wall and back along the river. The first ruin one encounters is Tyuonyi (chew-OHN-yee), the dominant village at Bandelier, which once had 400 rooms arranged in a ring around a central plaza. The pueblo's ring pattern is still just discernible, but time has worn the soft tuff walls down to mere waist-high stumps.
Past Tyuonyi, the trail climbs up into the north side of Frijoles Canyon, and ladders propped up against the canyon wall ascend to rooms that Anasazi scooped out of the pink tuff. In peak summer season, small groups gather at the bases of the ladders to wait for a turn. The ruins trail continues to the Long House, a series of attached apartments and storerooms that runs for 800 feet along the base of the canyon wall.
Though Bandelier attracts more people than Chaco (300,000 visitors a year compared with 90,000), it also affords more opportunities to escape them. Unlike Chaco, Bandelier is a hiker's park, with more than 70 miles of trails in its its 50 square miles.
The easiest trail is the half-mile hike along the shaded banks of the Rito de los Frijoles to the Ceremonial Cave, an isolated cluster of apartments and kivas built high up in the canyon wall under an overhanging lip of rock. You make the literally breathtaking ascent to the semicircular cave via four ladders that rise a total of 140 feet up the canyon face (prominent signs warn off those with heart problems or fear of heights). The small kiva sunk into the rock has been completely reconstructed and roofed over, and you can lower yourself into it on a ladder just as the Anasazi did. You truly feel reborn when you rise from this stone womb into an almost perfect hemisphere of sky, mountain, pine and rock framed by the pink tuff lip of the overhang.
Even more rewarding and challenging is the six-mile hike to the ruins of Yapashi Pueblo and its shrine of the stone lions. Centuries of weather have eroded the pair of crouching mountain lions to hardly more than humps of stone. Yet the remote shrine remains sacred to the Pueblo Indians, who walk as far as 400 miles to leave offerings of deer antlers or eagle feathers inside the ring of boulders encircling the lions. Without the delicate green cottonwoods and the sheltering walls of Frijoles Canyon, Yapashi is open the winds that blow clean and dry through the desert.
Hiking through the back country of Bandelier, sitting in the great kiva of Casa Rinconada or standing in the dark stone cube of a perfectly preserved room at Pueblo Bonito, one feels that the Anasazi -- the ancient ones -- are close, very close beside one. And something of that sensation persists even after the return to "civilization." The flat-roofed adobe dwellings, the geometric designs of Pueblo Indian pottery, the intricate beadwork of turquoise jewelry, perhaps most of all the deep reverence for the forms of the land: all of these are part of the heritage of the Anasazi. The beauty of northern New Mexico is, one realizes, a beauty that the Anasazi both understood and helped to create.
 
 
 
VISITOR'S GUIDE TO THE PARKS
Chaco
 Chaco Culture National Historic Park is a three- to four-hour drive from Albuquerque or Santa Fe, with the last 20 or so miles on dirt roads. The most direct route is to pick up Route 44 off I-25 at Bernalillo and drive west to the turnoff to the park at Nageezi. A far more scenic approach from Santa Fe is to take Route 84 through Abiquiu (Georgia O'Keeffe's home) and to pick up Route 96 (west) at Abiquiu Dam and take this to Route 44. Dirt roads may be impassable in bad weather.
For information and road conditions, contact Chaco Culture National Historic Park, Star Route 4, Box 6500, Bloomfield, N.M. 87413; telephone (505) 988-6727.
Admission to the park is $3 per vehicle. The ruins are open year round, from sunrise to sunset, although the visitor center is closed on Christmas. The ranger-staffed visitor center has toilets, drinking water, a small museum and a bookstore, and there is a campground a mile away. Ranger-led tours and talks are offered as staffing permits. No food or gas is available. Fill up your tank at Nageezi before you set out and make sure you have plenty of fluids and a hat during hot weather.
The only lodging near the park is a small, spotlessly clean bed and breakfast next to the trading post at Nageezi, The Inn at the Post, Nageezi, N.M. 87037; (505) 632-3646. The cost is about $50 for a double and full breakfast. For dinner, there is a fully equipped kitchen open to guests (rudimentary provisions are available at the trading post).
 
Bandelier
 Bandelier National Monument is 46 miles west of Santa Fe on paved, scenic, clearly marked highways. Take U.S. 285 north to Pojoaque, then pick up 502 west and Route 4 south to the park gate.
Admission to the park is $5 per vehicle. The ruins are open year-round (the visitor center is closed on Christmas), 8 A.M. to 6 P.M. in summer, 8 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. in winter. The visitor center has toilets, drinking water, a bookstore, a small museum, a gift shop and snack bar. Frequent ranger-led tours depart from the visitor center, and there are other special programs and talks during the summer. The park runs two campgrounds and a picnic area.
For more information and for camping reservations, contact Superintendent, Bandelier National Monument, Los Alamos, N.M. 87544; (505) 672-3861.
There is a variety of accommodations and restaurants 10 miles away in Los Alamos, and even more in Santa Fe.

HEADLINE: Dual-Fuel Setups

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your story on Aug. 25, "Flipping Between Gas and Oil," was particularly relevant to consumers since it effectively highlighted many benefits of upgrading to dual-fuel systems in large apartment buildings. However, the article had a serious omission. Very often, the first step in the process is free. 
 Of special interest to your readers in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, the area serviced by Brooklyn Union Gas, is our free customized "Energy Cost Comparison Report" for individual apartment-house owners and managing agents. The report gives fair, reliable estimates of savings and is helpful to apartment-house owners in obtaining low-interest loans through the "Energy Investment Loan Program" sponsored by New York State. The free service is also available to potential cogeneration users.
We also recommend to potential dual-fuel users independent contractors to handle technical assistance, and cost estimates for the installation. This service also is free.
Utility requirements for dual-fuel rates vary greatly. For example, we provide gas service to apartment buildings with as few as 16 units, while other companies do not. I strongly recommend that potential dual-fuel users contact their local utility to find out how to make the conversion process as economical as possible.

HEADLINE: Talking: Foreclosure;
Protecting Tenants' Interests

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
DURING the 1980's it became increasingly common to buy condominium units and one-family houses as investments and rent them to tenants to cover monthly carrying costs while waiting for the property to appreciate.
Often, the rent was below monthly overhead, which was not a drawback while the investor was still making money from other ventures and values were soaring. But with the slump in the economy and a decline in property values a growing number of small investors are becoming delinquent in their mortage payments, bankers report. 
 Can tenants safely assume they can stay on even if the unit goes to foreclosure? Who will pay for repairs or the water or fuel bill while things are being sorted out? And is the security deposit in jeopardy?
First, it is important to separate rent-regulated tenants or those renting from a professional landlord in a large rental building from those who are renting on the unregulated market from a private individual. The former should be protected, or at least insulated, from the owner's financial problems.
It is those in private arrangements who are in a tenuous position. Lawyers warn that no matter what protection they might think they have because they signed a lease, they may have to move out fast. "The lease is no protection," said Philip T. Aaron, a lawyer in Syosset, L.I., who specializes in representing lenders in foreclosure proceedings. Moreover, despite strict consumer laws regarding the safekeeping of security deposits, the tenants may never see those funds again.
However, if the tenants play their cards carefully they can lessen the financial drain and negotiate the chance to stay on, at least for a while. A handful of such tenants, among them one in Syosset, L.I., who had been renting a house being repossessed by the Dime Savings Bank of New York this spring, even seized the initiative and put in a bid to buy the house.
Any hint of impending trouble often starts with a seemingly inexplicable personality change by the owner. "He becomes less and less responsive to your needs," said Terence Beaty, director of special services for William Pitt Real Estate in Stamford, Conn. A few, terrified of losing the income stream, may become overly soliticious, he said.
"The first we knew about it was when the president of the condo association knocked on our door and told us that the owner hadn't paid his common charges for six months," said Jennifer Calderwood, a graphic designer in New York City who suffered through the ordeal last year while renting a three-bedroom condominum in Stamford, Conn.
Official notification normally comes when foreclosure proceedings begin. This is because the tenant is often named in any foreclosure action along with the owner. Richard Liebman, a lawyer in Rockville Centre, L.I., specializing in bankruptcies, explained that the tenants are normally named to facilitate a rapid eviction after the foreclosure action has been completed.
If the owner opts at this point for "deed in lieu" -- a method whereby he or she voluntarily hands over title to the lender rather than suffer through a lengthy foreclosure proceeding -- matters could speed up rapidly. Within weeks the property could be owned by the lender, who normally is eager to get the tenant out fast to spiff up the place for speedy resale, said Mr. Beaty.
Requiring the tenant to leave is legal, said Goldie Rotenberg, a real estate lawyer in Manhattan, because the lease is normally subordinate to the rights of the first mortgage holder. Even if the owner tries to sidestep foreclosure by declaring bankruptcy, she added, the lease will still be extinguished because liquidating that asset becomes a priority need of creditors such as the lender.
EXPERTS therefore suggest the tenant contact the lender fast to negotiate for both time and terms. "It's not unusual to get calls from the tenants," said Roger Williams, manager of asset recovery for the Dime Savings Bank of New York.
Sometimes the lender can be persuaded to give the tenant a cash incentive to leave immedately because eviction proceedings can take six months. Known as "cash for keys" or a "surrender allowance," it provides the equivalent of one or two months' rent in exchange for vacating the premises rapidly.
Although most lenders do not want to become landlords, some may be willing to make an interim arrangement if the market for the property is particularly soft. "It gives us an income stream while we're preparing for a sale," said George Petropulos, vice president for real estate investment at Peoples Bank of Connecticut.
A similar extension might also be granted by a court, said Mr. Aaron. If the tenant is willing to appear at the eviction proceedings and explain why he needs more time -- such as a chance for his children to finish the school year -- it could be granted.
The lender may not even charge rent for the interim months. "We don't charge because we don't want to be considered a landlord," said Mr. Williams of the Dime. "The liability is too great. Tenants see us as having deep pockets."
Moreover, most lenders do not want to be responsible for maintenance. But if the tenancy is going to be long-term -- perhaps because the lender thinks the property might be sold more easily with a good tenant in place -- such an attitude will not apply. Instead, a new lease may be drawn.
These experts admit that most tenants do not continue paying rent once they know their landlord is headed for financial shoals. "We only had two months left on our lease," explained Ms. Calderwood, "and refusing to pay was the only practical way we could recoup some of the $4,000 he was holding as a security deposit." Suing the owner would have cost too much, she said. Moreover, the lender was under no obligation to make good.
"If we never had the deposit," said Mr. Williams, "we can't be expected to pay it."
Of course, the tenant can fight the owner for the refund in Small Claims Court or contact the Attorney General's office. But the escrow account set up for the deposit (if there ever was one), say these experts, has often been cleaned out by the owner by then.
Any tenant who is uneasy about witholding rent should set up a separate account and deposit the rent until matters are cleared up, said Mr. Liebman. This account can meanwhile be drawn upon to pay vendors or for emergency repairs since it is unlikely that either the owner or lender will pay these bills.

HEADLINE: To Mixed Reviews, Education Chief Leaves the Stage

BYLINE: By CHARLOTTE LIBOV

 BODY:
THE state's Education Commissioner, Gerald N. Tirozzi, is collecting a lot of plaudits these days. He has received commendations from the State Board of Education, the Connecticut Education Association and Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s office, among others. But these are not the only mementoes Dr. Tirozzi will be taking with him as he leaves his post to assume the presidency of Wheelock College in Boston on Oct. 1.
Hanging from his office walls are numerous framed newspaper and magazine articles published during his eight-year tenure as chief of the State Education Department. One, published in The Hartford Courant's magazine in March 1988 under the headline "How Dare He?," chronicles the firestorm of controversy, including calls for his resignation, elicited by Dr. Tirozzi's call for greater racial integration of schools. "Gerry was constantly out being a very strong advocate for education," said State Rep. Nancy Wyman, a Tolland Democrat who is co-chairwoman of the General Assembly's Education Commission. "We were fortunate to have Gerry with us, and we are unfortunate to have him leave." 
 But that assessment is not universal. "I say good riddance," said Tom Scott of Milford, who served as a Republican legislator during the 1980's and now heads the Connecticut Taxpayers Committee. "He was incredibly out of touch with the needs of middle-income families in Connecticut who needed to rely on the school system. He's one of these social experimenters who has his head and mind into the stratosphere somewhere, trying to manipulate the youth of America to suit his own ideology."
Generating strong reactions is not unusual for Commissioner Tirozzi. Even the timing of his departure has elicited some speculation that he is leaving because he senses tougher political times ahead with the arrival of the Weicker administration. Such speculation makes the Commissioner bristle.
"I know there are some who think I'm running away," he said. "To them I'd like to say, 'I said I wanted to be a college president, and that's what I'm doing.' "
The state Board of Education has begun to search for a replacement for Dr. Tirozzi. Until a successor is appointed, Marilyn A. Campbell, who served as an acting deputy commissioner, has been named Acting Education Commissioner.
Dr. Tirozzi, 54 years old, began his career in New Haven, where he grew up. Young Gerald, whose father drove a beer truck, was urged by his school counselor to prepare for a factory job, but he went on instead to earn a doctorate from Michigan State University. He became a teacher in 1959, then rose through the administrative ranks to become New Haven's School Superintendent in 1977.
 
Second-Highest Teacher Salaries
 In 1983, on the day he was appointed Commissioner, the Federal Government released "A Nation at Risk," a stinging indictment of the nation's schools. Dr. Tirozzi seized the opportunity to help shape a broad package of reforms that earned national recognition.
During his administration state spending for education rose to $1.3 billion in 1991-92 from $685 million in 1984-85. The state's average teacher salaries have become the second highest in the nation, after Alaska's. The average teacher's salary in Connecticut is $44,736, compared to $29,437 in 1986. The average beginning salary is now $25,312, compared to $17,013 before the Education Enhancement Act, a state law passed at the Commissioner's urging in 1986. Among its provisions, the law provided additional state funds to districts that increased teacher salaries.
Dr. Tirozzi supported the creation of a broad program to raise standards for teachers, with beginners required to pass tests in their specialties and participate in training and assessment programs. Students, too, have been assessed through a program of mastery tests, which gauge their proficiency in the fourth, six, and eighth grades.
These changes are his legacy, the Commissioner said. "I think reforming teaching, dealing with salaries, dealing with rigorous standards, to me, were significant accomplishments," Dr. Tirozzi added.
Such improvements have helped allay fears of a teacher shortage, he said in a recent interview. He noted that Granby recently had more than 1,500 applicants for eight jobs. "In the early 80's you could hardly find a person who wanted to teach in a small rural district," Dr. Tirozzi said. He is also proud that some of Connecticut's highest teacher salaries are now being paid in the cities, he said.
But during the past few years angry taxpayers in numerous districts, citing high teacher salaries, have caused school systems to slash their budgets. As a result hundreds of the state's newly trained teachers face layoffs. And the state's allocations for some of the new teacher-training programs are also being reduced. Experienced teachers who were paid to be mentors to newcomers are now asked to volunteer their time instead.
But Dr. Tirozzi said he did not believe that the programs his administration created would fall by the wayside.
"I won't accept the scenario the sky is falling on education in Connecticut," he said. "It's not. My sense is that because we've laid a very strong foundation, that is so comprehensive and coordinated, it will be very hard to put chinks in its armor."
Commissioner Tirozzi is closely identified with the issue of school integration. In 1988 he infuriated many people by releasing a report that outlined the racial isolation in the state's school districts. As a result, many critics, including Mr. Scott, then a state senator, called for Dr. Tirozzi's resignation.
But he weathered the political storm and has encouraged the implementation of voluntary programs designed to promote integration, including those that encourage youngsters to cross school-district lines voluntarily, like a magnet school being built in Bridgeport. For the past several summers, a successful program has brought suburban youngsters into the Hartford schools.
"Dr. Tirozzi acted as catalyst," said Mark Waxenberg, president of the 30,000-member Connecticut Education Association, the teachers union. "I think that was his major contribution."
 
Inspired a Lawsuit
 The Commissioner "believed, and he still believes, each child is entitled to an equal education," Mr. Waxenberg said. "He stuck with it when it was not advantageous to do so. And I have to admire him for that."
John C. Brittain, a professor of law at the University of Connecticut credits Dr. Tirozzi with inspiring him to file a lawsuit, now pending, attempting to force school integration in Connecticut. Mr. Brittain called Dr. Tirozzi "courageous" for tackling the issue.
"Gerry Tirozzi definitely pricked the conscience of the state of Connecticut with respect to racial, economic and educational segregation between urban and suburban school districts," Mr. Brittain said.
But he said the Commissioner has recently backed away from the desegregation issue, a charge Dr. Tirozzi flatly denied.
"I'm not Superman," he said. "If someone thought any commissioner could solve this issue, I think that's unrealistic. I think my goal was to make sure Connecticut citizens were aware of the problem and couldn't walk away from it."
Mr. Scott said he blamed the Commissioner for the state's fiscal woes, which culminated in the recent passage of a state income tax.
"The state went overboard in salaries in terms that taxpayers, parents and students got nothing in return," Mr. Scott said. "Our property taxes are going up, our state taxes are going up, and we didn't get anything for it. Education hasn't improved."
 
'We Have Laid a Foundation'
 But Dr. Tirozzi maintains that the performance of youngsters will improve eventually, and that many people are too impatient for change.
"I think the kind of systemic change we're looking for is broad, systemic change," he said. "And I think that, based on what we have accomplished during my tenure, I am totally confident that we have laid a foundation upon which you can build."
Dr. Tirozzi said he regrets that he will not be able to implement a comprehensive early childhood education program for the state. He noted, however, that Wheelock College is strongly committed to training teachers to educate young children.
"My sense is this decade you will see a major educational policy shift toward the care and education of young children," he said. "This will be a platform to use the presidency of that college to impact on the national discourse on the care and education on young children. I want to be a part of that."

New Hope for Bridgeport Housing Project

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
REDEVELOPMENT of Father Panik Village, one of Connecticut's oldest, largest and most notorious public housing projects, is under way in Bridgeport.
The hope is to produce a mix of private and public housing free of the problems that have given the project the reputation of being the city's most dangerous area. 
 The plan reflects the effort of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development to limit public housing in any single area and to require sites where there are not already large concentrations of poor minority residents. That stipulation frequently sets off a "not in my backyard" reaction when new sites are sought.
In the case of Father Panik Village, H.U.D. has imposed a special restriction: The department's funds may not be released for construction of public housing until private developers produce nonpublic housing on the site.
"We want assurance of mixed-use development, not another large concentration of public housing," said Robert S. Donovan, deputy manager of the department's Hartford office. "It is H.U.D.'s intention to avert another Father Panik Village."
The project, bordering the Yellow Channel of the Pequonnock River, acquired its notoriety when drugs infiltrated Bridgeport in the 70's. By the mid-80's, it was among the most troubled districts in the state. With 1,400 apartments of 2 to 6 bedrooms in 48 buildings, it was unmanageable.
To reduce density, four buildings were torn down, but that only created a long windowless alley that fostered 24-hour traffic in drugs and guns.
At least 10 people have been killed in the project in the last five years alone, said Lieut. David Boston of the Bridgeport Police Department. An additional 29 severely vandalized buildings were demolished between 1987 and 1990.
Because the area has a large concentration of the poor and minorities, the Housing Authority can allow only 25 percent of new public housing, or 110 units, on the site. An additional 440 units permitted under zoning will be market rate. The authority is now faced with the daunting task of turning the 40-acre wasteland into an attractive complex with shops, offices and parkland.
"Our major concern is getting private investors interested, and, eventually, market-rate buyers and renters," said Clarence H. Craig Jr., the Housing Authority's executive director. "Given the history of the place it won't be easy."
Mr. Donovan believes H.U.D. might bend its special restriction for the first 20 units of public housing, for which competitive plans have been submitted to the Housing Authority by three architects: Zane Yost of Bridgeport, Leslie Feder of Manhattan and Wendell Harp of New Haven. "The way Mr. Craig described the project informally," Mr. Donovan said, "with no land cost, on a corner facing a thriving community center and a successful low-income apartment house, it could be viable."
In 1987, a suit was filed against H.U.D. and the Housing Authority in Federal Court by a group of residents and by nonresidents waiting for apartments. The residents claimed that their buildings were not decently maintained. People on the waiting list argued that apartments were kept vacant because the Housing Authority could not decide what to do next.
Under a 1990 out-of-court settlement, 385 units in the remaining 15 buildings were renovated and all the tenants were moved into them. The buildings will stand until March 1997, by which time everyone is expected to be relocated, and will then be torn down.
ORIGINALLY called Yellow Mill Village, the project was the dream of the Rev. Stephen J. Panik, a Roman Catholic priest. It opened in 1939 and was a model of its kind, landscaped and replete with food and service shops. Bounded by Crescent Street to the north, Pembroke Street to the west and Hamilton Street and Waterview Avenue to the south and east, it replaced a vast shantytown. When Father Panik died in 1953, the complex was renamed in his honor.
"Today there are no stores left," said Bessie Thomas, a resident since 1960 and member of a task force of municipal and civic leaders set up to aid the redevelopment. She walks to East Main Street to shop because it is not far enough to justify the $1.50 round-trip bus ride. The nearest supermarket can be reached only by car.
A marked shift in residents occurred after Federal law changed in 1983, requiring public housing residents to spend 30 percent of their income on rent and removing rent ceilings. "Many families moved out rather than pay more as their incomes rose," said Collin Vice, the Housing Authority's director of planning and development. "That left only the poorest of the poor."
So far, H.U.D. has spent $2 million for demolition and $38 million to relocate about 700 families throughout Bridgeport, Mr. Craig said. Half are in old buildings and may apply for a second relocation as better quarters become available. Another allocation will be required to relocate the last of the tenants.
To date, the authority has bought 130 units citywide for renovation, an additional 56 are under construction on properties bought from the city and 33 are being reviewed for approval by H.U.D.
Meanwhile, Michael Sheehan, a New Haven lawyer who represented the tenants in the suit, has filed objections to the Housing Authority's failure to comply with a relocation schedule. He charges that "another 206 units were supposed to have been provided by now."
Mr. Craig is trying to do so by enticing reluctant landlords to accept unit subsidies that remain with the apartment for 15 years, rather than tenant subsidies, which tenants take with them when they move. "We have applied to H.U.D. for 123 unit subsidies," Mr. Craig said. And under a so-called turnkey approach, new units may be built privately around the city and turned over to H.U.D., which would then reimburse the developer.
BUT David P. D'Aulisio, a local realtor and member of the task force, has found that "developers won't risk their own capital, although government backing makes them somewhat more interested."
"We are also having a problem with redlining by the banking industry in many neighborhoods, " he said.
"Realistically," Mr. D'Aulisio added, "we are looking at several years before we see significant development on the site. The stigma of a crime-ridden, drug-infested, poverty-stricken neighborhood in the country's first city to declare bankruptcy is not easily overcome."

HEADLINE: Judges Giving Women Prison Terms More Like Men's

BYLINE: By MARY L. RAFFALLI

 BODY:
A YOUNG woman standing before a Nassau County judge in 1985 was convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance and sentenced to three years' probation.
Another woman in a similar situation before the same judge in 1989 drew a sentence of one to three years in state prison. 
 Criminal-justice experts attribute the difference to changing attitudes toward women. The pattern stems from a combination of feminism, the emergence of crack, a political hard-line on drugs and the troubled economy.
According to the State Division of Criminal Justice Services, in 1985 about 70 percent of Nassau women who were convicted of a drug felony with no prior felony convictions, received probation. In 1989, the rate for female first offenders given probation plummeted, to 9 percent.
 
'Chivalrous Behavior Has Changed'
 Although similar trends are found in Suffolk, they are more dramatic in Nassau.
Criminologists say there has been a double standard, in that women have been sentenced to rehabilitation and probation based on issues surrounding motherhood and children. A senior research associate at the Criminal Justice Research Center of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, Dr. Ira Sommers, said:
"Now chivalrous behavior has changed with the call for equality. It is because of drug hysteria and changes in attitudes between the sexes that now women are actually being incarcerated once they are caught and convicted."
Some experts say the women's liberation movement is playing a major role. The chairman of the department of criminal justice at Nassau Community College, Peter Grimes, said:
"Our criminal-justice system sent men to prison, but women received the benefit of the doubt and were sentenced more leniently. But the system is changing, and women are not being given the benefit of the doubt, as they had been almost routinely in the past.
"Now the punishments for men and women are similar. As part of a move toward male-female equality, criminal justice removed the kid gloves."
The president of the National Organization for Women in New York City, Melodie Bahan, said: "To in any way tie the increase in women involved in crime to feminism is a little dangerous. It just gives people another reason to fight against women's rights, and that's ridiculous."
 
Matching the Men's Rate
 Nonetheless, compared with men, Nassau women had a much greater chance of receiving probation in 1985. By 1989, the probability was the same for both sexes. In 1985, 32 percent of male first offenders convicted of drug felonies were given probation, compared with 70 percent of their female counterparts. In 1989, the margin narrowed, as the rate of women given probation dropped to the men's 9 percent rate.
"Today," the executive director of the Education and Assistance Corporation, Rosemary Kelly, said, "it is very difficult for a judge to see Sam Smith, who sold drugs to an undercover cop, and give him one to three years upstate and then see Mary Jones, who has the exact same story and give her probation. For years they were doing that. But the women were fewer and farther between.
"Judges used to say, 'Poor woman, she deserves a break.' But not any more. Now the attitude is women wanted equality, and they're getting equality." Ms. Kelly's organization runs Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime and Stoplifting, another treatment program.
The conviction rates for first-offender men and women are approaching each other, with a decrease in the percentage of men who were convicted and an increase in the women's rate.
Although 48 percent of the women arrested for drug felonies in 1985 were convicted, 68 percent of the men were convicted. In 1989, however, 56 percent of the women and 63 percent of the men arrested in drug felonies were convicted.
Courtney Voses, a lawyer, said more women were committing crimes because of problems in the work place and home, as well as drugs.
"More women have drug problems and have a desperate need to go out and make money," Ms. Voses said. "They have family pressures. Some have six or eight children with no support systems. So they turn to crimes."
 
Expectations for Women
 Ms. Bahan said women were generally sentenced more strictly than men. "The system is inherently biased," she said. "There is a perception that women are not supposed to commit violent crimes, and people are outraged."
Others contend women's sentences are approaching the severity ofmen's terms because expectations for women have become similar to those for men. A lawyer, Adrian Diluzio, said: "In the movies as well as in the courts, we consider women to be more like men. And women are taking on qualities that were traditionally thought of as male qualities. They are more aggressive, take greater risks, and have more interest in the profits."
In 1987, Mr. Diluzio defended Jayne Stamen of East Meadow, who was accused of conspiring to have her husband killed. She was found not guilty.
As women's self-images have changed, there has been a shift in crimes women are committing. Up to the early 80's, women's crimes in Nassau were mainly limited to forgery and shoplifting.
"Today, the shift away from shoplifting is because of severe social, professional and economic pressures that are hitting women," Ms. Kelly said. "Going in and stealing a $50 blouse from Lord & Taylor is not going to help. They are selling drugs on street corners to undercover cops instead."
From 1985 to 1989, arrest statistics for Nassau women show a shift from larceny toward drugs. Over the four years, shoplifting arrests decreased 61 percent, and felony drug arrests increased 394 percent.
In 1985, at 44 percent, more women were arrested in larceny cases, usually shoplifting, than in any other felony. Seven percent were arrested for drugs. In 1989, 30 percent of the women arrested in felony cases were arrested on drug charges and 15 percent were arrested in shoplifting.
Professor Grimes said the reason for the shift is that drug dealing is more effective because it brings in more money faster, adding, "There's no fencing involved."
A professor of criminology at Hofstra University, John Wilderman, said: "Shoplifting was more of a diversion for housewives. It was a way of being deviant and getting excitement. Now most women committing crimes need to support a habit. You can't make much money from shoplifting and the probability of getting caught is higher."
 
Changes in Families
 Among the factors contributing to the increased drug activity by women in Nassau are limited financial resources, increased financial pressures and increased numbers of women who are the sole providers for their families.
"More women are responsible for a child, a family without a man, without any supports," Professor Wilderman said. "She is trying to keep a job and a home. Add to this the recession, and she reaches the breaking point. These are hard times, and people become desperate.
"That single mother has to pay $2 for bread instead of $1, but her income is the same or less. Now she can save half of what she expected or nothing at all. Eventually, she has to get the money somewhere else."
Women moved to crimes that had been previously committed mostly by men. Now, women are involved in street homicides and other street crimes like robberies and assaults. "These are crimes we never used to see committed by women," said Dr. Sommers.
 
A Woman 'Can Open Her Own Door'
 The increasing role of women in violent and drug crimes may also stem from a relaxation of men's protection of women in criminal endeavors. Mr. Diluzio said, "It used to be that drug dealers would say, 'I don't want my woman in the firing line.' Now they're saying" that the woman "can open her own door."
Public attention to drug felonies is increasing. "Women are more involved in a politically very unpopular crime," Dr. Sommers said, "and so they are bearing the burden of being caught committing the wrong crime for this era."
A spokesman for the Nassau District Attorney's office said, Ed Grilli: "Since 1986, with crack, we are seeing many women involved with drugs, especially selling. Women addicts sell to support their own habits but I'm sure women have been affected by the recession as well. And with crack dealing openly going on in neighborhoods, women see it as an opportunity to make money."
 
Selling in 'Drive Through' Areas
 Mr. Grilli said the county had never had a crime problem of the magnitude of crack. He named "drive through" areas, where crack is openly available on "every street corner" in Freeport, Glen Cove, Hempstead, Long Beach, New Castle and Rockville Centre.
The police have been conducting "street sweeps" since 1987, especially in Freeport and Hempstead, and arresting in some instances more than 200 people, Mr. Grilli said.
The Supervising Judge of County Criminal Court, Marie G. Santagata, said just a few women were brought in from sweeps, compared with men.
The large-scale entrance of women into work places previously occupied solely by men can mean that the women have become as vulnerable as men. Professor Wilderman said he was not surprised by the increase in female offenders, because "if you go into the swimming pool, you're going to get wet."
"You can't be involved in institutional life, occupationally, economically and in every other aspect, but not in the deviant aspect," he said. "Women were not criminals and not drug users because they were not visible. It's when they became shakers and makers that they became inmates."
"Women were given more options," Ms. Voses said. "They met many different people, did different types of work, and some were led toward crime."
 
'Women Don't Coddle Other Women'
 The increase in women working in the criminal justice system as judges, lawyers, police officers and the like may reflect how the system deals with women. "Women don't coddle other women," Professor Wilderman said. "They do not see them as dependent creatures in need of protection. Men tend to see a woman and say, 'Now here could be my mother,' or, 'Here could be my sister.' Women say, 'That could be me, but it's not.' They sympathize as peers."
Ms. Voses said that male lawyers were not more protective of women, but rather that female lawyers were. "Women go the extra yard for their female clients," she said. "I help with social work, day care, housing. I don't see them as peers. It's not a peer situation. It's a client-attorney situation."
Judge Santagata said she did take into account whether the defendant was a man or woman, but added:
"We consider everything. Probation does an in-depth study of each defendant, and with all that information, the court determines what decision would be best for the individual."
 
Increases in Jails
 "You're looking at a pattern, over time," a spokesman for the state's division of criminal-justice services, Richard Ross, said. "The pattern is clear no matter what any one number is." The agency receives and processes information from jails, probation departments, courts and police departments.
Jail statistics show increases in female inmates. In 1986, 995 women were admitted to the Nassau County jail in East Meadow. Last year the figure was 1,643.
Professor Grimes said, "Now more and more women are going to prison or jail, where in the past, they definitely would have received some sort of probation."
Since 1985, the number of men sentenced to prison has remained level. In Nassau in 1985, three female first offenders convicted of drug felonies were sent to prison, compared with 63 men. In 1989, the number of men was 67, but the women increased to 27.
"The whole ideology has turned right wing," Professor Wilderman said. "The prisons are filled up, and they want to build more whenever, wherever they can -- floating prisons, prison blimps. And why just for the men?"

BILL OF RIGHTS RUN
The 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights will be celebrated today with a 10-kilometer run from Tom Paine's Cottage in New Rochelle to St. Paul's National Historic Site in Mount Vernon, where a daylong festival will be in progress. Runners may sign up from 8:30 to 9:45 A.M. at the Paine Cottage at 983 North Avenue for $11. The race begins at 10 A.M. 
 After proceeding through Eastchester and Pelham, the run will wind up at St. Paul's at 897 South Columbus Avenue, in time for the presentation of winners' plaques at noon.
 For the rest of the day, visitors may tour the historic church and the Bill of Rights Museum, stroll through a Revolutionary War encampment, watch a demonstration of a reproduction of an 18th-century printing press, view an early bookbinding exhibition, debate the Bill of Rights with costumed Colonial Americans, listen to strolling costumed musicians, sample Colonial cookies and receive a copy of the Bill of Rights printed on the premises.
St. Paul's is a national shrine because it was there that the printer John Peter Zenger, whose reporting about a corrupt election brought his arrest on charges of libel, was tried and acquitted in 1735. His ordeal led to the inclusion of freedom of the press in the Bill of Rights.
Everything is free but the cookies. Call 667-4116 for more information.
 
COLONIAL FAIR
 Back at Tom Paine's Cottage inNew Rochelle, the Huguenot Thomas Paine Association and the New Rochelle Historical Society have scheduled a Colonial Fair Saturday from noon to 4 P.M.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
The Safest Bet for Uncertain Times

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
It has been an uncertain September for stock market investors, and analysts are still divided over the outlook. It is an on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand story, but it appears that the safest bet is in countries where interest rates are expected to fall and economic recoveries look ready to begin.
On the one hand, the stock markets in Britain and Hong Kong, where the key equity indexes repeatedly reached record highs this summer, have lost their momentum. The market in Germany is stuck in a narrow range. Norway is declining. Italy has faded. 
 On the other hand, there are some signs that things might improve. France hit a new 1991 high last week, and the market in Japan, where hope is growing for a cut in the official interest rates, has shown some bounce.
In addition, a further interest rate cut in the United States is possible, and this could lead to drops in Japan and England. Economists are beginning to see signs of a recovery in the economy of the old East Germany, which could ease the load on the unified country's locomotive, the old West Germany. Inflation is coming down around the world.
But, back on the first hand again, the economic recovery in the United States is looking weak while the recovery in England seems even shakier. The economies in both Germany and Japan, which had been the areas of strength as the world economy slowed, are now slowing themselves.
Politics are also unsettled. Reports of heart trouble for Boris Yeltsin, the president of the Russian republic and hero of the resistance to the coup in the Soviet Union, could worry markets. The civil war in Yugoslavia continues. Last week there was a threat of renewed military action in Iraq. And the potential cost of feeding the Soviet Union this winter is escalating.
"The basic reason that stock markets are having a difficult time reaching higher ground is that we are still not seeing global liquidity growing by very much, and there is simply not enough liquidity to finance a recovery and push equity prices higher," said Thomas R. Robinson, chief international equity strategist at Merrill Lynch.
Lower interest rates would increase the liquidity, he said, but he thinks central banks are being stingy and are still focusing on the threat of inflation.
"We have seen the occasional burst in one market," he added. "But we still have to be unusually attentive to valuations and earnings because the global markets are really just moving sideways."
Despite the list of uncertainties, Barton Biggs, the global strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company, has a feeling, based "on nothing tangible," that there will be a rally around the world in October. "A lot of good things are happening around the world," he said, listing declines in inflation, economic change in Latin America and the collapse of Communism.
Because of this feeling he has increased the portion of stocks in his portfolio to 60 percent from 55 percent. Bonds remain at 40 percent and cash goes to zero.
"Sixty is more like a base rate," he said. To keep the equity holdings in a portfolio much below the 60 percent level, he said, one has to be convinced of a bear market because equities are the best performing asset over time. "If you get really bullish, you want to be at 70 percent," he said.
Mr. Biggs notes that there is disagreement about the current outlook, even within his firm. Byron Wien, another Morgan Stanley strategist, still believes that stock markets will fall soon.
But Mr. Biggs said one reason for his belief in an impending rally is that so many investors and analysts have already decided to be "basically pretty cautious." Mr. Biggs is betting against the conventional wisdom.
Mr. Robinson of Merrill Lynch is taking a more cautious approach but is also focusing on falling interest rates and incipient economic recoveries.
According to this strategy some of the best opportunity is in North America. The United States and Canada are on the firm's preferred list, because of both lower interest rates and hopes for the recovery. This is contrary to the conventional wisdom about the United States, Mr. Robinson acknowledged, because many analysts argue that its stocks are expensive when compared with other markets. But he said the recent cut in United States interest rates makes values look better and a recovery will improve earnings expectations.
Britain is also favored and France is liked. Both have the chance for lower interest rates, although the French Government has stubbornly resisted cutting rates this year because of the weakness of the franc and its commitment to fight inflation. And these markets' valuations are more attractive than the American market.
But Japan, even after its recent bounce, is not on Merrill's list, although many other analysts like Tokyo just because interest rates are expected to fall. Mr. Robinson says the market is still subject to a downturn because company earnings may be disappointing as the economy slows down. There is also the impact of the scandals involving Japan's leading investment firms. "We think the investors will still want to be cautious," said Mr. Robinson.

HEADLINE: When the Regulators Stood Still

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE and STEPHEN LABATON

 BODY:
John H. Gutfreund sought the unusual audience, and on the hot and humid afternoon of Monday, June 10, the chairman of Salomon Brothers Inc., the most powerful firm on Wall Street, was ushered into the imposing third-floor office of Robert R. Glauber, with its heavy, Victorian-style furnishings and dark oil portraits of unsmiling, bygone financiers.
More than anyone at the Treasury Department's headquarters in Washington, Mr. Glauber, the Under Secretary for Finance, is responsible for regulating the monthly auctions at which the Treasury sells billions of dollars in securities to finance the Government's huge debt. Evidence had been piling up that Salomon might have broken the rules -- particularly the rule aimed at preventing any one firm from hogging too many of the securities at a given auction. Mr. Gutfreund had come to Washington to try to head off an investigation that Mr. Glauber's team had quietly initiated. 
 The meeting lasted less than 30 minutes, Mr. Glauber recalls. But as summer turns to fall, that brief conversation begins to look like the start of a new direction in the unfolding Salomon Brothers scandal -- one in which the firm's fraudulent auction bids in the names of unknowing customers, much in the news today, take a back seat to a larger and more troubling issue.
The new concern is whether Salomon acted alone; whether the Wall Street firm and a few big customers -- perhaps acting together -- cornered the market in two-year Treasury notes auctioned last May 22, forcing others to pay exorbitant prices to acquire them. If that is the case, then the Salomon scandal goes far beyond the aberrant behavior of Paul W. Mozer, who was chief of Salomon's Government trading department, and a few assistants who helped Mr. Mozer rig bids in the names of customers without their knowledge.
That broader case would spotlight the failure of Mr. Glauber and E. Gerald Corrigan, the 50-year-old president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York -- the two officials most responsible for regulating and supervising the Treasury market -- to curb Salomon and perhaps other firms earlier this year.
By mid-May, their staffs had detected, in a new study, a striking pattern of aggressive bidding going back to the spring of last year. But until the May 22 auction, this behavior had not distorted Treasury securities prices, so regulators had no compelling reason to act, in the opinion of Mr. Glauber and his staff. Indeed, Mr. Gutfreund sought the June 10 meeting to contest the Treasury's concern that Salomon's behavior and the distorted pricing after the May auction were linked.
"This was a meeting that he set up; we did not ask him to come in," Mr. Glauber said last week. "He told us some things and we listened. We could have asked him more about the May auction. But we listened."
 
Some Missing Questions
 Nor did Mr. Glauber ask Mr. Gutfreund about auctions in February and April in which Salomon had executed what seemed to Treasury to have been excessive bids. And soon after the June 10 meeting, Mr. Glauber made a fateful decision. He decided to postpone until August at the earliest consideration of any proposed changes in Treasury auction rules designed to prevent the concentration of purchases in a few hands.
"You don't want to rush in and make modifications with a sledgehammer until you know the full extent of the problems," Mr. Glauber said. "Rushing to judgment in this kind of market is a mistake. And we do not know yet whether we know the full extent of what happened."
But the reluctance to act raises troubling questions about the close-knit relationships among the Treasury, the Fed and the primary dealers like Salomon who play the major role in financing the huge Federal debt. Did those relationships lull the regulators into a false sense of confidence that the Government securities market was free of corruption?
Even within the ranks of the Treasury and the Fed, which through its New York office conducts the principal Treasury auctions, there is criticism that regulation of the Treasury markets -- where $5 billion to $12 billion in new notes and bonds are auctioned monthly -- had become too lax and too trusting.
"The plain fact is that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is on the front line," said a high Fed official in Washington, who declined to be identified. "They see all the data and they are in daily contact with the dealers. They are the source of identifying problems and sounding the alarm."
 
Cast of Characters
 Whatever the criticism, the Treasury, the Fed, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department are conducting civil and criminal investigations of the Treasury securities marketplace. And Salomon officials, who have tried to characterize the scandal as one limited to Mr. Mozer and a few misbehaving confederates, do not discount the possibility that the misbehavior might go well beyond the firm.
The main evidence leading in this direction so far is twofold: The study showing Salomon to have been a far more aggressive bidder in Treasury auctions than had previously been disclosed and the frequency with which the firm illegally used the names of others to buy securities that it secretly kept for itself. Two firms whose names have been used more than once were Quantum Fund and S. G. Warburg & Company.
Warburg, a London-based investment house, is itself a primary dealer in Treasury auctions. Quantum is a mutual fund that invests the savings of others, often in Treasury securities. Both deny that they had any knowledge of Salomon's activities.
The Treasury and the Fed have turned up a startling trend. In a retrospective study, requested by the Treasury and completed by the Fed in mid-May, they found that in three different auctions, over 13 months, Salomon had acquired more than 75 percent of the notes and bonds sold, either in its own name or as an agent for customers. And in nearly 30 of the approximately 230 weekly or monthly auctions held since early 1986, Salomon had bid for and acquired up to 50 percent of the securities.
"Only Salomon would commit the capital required to take such aggressive positions," said Michael E. Basham, a key Treasury deputy under Mr. Glauber until early September, when he left to join Smith Barney Harris Upham & Company Inc. "Regulating the Treasury market is really regulating Salomon."
The Fed study showed that before the spring of 1990, not even Salomon had accounted for 75 percent of any auction. So the new figures should have aroused the Fed's and the Treasury's suspicions that Salomon might have been trying to exercise undue control over the market, some critics say. Apparently, they didn't.
No rule bars Salomon from acquiring most of the securities at an auction, as long as it bids for 35 percent or less in its own name, with the rest ordered for customer accounts. But some argue that the huge chunks taken by Salomon in March 1990 and then in February and April of this year should have prompted the New York Fed to check whether Salomon might have been violating auction rules, as it turns out it was.
"Enormous power over a particular market segment can lead to arrogance, can lead to conclusions that it's within a firm's power to do things that would be unlawful and that might lead to temptations to do so," Richard C. Breeden, chairman of the S.E.C., told a Congressional committee this month.
Mr. Corrigan's people are now making such checks part of their regular routine. But such policing goes against ingrained habits. Mr. Corrigan, a Fordham-trained economist who has spent most of his career in the Federal Reserve system, told Congress this month that the Treasury auction system "has worked incredibly well until now." He testified that the Fed's relationship with Salomon and the 38 other primary dealers who purchase most of the securities at the auctions has been much more that of a trusting business relationship than a regulatory one.
"The data and information we collect from primary dealers are aimed at providing broad insights into the workings of the market," Mr. Corrigan told the Securities Subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee in written testimony. "Information gathering activities have never been structured with a view toward enforcement or compliance activities."
The fourth time that Salomon went above the 75 percent mark was on May 22, only a week after the Treasury had received the revealing Fed study. More than $12 billion in two-year notes were sold that day. Immediately after the auction, however, other traders trying to acquire the new notes to meet obligations to sell them to customers, found themselves forced to pay excessively high prices.
Within days, the uproar on Wall Street over the unusual "squeeze" -- resulting in big losses for some traders -- was noted in Congress. Mr. Glauber's staff on May 29 asked the S.E.C. to begin an investgation, the first ever undertaken by that agency into the Treasury market. And Mr. Basham telephoned Salomon on June 4 to express the Treasury's concerns. "My call was a modest attempt to get them to unwind their position," Mr. Basham said. Six days later, Mr. Gutfreund paid a visit to Mr. Glauber in Washington.
At 62, Mr. Gutfreund is a decade older than Mr. Glauber, but the two men are similar in height and build (about 5-foot-7 and stocky) and in intensity. While Mr. Gutfreund is a hard-driving Wall Street trader, Mr. Glauber, a Harvard economics professor temporarily on leave, works endless hours trying to shepherd the Bush Administration's bank reform legislation through Congress.
Because of the banking bill, the investigation of Salomon's trading practices was, in June, a lesser priority for Mr. Glauber -- and it remained that way until August, when Salomon suddenly disclosed that Mr. Mozer, the head of its Government desk, and a few of Mr. Mozer's staff had purchased Treasury securities in customers' names apparently without their knowledge. The practice illegally circumvented the 35 percent maximum purchase for a single buyer.
 
A Matter of Delays
 Mr. Mozer had told Mr. Gutfreund in April of some of these violations, but he made no mention of them at the June 10 meeting in Mr. Glauber's office. Indeed, Mr. Gutfreund's long failure to report the transgressions to the Fed or the Treasury cost him and other top Salomon officials their jobs in mid-August, after the bid-rigging was finally revealed.
In early June, sitting on a couch in Mr. Glauber's office and puffing on a cigar, Mr. Gutfreund spoke only of the squeeze on the two-year notes -- admitting its existence, but arguing that such squeezes are not all that uncommon and can be the result of natural market forces. As he left, he handed Mr. Glauber an envelope of charts, which have yet to be made public, intended to illustrate his case. Mr. Glauber did not tell the S.E.C. about the meeting, although the S.E.C. had been working on the case.
Mr. Gutfreund in June and Salomon today offer various explanations of how a squeeze can occur naturally. With interest rates declining, as they have in recent months, a new Treasury note sold at auction for a yield of, say, 6 percent, gains in value as market interest rates decline below this level. The greater value increases the demand for the notes. A price squeeze can then develop if traders need to acquire some of the notes because they had sold them to others even before they owned them in so-called "when-issued" trading in advance of the auction. Such traders are called short-sellers.
"The development of a squeeze does not imply any deliberate effort by holders to 'corner' the issue," Salomon said in a question-and-answer press release. "Indeed, the possibility of squeezes is inherent in when-issued trading."
But the May two-year notes ended up mostly in the hands of Salomon and three funds -- Tiger Investment Inc., Quantam and Steinhardt Partnership Inc. With short-sellers seeking to borrow or purchase roughly $6 billion of the May notes, or half the issue, the price squeeze continued until July, as Salomon and Steinhardt in particular appeared to hold their positions. Now the S.E.C. is trying to determine whether Salomon and the others somehow worked together to obtain such control.
"Ultimately, the public debate will be whether this was a case of pre-agreement or coincidence," said an executive who trades in Treasury securities at a Wall Street firm.
Like many of Salomon's prior infractions, the May auction prompted some Treasury officials to rethink the rules. They and the New York Fed considered but rejected a proposal that would have limited all traders in the primary market to 35 percent of an issue for both themselves and their customers. Conforming to the current 35 percent ceiling, a primary dealer could theoretically buy 100 percent of an issue on behalf of itself and two customers.
Instead, Mr. Basham said he viewed the problem as one of disclosure. Because the largest Wall Street firms know the positions of their customers and often financed their purchases, they are able to use this information in their own trading in the after-auction secondary markets and could thus cause squeezes.
 
A Postponed Rule
 The proposed solution, circulated in June as a memo from Mr. Basham, was a two-part rule. First, a company that sought to acquire more than 5 percent of an auction would have to make the bid directly to the Fed and not go through a primary dealer. This would reduce the chances of phony bidding. And, secondly, any bidder acquiring more than 20 percent of the securities at an auction would have to publically disclose its holdings, a rule roughly analogous to S.E.C. regulations for stock market investors.
Such proposals most likely would have drawn opposition from the largest primary dealers, and Mr. Glauber decided to postpone its implementation until he could solicit the industry's views. The plan was to make a presentation in early August, at a meeting in Washington of the Treasury Advisory Borrowing Committee, a group representing primary dealers, including Salomon. Mr. Glauber and some of his staff were tied up in Congressional hearings on bank reform, and the presentation was postponed until early September.
But Salomon's bombshell confession about unauthorized bids came in mid-August. Now Mr. Glauber and Mr. Corrigan are awaiting the outcome of the various investigations under way before making any changes in the rules -- changes that would substitute regulation for the old mutual trust in the marketplace.
"This was a gentlemanly world, where one's word was very, very important," said a lawyer for Salomon. "You see on doillar bills the phrase 'In God We Trust.' At the Treasury Department, there was a view of, 'In the primary dealers we trust.' " Now that trust is gone.
 
 
 
WHY SALOMON'S SUDDEN AGGRESSION?
 The Salomon scandal raises a tantalizing question: Why now? Why haven't dealers in Treasury securities broken the rules so flagrantly in the past? No one has a definitive answer, but there are various theories.
The main one is disregard of moral standards coupled with Salomon's pay incentive system -- a sort of 1980's Wall Street mentality reaching the Treasury security market well after the retreat of Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken. Salomon's traders in this market receive annual bonuses tied to the profitability of their operation, and in pursuit of bigger bonuses they cheated, many analysts say.
In doing so, they took advantage of lax auction supervision by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which supervises the auctions for the Treasury. "The Fed felt that anyone who would be admitted to the inner-sanctum of doing business with the Fed as a primary dealer was virtually by definition an honorable person," said Francis Schott, an economic consultant and a former research director at the New York Fed.
There are other theories, as well. The recession has produced a steady decline in interest rates since last year. That has made made the prices of Treasury securities rise, emboldening Salomon and other investors to take big positions. Finally, the disappearance of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., another major trader in Treasuries, left the field wide open, perhaps encouraging Salomon traders to operate more aggressively.

Chronology: "Solly's Folly: A Recap"
 
1990
 
March 27: Salomon Brothers and its customers buy more than 75 percent of a two-year Treasury note issue.
 
June 27: Paul Mozer, head of Salomon's Government securities desk, bids for more than 100 percent of the four-year notes up for auction. A few days later, Michael Basham, then a Treasury official, warns Mozer about excessive bidding.
 
July 10: Mozer bids for more than 100 percent of an auction of 30-year bonds issued by the Resolution Trust Corporation. Treasury rejects the bid and puts a 35 percent ceiling on the bids by a single buyer at a particular yield.
 
Dec. 27: Salomon bids for 47 percent of an auction of four-year notes, exceeding the ceiling by purchasing notes in the name of Warburg Asset Management apparently without its knowledge.
 
1991
 
Feb. 21: Salomon and its customers bid for 105 percent, and acquire 57 percent of the five-year notes auctioned. Two customer bids, Warburg and Quantum Fund, are apparently unauthorized. When the New York Federal Reserve Bank complains that the Warburg bid violates a technical rule, Mozer changes the name on that bid to Mercury Asset Management, another S. G. Warburg unit.
 
April 25: Salomon and its customers bid for 61 percent and acquire 51 percent of the five-year notes acquired by improperly inflating the bid of a customer, Paul Tudor Jones.
 
Mid-May: Fed review of auction awards back to early 1986 shows that most of Salomon's purchases were less than 45 percent, but in three cases, starting in March 1990, they exceeded 75 percent.
 
May 22: Salomon and customers, mainly Steinhardt Partners Ltd., gain control of nearly all the two-year notes auctioned. A Salomon purchase involving Tiger Investments is partially unauthorized. Others attempting to buy the notes after the auction are forced to pay exorbitant prices, prompting complaints of a squeeze.
 
May 29: Treasury asks the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the squeeze.
 
June 4: Basham calls Mozer to express concern about the squeeze.
 
June 10: In a meeting, John Gutfreund, Salomon's chairman, tells Robert Glauber, Treasury's Under Secretary for Finance, that the squeeze could have resulted from natural market forces. He is not asked about and does not mention the unauthorized purchases.
 
Aug. 9: Gutfreund tells Glauber that the Mercury bid in February was apparently unauthorized and admits to having known this since April.
 
Aug. 14: Salomon announces publicly that Gutfreund an other top executives had known since April of the illegal purchases.
 
Aug. 15: Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Fed, tells Gutfreund that he and other top management must go it Salomon is to remain a primary dealer in the Treasury market.
 
Aug. 16: Gutfreund and Thomas Strauss, Salomon's president, resign. Shareholder Warren Buffett becomes interim chairman.
 
Aug. 18: Treasury suspends Salomon from bidding at securities auctions, but within hours Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady midifies the ban to allow Salomon to bid for its own account.

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
A 2,000-Hour Guarantee

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
In a few weeks, about 3,000 construction workers, chosen by a complex formula that includes years of service and training, will get an unusual offer from B.E.& K. Inc. The Birmingham, Ala., construction company will agree to pay them for 2,000 hours -- a year of 40-hour weeks -- plus a vacation and full benefits, in 1992. They, in turn, must agree to work whenever B.E.& K. needs them, and not to work elsewhere.
It is the kind of trade-off that factory and office workers take for granted. But it is apparently a first in construction. "It's time we brought some stability to our workers, too," said T. Michael Goodrich, 46, B.E.& K.'s president. 
 That's not a new idea for Mr. Goodrich. While pursuing his civil engineering and law degrees, he spent summers working at his father's Tennessee construction company. "I saw lots of workers driven out of the industry by the insecurity," he recalled.
The industry never lost its appeal for Mr. Goodrich, though. In 1972, after working as a clerk for a judge for two years, he joined the then-fledgling B.E.& K. as legal counsel. B.E.& K. now is a billion-dollar industrial construction company, one of the country's largest.
Its new stab at stemming the labor outflow seems strangely timed, however. July's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for non-housing construction workers was 16.7 percent. With workers so outnumbering jobs, it would seem that no company need sweeten the pot.
Moreover, the program's economics are predicated on a heady upturn in business. "If we've miscalculated, the liability could cost us more than we can afford," Mr. Goodrich said.
He insists the rewards warrant those risks. The general labor glut masks the chronic shortage of highly skilled workers. Mr. Goodrich is hoping that the guaranteed work will act as a blue-collar version of a golden handcuff.

HEADLINE: In Mexico, Fears of Free Trade Melt

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: NAUCALPAN, Mexico

 BODY:
AMBIANCE S.A., a small manufacturer of hotel furniture and hand-painted plastic sculptures in this industrial town on the outskirts of Mexico City, was devastated when Mexico agreed in 1986 to open its market to foreign competition.
With the drastic reduction in the tariffs that had protected Mexican industry for seven decades, the country's hotel chains began importing mass-produced American tables, chairs and desks. Mexican gift shops that had stocked native figurines began filling their shelves with imported steam irons and pocket radios instead. 
 Almost overnight, Ambiance's sculpture sales fell by nearly a fifth and its furniture sales dropped by two-fifths. "There was a high risk of losing everything," said Mauricio Aguilar Duran, who, with his brother, founded the company in 1978.
But Mexico's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a 108-nation organization dedicated to free trade, seems to have had its intended effect. It forced many industrial companies to become more competitive.
Ambiance, already suffering from a national recession and then hit by the effects of a 1989 hurricane in Cancun that hurt many of the hotels that were the company's best customers, was forced to prospect outside of Mexico for business. In the last 12 months, the company has exported half of its sculptures, at a modest $150 or less apiece. And thanks in part to the recent American fascination with all things Southwestern, its furniture division, now a separate but affiliated company called Arexxa, sent almost 90 percent of its output to the States.
Sales of the two climbed to a combined $1 million last year. And to fill increasing demand, the company has had to buy plastic figurines from smaller companies and paint, package and market them. The success has more than made up for the failure of another division, producing garden furniture, wiped out by cheaper imports.
GATT membership, Mr. Aguilar said, "helped me prepare to compete a little more. It has been advantageous."
The tariff drop, coupled with a devalued peso, helped boost total Mexican exports of manufactured goods to the United States by more than 100 percent since 1985, to $19.3 billion last year. Imports have climbed at about the same rate to about the same level, indicating that the two economies have become more integrated.
"It's allowing each country to specialize, to take advantage of its strengths, and that has resulted in a more efficient use of resources, particularly in Mexico, because it's so much smaller," said Gene M. Grossman, a professor of economics and international affairs at Princeton University.
Confounded by the failure of protectionism to produce sustained growth, dozens of developing countries have joined free-trade organizations, hoping to uproot domestic cartels, clear the way for competition and spur export-led growth. Ambiance's experience shows the pain and the promise that small businesses in the developing world -- and the United States -- can reap from free-trade policies. And its successful shift to exports may be a harbinger of how Mexican companies may respond to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the United States, Mexico and Canada have been negotiating for the last three months and which Mexican executives like Mr. Aguilar now aggressively support.
For decades, Mexico led many other poor countries in assessing tariffs on some imports and requiring hard-to-obtain import licenses for others. Duties ran as high as 100 percent and more; some products were banned outright.
The practices were aimed at allowing domestic industries to grow and acquire the economies of scale needed to compete internationally. But these policies instead often gave rise to powerful and politically connected cartels that turned out merchandise of pitifully poor quality.
Not surprisingly, when Mexico decided to join the GATT, its business community was deeply divided. Small-scale producers of factory equipment, like boilers, fought with particular vigor, afraid that they might be wiped out by the superior quality and relatively low prices of the multinationals.
While painful, the transition was not as difficult as many feared, in part because of an unexpectedly healthy flow of foreign investment, which has averaged $2.9 billion annually for the last five years, up from $1.8 billion in 1985, according to the Mexican Government.
Just as important, said Jagdish Bhagwati, a professor of economics and political science at Columbia University, is that domestic manufacturers tend to make different trade-offs in quality, price and speed of delivery than do multinationals, allowing them to compete successfully in the same markets.
Programs to help small companies become exporters also eased the pain. Under one of them, Ambiance got certification from the Banco Mexicano de Comercio Exterior that allowed it to circumvent some paperwork for exports and imports. The bank also guaranteed 80 percent of Ambiance's bank loans -- a significant advantage in a country where the Government has used credit restrictions as a weapon against inflation. (The program is so helpful, in fact, that the United States is trying to ban it under the new trade agreement arguing that it is a form of subsidy).
Only companies with a certain level of sales and a high percentage of sales from export qualify for the certification. And applicants are required to produce extensive, five-year cash flow statistics and provide a detailed business plan for the next five years.
Export programs aimed at helping small businesses are relatively rare in the third world, according to Richard E. Feinberg, executive vice president of the Overseas Development Council, an economic development research center in Washington. Even those in the United States have long suffered from being little known. "In the U.S., we've talked endlessly about how the exports are concentrated in the Fortune 500," Mr. Feinberg said. "And we're still talking."
In addition to the liberal lending policy, Ambiance enjoyed a few lucky breaks. Not every small third world manufacturer can count on a fad on the order of the current American craze for Southwestern furniture. Like hundreds of East Asian electronics companies, Ambiance also benefited from the openness of the American market to its products. And the lower Mexican tariffs on imports also proved to be a plus -- finally making affordable the foreign machinery needed to improve quality and produce in large quantities.
One of the imports stands against the back wall of the figurine factory here, a fairly simple piece of machinery attached to a yard-long arm with a nozzled tip. Ambiance uses it to extrude packaging foam in shapes that safely snuggle its heavy plastic figurines, many of them reproductions of art works, for the long trip to the United States.
Mexico does not produce comparable equipment, Mr. Aguilar said. But since it joined the GATT, the extruders have become more affordable; tariffs on them have dropped to 20 percent, from 40 percent.
Now, some business leaders are pulling for a trade agreement that would eliminate Mexico's average 10 percent tariffs on American products, in exchange for eliminating America's average 4 percent charge.
Raul Herrera Zafra, the sales manager of Colombin Bel S.A. de C.V., part of the Cydsa group, is one of them. In a northern industrial zone of Mexico City, Colombin Bel has 360 people making polyurethane foam for the automotive, electronic, medical, furniture and mattress industries. Its latest foam, which self-extinguishes if set on fire, is being used by Chrysler of Mexico, and Mr. Herrera would like to export it to Detroit.
One of the biggest obstacles, he said, is a 15 percent United States tariff on imports of such foam from Mexico, which he hopes will be reduced under the free trade agreement. "Only by means of open competition can Mexican enterprises grow," he said. "We have gone with crazy ideas that don't work for many years."
Colombin is also hoping for lower tariffs on Mexican imports of foreign machinery. Many of the large chairs and other furniture now sold in Mexico are still stuffed with natural fibers, often harvested from trees, Mr. Herrera said. But high-precision cutting machines from abroad would allow furniture to be stuffed instead with polyurethane foam.
"The machines are indispensable," he said, "not to replace workers but to enrich them."
 
 
FACING ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
 When the Bush Administration sought Congressional approval this spring to negotiate a free trade agreement with Mexico, some of the toughest opposition came from environmentalists and labor unions concerned that American companies might move their factories south of the border to take advantage of weak environmental and worker safety rules and even weaker enforcement of what rules exist.
Since then, the Mexican Government has tightened environmental rules, shut down some of the worst polluters and increased the spending of its environmental protection ministry sevenfold.
"It's a good start," said Alex A. Hittle, the international coordinator at Friends of the Earth, a Washington-based environmental group. "One of the things propelling this is the free trade agreement, and once it is done and gone, it'll be interesting to see if this continues to go forward or sags back."
The environmental moves could eventually encourage consolidation of certain industries into the hands of the strongest companies. Mauricio Aguilar Duran, the owner of Ambiance S.A., a furniture and figurine maker that has benefitted from reduced trade barriers over the last five years, said the campaign was already making a difference.
Just six months ago, the environmental ministry shut down a foundry making bronze figurines on the same street as Mr. Aguilar's factory. The foundry's unions have occupied the site in protest, he said, preventing him so far from buying the factory and expanding his own overcrowded operations. But the potential is there.
Worker safety has received far less attention. "In the United States, they have goggles, safety aprons, gloves, special shoes and a yellow line on the floor that tells the worker where not to go," Mr. Aguilar admitted. "In Mexico, we don't have this."

HEADLINE: All About/Batteries;
Keeping a Gadget-Mad Nation Charged Up -- and Safe

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
From boom boxes to camcorders, Walkmen to cordless drills, portable power means batteries -- lots and lots of them. Americans now consume 2.7 billion of these household batteries a year. Most end up as trash in landfills and incinerators.
But many environmentalists and governmental officials are concerned that the metals used in batteries will get into drinking-water supplies as landfills leak or as incinerator-stack emissions fall to the ground. All dry-cell batteries -- different from car batteries, which have a liquid electrolyte -- store electricity through chemical reactions that usually involve two different and often toxic metals. 
 According to a draft report prepared earlier this year by the Environmental Protection Agency, household batteries account for 52 percent of the cadmium and 88 percent of the mercury found in trash, though less than 1 percent of all municipal solid waste by weight. Small amounts of the metals, if ingested, can damage the nervous system or increase the risk of cancer.
As a result, several states, including Connecticut, have recently passed laws requiring that batteries containing cadmium be easily removable from appliances for disposal. Other legislation, much calling for the recycling of materials in batteries, is pending in several states. Several dozen communities, including some in New York, have begun programs to separate batteries from other trash for reclamation.
The initiatives could shift the balance of power from single-use batteries to rechargeables. Not only can they be used and recharged about 300 to 1,000 times, but their manufacturers seem more agreeable to recycling.
Single-use batteries are the largest category by far of the $3.3 billion battery market, which is estimated to be growing 4 percent to 5 percent a year. Two companies -- Duracell International Inc., once a unit of the Union Carbide Corporation, and Eveready, a unit of the Raltson-Purina Company -- account for 80 percent of the sector. A number of other companies like Ray-O-Vac, Kodak, Panasonic, Sony and General Electric, fight for the remaining share.
The environmental issue has made rechargeables the fastest-growing market segment, according to industry executives. The largest producer is Gates Energy Products, a unit of the Denver-based Gates Corporation, a rubber products company. Its batteries are sold under dozens of names by a number of retailers including Radio Shack. Its own brand is Millennium. Gates said the market for rechargeables is about $330 million a year, or 10 percent of the overall market.

 
 
'Green' Batteries
Environmentalists Push Rechargeables
 The makers of single-use batteries, like Duracell and Eveready, say they have defused environmental concerns by removing all but a tiny fraction of mercury from their best-selling alkaline batteries.
"The ingredient of concern is mercury and all the battery companies have done a lot to remove it from their products," said James J. Donahue, Jr., a spokesman for Duracell.
Even so, environmentalists say that using batteries once and throwing them away adds to the trash that must be disposed of and contributes to the depletion of the resources that go into them.
"Based on first principles, you would argue for rechargeables," said Richard Denison, a scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund. "One rechargeable can replace hundreds of disposables."
Popular guides for environmentally correct consumer behavior, like "50 Simple Things You Can Do to Save the Earth," published by Earth Works Press in Berkeley, Calif., typically recommend rechargeable batteries. The E.P.A. recommends using them in small appliances "whenever possible."
Producers of single-use cells note that rechargeables tend to lose their charge much faster on the shelf and can hold only about a quarter the power of an alkaline cell of equal size. Prices for rechargeables are two to four times higher than for single-use cells.

 
 
The Cadmium Question
Lingering Problems With Toxic Metals
 The most popular type of rechargeable battery has environmental problems of its own. It is the nickel-cadmium battery found in "cordless" appliances that stay plugged in when not in use. Each year, millions of portable vacuum cleaners, camcorders, shavers, electric drills and flashlights are sold with rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries. Most of them are sealed in the appliances at least in part to prevent users from trying to replace failed batteries with conventional ones. Attempting to recharge single-use batteries can cause them to swell up, leak, or even explode.
This means that each year tens of thousands of rechargeable batteries, containing an estimated 1,200 tons of toxic cadmium, are going into landfills and incinerators as the appliances are discarded.
To prevent this, three states, Connecticut, Minnesota and Vermont, have passed laws requiring that the batteries be easily removable so they can be discarded separately when they or the appliance wear out. More states are expected to follow with similar rules. The intent is to induce customers to separate the nickel-cadmium units from other batteries so the toxic materials can be recycled.
The makers of nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries have broken away from a broad industry group, the Battery Producers Alliance, to form the Portable Rechargeable Battery Association. "Our initial focus is to promote the recycling of nickel-cadmium batteries," said Norm England, the new group's executive director. "We want to do pilot projects so we can figure out the economics" of recycling.
Since there are no facilities in this country to recover cadmium from batteries, initially they will have to be shipped overseas. And any group collecting batteries in quantity risks coming under E.P.A. hazardous-waste rules, which greatly increases costs.
As a result the single-use battery producers are cool to recycling efforts. Mr. Donahue said the industry would support recycling if it were economically practical. But the value of the materials, like zinc and manganese, is not high enough to cover the collection and processing costs. "In the absence of recycling, there is no better method of disposal than household trash," Mr. Donahue said.

 
 
A Hydride Substitute
It Has Fewer Uses And Costs More
 Putting aside their current enthusiasm for recycling, some makers of rechargeable batteries have tacitly acknowledged that problems associated with cadmium will probably limit the product's use in the future. So they are developing new batteries that use various metal hydrides instead.
The new battery favored by many manufacturers has many of the same characteristics as nickel-cadmium, without the disposal problem. But its differences may limit its application.
For example, the hydride battery can hold twice as much power per unit as standard nickel-cadmium, but it discharges in storage at twice the rate. According to Gates, which is developing a hydride substitute, a fully charged hydride battery would lose its charge after standing for two months. The new batteries are also likely to be more expensive than nickel-cadmium batteries, at least when first released.
The hydride battery also cannot put out power as fast as nickel-cadmium, so it probably will not be suitable for power tools and appliances that drain batteries rapidly. At the moment, that leaves only nickel-cadmium and small, sealed lead-acid batteries for those applications.
 
 
 
SAVING THE ENVIRONMENT, AND MONEY
 How do the costs of using rechargeable batteries stack up against those for their disposable counterparts? The difference can be quite dramatic, according to a recent study.
The analysis -- conducted at Carnegie-Mellon University and cited in the World Wildlife Fund's study "Getting at the Source: Strategies for Reducing Municipal Solid Waste"-- assumed that a cassette player was operated for two hours a day over a three-year period using four batteries. It also assumed alkaline batteries would last five hours, and that the nickel cadmium rechargeables would last two hours.
After three years the alkaline-battery user would have gone through 876 cells at a cost of $657. The four original rechargeable batteries would still be in use, so that total battery purchase cost was estimated at $11.
But the rechargeable user faces costs for the recharger and the power consumed in recharging. The study estimated the cost of the recharger at $10 and the power cost for 1,095 recharges at $5. The total cost of rechargeables would be $26, or a savings of $631.
The environmental savings are just as impressive, according to the study. The disposable batteries would pile up 24,100 grams of trash, including 105 grams of toxic mercury, compared with 90 grams of waste from the rechargeables. The rechargeables would add 16 grams of toxic cadmium to the environment, the study concluded.

HEADLINE: From Manhattan Project to Seventh Avenue

BYLINE: By DEBORAH HOFMANN

 BODY:
Teflon is no longer just about pots and pans.
This fall, the protective surface treatment developed by the chemical division of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company for kitchenware also protects fashion wear. 
 "Teflon's just awfully good at repelling spills, and it's completely undetectable," said Cyrus Clark, whose company designs Teflon-treated fabrics for use in bed linens, curtains and upholstery.
Discovered 53 years ago, Teflon, the brand name for polytetrafluoroethylene, has become synonymous with water and stain repellancy in the kitchen. Now the word Teflon is showing up on tags dangling from sleeves of uniforms, ski parkas and raincoats. Scores of outerwear manufacturers are offering Teflon-covered garments.
And there are other applications in evidence along Seventh Avenue: wool business suits, leather gloves and jackets, skirts of cotton chintz, silk blouses, scarfs, dresses, neckties and childrens' clothes. Textile mills are shipping Teflon-treated cloth to fabric stores.
Du Pont emphasizes the economic incentive: fewer dry cleaning bills. It says that wet or oily blotches can be wiped away and that stains wash out more easily in the laundry.
Will Teflon-treated garments reduce business for the dry cleaning industry? "It most definitely won't make us sit by the phone, the equivalent of the lonely Maytag repair man," said Norman Oehlke of the International Fabric Care Institute, a trade group in Silver Spring, Md. "It'll be good for everybody, including us; the Teflon coating will make stains more easy to remove.
"It may even be a boon to business, another service that we can offer."
About 2,000 drycleaners now offer to apply Teflon to any garment, whether or not it was originally treated with Teflon.
Du Pont says the coating is undetectable by sight, smell or touch and that a fabric's natural properties of breathability, weight and drape are unaffected.
Teflon is a fluorine-based compound that was discovered by Du Pont in 1938. The polymer material resists interacting chemically with anything else; for that reason it was used in the early 1940's to pack radioactive materials used to build the atom bomb. It was later used to make electronic wire casings, and in 1960, during a Christmas promotion at Macy's, it was introduced in nonstick kitchenware.
 
Goodbye Zepel
 In the last five years, the company said, research was conducted to try to make Teflon in a liquid form so that it could be used to protect fabric. Development was completed last fall. Teflon is replacing Zepel, Du Pont's previous stain repellent, which is being retired.
"We reformulated Teflon to use it on all new categories of surfaces, including soft and delicate fabrics," said Gary De Bay, the worldwide brand manager for Teflon.
In its initial liquid form, it is applied to most garments at the textile mill phase as a final step after dyeing. It may be sprayed or rolled on, or a fabric may be dipped in a bath to cause the Teflon to absorb and coat every fiber. Life expectancy on a wash-and-wear garment, for example, a uniform, is about three years.
Another Teflon treatment can then be applied; Du Pont estimates a new application to a trenchcoat, for example, would cost about $10.
Among the range of Teflon-coated apparel available to consumers this fall are a hand-painted silk scarf in muted mauve, celery, rose, gray and black, designed by Tamara Maas for Lippin International ($125), as well as the designer's hand-painted silk jacket with silk batting, in orange, coral, grape, black and chartreuse ($395). Both are available at department stores nationwide.
A three-quarter length trench-style raincoat by Portrait with a floral print of subdued blue, green and mauve, is $189 at Macy's, Plymouth and Nordstrom. Aris/Isotoner makes womens' gloves protected with Teflon, $26 unlined, $30, lined, at Macy's, Lord & Taylor, Bloomingdale's, A. & S. and Stern's stores.
Cotton shorts, $35, shirts, $40, nylon jackets, $70, and caps, $9, made by 10-X, are treated with Teflon and sold at sporting goods stores nationwide. Teflon-permeated parkas by Roffe are $195 to $240 at Paragon Sports and Scandinavian Ski Shop. A man's trench-style raincoat by Whaling, $400 at Lord & Taylor, is waterproofed by Teflon.
A buttery yet water and stain proof leather jacket by Laurence Roy, available at Tannery West stores nationwide, is $395.

HEADLINE: New Cafes: Tradition Without Smoke

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
In the 1950's, cafes were dark places filled with cigarette smoke and bohemians. In the 80's, they were soaring, noisy spaces inhabited by black-clad women and baby vegetables.
Now, cafes are flourishing in yet another form. A number of small cafes concentrating on coffee, tea, desserts and a few salads and sandwiches have opened in the last year or so, particularly in downtown Manhattan. They're not restaurants calling themselves cafes but small, relaxed meeting places, although not usually dark and smoky. 
 For restaurateurs, cafes are appealing because they require a relatively small initial investment and are simpler to run, requiring a smaller inventory and a less sophisticated work force than restaurants.
For customers, they seem to suit the new tone of the time: informal and unpretentious, requiring less of a commitment than going out for a real meal at a real restaurant. Although prices for individual items like a cappuccino for $2.50 may be high, the total bill for an afternoon or evening out is small, a benefit when even the affluent feel uncomfortable with heavy spending.
 
From Cozy to Lively
 The cafes are as varied as their owners. Some, like Anglers and Writers at 420 Hudson Street, are woody, cozy places where real moms turn out apple pie; others, like The City Bakery at 22 East 17th Street, are stylish, lively meeting places. Often, they are tucked away on side streets, like Edgar's at 255 West 84th Street.
The City Bakery, which was opened in December by Maury Rubin, a former producer and director for ABC, attracts farmers and customers from the nearby farmers' market as well as photographers and advertising peple who work in the neighborhood. Metal tubes filled with newspapers and magazines cover one wall.
"Cafes allow people to relax a little bit more," said Natasha Halmovich, the manager. "Restaurants are like going to the theater. Cafes are like going to the movies."
Cafes are places to sit and talk, to sit and read, to sit and watch the passing parade. It is against the informal rules of a cafe for patrons to be rushed out of their chairs. Cliff Barda, who was recently in New York from Seattle to visit his daughter, spent most of one day at Dean & DeLuca Coffee-Tea at 121 Prince Street, which met his two requirements: "The coffee has to be good and the ambiance has to be friendly."
 
'Permissive Atmosphere'
 The lack of table service, he said, encourages lingering. "It's a kind of permissive atmosphere," he said. "Table service makes you feel more claustrophobic."
Mr. Barda, who directs a mental health center, said he often takes his paperwork to cafes in Seattle. "It's a European influence that has finally come over here," he said. "It's acceptable now to pass time in cafes."
Cafes are also the logical destination for those who have given up drugs and drinking, and find bars or clubs unappealing. "If you're going to a cafe, you don't have to be confronted with it," said Angela Lukacin, manager of Caffe Giardino at 25 Cleveland Place near Spring Street.
The small, unpretentious cafe with its large garden attracts artists and writers, but it is also a resting place for tourists who have been wandering through nearby SoHo and Little Italy. Andreas Dietze, an advertising agency copywriter from Germany who had just arrived in New York, stopped for coffee after walking from Grand Central to Battery Park and then up to SoHo, a trek that took far longer than he expected. "It looks so little on the map," he said.
Flora Bochinis, a retired teacher who has always lived in New York, likes cafes because they are casual.
"There used to be loads of them," said Ms. Bochinis, who was having ice cream with a friend at Caffe Donatello at 207 Waverly Place, a new Italian cafe in Greenwich Village. "We used to sit all night for a dollar. It was marvelous. Little by little, they became restaurants and bars."
The resurgence of cafes pleases her, because it means that people will be more likely to socialize. "In a restaurant," she said, "you go and sit down with one person and nobody comes over." Cafes are also cheaper. Her friend, Laurrie Brinckerhoff, was having a toasted cheese sandwich and a salad, something in keeping with her tighter budget since she became unemployed.
 
The Roots of Their Owners
 The tide of international immigrants to the city shows up in the new cafes, with many reflecting the roots of their owners. The Adore on 17 East 13th Street is run by Yukihito and Makie Yahagi, Japanese immigrants. Caffe Novecento at 343 West Broadway was opened six weeks ago by Hector Rolotti, an Argentinian of Italian descent. Caffe Tina at 184 Prince Street is owned by two Italians, Tina Launi and Pino Di Bartolo, and could easily be in a small town in Italy.
Some define themselves by their coffees, others by their teas. Le Poeme, at Prince and Elizabeth Streets, with Corsican and French specialties, has teas like rasberry, blackberry and fresh ginger.
Craig Bero, who owns both a cafe, Anglers and Writers, and a restaurant, Village Atelier, said cafes seem more in keeping with the times. A cafe, he said, offers simplicty, with lower expectations and fewer promises.
They can be places to dream, though. Sylvia Stein was drinking coffee and eating a croissant at Caffe Rafaella on Seventh Avenue near 10th Street, fantasizing about moving to Santa Fe and opening a Jewish deli. The closest she has come to restaurant experience was her acting stint on the soap opera "As the World Turns."
"I was a waitress in a deli," Ms. Stein said. "I wore yellow polyester on national television."

HEADLINE: Camera

BYLINE: By John Durniak; John Durniak is a freelance writer, editor and consultant on photography.

 BODY:
A camera for mixed media, one that may be a harbinger of a new kind of filmless photography, is coming to the United States from Japan.
The impact of television and the computer is being acknowledged by the Fujix Digital Still Camera, which takes 21 color images on a reusable Fujix IM-8S electronic memory card. Its manufacturer, Fuji, sees a many-sided market -- for family pictures, photojournalism, for desktop publishing, for engineering and product design. 
 The memory cards can be played through a standard television set using the camera's built-in playback function, or recorded into a personal computer for viewing and use.
High-quality prints can be made from the memory cards, according to Fuji, and next fall the company will provide lab services for transferring memory-card images onto Photo CD's -- a system developed by Eastman Kodak and Philips Electronics to allow photographs to be transferred to compact disks for display on television screens.
Now being sold in Japan, the camera will appear on the American market in April, shortly after the 1992 Comdex Exhibition in Chicago.
In 1988, Fuji developed the world's first camera that recorded pictures on digital memory cards -- the DS-1P. A year later, as an experiment, the camera system was offered for sale in Japan. This is a new and improved version of the original Fuji memory-card camera.
When the card is inserted into the Fujix DP-100 Memory Card Processor, the compressed images can be moved quickly into personal computers like the Apple Macintosh and I.B.M.
Photographs of the camera show it to be almost palm-sized and shaped more like a small video camera than a traditional 35-millimeter still unit. The Fujix Digital features automatic focus, a 3x zoom lens with capacity for closeups, rechargeable batteries and a built-in playback function for immediate viewing on a television screen.
The camera weighs about 1 3/4 pounds. The memory card is 2.2 millimeters thick and about the size of a business card.
Shutter speeds run from a quarter of a second to 1/749 second, with aperture setting from f/2 to f/11. Through-the-lens metering can be used for available light and taking pictures with the built-in flash. Photographers have a choice of automatic or manual exposure.
The electronic flash features quick recharge, has an automatic power save function, and can be set for automatic flash-on when needed.
Drive modes are for single-frame recording, continuous or with a self-timer. Erasing faulty images is accomplished from the last frame, backwards.
To power the camera, the engineers have wisely chosen rechargeable battery packs, and long-life lithium batteries for the memory backup system.
With image compression, the user has a choice of three modes -- "fine," which produces 5 frames a card, "normal" for 10 frames and "economy" for the maximum 21 frames. The imaging device contains 390,000 pixels, or picture elements.
An American market price has not been set yet. In Japan, the camera sells for around $5,000.
According to Fuji, three elements will help in creating a new market for its digital system: the increase in popularity of PC work stations; the development of computer networks throughout the world and the imminent appearance of high-definition television, or HDTV, in the marketplace. With these forces in play, Fuji believes there will be a great need for the taking and transmitting of digital pictures quickly.
"High-quality image transmission," said a Fuji spokesman, "is possible at a quick seven seconds per frame, making the system ideal for the coming information network era."
What else is new at Fuji?
People in the Memphis area have until the end of this month to see what Fuji believes is the world's largest photographic mural. It is a picture of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, U.S.S.R., and is part of the Catherine the Great Exhibition at the Memphis Cook Convention Center. Fuji photographic materials were used in creating the super mural, which measures 92 feet by 15 feet.
Fuji is about to place on the American market this fall an ultra-compact video projector, the P-40U, which can be used with any camcorder, VCR or video disk player that has a video output terminal. It projects an image ranging in size from 6 to 40 inches measured diagonally. The lens is a 55-millimeter, f/2.8. It can be powered by AC or a camcorder battery. It is so small it fits easily into a camcorder bag: 33/16 by 27/16 by 71/16 inches. List price: $799.

HEADLINE: Rural Towns Trying to Lure Retirees to Bloster Economy

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
Using advertising, videos, toll-free hot lines and booths at recreational vehicle conventions, small towns from Idaho to Alabama are fighting decline by marketing themselves to retirees.
Many of the most aggressive towns are inland places far from the sunny retirement belt of Florida and the Southwest, like Guntersville, Ala., Hot Springs, Ark., and Chewelah, Wash. And they are having success, luring significant numbers of older people who find traditional retirement meccas overbuilt, crime-ridden and unaffordable. 
 Many civic leaders say it is now far easier and more lucrative for rural towns to attract older people -- with their pensions and savings -- than new factories or office parks. Companies often demand millions of dollars in tax abatements and new roads and other repairs, they say. But retirees and their hundreds of thousands of dollars in assets are being enticed with a brochure, a tour, a handshake and a smile.
 
Healthy, Wealthy and Wise
 "These migrants are healthier, wealthier and better educated than most Americans," said Mark Fagan, a professor at the Center for Economic Development and Business Research at Jacksonville State University in Alabama, which is helping 94 Alabama municipalities attract older people.
On average, Mr. Fagan said, the retired couples who have settled in Alabama have annual incomes of $35,000 and assets of more than $250,000.
"They pay for their homes with cash and spend most of their income locally," Mr. Fagan added. "It is like having an export industry to bring in out-of-state dollars."
In addition, the retirees place few demands on the most expensive of local services, the public schools.
The marketing campaigns come after a decade in which many rural towns that depended on agriculture, mining and manufacturing had some of their sharpest population declines in this century, as young people moved away in search of jobs.
With 20 million Americans expected to retire in the next decade, experts say, the futures of many towns may depend on their ability to grab a piece of the retirement trade.
Most of America's 2,400 rural counties outside of metropolitan areas had sharp drops in population in the last decade. But some 480 counties, many of which include retirement resorts, saw their populations jump by 16 percent as retirees settled in year round.
As a result, more than 200 rural communities that were losing population have tried to tap into the senior market with home-grown marketing campaigns, Mr. Fagan said, and growing numbers of other towns are inquiring about them. Many of the established programs are now reporting significant successes.
Chewelah, a town with fewer than 2,000 residents, 45 miles south of Spokane, has attracted 35 retired couples in the last two years with ads in retirement magazines, a toll-free hot line and a video made for $750 by high school students, town officials say. These all boast of Chewelah's nearness to golf courses, ski slopes and hospitals.
"If you had a heart attack in my office this very minute," Gloria Davidson, the town's Mayor, said in a telephone interview, "you would be in Spokane in 15 minutes by helicopter."
The arrival of the retirees, Ms. Davidson says, has created jobs by spurring the opening of a bakery, a restaurant and a beauty shop.
 
Unpaid 'Ambassadors'
 Other places have added a more personal pitch.
Kennewick, Richland and Pasco, Wash., together have trained 49 residents to act as unpaid "ambassadors" on their business trips and vacations. The ambassadors offer middle-aged people promotional literature and bumper stickers. Together with ads and a toll-free hot line, officials say, the campaign has attracted 35 retired households.
In Alabama, the four-year-old state program has purchased $100,000 in ads in national retirement publications and advised towns on how to market themselves. The campaign has drawn 15,000 queries from out-of-state residents and several hundred retirees have settled in the state.
Guntersville, Ala., a town of 7,000 along the Tennessee River that lost its major employer, a textile factory, in the early 1980's, attracted 250 retired couples in the last three years with magazine ads and commercials on ESPN, the cable sports network, during the network's coverage of fishing tournaments.
The retirees, town officials say, have revived business in banks, real estate offices, marinas and golf courses.
 
Going Home Again
 In North Dakota, the Legislature this year financed Operation Back Home Again, a program designed to help towns across the state trace the graduates of their high schools as far back as 1950 and ask them to return for their golden years. In Mississippi, county development agencies and the Mississippi Power Company have set up booths at national boating, fishing and recreational vehicle conventions.
Hot Springs, a lakeside city of 32,000 in central Arkansas, has attracted more than 500 households in the last two years with its ads in retirement magazines, town officials say. When retirees arrive, they are met by blue-coated volunteers, who offer tours of the town, including its new art galleries and shops. Meanwhile, the guides sing the praises of retirement in the Ozarks.
"This is a garden," said Richard Bingham, a 59-year-old tour guide in Hot Springs who moved from South Pasadena, Calif., in 1987. Mr. Bingham recalls that rising pollution, crime and real estate prices made Southern California less and less inviting as a place to retire.
So he sold his home there for $250,000 and bought a three-bedroom house on a lake in Hot Springs for $100,000. He also bought a 24-foot boat, and put $75,000 into a local bank.
"It just got too darned crowded," Mr. Bingham said of California." It used to take me 30 minutes to drive to downtown Los Angeles. In the last year it took an hour and a half to two hours."
 
Traditional Areas Slip

The dimming luster of traditional retirement areas may just be starting to appear in census findings, said Stephen Golant, a professor of geography at the University of Florida in Gainesville.
In 1987, for example, Florida estimated that it would have 2,542,000 residents over the age 65 by 1990, based on past growth of the state's retired population. But the 1990 census found that the state had only 2,389,000 residents over 65, an indication, Mr. Golant said, that the migration may have slowed.
The youngest people now making plans for retirement, who will be joined by the oldest members of the baby boom in the next five years, are increasingly asking about small towns far away from traditional retirement resorts, said Kate Greer, the editor in chief of New Choices, a magazine aimed at retirees.
"I sense a real change in attitude," Ms. Greer said. "These people are asking, where do I really want to retire?"
Mr. Golant cautioned, however, that rural towns could be disappointed in the long term by the arrival of retirees. Although Mr. Fagan estimates that each retired couple has the same economic impact as 3.7 factory jobs, Mr. Golant said the retirees did not create the types of well-paying jobs that towns would gain by attracting businesses.
"Certainly they will generate jobs in recreation, personal services and health-related activities," Mr. Golant said. "But it is not clear the presence of retirees will generate higher-paying jobs that are generally related to management, research, technology and finance."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
The Outrage Index Rises; Wall St. Feels the Heat

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
SINCE the mid-80's, the nation has been swept by a seemingly endless wave of scandals from the world of finance. Defining the era are figures like Dennis Levine, with his briefcase full of insider-trading cash, Michael R. Milken, the junk bond billionaire whose machinations led to the demise of Drexel Burnham Lambert, and John H. Gutfreund, the head of Salomon Brothers Inc., who turned a blind eye on wayward Treasury bond traders. The cumulative weight of all this turpitude raises the question of whether American business has suffered a moral collapse.
But the people who carefully monitor such trends seem to believe that business is no more or less ethical than it was a decade ago, or two or three. "These things don't change that much," said District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau of Manhattan, who should know. Today he heads a sweeping investigation of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the rogue financial institution. As a young Federal prosecutor in the 1960's, he helped convict a head of the New York Stock Exchange.
Easy money no doubt bred looser morals during the 
 1980's Wall Street boom, just as it did during the go-go 60's, when fake investment opportunities poured out of "bucket shops," not to mention the raging investor abuses of the Roaring Twenties.
What seems to be new is that business on Main Street as well as Wall Street is increasingly caught between clashing economic and societal forces that are dramatically raising the cost to companies of ethical lapses. Those same forces are also increasing the rewards to firms that manage to stay honest.
On the one hand, argues Gary Edwards, president of the Ethics Resource Center in Washington, a nonprofit group that advises companies on ethics, the more intense the competition -- from restructuring, deregulation, sluggish growth, foreign rivals -- the more pressure on employees to bend the rules. "Hard times, like booms, breed bad ethics," he said.
But amid the hard times, Americans are becoming more and more concerned about morality. This is reflected not just by mounting outrage over abuses by the rich and powerful but by growing struggles over abortion, animal rights and the environment. "Moral issues are increasingly becoming the political issues of our age," said Robert W. Fogel, an economic historian at the University of Chicago. "Wall Street is one of the arenas in the struggle for a moral life."
The moral indignation is also laced with old-fashioned American populism. "The outrage is exacerbated by a sense of envy of the large amounts of money earned by a relatively few people on Wall Street," said Samuel L. Hayes 3d, a professor of investment banking at the Harvard Business School. For example, Paul Mozer, the disgraced Salomon trader, earned more than $10 million in the last three years.
Not surprisingly then, the cost of such behavior to firms has increased exponentially. "The grievous economic harm is done in great boxcar numbers," said Harry Keefe, a bond trader and founder of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Even with illicit profits of millions, he added, "the gain is so small and the potential damage is so large." And it is getting larger. New sentencing guidelines that are scheduled to take effect Nov. 1 call for vastly larger fines and more prison sentences. But for a firm caught breaking the rules, and for its employees, customers and stockholders, $100 million fines and jail terms may be the least of the costs.
Take the case of Salomon Brothers Inc. A few weeks ago it was the most profitable powerhouse on Wall Street. Since early September, when Salomon executives admitted failing to report irregularities by some of their bond traders, Salomon's value has plunged by a sickening $1.6 billion, 40 percent of its market capitalization. If investigators uncover much more wrongdoing, Salomon's very existence, along with thousands of jobs, could be at stake. By contrast, its profits on the illicit trades were estimated at no more than a few million dollars.
The shock waves can extend far beyond one firm. The fall of Mr. Milken's firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., took down the entire junk bond market.
At the same time, however, the virtuous can look forward to greater rewards. Today, on Wall Street, companies with intact reputations are picking up clients who no longer feel comfortable with Salomon, and seeing their stock prices soar in the bargain. "Ethics has been shown to be good business in the case of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley," said Mr. Hayes. There is also the prospect of increasing scrutiny. "There's a lot of political capital to be won by identifying yourself at the forefront of policing society, particularly the rich and powerful," said Mr. Fogel. The trend, which began with the savings and loan cleanup, seems to be accelerating.
As a result of the cases of Salomon and B.C.C.I. -- it illegally acquired an American bank, for one thing -- the Federal Reserve will get more power and more money to bolster oversight. Many experts welcome that development. "More money to prosecute wrongdoing would re-establish the profitability of obeying the law," said Mr. Hayes.
But the fervor is for tougher enforcement of existing rules governing finance, more than for an increase in regulation back to pre-Reagan levels. Both political parties as well as big business groups oppose re-regulation on the ground that it would undermine efficiency and global competitiveness. Rather, the hope is that making examples of a few wrongdoers will act as a deterrent and spur greater self-policing.
Businesses are adapting to the new reality with self-protective measures. "The trend is toward higher standards and greater efforts by companies to comply," said Joseph Badaracco Jr., who heads the Harvard Business School's ethics program. Since 1980, when few companies did more than publish a code of ethics, 90 percent of financial service companies have instituted formal ethics codes and 30 percent have begun ethics training sessions for their employees.
Crackdowns have already begun on Wall Street. Shearson Lehman Brothers, for example, recently suspended two traders accused of stock manipulation. Companies are also rethinking their pay and bonus systems. "An incentive system in which rewards are based on individual performance really tested the moral fiber of people that had hairline faults," said Mr. Hayes.
Ultimately, every business must create its own ethical climate. "Warren Buffet is trying to re-create a sense of community that ties everybody's fortunes to the fortunes of the firm, that means when one goes down, all go down," Mr. Hayes added, referring to Salomon's new chairman. "That concentrates the mind."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
For Mario Cuomo, All Roads Lead to Home

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
IN eight-and-a-half years as Governor of New York, Mario M. Cuomo has generated a significant body of political folklore.
There are the legendary Wednesday night basketball games with his staff, in which the 59-year-old Governor uses sharp elbows to compensate for his age and chronically bad back. There are the solitary walks around Albany's Lincoln Park, where dressed in a jogging suit he ponders the events of the day. There are the pre-dawn telephone calls from an aide in New York City, who reads Mr. Cuomo the headlines from the morning papers. 
 But few of those images can compete with Mr. Cuomo's obsession with sleeping in his own bed. Of the 3,187 days that Mr. Cuomo has been Governor, he has, by his staff's count, spent only 36 nights away from the Executive Mansion.
As the emerging field of Democratic candidates gathered at the national party's fall meeting in Los Angeles this weekend, those closest to Mr. Cuomo cited his reluctance to travel as one of the reasons he has shied away from a race for the White House. His absence from the meeting and his stay-at-home record may be the most convincing evidence that he is not planning a Presidential campaign, they said.
 
Flying the Red-Eye
 Four times since taking office, Mr. Cuomo has flown to California and back on the same day. He took the red-eye back to Kennedy International Airport on the night he delivered his triumphant keynote address at the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco. When he attended the four-day Democratic convention in 1988, he flew to Atlanta and back on the first day, then flew back down and returned on the third day.
As in most years, the Governor's one-week vacation was spent in the Executive Mansion last month, where he could read and work the phones without wearing a suit or making appearances.
When Mr. Cuomo leaves on Saturday for a rare week-long trade mission to Japan, it will be only the second overseas trip of his three terms as Governor. The first was to the Soviet Union in 1987.
"He kept asking whether we could do it in three days," Tonio Burgos, a former aide, said of the planning for that trip.
To many of Mr. Cuomo's aides, the Governor's distaste for extended travel is an endearing quirk, a trait that testifies to his workaholism and his single-minded devotion to the state. They regularly squeeze it for every possible drop of political symbolism.
But in light of the undying talk of Presidential races, it is a quirk that also raises intriguing questions.
Why does a man with such immense intellectual curiosity have so little interest in exploring the world? Can he thoughtfully address issues of global politics when he has seen so little of the globe? Does his reluctance to go abroad hurt the state's ability to attract foreign investment and trade?
Does Mr. Cuomo dislike being away from Albany because of an extreme devotion to his job or because he is, in the words of several aides, "a control freak"? And did the prospect of a grueling travel schedule discourage a run for the Presidency?
Like most questions concerning Mr. Cuomo's complex psyche, many of those are unanswerable, particularly without the Governor's help. He declined repeated requests last week to discuss the subject.
Andrew Cuomo, the Governor's eldest son and closest adviser, said the infrequency of his father's travels this year -- only seven out-of-state trips and one overnighter -- demonstrates that he means what he says about not running for President.
Meyer S. Frucher, another frequent adviser, said that Mr. Cuomo has given few out-of-state speeches attacking the Bush Administration because he has tired of being hounded by the Presidential question. "Whenever he does it, whatever he says is obscured by the political perception that this is being done to enhance Presidential ambitions," Mr. Frucher said. "I think it truly frustrates him and inhibits his interest in traveling."
Clearly, Mr. Cuomo does not dislike travel itself. He frequently flies about New York and has taken 163 out-of-state trips while Governor. His Zen approach to flying in the rickety state plane, despite its occasional emergency landings, has demonstrated that he has no fear of flying.
But it is equally evident that Mr. Cuomo does not like to stay gone. He does not sightsee. He does not eat at restaurants. He does not seek out political leaders or policy experts. He does not linger. A voracious reader, "he travels in between the pages of books," said Vincent Tese, his director of economic development.
One aide said that Mr. Cuomo dislikes the social requirements of a visiting head of state. Others suggested it has more to do with his work habits. "When he travels, he doesn't feel plugged in and that for him is an annoyance," said Gary G. Fryer, a former press secretary.
Mr. Fryer and other advisers suggested that Mr. Cuomo feels more control over the gears of government and his own political fate in Albany.
The issue of control was reinforced 10 days ago when reporters got hold of a confidential memorandum that advised the Governor to "track the media as much as possible in advance" of his trip to Japan "and control its behavior as much as possible during the tour."
Spokesmen for Mr. Cuomo dismissed the memo from longtime aide Stephen Schlesinger as "ridiculous" and said the Governor had never seen it.
What is clear is that Mr. Cuomo's reluctance to travel extensively separates him from most governors. During 1990 alone, governors from 26 states and territories made 54 trips abroad, according to a survey by the National Governors Association. Gov. William Donald Schaefer of Maryland, for example, has taken nine foreign trips to 22 countries in his four years in office.
Some governors and mayors come under intense criticism at home for excessive globetrotting. But officials with business groups said the trips can be invaluable for promoting trade, tourism and investment.
Mr. Tese said it is less important for the Governor of New York to travel abroad because the state has a world financial and diplomatic center. In addition, Mr. Tese and Mr. Cuomo's wife, Matilda, have served as surrogates for the Governor on frequent trips overseas.
If the Japanese recognize next week that Mr. Cuomo is bestowing a special honor by visiting their country, they will not be alone. When Andrew Cuomo was asked what it meant that his father had spent only 36 nights away from Albany, including two nights at his wedding, he thought for a second and then said: "It means I'm very lucky he came to my wedding."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Some Things Are More Vital Than Money When It Comes to Creating the World Anew

BYLINE: By LEONARD SILK

 BODY:
THE United States, the world's one remaining superpower, also has the world's biggest hole in its pocket. The national debt, just $1 trillion a decade ago, is now $3.5 trillion. The Federal budget deficit is expected to swell the national debt by $362 billion in the fiscal year 1992, which begins Oct. 1. And the net foreign debt -- foreigners' assets in this country minus Americans' assets abroad, measured at their current replacement value -- swung from a surplus of $364 billion in 1982 to a deficit of $412 billion in 1990, a $776 billion plunge that is still going on.
Yet the United States, with "more will than wallet," in President Bush's words, is still taking the lead in efforts to deal with crises all over the world: dispatching American planes to Saudi Arabia to force Saddam Hussein of Iraq to yield to United Nations inspection of his nuclear, biological and chemical warfare plants; pressing the Israeli Government to change its settlement policy in the occupied West Bank by holding up $10 billion in loan guarantees for resettling Soviet Jewish immigrants; trying to achieve a Middle East peace agreement; seeking to prevent economic and political chaos in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe; trying to construct what Mr. Bush calls a new world order while maintaining the world's largest military budget and tackling (or, his critics would say, neglecting) America's own social, economic and environmental problems. 
 Is the United States suffering from what Paul Kennedy of Yale, in his book "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers," called "imperial overstretch," straining its resources and bringing about its own decline, as great powers have done throughout history?
Or is the analogy false, as other scholars, like Joseph S. Nye Jr. of Harvard, argue? In his book "Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power," Mr. Nye contends that assertions of American economic decline are based on a misreading of history. Since the early post-World War II period, the United States gross national product has indeed declined from about one-third of total world output to one-fourth.
But Mr. Nye maintains that the big bulge in America's share of the world's G.N.P. during and immediately after World War II was highly exceptional: the American economy soared as the nation became the arsenal of democracy and, unscathed by the war, led world reconstruction. Other major industrial powers, especially the defeated enemies Japan and Germany, were devastated and needed years to rebuild and modernize their economic and social structure.
With America's help, they gradually did so, and by 1975 the United States share of world production slid back to its prewar level of about 25 percent, reaching an equilibrium it has maintained ever since.
 
Depending on Others
 Nevertheless, America's heavy dependence on foreign and domestic debt to pay for its growth, which was interrupted in the last year by a recession, raises serious questions about the stability and soundness of the economy.
For the first time in its history, the United States had others finance one of its wars, raising $54 billion from allies for the operation in the Persian Gulf. In fact, the United States received $33 billion more than the war cost it, temporarily easing the budget deficit and balance of payments.
But can the United States count on other countries to finance its future military actions? Or will the only superpower be so severely constrained by its lack of money that it will be reduced to the role of mercenary or forced to surrender its freedom of action, in both military and economic affairs?
As though from the grandstands, the United States has been watching the Soviet republics, the newly independent Baltic states, and other Eastern and Central European countries struggling to emerge from Communism and become efficient market economies. If they succeed, this is a development rich in potential for the United States and the world economy.
In a sense, the end of the cold war provides the kind of opportunity for world economic growth last seen at the end of World War II with the modernization of Europe, Japan and the newly industrialized countries of the Pacific rim. But the United States cannot finance another Marshall Plan.
This does not necessarily make the country a pitiful, helpless giant. As global leader, it can mobilize the capital and energies of other countries and help clear the way for private enterprise to build the new world order.
 
Menage a trois
 The burdens this time will have to be cooperatively shared. If the collapse of the Soviet Union has made the once bipolar world "unipolar" with respect to military force, it has become "tripolar" economically, with the United States, Japan and Germany (or, in regional terms, North America, the Pacific Rim and the European Community) bound together in a complex relationship, both rivalrous and interdependent, like a tempestuous marriage.
Depending on the way the menage a trois behaves, the relationship may split apart or strengthen and mature. Threesomes are inherently unstable, however; the immediate danger, the Japanese believe, is that the Americans and Europeans will gang up on them.
Only the United States, playing both unipolar and tripolar roles, can lead the world toward greater stability. For its military power enhances its political influence, and that in turn permits it to shape global events in a way that neither Japan nor Germany, still laboring under the stigma of their wartime aggressions and atrocities, can do.
Despite the careless way it has managed its own financial affairs, America's superpower status also enables it to acquire, borrow or print the money it needs to pay for activities it chooses to undertake. And it can mobilize the resources of others through international bodies like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
This power to lead and raise financial resources could help pay for the reconstruction of the Soviet economy (or whatever it becomes), arrangements for peace and economic development of the Middle East, and the rescue of the third world from debt and economic decay.
As the British economist D. H. Robertson said 70 years ago, "Money is not such a vital subject as is often supposed." Political power, dependent not only on military and economic strength but also on a nation's reputation for using power with integrity and disinterestedness, outweighs money, which can be created or borrowed.
But only if the powerful does not lose its credibility, whether by careless financial behavior, political ineptitude or moral hypocrisy. If the United States does not succeed in putting its own social and fiscal affairs in better order, it will be that much more difficult for it to lead the way to a new and better world order. Right now, no other country can take its place.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
At Many Papers, Competition Is At Best an Illusion

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
IN a sad reflection of the hard economic times for newspapers, four venerable afternoon papers, in Richmond and Roanoke, Va., San Diego and Charleston, S.C., have recently announced that they will soon join the legion of departed afternoon dailies. The afternoon paper in Newport News was merged into the morning paper in late August. Their demise is illustrative of a newspaper landscape that is being steadily transformed by decades of pressure from rival media and a national life style that has altered reading habits.
Some of the changes are evident in figures that show a drop in the total number of newspapers. But some important breaks with the past are concealed by statistics: in a signficant number of cities, for instance, what seem to be two separate newspapers are actually products of the same reporting staff, with minimal differences in news content. The most dramatic change in the last two decades is the decline in the number of communities with competing papers. 
 The most recent announcements of closings have prompted a round of nostalgia for the languorous pleasure of curling up after supper with the local afternoon daily. According to the common wisdom, the afternoon paper has become a relic of the 1950's, like black-and-white television, the Cleavers and the Hula-Hoop.
In fact, there were still 1,084 afternoon papers in the United States last year, compared with 559 morning papers, according to Editor & Publisher, the authoritative industry magazine. True, there used to be more P.M. dailies. In 1960 there were 1,459 afternoon papers and only 312 morning papers. It is also true that the total afternoon circulation of 21 million is about half the 41 million circulation of morning dailies.
But the average profit margin for afternoon papers almost certainly outstrips that of morning papers. Small papers, which afternoon papers tend to be, often have lower overhead. They tend to be located in small one-paper towns, and for most there is no compelling reason to switch to morning publication.
 
A Dying Breed
 Indeed, what is passing from the contemporary scene is not so much afternoon papers as competing papers in the same community. There are 63 communities with two or more daily newspapers, compared with 172 in 1980, according to John Morton, a newspaper analyst at Lynch, Jones & Ryan in Washington. And only 12 of them have separately owned, fully competitive rivals, compared with 35 a decade ago. Paramount among these fully competitive markets is New York City, which has four battling dailies, all published in the morning. Other cities with at least two rival papers include Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Washington and Little Rock, Ark.
Another 20 cities have separately owned papers that have merged in what are called joint operating agreements, in which both papers continue to compete as news organizations but combine advertising, production and circulation departments. Among these cities are Honolulu, Nashville, Detroit and San Francisco.
In the 31 other two-newspaper towns, including Richmond, Newport News, Charleston and San Diego, a single owner publishes both morning and afternoon papers. Until 1980, when there were 115 such situations, the two papers, though commonly owned, were usually fierce rivals with separate news staffs. For instance, at the morning Courier-Journal and the evening Louisville Times in Kentucky, the two staffs worked in the same sprawling room, but they rarely spoke except to needle each other. The right to sneer at the other paper was earned with scoops and hard, fast work and the real beneficiaries, of course, were the readers.
 
Unrivaled Coverage
 But maintaining two news organizations is very expensive and the trend in the 1980's was to merge rival news staffs. The illusion of competition was maintained by continuing to publish the afternoon paper under its own name as though it were independent. The next step was usually to close the afternoon paper altogether.
The news staffs of The Courier-Journal and The Louisville Times merged in 1985, and The Times has since closed. The news staffs of the morning News and Courier and The Evening Post in Charleston were merged in 1981. Sept. 30 will be The Post's last day of publication.
Two of the few remaining commonly owned, but truly competitive, morning-afternoon combinations are the morning Richmond Times-Dispatch and the evening Richmond News Leader and the morning San Diego Union and evening San Diego Tribune. But the Tribune is scheduled to close early next year, The News Leader next June.
In Louisville, Charleston, Richmond, San Diego and every other city where the afternoon paper has been marked for the junkpile, the owners have argued that a strengthened morning paper will serve readers better. But the appeal of an afternoon paper to loyal readers can be almost irrational, to the amazement of some newspaper companies.
In January, Landmark Communications announced that it was studying whether to discontinue the name of the afternoon Ledger-Star, in Norfolk, Va., and call it by the same name as the morning paper, The Virginian-Pilot. The two news staffs merged in 1982 and both papers now carry the same editorial page. By and large, The Ledger-Star was simply the afternoon edition of The Virginian-Pilot, and everyone knew it.
Sandra Mims Rowe, the executive editor of both papers, said that the plan was eventually to discontinue the afternoon edition. But she said research showed that despite the similarities the papers were perceived to be different. And Ledger-Star readers not only preferred an afternoon paper; they also wanted one with its own identity. In June, Landmark announced that The Ledger-Star would keep its name, and Ms. Rowe said that plans to abandon it have been shelved indefinitely.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
China Takes on the Role of Enemy No. 1 to the West

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
WITH the disintegration of the Soviet Communist regime, a vacancy emerged for the position of "evil empire" for Americans to revile. Now there are signs that China will fill the vacuum and become America's chief ideological adversary and symbol of much that Americans find offensive -- but in a style far different from Moscow's.
This "new cold war" -- as Deng Xiaoping, China's leader, refers to the tensions between China and the West in a document circulating among officials -- is unlike the competition between America and the Soviet Union in some fundamental respects. Beijing does much to offend American values, but does much less to threaten American interests. There are indications that China may be supporting rebels in the Indian state of Assam, part of which China claims as its territory, but in general China appears uninterested in supporting terrorism or in backing insurgencies in Latin America or southern Africa. 
 "I don't think it has a strong inclination to cause mischief around the world," said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a China scholar at the University of Michigan. "I think right now the Chinese leaders are extremely worried about how China will fit constructively into the world. I don't think this is a leadership that is looking to support international revolution. I don't think this is a leadership that is seeking to disrupt trends toward global stability."
 
'Trying to Lie Low'
 China may annoy the United States by selling weapons to volatile areas, but this is neither new nor rooted in ideology. The army sells weapons for reasons associated not with Communism but with capitalism: its budget is falling as a share of the economy, and it wants to earn hard currency. Nor is China likely to become a rallying point for developing countries. Its ideology and system no longer have much appeal abroad, and it seems ambivalent about whether it really wants to be a leader of the third world. Well-placed Chinese say that in a document stamped "Top Secret" and being distributed to some officials, the Communist Party General Secretary, Jiang Zemin, asserted that China will not try to assume a conspicuous role as rival to the West.
"They're trying to lie low," said a Western diplomat. "They're trying to separate ideology from foreign policy." One reason, no doubt, is that continued growth in trade with the West is a paramount economic need.
Still, a Chinese official recently said that "events may drive us inevitably" to a position of confrontation with the West. In the United Nations Security Council last year, Beijing rather than Moscow stayed aloof from the Western consensus to attack Iraq -- serving notice that China can use its veto to block construction of a new international order on a Western blueprint. China still asserts that Communism will inherit the earth. And the leadership periodically acknowledges that it sees itself in fundamental competition with the West.
"This is a struggle between the two basic adversaries, socialism and capitalism," the People's Daily declared recently. The press asserts several times each day that "enemy forces at home and abroad" are trying to sabotage China. The result is that China has accepted by default the role of spokesman for the diminishing circle of Communist countries. It is also becoming the de facto spokesman for those developing countries that view Western complaints about political prisoners as invasions of local sovereignty.
In fact, there are a number of countries where rights abuses are more pervasive than in China -- Myanmar, formerly Burma, and North Korea, to name two of China's neighbors -- but those countries get less scrutiny. Moreover, most have not elevated repression to an ideology by boasting about "the people's democratic dictatorship" or by trying to debate the West on human rights issues. China's prickliness risks making it a symbol in the 1990's of recalcitrance and repressiveness.
Meanwhile, China's stance makes it clear that any American exultation about "the collapse of Communism" ignores a huge exception. In fact, far more people live under hard-line Communist regimes today than did three years ago: the 290 million Soviets, 16 million Czechs, 17 million East Germans and all the other East Europeans who have discarded Marxism are far outnumbered by the 1.1 billion Chinese who since the Tiananmen Square crackdown of 1989 have endured a born-again Communist regime.
 
A Reversal of Hopes
 And the effect of the crackdown on American-Chinese relations has only been magnified by the reversal of hopes in the West that China was progressing toward democracy. In that sense, the emergence of China as America's chief new adversary on the subject of human rights has as much to do with changes in perceptions as with changes in reality in China over the last three years. The regime then and now imprisoned anyone who challenged the system, then and now occupied Tibet by force, then and now backed the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, then and now sold missiles to third-world countries -- and then and now oversaw improvements in health care and living standards.
"It's a deceived-lover syndrome," suggested a Western ambassador in Beijing. "Too many people had too rosy a picture of China, and now some of these people feel guilty about their innocence and gullibility. So now they're coming back with a vengeance."
Yet to some of China's Western critics, the perception that Beijing is not as threatening as Moscow simply makes it more contemptible. The first thoughts about China that come to mind in the United States these days are likely to be not of cuddly pandas or thriving entrepreneurs, but of tanks and prisons. With the Soviet Union deflated, Iraq defeated and Libya quiescent, no country more than China stands up so brazenly for ideologies and values that most Americans find outdated or evil.

HEADLINE: U.S. Already Lining Up Support for Zionism Move

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 21

 BODY:
As President Bush considers calling for a repeal of the resolution equating Zionism and racism in his address here on Monday, American diplomats have already begun seeking support for such a move at the General Assembly session now under way, officials involved in the effort say. But they add that it is uncertain whether a repeal move would succeed.
The 12 European Community countries told the United States they would support such an effort, but warned that securing a convincing repudiation of the resolution at the current session would be difficult and carried political risks. 
 A repeal by any margin might help President Bush mend fences with Israel and its supporters in their dispute over housing loan guarantees. But many countries have warned the Administration that if it wishes to demonstrate that the United Nations as a whole has rejected the position it took in 1975, it would need to muster a substantial majority in favor of repeal. Officials have also warned that a repeal measure would run the risk of being watered down by amendments.
But some lawyers argue that as the "Zionism is racism" resolution is one of the few that have never been reaffirmed or recapitulated by the General Assembly in subsequent votes, the organization has already shown that it no longer believes in it.
The measure, one of the most controversial the Assembly has adopted, was passed on Nov. 19, 1975, as Resolution 3379, at the urging of Arab and other third-world countries with support from what was then the Soviet bloc.
The resolution identified Zionism as "a form of racism and racial discrimination" and "most severely condemned" it as "a threat to world peace and security."
That denunciation was supported by 72 members, with 35 opposed, 32 abstaining and 3 countries not taking part in the vote. The United States and all Western countries voted against it, as did a number of developing countries including the Bahamas, Honduras, the Ivory Coast and Uruguay.
The resolution was adopted at a time when third-world members of the General Assembly, backed by the Soviet bloc, were taking an aggressive anti-Western stance, securing the adoption of numerous resolutions critical of Western political and economic beliefs and practices.
Diplomats argue that the collapse of Communism and the more moderate and chastened attitude taken by most developing countries these days is an important reason for pushing for repeal now.
Another is that Israel recently scored a significant political victory at the United Nations when the 54-member Economic and Social Council, representing a cross section of the world's countries, voted overwhelmingly to admit it to the Economic Commission for Europe.
 
Israel Gaining Support
 To the surprise of many Western observers, only the Arab members of the Economic and Social Council voted against Israel, which appled to join the European commission because the Arabs had already refused to admit it to the Economic Commission for Western Asia. Geographically Israel belongs on the Western Asian panel, but the panel's Arab majority has kept it out.
The recent vote was seen by some diplomats as a sign that many developing countries were no longer prepared to vote against Israel on principle and a warning to the Arabs they might find themselves embarrassingly isolated if they opposed repeal of Resolution 3379.
Just how the United States might try to repeal the resolution is also a matter of debate within the Bush Administration, officials say.
A new resolution rescinding or canceling the Assembly's assertion that Zionism is racism would run the risk of being amended in ways that weakened its impact. An alternative approach would be to reintroduce the original resolution equating Zionism and racism and ask the General Assembly to vote it down. But while few countries would vote for such a resolution today, to be convincing this tactic would require a huge no vote and not simply a large body of abstentions.

HEADLINE: The Arithmetic of Help: Israeli Loan Guarantees

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Sept. 21

 BODY:
The tense battle between the United States and Israel over loan guarantees began here months ago with a mixture of sober economic projections, dry market analyses and more than a bit of raw, seat-of-the-pants flying.
Israeli officials knew that a huge number of Soviet Jews would be heading their way over the next few years, and a million people seemed like a reasonable forecast. It also had the advantage of being a neat, round figure -- one easy to digest. 
 To absorb so many people, American help was needed in the form of Government loan guarantees. On that score, $10 billion seemed like a reasonable, and conveniently round, figure.
"There's nothing very scientific about it," acknowledged Amos Rubin, economic adviser to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. "You're talking about a wave of immigration, and you don't know how many and how soon."
 
A 5-Year Arrangement
 Of course, Mr. Rubin said, the numbers were far from randomly selected, and when stirred together they translated earlier this month into a formal Israeli request for $10 billion in loan guarantees from the United States.
They would be spread over five years, and would be used to help create jobs, schools, housing, roads, sewerage and other essentials for the masses of Soviet Jews expected to try carving out a new life here.
It all seemed straightforward enough, until President Bush stunned Israeli leaders by declaring that the loan guarantees, which Israel says it must have to avert hard times, would have to take a back seat for now to a hoped-for Middle East peace conference.
His firmness in demanding a delay in Congressional action, and Israel's sharp, at times emotional reaction to a development it had not anticipated, have combined to create one of the nastier disputes in years between this country and its chief ally and benefactor.
 
No Handout, Israel Emphasizes
 What Israel wants, officials here feel they must say again and again, is not a new American handout, something they recognize is not realistic to expect in this time of huge budget deficits in Washington. Rather than loans, they are looking for loan guarantees, which amount to an endorsement by the United States of Israel's credit-worthiness.
Their request is not exactly as cost-free, as some Israelis contend, because by law Washington must set aside some cash as a contingency fund against the possibility of Israeli default. But that is likely to require an outlay in the area of several hundred million dollars, far from $10 billion, and Israel says it is prepared to pay that expense itself.
The real point here for Israel is that, with the United States as its guarantor, it would presumably be able to obtain lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms than it could on its own in borrowing from commercial banks or other financial institutions.
Their country, Israeli officials say, has never defaulted on a loan and is not about to start now. Therefore, they argue, the risk to the United States and the cost to its taxpayers are minimal. But should the assistance be denied, the potential damage to Israel might be considerable.
"The loan guarantees are essential precisely because we know that to absorb the immigrants, we have to encourage mass investment and borrowing," Yaacov Frenkel, governor of the Bank of Israel, said in an interview. "Without them, I've no doubt that unemployment will be much higher and that there will be tremendous suffering among Russian and Ethiopian immigrants."
 
Toting Up the Numbers
 Government economic planners, when they settled last spring on the estimate of a million Soviet Jews by the mid-1990's, calculated that they needed $60 billion to $70 billion to deal with the influx.
More than half of the total, they said, could be paid from internal sources, like domestic borrowing, tax revenue and money from the sale of Government-owned businesses -- part of a privatization program that has yet to get fully off the ground. That left $25 billion to $30 billion to be raised overseas, with most of it expected to come from the sale of Israel Bonds, contributions from Jews and other traditional sources.
But not all of it. The size of the borrowing was so large that it strained Israel's fund-raising abilities. There remained a sizable segment -- $10 billion, it was decided -- to be obtained, and that is what the Israelis hope to raise with the help of United States loan guarantees. Not only would bank interest rates be lower with this American blessing, officials here say, but the loans could be stretched out over the next three decades.
And, they add, they could obtain a 10-year grace period on repayment of the principal, no small matter for a country where a third of the budget is devoted to repaying old debts.
"During the next 10 years, we will need to pay only the interest on the $10 billion," said Dan Halperin, a former Finance Ministry official who now works with a Tel Aviv-based economic consulting firm.
 
New Wrinkle in U.S. Law
 Of concern here is the new United States law requiring the Bush Administration to create a special cash pool to back up the loan guarantees.
In 1975, when New York City asked for similar assistance, it cost the Federal Government nothing. Now, Washington must set aside this reserve fund under a system known as "scoring." It could range anywhere from one-half of 1 percent of the total guarantees -- a set-aside of $50 million in this case -- to 8 percent, or $800 million.
Israeli officials fret that even if the Bush Administration does in time approve the assistance, it might "score" the guarantees uncomfortably high. That, they say, would be interpreted by banks as a message of no confidence and would, in turn, boost interest rates.
As the Israelis see it, they are a better risk than many might think for a country with a lumbering, state-guided economy that relies on American aid, loans and gifts for roughly an eighth of its gross national product.
The negative features of this economy are visible enough. Unemployment is 11 percent and climbing, annual inflation is running at 20 percent, taxes are high and the Government has proved inadequate in meeting the needs of the nearly 350,000 Soviet immigrants who have already arrived during the last two years.
 
Unemployment of the Intelligentsia
 Providing jobs has proved especially elusive, for unlike most immigrant groups, this one is highly educated, filled with physicians, engineers and computer experts. There are simply not enough openings here for all of them. "They have to be productively employed," Mr. Frenkel said. "It's very easy to have them nonproductively employed, but it's a useless way to go."
Yet despite the considerable downside, Israeli officials insist that their credit is good, and Salomon Brothers, the New York-based investment bank, agreed in a report issued this month. Israel should not be lumped among the debt-hobbled, along with Poland and Brazil, the report said, but rather should be seen as comparable to other advanced and democratic countries like Spain, Ireland and New Zealand, all of which have better credit ratings than Israel.
This country's overseas debt of $24 billion, while high, has held steady for several years and now accounts for a shrinking share of the gross national product -- 31 percent last year, according to the Bank of Israel, compared to 64 percent in 1983. "We're far from a situation where the U.S. has to write off $7 billion of debts as it did with Egypt during the war," Mr. Halperin said.
Then again, Israel does have it easier than many borrowers. More than a third of its net foreign debt of $16 billion (subtracting the country's bank deposits and other overseas assets) is in Israel Bonds, generally bought by Jews in other countries who often view their bond purchases as donations. In addition, the regular economic aid received from the United States -- $1.2 billion this year -- goes largely to help Israel repay debts to Washington.
 
A Way to Pare Down the State?
 "In effect, Congress is paying itself back," said Alvin Rabushka, head of economic policy research at the Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies in Jerusalem.
Professor Rabushka is a free-market advocate in a society where state controls remain thick. While most economists here forecast great hardships, including higher unemployment and taxes, if the loan guarantees are not approved, he is not persuaded that the requested American assistance is a blessing.
"Israelis like to argue the private sector is so small that it can't absorb all the Soviet Jews, and so the Government must do it," he said. "But the reason the private sector is so small is that the Government of Israel is so large and has prevented the private sector from developing."
"The loan guarantees," Professor Rabushka said, "would continue this trend."

HEADLINE: Neighbors Challenge New York's Tax Reputation

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
Recently approved changes in Connecticut's taxes, which will be phased in starting on Oct. 1, are the latest in a series of regional tax increases that could change the competitive dynamics of the New York metropolitan area, accountants and relocation specialists say.
Not only does Connecticut now have an income tax, but last year, New Jersey, which had been relying more heavily than most other states on property taxes, raised its income tax and imposed a surcharge on its business tax. 
 "Both New Jersey and Connecticut have radically different tax structures than they did a year and a half ago," said Jonathan Adams, chief economist at the Real Estate Board of New York.
The end result will be to bring New Jersey and Connecticut more in line with the relatively high tax burden imposed by New York City and New York State, a convergence that will become all the more noticeable when state and local taxes are deducted on Federal tax returns. While some tax specialists predict that this may reduce some of the economic tension among the three states, others think that viewpoint ignores a far larger and more worrisome threat: instead of leaving New York for a neighboring state, businesses and individuals earning high incomes may simply leave the region altogether.
But if one chooses to remain in the region, where is the most favorable tax climate? For individuals, the answer depends on the level of income earned, where they work and whether their towns impose high property taxes. For companies, it depends on the kind of business they are in.
Even so, accountants who regularly analyze the region agree that certain generalizations can be made. From a pure tax standpoint, New York City is still far and away the worst place to live and work.
The state and local income tax bill for a married couple in New York City with two children and a combined income of $100,000 would be $7,481, or more than twice as much as the $3,225 they would pay in the region's most favorable tax location, New Jersey, according to an analysis by Arthur Andersen & Company.
 
An Added Burden
 For businesses, a company with $50 million in income is also at a considerable disadvantage in New York City. Assuming that 20 percent of its income is generated in its home state, the company would pay $2.1 million in New York City, $1.2 million in other localities within New York State, $1.3 million in Connecticut and $941,700 in New Jersey.
Companies in New York City, by contrast, not only have to pay much higher corporate income taxes, they also have to pay a slew of other less visible taxes, like a commercial rent tax and an unincorporated business tax on income derived from partnerships.
"In many cases, when you have a corporate headquarters in New York you pay about twice what you would if your corporate headquarters were in New Jersey," said James P. Sweeney, the northeast regional director for state and local tax services at Arthur Andersen.
Accountants say that determining the optimal location for individuals is also complicated. Families with incomes below $40,000 tend to do best in Connecticut, since the state's new income tax was crafted to fall most heavily on those with higher incomes.
 
The Property Tax Factor
 Many married couples whose income falls between $75,000 and $125,000 would be better off in New Jersey. But once their income gets over $150,000, the tax advantage swings back to Connecticut, where the maximum rate is 4.5 percent, compared with 7 percent in New Jersey. Before 1991, the top rate in New Jersey was 3.5 percent.
This analysis comes with certain caveats. In some towns in New Jersey and Westchester County, property taxes may be so much higher than in Connecticut that they wipe out any advantage from a lower personal income tax.
And the difference between locations becomes more or less moot for individuals working in New York City, because the city and state impose an income tax on all who work within their borders. Since those taxes are typically higher than the applicable income taxes in either New Jersey or Connecticut, and since both states give their residents a credit for New York State taxes, income-tax rates for individuals in Connecticut and New Jersey become much less relevant.
Add to that the fact that both state and local taxes can be deducted from income in figuring Federal taxes and the result is that the tax differences among the three states are no longer so distinct.
"If you run all the numbers, there's less of a tax reason to move from one place to another," said Phil L. Krevitsky, regional tax partner at Ernst & Young.
 
A Minimal Difference
 One Manhattan company that compared the tax rates in New York and Connecticut concluded that when the Federal, state and local rates were combined, the tax burden would be 46.99 percent in New York, compared with 41.59 percent in Connecticut. A comparable calculation for New Jersey yields a tax rate of 40.22 percent.
Theoretically, New York City, which has long been criticized for imposing hefty taxes, should benefit from this merging of tax rates.
"In a psychological sense, New York has been aided," said Carl Weisbrod, president of New York City's Economic Development Corporation. "The sense that somehow you can escape to a tax haven has been reduced, if not eliminated, by the actions of states around the region -- and the entire country."
Perhaps, but that has not stopped businesses from leaving New York. New Jersey's Department of Commerce and Economic Development reports that 40 companies from New York with an average of 115 jobs each expanded their operations or relocated completely to New Jersey in the first half of this year. That is up from 20 for the same period last year.
And the Westchester Business Partnership says that in the last 18 months, more than 110 companies have moved there, the majority of them from Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens and Long Island.
 
Gauging Quality of Life
 But individuals familiar with the reasons for those moves said they do not think taxes played much, if any, role. In Westchester's case, "quality of life" issues headed the list, said Connie Freid, director of the economic development for the county. And in New Jersey, personal and corporate tax rates are unlikely to be the motivating force since both had just gone up.
"I don't think taxes are as significant an item as people make them out to be, said George R. Zoffinger, commissioner of New Jersey's department of commerce and economic development."
Consider the experience of Datability Inc., a manufacturer of hardware that links computer networks that moved from Manhattan to New Jersey earlier this year. Leslie Shinto, the company's marketing and communications manager, said the company began thinking about leaving New York only when it realized it was expanding so rapidly that it needed more space at an affordable price. It ultimately secured 45,000 square feet of newly refurbished space in Carlstadt, N.J., for the same price it had been paying for 18,000 square feet on Eighth Avenue in Manhattan. "Taxes were not a primary consideration," Ms. Shinto said.
The reasoning behind Datability's move reflects that of many other companies, relocation specialists say.
 
Awaiting the Impact
 "Other things being equal, taxes are nowhere near the major consideration," said Ted M. Levine, president of Development Counsellors Inc., which helps local governments attract businesses. "It's probably 10th or 12th on the list." Mr. Levine cited more important factors like the quality and availability of labor, and the proximity to markets and suppliers.
Real-estate brokers in Connecticut say that so far they see no sign that people from Westchester or Long Island are deciding not to move to Connecticut because of the newly imposed income tax, or alternatively, that local residents are rushing to sell their homes and move out.
Even Tom Scott, who waged a vitriolic campaign against the tax changes as the head of the Connecticut Taxpayers' Committee, says he does not know anyone who is thinking of leaving the state, although he attributed that inertia to hopes the tax would be repealed.
Harder to determine is the long-term impact of the new taxes on Connecticut's business climate. Before the latest changes, corporate income taxes in the state were the highest in the country.
 
Southern Alternative?
 Murray Gerber, the chief executive of Prototype and Plastic Mold Company, a plastics manufacturer in Middletown, Conn., plans to move his company from the state.
"I just hung up on a call with my real estate broker," he said. "I'm trying to rent or sell my building and move to where my business can be more competitive." Mr. Gerber, the former chairman of the state's Business and Industry Association, established his company in Connecticut 23 years ago and it now has about 70 employees.
On a recent vacation to Georgia he discovered that state's budget was the same size as Connecticut's, even though it has twice as many residents. He filled his car with gas for 99.9 cents a gallon, compared with at least $1.20 in his home state. He saw beautiful houses for $150,000 to $170,000 that would have cost at least $500,000 back home.
While Mr. Gerber does not know where he will move and has no specific plans to move to Georgia, he insists he is serious about relocating so his company can earn a better profit.
 
Threat to Mid-Atlantic
 Higher taxes, then, may not determine the best place to live and work within the region, but they may make the entire region unattractive. "New York was always a high-tax state, but now with Connecticut and New Jersey raising taxes, it may force people to question whether they want to be in the mid-Atlantic," said David Shulman, who analyzes the real-estate market for Salomon Brothers.
It is a danger public officials in the region seem to recognize. "It's a concern that all of us face," said Mr. Weisbrod, who is in charge of retaining companies in New York City. "I think that is a major threat."
Many economic development agencies in cities and states across the country are working hard to lure companies. They regularly shower companies in high-tax areas like New York, Connecticut and New Jersey with direct mailings that explain the cost-advantages of moving. They typically follow up with a barrage of telephone calls, luncheons and seminars.
Richard Knowlton, president of the Savannah Economic Development Authority in Georgia, says he has seen "a significant increase in the last six months" in interest from companies in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, and in other high-tax states.
While executives rarely cite taxes specifically among their top reasons for wanting to move, Mr. Knowlton said, "they talk about how hard it is to be successful, and the burden the government is putting on them." His organization is not shy in reminding Connecticut executives about the state's new income tax. "We certainly point out the fact that that advantage is no longer there," he said. "We would definitely use that in our presentation."

HEADLINE: CUOMO TO PROPOSE A STATE TAKEOVER OF MEDICAID COSTS

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Sept. 21

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is expected to announce next week that he will support a state takeover of the hugely expensive and rapidly growing share of Medicaid costs currently paid by New York City and other local governments, Cuomo administration officials said today. The announcement would be a major policy shift for the Governor, who warned the city three months ago not to expect such a takeover anytime soon.
To negotiate such a takeover and to push it through a politically divided Legislature will require great technical and political dexterity. But Mr. Cuomo's advisers characterized his planned announcement as a significant step intended to build momentum behind the concept. 
 The measure, which would allow the state to receive some tax revenues that now go to localities, could ultimately save more than $1 billion a year for the financially troubled city, although such savings would probably not be realized until the end of the century. The savings for county governments statewide could approach $2 billion by 1999, Cuomo aides said.
 
Future Appears Less Removed
 In mid-July, Mr. Cuomo disappointed Mayor David N. Dinkins by saying that a state Medicaid takeover was "a projection for the removed future." While the Governor never rejected the idea, city officials interpreted his pronouncement as a devastating deflation of their hopes for fiscal relief from the state.
Cuomo administration officials said the Medicaid announcement was to be the centerpiece in a pair of speeches that the Governor would deliver in New York City on Monday night and Tuesday morning. In the speeches, which Cuomo aides are promoting as highly important, Mr. Cuomo plans to propose a variety of legislative and administrative measures that could provide state help to the city.
In addition to the change in Medicaid, the primary government health-care program for the poor, Mr. Cuomo is expected to announce a number of economic development initiatives that would be bankrolled by the state and its public authorities. The proposals may include several transportation and housing construction projects.
 
Relieving Local Governments
 The Governor is also likely to discuss the need to reduce state-imposed requirements on local governments, a reduction called mandate relief, and to suggest a number of fiscal maneuvers that would create cash for the city. He did not return a telephone call to the Executive Mansion today.
Advisers to Mr. Cuomo said he would spend the weekend selecting from a menu of proposals collected by his staff in the last three months. He is to disclose his plans on Monday night to a group of business, union and civic leaders gathered at Mr. Cuomo's request by the New York City Partnership. Reporters will not be admitted to that speech. The Governor will repeat his message at a breakfast sponsored by the Association for a Better New York on Tuesday morning. There are no plans to broadcast either speech.
Cuomo administration officials said the Governor hoped to create a sense of action and recovery after a year in which the city has suffered a deficit of both cash and morale. With budget cuts taking a noticeable toll on basic services and with the violence in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn straining race relations, the city has been seized by an almost tangible malaise.
"What's necessary is to give the city and the world the sense that things are happening, that New York's not going down the toilet," said Meyer S. Frucher, a former Cuomo aide and frequent adviser to the Governor. "That's the significance. It's important that there's a sense out there that the forces are coalescing."
Because of Mr. Cuomo's delicate relationship with the Dinkins administration, the Governor's task is a politically sensitive one. Aides said Mr. Cuomo knows that he must not appear to be upstaging Mr. Dinkins, a longtime friend and the first black mayor of a city where most residents are members of minority groups. The two men discussed Mr. Cuomo's proposals by telephone today.
In July, shortly after the state and city had both approved excruciatingly difficult budgets, tensions between the Cuomo and Dinkins administrations reached a peak. The Governor made it clear he was annoyed by a memorandum written by First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel and later leaked to the press that suggested that the city did not want the state's advice on its plans for reorganization.
Cuomo administration officials have drafted the Governor's proposals with little advice from either the city or the Legislature. City officials were briefed on the broad elements of Mr. Cuomo's ideas last week, including the Medicaid takeover.
 
Dinkins Aide Praises Idea
 Leland T. Jones, the Mayor's press secretary, said today that "any move in that direction would be well received."
New York City's Medicaid costs for the current year are estimated at approximately $2 billion, and they are expected to increase at an annual rate of nearly 15 percent. The growth in the program has been driven by a rapid increase in the city's welfare rolls that has accompanied the economic downturn.
The Federal Government pays half of all Medicaid costs, which currently total $12 billion in New York State. New York is one of the few states that requires local governments to share the remaining cost, and the 25 percent share that the state requires of its counties is the highest in the country.
The cost-sharing arrangement puts severe strain on the budgets of urban counties, where most Medicaid recipients live, and that burden tends to grow at times of economic distress, when local governments can least afford to shoulder it.
The Cuomo administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the Governor's proposed takeover of the local share of Medicaid costs would be phased in and would be completed by the year 2000.
They said Mr. Cuomo would propose financing the takeover through a "tax swap," in which a share of local taxing authority would be transferred to the state. The officials said the trade would involve the personal income tax in New York City, and the sales tax in all other counties.
The Governor's embrace of a tax swap, which has been championed by the Citizens Budget Commission and other civic groups, represents a shift from the position he took last July.He argued then that the only way the state could afford a Medicaid takeover was "to raise a huge tax -- and that just isn't going to happen."
Under the tax swap concept, local governments would profit over the long term because the growth in Medicaid costs would probably outpace the growth in revenue generated by the taxes that would be sacrificed.
State officials would hope, meanwhile, that an economic recovery would increase tax revenues while paring the Medicaid rolls. And the state would insist that a variety of measures be adopted to contain Medicaid costs.
Mr. Cuomo, the Republican-led State Senate, and the Democratic-controlled Assembly have proposed a number of such initiatives in recent years, ranging from eliminating some services covered by Medicaid to reducing reimbursement rates to hospitals and nursing homes. But because of different views between the houses, many of the proposals have not been adopted.
"Until we see Medicaid costs that are closer to a more manageable rate of growth, we couldn't consider a takeover," said John E. McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino. "We wouldn't rule it out, but our priority continues to be Medicaid reform."
Edwin L. Crawford, executive director of the New York State Association of Counties, said that cost containment would be critical to the success of any takeover.
 
'It Has This Horrendous Growth'
 "The very reason we want to get rid of it is the same reason the state doesn't want to take it over," he said. "In addition to being so expensive, it has this horrendous growth to it. And once the state takes it over, it has it forever."
Although some small counties have Medicaid costs that are infinitesimal compared to New York City's, Mr. Crawford predicted that all county governments would support a state takeover. "The rate of growth in Medicaid is about the same upstate and downstate," he said.
But even within the Cuomo administration, some officials said they were skeptical that small counties would endorse the proposal. Such a refusal, they said, could cause political problems in the Senate, which is dominated by Republicans from upstate and Long Island.
"I don't know how eager they're going to be about a takeover that primarily benefits cities with large numbers of poor people," said one administration official. "And even in New York City, I think the reaction will be that it's not enough."

HEADLINE: NOTEBOOK;
A Long, Painful Road for Expos

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Dave Dombrowski and the Expos have left Montreal. The Expos should return next season. Dombrowski won't.
The Expos returned to Montreal last week after an unexpected road trip to New York and Philadelphia. They had planned on playing Chicago at Olympic Stadium this weekend, but they took another unexpected trip -- to Chicago. In fact, they will be on a road trip the rest of the season, traveling from Chicago to St. Louis to Pittsburgh to St. Louis to Pittsburgh. 
 Barring rainouts, the Expos will have played their last 25 games in other teams' parks. Structural problems with Olympic Stadium forced the impromptu journey. First, a 55-ton concrete beam fell from the side of the stadium. Then engineers found beams that they thought should be reinforced. It was indignity piled on ineptitude for the worst team in the National League East.
As if the Expos didn't offer a close enough resemblance to a sinking ship, Dombrowski fled to Florida and not just on a season-ending road trip. The 35-year-old general manager opted to take that job with the expansion Marlins.
Dombrowski, of course, had to receive permission to speak with the Marlins, and Claude Brochu, the Expos' president, granted it. The decision seemed strange, considering that only last year Dombrowski and the Expos received various individual and organization awards and earlier this year Brochu extended the general manager's contract through next year.
"Dave and I had an understanding," Brochu explained. "If he had an opportunity which he particularly wanted to explore, I would let him do so. We agreed to that sometime back. When Carl Barger asked for permission, when I spoke to Dave about it, he said he would like to explore it. I had to live by our agreement."
Furthermore, Brochu said, he felt the club had a good replacement in Dan Duquette, who had served as assistant general manager for two years.
Immediate speculation about Dombrowski's departure centered on a falling out between him and Brochu. The men, however, had a good working relationship and were friends.
Dombrowski, however, had become uncomfortable with the economic constraints that the new ownership placed on the baseball operation. One Montreal man close to Dombrowski said that the young executive found it difficult establishing himself among his older, more experienced peers and felt almost embarrassed by some of the moves he had to make because of the restrictions.
For example, he traded Tim Burke to the Mets for Ron Darling knowing that he would have to turn around and trade Darling because of his salary. In his 16 days with the Expos, Darling became an instant hit in Montreal because unlike other eligible free agents, he talked about wanting to stay.
Also, Dombrowski, for the first time in his three-year tenure, was being criticized by the Montreal news media, starting with his giveaway trade of Otis Nixon to Atlanta. He reacted much like Joe McIlvaine did in New York when he began to suffer criticism for the Juan Samuel trade. McIlvaine left the Mets for San Diego and now Dombrowski has departed Montreal for Miami.
Will any other members of the Expos's front office follow? The word among colleagues from other clubs is that Dombrowski would like to take Gary Hughes, the scouting director; Frank Wren, the assistant scouting director, and John Boles, the player development director.
"Why not, while you're at it?" Brochu said, laughing. "All these people are under contract with us through '92. We made an arrrangement with Carl Barger and David that any approaches would be completely confidential. We'll decide as a club if we will let them talk to these people. It would be a little difficult in one fell swoop to replace them all internally. We would probably have to go outside if we elected to do that. We'll be pretty tough about it. If it's going to harm us in any way, shape or form, we won't do it."
 
Politics Oust the Astros
 The Expos's unplanned journey without end rivals the tour of America the Houston Astros have planned for next season. The Astros will vacate the Astrodome for 28 days so it can host the Republican National Convention.
Richard Griffin, media relations director for the Expos, noted the two trips and said: "The last 28 days on the road and we don't even have a Republican convention in our ball park. We don't even have Republicans. We have Liberals, Conservative and N.D.P. -- New Democratic Party."
 
Blacks Out of the Picture
 Dombrowski and Duquette got new jobs last week, and so did John Hart, who was named general manager of the Cleveland Indians. Not long before, Whitey Herzog was given that role with the California Angels. This week, the Colorado Rockies will name their general manager.
Just like that, the major leagues have five new general managers, and they still don't have a black general manager. (Two club presidents were also named recently, and they weren't members of minority groups either.)
Unless they did it secretly, the two expansion teams didn't even interview a black candidate. Secretly or otherwise, they didn't interview Bob Watson, the Astros' very capable assistant general manager and the most experienced black executive in a front office.
"No one asked permission to talk to me," Watson said. "The job would have been a tremendous challenge, and I would like to have at least been considered for that challenge. I would like to have been a part of the interviewing process to let people know what my thoughts are and get my name out there. But that didn't happen. That's baseball."
The people doing the hiring, Watson added, have to entrust their business to the people they hire. "Owners don't feel they can trust minorities," he said. "John McMullen felt he wanted to give me the opportunity. I appreciate it."
The two expansion teams apparently interviewed separate lists of candidates, although Steve Ehrhart of the Rockies said it was not planned that way. The Marlins interviewed Dombrowski, Bill Lajoie of Atlanta and Doug Melvin of Baltimore. The Rockies met with Walt Jocketty of Oakland, Ralph Nelson of San Francisco, Duquette, Joe Klein of Kansas City and Mike Port, formerly of California.
Ehrhart said the Rockies spoke by telephone with Herzog, Dallas Green, Jack McKeon and Murray Cook, all former general managers, but they didn't have in-person interviews.
 
The Free Agent 8

When Gary Carter catches -- against most left-handed pitchers -- the Dodgers have a starting eight that consists totally of imported talent. Carter, Brett Butler and Darryl Strawberry were signed as free agents. The Dodgers acquired Eddie Murray, Kal Daniels, Juan Samuel, Alfredo Griffin and Mike Sharperson in trades.
Discussing the dearth of homegrown talent, General Manager Fred Claire said: "We have a commitment. We want to be competitive, so we've turned to free agents and trades and we've been competitive. But we've worked hard at player development. I believe in our young talent."
The Dodgers have long been considered one of the most fertile organizations for homegrown players, but they also have a reputation for overvaluing their prospects, luring other teams into giving better players than necessary for them in trades. Claire, however, seems to be more realistic than his predecessor, Al Campanis.
"We're not overloaded," Claire said. "There isn't a club in baseball that has a surplus of young talent. A surplus? No. But a future? I believe we have a future."
Asked to list the players closest to making it in or to the majors, Claire named catcher Carlos Hernandez, first baseman Eric Karros, shortstop Jose Offerman, third baseman Dave Hansen, centerfielder Tom Goodwin, left fielder-first baseman Henry Rodriguez and pitchers Pedro Martinez, Jamie McAndrew and Mike James (starters) and John Wetteland and Zakary Shinall (relievers).
Martinez is the 20-year-old brother of the Dodgers' Ramon Martinez. A right-hander, the younger brother compiled an 18-8 record and 2.28 earned run average as he rocketed through the Dodgers' system this year, from A to AA to AAA.

HEADLINE: Chicago Treats 47 in Congress to a Free Weekend

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 21

 BODY:
At a reception for influential out-of-town guests on Friday, with the ting of wine glasses filling the room, Mayor Richard M. Daley chuckled at how well things were going during this city's first "Congressional Weekend."
A few months earlier, the Mayor had invited the entire United States House of Representatives here for an all-expenses-paid weekend to show off Chicago and to push his Federal spending wish list. All the lawmakers had to do was show up; the city was paying for everything with hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from local corporations. 
 On Thursday, 47 Representatives, many accompanied by spouses, arrived here, including Speaker Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington. And for the rest of the weekend, they are being entertained.
 
Baseball and a Boat Ride
 By this evening, the Mayor had taken them on a boat ride and to a baseball game. On Friday, he took a select group on a helicopter tour of the city, so he could push his dream of a third airport for Chicago.
Wedged in with the sightseeing, there has been criticism. Dick Simpson, a former city alderman who plans to run for Congress next year, called the visit "a four-day boondoggle that is nothing more than a corporate funded weekend vacation."
While there is nothing wrong with members of Congress coming to Chicago on "a real fact-finding mission," Mr. Simpson said, "the agenda is packed with private cocktail parties, private gourmet dinners and a breakfast at a private club," he said. "If they were on a genuine investigation attempt, they would have met some of Chicago's 80,000 unemployed or the children who can't get into the underfunded Headstart program or the families victimized by the highest murder rate in Chicago's history."
 
The Top Destination
 The Chicago weekend came just seven days after Public Citizen, a research organization founded by the consumer advocate Ralph Nader, issued a report that said House members accepted nearly 4,000 trips in 1989 and 1990 that were paid for by corporations or trade groups. Chicago was the top destination.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, a Chicago Democrat and the co-host of the Congressional weekend, is one of Mr. Simpson's potential opponents next year.
Before this weekend's visit, Mr. Rostenkowski sought the advice of the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, which said the trip was within House guidelines because the city is paying for it.
While not one dime of city money is being spent, Chicago is paying for the weekend with the more than $330,000 donated by corporations, according to a mayoral spokeswoman.
Mr. Daley and the lawmakers shrugged off the criticism and scoffed at the very mention of the "J" word -- junket.
"I get criticism all the time," Mr. Daley said. "They get it all the time. It comes with the territory."
The Mayor said one reason he wanted the representatives to come to Chicago was to see first hand the problems facing urban America.
 
Glitter and Flash
 Asked why the representatives were largely shown the city's glitter and the flash and were kept far away from some of the neighborhoods that have become killing fields, Mr. Daley said "they see it everyday in their own districts."
"I'm basically trying to promote Chicago," Mr. Daley said. "We have to rebuild America. America spends too much time on international issues and not enough time on problems in America."
Representative Howard Wolpe, Democrat of Michigan, said the weekend was "a very useful way to expose us to the issues that are being faced by urban communities everywhere."
"This country for too many years has abandoned any kind of urban agenda," he said.
 
'A Fact-Finding Mission'
 Blowing a cloud of cigarette smoke toward the ceiling of a dining hall where his colleagues were finishing lunch on Friday, Representative William O. Lipinski of Chicago, said, "I wouldn't call this a junket at all."
"I don't even know what junkets are," he said. "This is a fact-finding mission."
Nearby, Representative William J. Jefferson, Democrat of Louisiana, telephoned his district office. For Mr. Jefferson, a first-term Congressman, the weekend was an opportunity to get to know his colleagues and "the issues" better and a chance to visit his relatives. He has two aunts and three sisters in the city.
"I saw them last night," he said Friday afternoon. "I talked to them about their impressions of the city and its problems. They wanted to make sure I saw both sides of town; folks who are doing well and folks who aren't. But I suppose the idea of these things is to show us the progress a city is making."
 
Visits to Other Cities
 Mr. Jefferson said he went on a similar weekend visit to New York City last spring. Congressional weekends have also been held in Detroit and Philadelphia.
"In New York, we saw the typical tourist sites," he said. "The bus trips took us through some depressed areas but on the way to somewhere else."
When asked if he thought this trip was a junket, a whirlwind of parties and free lunches, he sighed.
"We always get the heat and the fire," he said. "If we listen to that, we'll always stay home. To think we could become the slave of an industry because someone helped us with a plane ticket is absurd."
A few minutes later, Mr. Jefferson was one of only 13 representatives to go on a bus tour of an industrial park and ice cream flavoring plant, where they were given small boxes of chocolate covered almonds.
And as the bus headed back to the hotel, a Congressman said, "I wanted some ice cream."

HEADLINE: Late but Eager, '92 Democrats Assemble

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 21

 BODY:
With a blast at President Bush, a blithe dismissal of the polls and some blunt rejections of politics as usual, the Democrats who would be President assembled here today and began, in earnest, the scramble for the nomination.
"Welcome to what is clearly the start of the 1992 campaign," declared a beaming Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. "It feels good, doesn't it?' 
 The seven candidates and potential candidates here today were speaking to an important group: The 413 members of the Democratic National Committee are automatic delegates to next year's nominating convention and play crucial roles in party circles. Party leaders have waited, with some anxiety, for a field to present itself, and they were ready to be wooed -- at cocktail parties and hallway huddles and at today's formal committee meeting, which was the first full-blown cattle show of the 1992 campaign.
 
'Passport Presidency'
 Mr. Brown set the tone with a swipe at President Bush, asserting that he was conducting a "passport Presidency" focused strictly on international affairs. The men running for President, or contemplating a run, quickly took up the attack, particularly Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa.
Mr. Harkin, who announced his candidacy last week, scoffed that "we've never had a drought as long as this one," waiting for "trickle-down economics" to trickle down. Mr. Harkin, running as the standard-bearer of traditional Democratic liberalism, asserted that Mr. Bush "loves having his picture taken with working people" and boasted of eating pork rinds to show his empathy with the working class.
But all the posing, Mr. Harkin asserted, will be unavailing.
Mr. Harkin offered himself as the unashamed, guilt-free, true-believing Democrat in a field that includes several candidates who argue that the party must change. "I'm going to run as a Democrat," Mr. Harkin said. "I know who I am. I know what I am."
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who has argued that the party needs to refashion its appeal to the middle class, called for a philosophy that stresses opportunity, responsibility and community. He talked of his own humble roots, which were nevertheless always infused with hope, and contrasted that background with the poor children growing up today in the inner cities.
"For 23 years, since Robert Kennedy died, except for a brief interlude in the late 1970's, the Democratic Party has failed in its historic responsibility to protect the American dream," he said. "Our generation of Democrats can reclaim that role."
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, suddenly back at the center of Presidential speculation, delivered a rousing appeal for the party to remember its responsibility to aid working people, to reorder Federal spending priorities to emphasize domestic needs, to "love our troops when they are no longer troops," and to show it with housing and education and jobs.
Mr. Jackson, who was long expected to sit out the 1992 race but has recently said he was giving serious consideration to a third campaign, also reminded the party of its responsibilities to minorities. "If we fought for our minority members, who represent part of the substance of our party, as the Republicans have fought for Clarence Thomas, who is simply a symbol for them, we'd have an even playing field and all would prosper," he said.
 
Attack on Special Interests
 Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, who is still exploring a race for the nomination, delivered a scathing attack on contemporary politics and the influence of special interest money on it. The Democratic Party, he asserted, could choose to deliver itself to the "bondage" of special interest money or it could choose to break those ties and ally with the people.
Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts reflected the sudden cockiness of the Democrats in defiance of the pundits and polls. "George Bush, this is the first day of the end of your presidency," he declared as he took the stage.
Mr. Tsongas, who announced his candidacy last spring and was the only candidate in the race for several months, attacked Mr. Bush as a man without a core. "George Bush says he's for civil rights," Mr. Tsongas said. How do you make the journey, "if you have a core, from that statement to Willie Horton," Mr. Tsongas demanded. He was referring to the black convicted murderer whose case was frequently cited by Mr. Bush's 1988 campaign, a strategy that was widely criticized as appealing to racial fears.
Mr. Tsongas ended his speech with a poignant account of how his successful battle with cancer had changed his attitude toward life and politics, and made him begin to think of the obligations that one generation has to another. The policies of the present Administration, he said, were "generationally immoral."
Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma, the most recent Democrat to begin exploring a run for the nomination, used today's speech to assail both parties and cast himself as a truth-teller speaking out for the middle class.
"George Bush, I've got a message for you," Mr. McCurdy said in remarks prepared for delivery. "If you take credit for the collapse of Communism, a 40-year process that happened to culminate on your watch, then you must also take credit for the failed savings and loan. You must take credit for tripling the national debt."
As is often the case at Democratic National Committee meetings, there were subplots. Much of the buzz was around Mr. Jackson. Some of his supporters expressed concern over maintaining their influence and roles in the party if Mr. Jackson does not run.
Former Mayor Larry Agran of Irvine, Calif., also spoke to the committee today.

HEADLINE: Many Black Voters Face Quandary Over '92 Race

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
Bruce Lightner, the Raleigh, N.C., businessman who organized home-state Presidential campaigns for the Rev. Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988, is still waiting for his call to action this year.
Like other politically active black voters across the country, he is in something of a quandary as the 1992 election campaign finally gets underway and two leading black figures -- one declared, one not -- hover at the edges of Presidential contention. 
 Faced with a sudden array of Democratic choices, a shortened campaign season and the absence so far of the single well-known candidate who has laid claim to minority support in the past two Presidential contests, there are no sure predictions of where usually reliable black Democrats will turn.
"Like most people, for us it's going to be a feeling-out process on all these candidates," Mr. Lightner said.
 
Not So Sure for '92
 Mr. Jackson said last week that he was actively considering a third Presidential run this year. But Mr. Lightner, who brought Mr. Jackson to within a few percentage points of besting Senator Albert Gore in North Carolina's 1988 primary by delivering a concentrated black vote to the polls, is dubious.
He also said he did not plan to withhold his support in the hope that Mr. Jackson will make a late entry into the race.
"I think he has made his intentions clear," he said of Mr. Jackson. "If he was going to do something, I would like to think he would have made that known at least to his closest supporters by now."
Many black politicians have long insisted that black voters should not be treated as a monolithic, liberal voting bloc that will automatically support Democratic candidates.
But the altered campaign scenario, and particularly Mr. Jackson's role in it, has spurred anxious debate among elected black Democrats who are searching out a power niche in 1992.
 
Wilder's Route
 L. Douglas Wilder, the Governor of neighboring Virginia and the nation's first black elected state chief executive, has already begun his campaign, trying to stake out a more conservative middle ground that de-emphasizes race.
"Doug Wilder would like very much to simply have the issue of his control of the black vote accepted as a given," said Milton Morris, director of research for the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a research group on black issues. "But it's not likely that Jesse is going to allow Doug Wilder to just inherit black community support."
Representative Charles Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, is one of the leading black Democrats who has urged Mr. Jackson to consider a 1992 campaign. Without Mr. Jackson involved, he said, black voters might choose from among any of the remaining Democrats or, more importantly, choose "not to get involved at all."
After a meeting Mr. Jackson held last weekend with his advisers, other Jackson supporters were speculating openly about the possibility that Mr. Jackson could run. But some suggested that he might sit out the election and use his influence over the voters who have supported him to steer events during primary season.
 
Broker in the Past
 Mr. Jackson has relished his role as a broker in the past. In 1984, Walter F. Mondale waited anxiously until Labor Day before Mr. Jackson endorsed him. And in 1988, a widely publicized rift between Mr. Jackson and Michael S. Dukakis never fully healed, even after Mr. Jackson took to the road to campaign for the Democratic nominee, but not with him, in the general election campaign.
Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, a leading Jackson supporter, said it would take other candidates a long time to gain the sort of name recognition that Mr. Jackson already has.
"Should he choose not to run, the Democratic party can't win without him assisting," Representative Waters said. "Whether he is able to assist the Democratic Party depends on the Democratic Party's ability to work with Jesse."
Mr. Jackson's most committed supporters have not abandoned the hope that he might yet run, now that he has postponed his plans to be host of a Cable News Network talk show. An internal memorandum sent to Mr. Jackson by his chief aide, Frank Watkins, assessed his chances and concluded that Mr. Jackson could build on his 1988 base to win the primary and go on to defeat President Bush.
 
'This Is Open Season'
 But that strategy was delineated more than a month ago and relied on two crucial elements: that the California primary would be moved to earlier in the primary season and provide Mr. Jackson with an early boost, and that Mr. Jackson could transform the issue of statehood for the District of Columbia into a national theme.
A bill to move up the California primary was killed by state lawmakers this month.
Other advisers, like Ronald Walters, chairman of the political science department at Howard University, predict that Mr. Jackson would have a difficult time mounting a credible candidacy much later than next month.
"This is open season," he said. "The one thing he can't afford to do is jump out into a weak field and fail."
Both Governor Wilder and Mr. Jackson have expressed extreme distaste for any lineup that pits them against each other. Mr. Wilder, who has seized on economic issues and touted his success as a budget-balancing Governor, is more eager to be likened to Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, a moderate.
 
Similarities to Harkin
 And Jackson supporters see greater similarities between their candidate and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, a liberal who emphasizes the plight of working people.
But Dr. Morris of the Joint Center said that black voters, like voters of other races and ethnic groups, tend to support candidates of their own group and are more likely to choose between Mr. Wilder and Mr. Jackson.
He said Mr. Harkin, who comes from a predominantly white state, is not familiar to many black voters. "I think it's going to take a while before anyone realizes, hey, this guy sounds like Jesse," he said.
By the time that happens, some speculated, it could already be too late for Mr. Jackson to lay claim to supporters who were with him in 1988.
"He needs to know that as the parade gets going, people will eventually put their floats in it," said Representative Edolphus Towns of Brooklyn, a 1988 Jackson supporter who is chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. "They'll wait for a little while, but they're not going to let the parade get too far down the street before they join."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
A Secret Plan for Israel

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
President Bush tested his strength against Congress and the Israeli lobby and won. There will be no vote on loan guarantees to resettle Soviet Jews in Israel until January, though no one yet wants to say so publicly.
But the President's victory in this brief, bloody, ugly and unnecessary battle will spiral into a sinkhole of unrealistic Arab demands and unquenchable Israeli suspicions -- unless he moves now to restore harmony with Israel. 
 He need look no further than a secret plan already floating around his office that would allow him to submerge the bitter quarrel over loan guarantees into the broader peace process, which is what he and the Israelis should have done before they squared off two weeks ago.
There is no easy way to finesse the money guarantee issue by itself. Prime Minister Shamir will not agree to freeze Israeli settlements on the West Bank and Gaza Strip in order to get the guarantees. Mr. Bush will not say yes to the money without the freeze.
The plan would bury concessions on the volatile freeze-guarantees issue in a larger package and use the lure of worldwide guarantees exceeding $20 billion to generate a political force for compromise in Israel. Its central premise is that Washington has to be both more generous to and more demanding of Israel.
Israel would receive: a $10 billion U.S. loan guarantee (though it would have to be appropriated at $2 billion annually rather than all at once as Israel wants); another $10 billion in guarantees from West European countries (including $5 billion from Germany) plus Japan, and Washington would provide hundreds of millions in guarantees for private investment in Israel. Few taxpayer dollars would be required, unlike the yearly $4 billion U.S. aid program.
In return Israel would suspend settlement activity in the West Bank and Gaza Strip without qualification. At the same time, Arab nations would suspend their boycott on trading with Israel, and the Palestinians would suspend their uprising in the occupied territories.
The aim of all this is an early Israeli-Palestinian agreement for limited Palestinian autonomy in these territories.
Obviously the plan contains an unexploded time bomb. The U.S. would surely keep pushing Jerusalem to cede land for peace, although the Administration has promised to oppose a separate Palestinian state. Such larger questions, however, are for another, later time.
It is hard to believe that Israel would turn down a chance to finance Soviet immigration and its economic future in exchange for simply stopping the disputed settlements. But it might do exactly that unless there is a shake-up in the power balance inside the ruling Likud bloc.
The plan tries to deal with that problem too. The idea is to make the aid offer so attractive that moderate Likudniks will force Mr. Shamir to say yes and break with Ariel Sharon, the Housing Minister and mastermind behind the drive for settlements.
Administration officials know this is a long shot, but also see it as their only shot. Mr. Sharon and Mr. Shamir both want to keep hold of the territories, and both are prepared to play hardball with Washington. But Mr. Shamir, they think, is not willing to strain ties with the U.S. to the point of losing his prime ministership.
And as Administration officials see it, Mr. Shamir is strong enough now to hold onto that job even if Mr. Sharon bolts. They reckon that the other right-wing factions would stay in the Shamir Government rather than walk out with Mr. Sharon and face the prospect of losing seats in an election. And it is pretty clear that the opposition Labor Party would also go along with a Shamir-led minority government rather than enter elections when Labor popularity is so low.
Administration officials say Mr. Bush now feels he has redressed the power balance with Congress and the Israeli lobby, and that he does not want to lord his success -- or risk losing it.
That leaves him free to think about the plan near his hands, about making Israel an offer it cannot refuse, about a vision so compelling that conservative Israelis will be willing to forgo their corrosive scheme of incorporating the occupied territories into Greater Israel and focus on the nobler dream of resettling millions of Soviet Jews in a merely great Israel.

HEADLINE: Threat to Veto Israeli Guarantee Imperils Talks;
Never Defaulted Yet

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Cut Aid Now" (letter, Sept. 10), on the loan guarantee requested by Israel, Glenn Bering's reference to "the almost inevitable default on this loan" is baffling to anyone familiar with Israel's record on loan payments: Israel has never defaulted on a loan, even during times of great crisis in its economy and threats to its security. The guarantees are likely to cost the United States taxpayer not the ridiculous figure Mr. Bering suggests, but nothing at all, aside from negligible administrative costs. 
 Mr. Bering also refers to the settlement of Soviet Jews "in the United Nations-mandated Palestinian state under Israeli occupation." A minuscule proportion of Soviet and Ethiopian immigrants to Israel are settled in the West Bank.
More important, Mr. Bering fails to explain why the Palestinian state proposed by the United Nations in the 1947 partition plan (which called for the division of the British-ruled area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea into two states, one Jewish and one Palestinian) never came into existence.
The leaders of the Zionist movement embraced that proposal, which allowed for the establishment of Israel in 1948. The rejection of this compromise by Arab leaders, and the subsequent invasion of Israel by seven Arab armies led to an Israeli victory and the failure of the initiative to form a Palestinian state. This has had tragic consequences for both Arab and Jew, but Mr. Bering's implication that Israel prevented the formation of that state is wrong.
The Shamir Government's policy of creating settlements in the West Bank may well harm the peace process and go against Israel's best interests; indeed, many Israeli political and military figures have been saying that for some time. Thus it may be justifiable for the United States, as a loyal but firm friend of Israel, to pressure the Shamir Government to halt those settlements in return for a concession from the Arab states, such as the ending of the Arab-led economic boycott of Israel by Western companies.

A.T.& T. Admits the Human Error Was on Management's Side 

When a switching station went out in Manhattan last week it sent the entire region into conniptions. Hundreds of flights had to be diverted as the region's airports closed. Five million long-distance calls were blocked. It was the third major shutdown of A.T.& T.'s long-distance service in less than two years. This time, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company cited human error. An inattentive crew failed to notice when a generator switched off, said Robert Garnet, a company spokesman. Union officials countered that it was the alarms that failed. Grudgingly, A.T.& T admitted management and technical lapses. This did not go unnoticed by its biggest rival. "A.T.& T. has described its system as self-healing and fully redundant," said Daniel F. Akerson, executive vice president of MCI, which came out with a new ad campaign in response. "Clearly it's not.

It may not be Operation Desert Storm, but the potato chip wars are heating up. After years of offering coupons and other promotional deals rather than cheaper prices, Frito Lay Inc., the nations No. 1 snack-food maker, has shifted strategies to win back market share lost to No. 2 Borden Inc. and No. 3 Eagle Snacks, a subsidiary of the Anheuser-Busch Companies. To do that, the division of Pepsico Inc. said it will cut costs. First, 1,800 jobs will go, saving the company $100 million. Those dismissals will mean a $91 million charge against Pepsico's third-quarter earnings. Which salty-snack maker will fare best? "It's a war and they are all bleeding," said Max Busetti, editor of the Food Industry Newsletter.
 
Salomon Raids the Piggy Bank
 
The scandal at Salomon Brothers Inc. tarnished its credit rating as well as its name. Though its rating is still higher than half of corporate America's, it is lower than Salomon's more reputable competitors. That makes it more difficult for Salomon to raise money cheaply in a business where profits are squeezed from fractions of basis points. Last week, Salomon disclosed that it had begun dipping into its rainy-day fund of securities, which may be worth as much as $15 billion. By selling securities to raise capital -- and agreeing to buy them back -- Salomon has set up an alternative to issuing commercial paper until Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Treasury Department and the 33 state regulators investigating the firm say it has cleaned up its act. That may take time.
 
The B-2's Fading Purpose
 
The Northrop Corporation's B-2 radar-evading Stealth bomber is a plane without a mission. With Communism in collapse, there may be no need to sneak in under Soviet radar to drop a cache of bombs. But last week Congress learned that the Stealth's lack of mission may not be its only problem: in tests, the big B-2 showed up on radar. For Northrop, that is a big problem. With the Pentagon's budget shrinking, the B-2 was ailing Northrop's last cash cow. The Air Force said it wanted up to 75 planes -- worth about $60 billion -- and has ordered 15. But the B-2 is in real trouble in Congress. "We are not going to give a blank check to the program," said Senator Jim Exon, Democrat of Nebraska. Even without a blank check, Congress is in the hole for $30 billion on the B-2. Some fear that if the B-2 disappears, Northrop will drop off the scope as well.
 
G.E. Plays It Safe
 
Among the nation's biggest corporations, the General Electric Company -- with its high-tech emphasis -- is something of a risk taker. But last week G.E. showed itself to be very prudent. It announced it would take a $1.8 billion charge to cover medical and benefits obligations to future retirees. Most companies have until Jan. 1, 1993, to take the hit. G.E. decided to take it early.
 
Dirty Diaper Business
 
The rivalry between Toys "R" Us Inc. and Child World Inc. has reached a new level. Now they are fighting over, well, diapers. To lure customers into its stores, Child World announced a special on disposable diapers. But last week Child World said it learned employees from Toys "R" Us were slipping into its stores, loading up on diapers and reselling them. Child World threatened to sue Toys "R" Us. Child World was tipped off to the caper when three men in suits drove up to a Houston store and bought $100 worth of diapers each. Either something was fishy, or those three men had some baby.
 
 
 
ECONOMY

 
The Laggard Services Sector
 
If the future lies in services, as most economists are quick to say, the United States is in trouble. Economic growth in August was centered in mining and manufacturing. According to the Federal Reserve Board, factory and mine output rose by three-tenths of 1 percent in August. Though the gains were modest, this sector showed more vigor than the rest of the economy. "The manufacturing sector is the only area where we're seeing much strength," said David Wyss, an economist with DRI/McGraw-Hill.

When Spending Hurts
 
As consumers rouse from their recessionary slumber, they are beginning to spend. Trouble is, as they do, more boatloads of goods are coming stateside. According to the Commerce Department, imports exceeded exports by $5.9 billion in July. That was the largest monthly trade deficit since January and was an increase of 55.6 percent over June's figure.
 
Housing Recover Falters
 
For the nation's home builders, six months of interest-rate cuts have not been enough to keep the recovery from sputtering. According to the Commerce Department, housing starts were up by a modest six-tenths of 1 percent in August, the smallest gain in three months. The number of new permits issued also fell 4.9 percent, which signals even fewer construction starts in the months ahead. Since new construction fuels growth in other areas -- plumbing, furnishings, labor and even banking and insurance -- analysts looking at the figures were disappointed. "These numbers show a housing recovery losing steam, at least through August," said Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Society in New York.
 
Perfect Resume for the R.T.C.?
 
Albert V. Casey, a former chairman of American Airlines and of First Republic Bank of Dallas, is now expected to fill one of L. William Seidman's jobs. Mr. Seidman is retiring next month as head of both the Resolution Trust Corporation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Mr. Casey -- known as a tough manager -- is the leading candidate to head the R.T.C. The R.T.C. will manage the savings and loan bailout on a day-to-day basis. Mr. Casey has at least one qualification for the job few others could boast. Shortly after he became chairman of First Republic, it went under. It was one of the costliest bank failures in history.
 
The General Accounting Office said the savings and loan bailout will cost $191 billion.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Honda's Short Road to Market
 
It had to be one of the swiftest new-product introductions in automotive history. Last summer engineers from the Honda Motor Company in Japan said they had developed a thrifty new engine. They called it the VTEC-E. Last week, Honda announced the debut of the Civic VX, which is equipped with the first of those lean-burn engines. Honda expects the Civic VX to get about 55 miles a gallon on the highway and 48 miles in the city. But what is really remarkable about the new engine is that while its mileage is only 10 percent better than the next-best Geo Metro, imported by the General Motors Corporation, the Civic VX has about 30 percent more horses under its hood. According to Honda's critics at G.M., the new engine does not represent any big technological breakthrough. But if it is so easy, why didn't G.M. bring one out?
 
Keeping the Sushi Chefs at Bay
 
The bluefin, which is native to the North Atlantic, is a delicacy in the world's sushi bars. Environmentalists now worry it may be dying out due to over-fishing. Big bluefins -- put on ice and loaded onto planes -- can fetch $10,000 to $15,000 in Japan. So the National Audubon Society is proposing to have the bluefin listed as endangered under an international treaty. That would be the first time a commercial fish was deemed endangered. The United States Fish and Wildlife Services is expected to decide by Oct. 4 whether to recommend protection of the fish.
 
B.C.C.I. Punishment
 
The slow-paced investigation of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International is finally yielding results. Last week, the Federal Reserve announced a $37 million fine against Ghaith R. Pharaon, a Saudi businessman, for acting as a front for B.C.C.I.'s 1985 purchase of the Independence Bank of Encino, Calif. Regulators also asked a Federal court in Manhattan to freeze Mr. Pharaon's assets. They were worried, it seems, that he would turn his holdings into transportable cash.

HEADLINE: Abandoned Housing Site Leads to Suit Over Pollution

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: DOBBS FERRY

 BODY:
BY some accounts, Graig Arcuri, a housing developer, simply ran into a string of bad luck trying to build 140 luxury town houses on 40 acres of waterfront property here.
By other accounts, no amount of ill fortune justified the erosion and pollution left behind when Mr. Arcuri, faced with mounting debts and a failed project, apparently abandoned his plans and walked away. 
 In a lawsuit against the developer, two environmental groups claim that hard economic times notwithstanding, a builder must not be allowed to leave behind the remnants of a housing project to degrade the surrounding countryside.
The verdant hillside that Mr. Arcuri had hoped would become an affluent residential area has undergone dramatic changes in the four years since the Village Board of Trustees approved the developer's plans. No longer protected by natural ground cover, a section of the hillside has eroded, leaving a steep, deeply fissured incline leading down to a meandering creek and the Hudson River.
All that remains of Mr. Arcuri's initial effort to develop the land are two concrete foundations, one framed-in model town house, rubble from another building and narrow, unpaved roadways cutting across the land.
The Hudson River Fishermen's Association and the Friends of Wickers Creek Archeological Site are suing Mr. Arcuri, C. M. Realty Developers and Mount Mercy Associates. Mr. Arcuri is president of C. M. Realty and a partner in Mount Mercy Associates. The suit states that the developer violated and continues to violate mandates of the Federal Clean Water Act.
 
'We Want It to Set an Example'
 "This is an extremely important case," said John Cronin, Hudson Riverkeeper for the Hudson Riverkeeper Fund. "We want it to set an example for other communities and developers to follow. The Hudson River should not have to pay the price for bad business."
The Hudson River Fishermen's Association, originally a citizen activist group dedicated to preserving the ecosystems of the river, is now part of the 2,000-member, Garrison-based Hudson Riverkeeper Fund.
The case against the developer is being prosecuted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., senior lawyer for the Riverkeeper Fund and professor at the Environmental Litigation Clinic of Pace University's School of Law.
 
Called a Threat to Fish and Crabs
 The citizens' suit has been filed in United States District Court in White Plains. Citing Section 505 of the Clean Water Act, the suit claims that sediment-laden drainage from the two building sites flows into Wickers Creek through PVC pipes and along gullies caused by erosion. The discharges -- which include solid waste, wrecked and discarded equipment, garbage, rocks, sand and cellar dirt -- pose a threat to populations of freshwater fish and blue crabs in the creek, an estuary of the Hudson River, the suit says.
"This is somebody we couldn't ignore," Mr. Kennedy said last week, referring to Mr. Arcuri. "This guy dropped half a hillside and part of a house into a herring run."
The Soil and Water Conservation District for Westchester County inspected the site several times from 1987 to 1990 and informed the village that erosion and sediment control measures there were inadequate.
The erosion problem was first brought to the attention of the Hudson River Fishermen's Association by the Friends of Wickers Creek Archeological Site, a 20-member Dobbs Ferry group.
 
Inclusion in National Register Sought
 "First we passed the word along to the Village Board and the Mayor, but when they took no action, we came to the conclusion that we couldn't let this situation continue," said Thomas S. Morrison, chairman of the friends group. "We want proper conservation of the creek and all 40 acres. Right now, it is a blight in our community and a blight on the Hudson River."
An area covering less than an acre near Wickers Creek is being considered by the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation for nomination for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, said Julia S. Stokes, the state's deputy commissioner for historic preservation.
Prehistoric archeological artifacts dating to the fourth and third millenniums and belonging to hunter and gatherer societies of coastal New York have been found at the site. Members of the Weckquaesgeek tribe were the first settlers of Westchester, and shells from oysters, which once abounded in the river and were a key source of food for the Indians, can still be found in the soil. Until 1644, when the Indians were massacred by Dutch settlers, members of the tribe spent the warmer months along Wickers Creek.
A dig on the site -- from which many artifacts of the early Indian period were unearthed -- was completed by Greenhouse Consultants, an Atlanta-based archeological company. Barry Greenhouse, the company's president, said the prehistoric materials had been turned over to C. M. Realty Developers, which paid for the excavation.
 
Moratorium on Sewer Systems
 The developer's lawyer, Stephen J. Mignano, said that despite Mr. Arcuri's good intentions to excavate the archeological material properly before proceeding with the development, and his efforts to construct a viable housing project there, other events had prevented the project from moving ahead.
"What we hoped would be a beautiful project eventually went down the tubes," the lawyer said.
In November 1987, shortly after Mr. Arcuri received approval from the village to build, the state imposed a building moratorium on new sewer systems feeding into the Yonkers Joint Wastewater Treatment Plant.
By the time the moratorium was lifted in May 1990, Mr. Arcuri was finally ready to build and sell the $250,000-to-$300,000 condominiums, but he faced a depressed real estate market, Mr. Mignano said.
 
Lender Now in Receivership
 Also, City Federal Savings Bank in Piscataway, N.J., the savings and loan institution that gave Mr. Arcuri the mortgage for the development, folded. The bank is now in receivership and managed by the Resolution Trust Corporation.
P. Christian Yates, assistant director for loans and other assets at Resolution Trust's Somerset, N.J., office, said City Federal had made a $25.6 million commitment to Mr. Arcuri. Although the full amount of the loan was never advanced to the developer, Resolution Trust is "working with the borrower to resolve the loans that have been made," Mr. Yates said.
In addition to his mortgage debt, Mr. Arcuri owes money to contractors who began work and were not paid, said Tara M. Wall, a third-year law student at Pace who is assisting Mr. Kennedy with the suit. The total amount of those loans is not known. And Resolution Trust would not divulge the extent of Mr. Arcuri's debt.
The developer also owes the Village of Dobbs Ferry $185,000 in liens and taxes and the Town of Greenburgh $912,965 in taxes. Officials of both jurisdictions said that they have been unable to contact Mr. Arcuri to collect the money.
"Mr. Arcuri has been a thorn in our side," said the Dobbs Ferry Village Administrator, Margaret Slavin. "But this is an unfortunate story. Talk about bad luck."
 
A Trail of Bad Debts
 Mr. Mignano said his client had left a trail of bad debts and continued to be difficult to contact.
But, despite what many people believe, the lawyer said his client's "intentions are good."
"This is not Darth Vader we are talking about," Mr. Mignano said. "This is a man who ran into some hard times."
From a plaintiff's point of view, though, there is little sympathy for Mr. Arcuri's failures. Mr. Cronin said it was not bad luck but miscalculation that led to the current situation, because the developer failed to plan for all contingencies.
"Now there's a public price to pay," Mr. Cronin added. "And the question is, Will the people who said that everything was going to be rosy be held accountable?"
Jennifer Johnson, a project manager for the Trust for Public Land, a national nonprofit conservation organization, called Mr. Arcuri's story "a classic example of a bad loan that the rest of the country is paying for. That's definitely a hot issue these days."
 
Public Access to Waterfront a Goal
 The Trust for Public Land, which is based in San Francisco and has an office in Manhattan, is working with the developer and the Resolution Trust Corporation to obtain land to provide public access to the waterfront area and possibly to protect the archeological site, Ms. Johnson said.
"There may be a way," she said, "to work out a scenario whereby the developer gets out of a tough situation, the town gets something back and the public gains access to the river."
The trust wants to obtain land to connect the Old Croton Aqueduct Trailway to the waterfront.
"Hopefully," Ms. Johnson said, "we can work out a crisis situation with some capital from the trust."
Mr. Mignano said his client is still interested in moving ahead with the project if his debt situation is resolved. Matthew P. Carey, clerk-treasurer of Dobbs Ferry, said the village would welcome news that "somehow Mr. Arcuri became solvent again and the project could go forward."
 
$250,000 a Year in Taxes Possible
 Mr. Carey estimated that the village would realize about $250,000 a year in taxes if the property were developed.
Mercy College, however, is negotiating to buy the land and build a dormitory there. Because the college is a tax-exempt institution, that plan -- if realized -- would represent a significant loss in taxes for the village, Mr. Carey said.
Mr. Cronin called Dobbs Ferry "a partner in desperation with Mr. Arcuri." He said the Fishermen's Association and the friends group want the site restored and used in "a responsible way."
In the meantime, the plaintiffs are proceeding with the lawsuit. "Our primary goal is to have the creek cleaned up and the situation remedied," Mr. Kennedy said. "We won't agree to any settlement that doesn't include that."
 
Facing Penalties of $25,000 a Day
 "In the past, polluters have been reluctant to go to court," Mr. Kennedy said. "They have sought to settle."
Under the Clean Water Act, if the case goes to trial and the court finds the defendants guilty, the judge could order them to pay civil penalties of $25,000 for each day of violation.
"Instead of paying the U.S. Treasury," Mr. Kennedy said, "polluters often set up a fund to contribute to the local environment."

WILLIAM DORSEY'S PHILADELPHIA AND OURS
On the Past and Future of the
Black City in America.
By Roger Lane.
Illustrated. 483 pp. New York:
Oxford University Press.
$29.95.  
 For some, history is not a silent chronicle of past events but an active conversation between the past and the present. So it was for William Henry Dorsey, the scion of one of 19th-century Philadelphia's most prominent African-American families, and so it is for Roger Lane, a professor of social science at Haverford College and the author of "William Dorsey's Philadelphia and Ours," a long look at the evolution of African-American life in that city after emancipation.
The nature of black life in 19th-century Philadelphia fostered such conversations. The presence in their city of the African Methodist Episcopal Church (the nation's first independent black denomination), the Institute for Colored Youth (the most prestigious black secondary school, founded just before the Civil War), the American Moral Reform Society (a pioneering black civil rights organization) and the Grand and United Order of Odd Fellows (the largest black fraternal association) sharpened the historical consciousness of black Philadelphians. Some kept journals and diaries or wrote histories of their own. Others formed historical associations and organized exhibitions of their personal memorabilia. Still others systematically preserved the evidence of their own time for posterity.
First among these historically minded black Philadelphians was William Henry Dorsey, an artist whose wealthy father had founded one of the city's most successful catering businesses. Beginning early in the 1870's and continuing for roughly 30 years thereafter, he clipped nearly every article (or so it seems) concerning black people that appeared in the city's numerous newspapers and periodicals. To these he added reports, posters, catalogues, flyers, menus, playbills, commemorative plates and coins and numerous portraits -- many of the latter apparently by his own hand. In all, he put together 388 scrapbooks amounting to more than 30,000 pages.
Dorsey's scrapbooks reflect a wide range of interests, from notarial records to dialect poetry, from sermons to minutes of ward meetings, from the records of celebrations of births, confirmations, graduations and weddings to accounts of deaths -- quiet ones as nature took its course and angry ones at the hands of assassins, vigilantes and lynch mobs. A simple review of the subjects addressed, racial nomenclature employed and tone expressed in the documents that Dorsey assembled alone makes Mr. Lane's history a splendid guide to the changing lives of urban black people between the end of Reconstruction and the beginning of the great migrations from the rural South to the cities of the North.
Dorsey's massive collection of memorabilia provided the raw material for W. E. B. DuBois's classic book "The Philadelphia Negro: A Social Study" (1899), and was the foundation for yet another Philadelphia-based African-American institution, the American Negro Historical Society. But with Dorsey's death in 1923 and the subsequent dissolution of the society, the collection was shifted from place to place and parceled out among interested parties; after years of neglect and inattention, it was, to all intents and purposes, lost. The recent rediscovery of part of the collection at Cheyney State University among the effects of Dr. Leslie Pinckney Hill provided Mr. Lane with the occasion to continue the discussion that Dorsey began.
For the most part, Mr. Lane's tale is not a pleasant one. Most 19th-century black Philadelphians were poor, very poor. Like poor people everywhere, they died young and lived uncomfortably, eating badly and sleeping fitfully in houses that offered little protection from the elements. Their crowded neighborhoods showed death rates "two and even three times higher than those for whites"; they were also sites of vice, mayhem and murder. For Mr. Lane, an expert on the history of crime and the author of an earlier book on racial crime in Philadelphia ("The Roots of Violence in Black Philadelphia, 1860-1900"), this last matter is particularly significant.
But Philadelphia's black community was not of one piece. Following the primary thrust of recent African-American scholarship, Mr. Lane carefully delineates a complex social order in which "the better class" was distinguished from " 'V.C.N.s' or Very Common Negroes," Old Philadelphians (O.P.'s to the initiated) from the New, the skilled from the unskilled, Northerners from Southerners. Indeed, Mr. Lane greatly expands historical understanding of the black community's social structure, observing, for example, distinctions black Philadelphians made between those who boasted street addresses and those who resided on the alleys. Such fine differences were of utmost importance in a community where coachmen and waiters numbered among the elite. By elaborating them with such extraordinary precision, Mr. Lane does much to reconstruct the city William Dorsey loved.
Yet even the black aristocracy -- of which Dorsey was most certainly part -- enjoyed few opportunities for advancement since the black community was too poor to support its businessmen and professionals and too few to elect its politicians to public office. Ambitious, worldly and sophisticated, members of the highly educated black elite found it increasingly difficult to earn a livelihood. As the 19th century progressed, the task of transferring their elevated status to the next generation became extremely difficult.
For Mr. Lane, the key to understanding the dire circumstances of black Philadelphia was the near-total exclusion of black people from the industrial economy. White racial prejudice barred black men and women from factory labor, the most dynamic and productive sector of the economy. In 1870, fully three-quarters of African-Americans worked as unskilled laborers or domestic workers, nearly three times the rate for white immigrants. Only 4 percent of black workers were employed in white-collar jobs -- no matter how broadly defined -- compared to 15 percent for white immigrants and 35 percent for whites of native birth.
The ironclad proscription had numerous effects beyond the general impoverishment of African-American life. For one, it screwed down "the lid on opportunity," crushing the "black occupational pyramid . . . its top layers pushed close to the bottom, the bottom filled with people 'overqualified' for the jobs they held" and could not escape from. Dorsey, who lived off a small patrimony, apparently had no regular salaried employment until his appointment as a personal messenger to the mayor in 1879. He was then 42 years old.
Exclusion from the industrial order, Mr. Lane argues, had a profoundly subversive effect on community life because it denied black people the discipline that accompanied factory labor. Articulating an assumption that undergirds his work, Mr. Lane maintains that increased employment in factory and bureaucracy "demanded sober, disciplined, even regimented behavior" that, in turn, created increasingly well-ordered cities during the 19th century. One manifestation of this new "social psychology" was a sharp decrease in violent crime, particularly among industrial workers. But while Philadelphia's crime rate fell, that of the city's black population skyrocketed.
Mr. Lane's assumptions concerning the effects of industrialization reopen an old debate about the ways in which preindustrial and industrial culture shaped the lives of working people. His views will doubtless be challenged by those who see the industrial regime as the chief source of urban violence and disorder. Indeed, many historians argue that working people -- blacks among them -- employed the revivified remnants of the preindustrial past, both urban and rural, to create an urban order of their own, distinct from the regimentation that employers, the police and various "reformers" attempted to foist upon them.
Mr. Lane himself emphasizes that 19th-century black Philadelphians were an extraordinarily disciplined people, with high rates of literacy and low rates of alcoholism. They attended school longer than their white counterparts and avoided the almshouse at all cost. They had a strong tradition of mutuality and created a dense thicket of organizations -- church, schools, fraternal societies -- that knit black Philadelphians into a community that, however unsuccessfully, attempted to counter "simple racism openly applied."
Even those who dispute Mr. Lane's understanding of the implications of economic exclusion will appreciate his finely drawn portrait of black Philadelphia and the easy informality of the style that he uses to analyze the evidence Dorsey collected. But Mr. Lane is not content merely to remain in the past. Driven by a heartfelt interest in the future of his own city, he extends Dorsey's concerns down to the present. In so doing, he attempts to transfer the discussion of the origins of contemporary black America from the South, the plantation and slavery to the North, the factory and the city.
The ambitious effort to reconstruct contemporary black life that occupies the last section of Mr. Lane's book does not, however, meet the high standards set by its earlier historical analysis. Here the rich material Dorsey provided for interpreting the 19th-century city, the thick description of African-American life, is replaced by a thin one, often presented in a breathless manner as Mr. Lane rushes across the 20th century to connect the two Philadelphias. Set against the fine-grained portrait of Dorsey's Philadelphia is a hurried recital of the nightmarish realities of contemporary unemployment, domestic instability, illegitimacy, drug addiction, inadequate education and violence.
Mr. Lane's commentary on these disturbing circumstances -- which often draw on his own observations of the city -- are always informed, generally sympathetic and sometimes insightful. But they are rarely deep; in fact, they are often glib and occasionally platitudinous. Moreover, determined not to yield to what he believes to be an "exaggerated deference to black sensibilities"respecting the problems of city crime and poverty, Mr. Lane tries to maintain the same informality of style that enlivened his presentation of the clippings in Dorsey's scrapbooks. But in the grim context of today's inner-city life, what had worked so well earlier seems rudely out of place. Adopting, for example, the sexually charged language of the streets -- even if it is theirs -- to characterize the various types of work available to black men fails to do justice to the desperate problem of defining manhood in a society that, as Mr. Lane emphasizes, offers little meaningful remunerative work.
More than anything else, Mr. Lane's analysis reveals that the problems of contemporary inner-city Philadelphia are only partly a product of the legacy left by William Dorsey's Philadelphia. There is simply too much history between the late-19th-century city and the late-20th-century city -- and that history must be explained, not telescoped. Nevertheless, if neither his description nor his analysis of modern-day Philadelphia equals those he established in addressing William Dorsey's city, Mr. Lane has succeeded in continuing the conversation between past and present in a manner that invites others to join in as well.

How to Revive Housing Starts

BYLINE: By CHARLES LOCKWOOD; Charles Lockwood is a Los Angeles-based consultant to the real estate industry.

 BODY:
In past recessions, housing construction jumpstarted the economy. That isn't happening now. There was a modest upturn earlier this year, but construction is sluggish in much of the nation. This year, new housing starts are projected to tumble to the lowest level since 1945.
Housing is not leading the economy out of recession because, despite declines in interest rates and prices, only 43 percent of all American households can afford to buy a median-priced home in their region. In much of the East Coast and California, affordability figures are worse. In greater New York, for instance, only 22 percent of households can buy a median-priced home. In San Francisco, the figure is a dismal 9.2 percent. 
 How can we make housing more affordable? First, the percentage of house prices devoted to inflated lot values must be reduced. Before 1980, lots represented about 20 percent of home prices across most of the nation. Today, they constitute 40 to 60 percent.
The rise is a result of man-made constraints on land use like restrictive zoning and slow-growth rules. And local and state governments often do not have enough money to extend infrastructure for new development, so improved land grows more valuable.
Obviously, more land must be made available by expanding the infrastructure more quickly. Local governments could rely more on user fees levied on developers. State governments might enact their own version of California's Mello-Roos Act. This enables municipalities to float bond issues to pay for infrastructure improvements within a designated district. Developers repay the debt incurred for their property, taking advantage of the municipality's lower cost of borrowing.
At the same time, governments must use zoning and tax incentives to encourage jobs to move to outlying regions more quickly. Otherwise, new residents of those areas gain home ownership only at the cost of a long commute.
In addition, zoning regulations should be changed to encourage high-density, wood-framed, three and four-story apartments. These are less costly to build than high-rise apartments, and spread high lot values over more units, lowering prices.
Another solution for affordable housing in high-cost regions is state-sponsored programs to assist first-time buyers in saving down payments for their homes. Michigan, for example, underwrites low-interest loans to homebuyers whose gross annual household income does not exceed $36,500.
Through such moves, America can avoid becoming a two-class nation of homeowners and non-homeowners.

HEADLINE: Blacks See Bias Trend In Job Cuts

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
As big companies increasingly retrench, black professionals are becoming more concerned that they are being disproportionately hurt by widening layoffs and that their opportunities for advancement are becoming severely crippled.
At a convention of the National Black M.B.A. Association that ended yesterday in New York, one black corporate manager after another expressed those concerns, saying that the recession had caused many black professionals to lose their jobs and re-evaluate the worth of life in corporate America. 
 While many contend that blacks have always fared worse in employee cutbacks, many black professionals complain that the recent surge in layoffs has had a more severe impact on their ranks than previous ones.
 
Number of Factors
 Officials of the association and other experts point to a number of factors for this trend. They note that black employees often have less seniority than whites and that black executives generally do not have well-established ties with decision-making supervisors.
"Ten years ago, a company might have had the objective of increasing the black presence in its labor force to 10 percent, but that is not considered as important any more," said Derryl L. Reed, president of the M.B.A. association and assistant vice president of insurance services for the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America.
"And when it is time to cut costs, black professionals get the brunt of it because there generally is no access to the decision makers," he said. "We're not a part of the good old boy network."
No one interviewed at the convention was aware of any figures showing how black professionals have been affected by corporate cutbacks compared with their white associates. And many companies undertaking layoffs contend that they have sought to make sure that black and Hispanic workers are not affected more severely than whites.
"We have a strong commitment to having a diverse work force," said Lesli Ferrell, manager of minority business development at Frito-Lay Inc., which last week announced huge layoffs affecting nearly all of its 250 manufacturing and distribution centers. "And black workers have not fared proportionately worse than the majority work force. Unfortunately with layoffs, you have to lay off people of all persuasions and backgrounds."
Still, nearly all of those interviewed at the convention said that black and Hispanic professionals were being disproportionately affected in corporate cutbacks.
Mark T. Standard, a former marketing representative with a large computer company who was laid off from the company's New York operations two years ago, said it seemed that black workers were disproportionately affected by those layoffs.
"Nearly every black person that I knew in the company got laid off," said Mr. Standard, who is now pursuing an M.B.A. degree at the University of Chicago. "It seemed that black people were fairly new to the company and everyone got downgraded in the downsizing. Middle managers were placed in the field, and those who were in the field were placed out the door."
The corporate cutbacks have also reduced the opportunities for emerging black professionals, college officials contend. Companies "aren't just going to schools and making fewer offers; they're going to fewer schools," said Sybil Collins Mobley, dean of the School of Business and Industry at Florida A.& M. University. "And when they do come, companies are not looking for 10 people to recruit any more, they're looking to hire one."
 
Shifting Specialties
 She added that she recently visited a West Coast company that had a work force of 56,000 a decade ago. "Now that company has 28,000 workers and an order to reduce by 10 percent," she said. "And situations like that -- which are abundant -- have created a tremendous problem for the black professional."
As a result, officials of the M.B.A. association, management consultants and heads of executive search firms have been urging black executives to move out of areas like human relations, personnel and corporate communications, which have been severely cut in the last few years.
In seminars, lectures and informal discussions among black professionals at the convention, the recommendation was to go into accounting, development, sales and engineering.
Mr. Reed, the association's president, said that this year's convention had an entire day devoted to seminars on entrepreneurism, adding that with a shrinking number of management jobs available, undertaking their own enterprises has become increasingly important to black professionals.
"We want people to realize that as the number of available jobs contracts in corporate America, they must look at other areas of opportunity," Mr. Reed said. "And we are urging people to use their layoff experience as an opportunity to pursue their own business ventures."

San Diego Daily Fades as Market Outgrows It

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Sept. 22

 BODY:
The letters in Neil Morgan's mailbox come from all over California, expressing dismay over the loss of an "old friend."
Mr. Morgan, the editor of the soon-to-be-closed San Diego Tribune read one aloud in his office: "I'm sorry I wrote some critical and not-nice remarks to your paper some months ago. But The Tribune, to me, was the very best publication always. And who has time to read a morning paper?" 
 Despite the outpouring of sympathy, Mr. Morgan asked, "So where was everybody when we needed them?"
Earlier this month, Copley Press Inc., the owner of The Tribune, announced that the afternoon newspaper would merge early next year with its much-larger sister publication, the morning San Diego Union. The Tribune, which began publishing in 1895, has been owned by Copley since 1928.
The combined paper, to be known as The San Diego Union-Tribune, is expected to publish morning and afternoon editions. Yet, the demise of The Tribune is another sign of the continuing decline of afternoon newspapers. In the last two months alone, afternoon papers in Richmond and Roanoke, Va., and Charleston, S.C., have announced plans to merge with morning papers. And the afternoon paper in Newport News, Va., closed at the end of August.
 
Stable Circulation
 The Tribune, by most measurements, is not a dying afternoon daily. But two papers are more expensive to operate than one.
Mr. Morgan called the merger "a dollars-and-cents move."
Over the last decade, The Tribune has held on to most of its readers. The paper, which reached a peak circulation of about 133,000 in 1979, now sells about 117,000 copies a day, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
But in that period, San Diego -- and The Union -- surged. San Diego's population has increased about 27 percent, to 1.1 million. And The Union's average daily circulation has grown to more than 271,000, from about 204,000 in 1979.
Meanwhile, Copley Press, like most other newspaper companies, has come under pressure to reduce its costs because of the advertising slump caused by the recession.
 
Two Plans for The Tribune
 The company would not disclose how much it expected to save by merging the two papers.
 Herb Klein, editor in chief of Copley Press, said the company had considered two plans for The Tribune. One was to make it an afternoon tabloid that would be completely different from The Union in order to attract readers.
"Or we could cooperate instead of compete," Mr. Klein said. "So we decided to take the best of both papers and combine them."
Helen Copley, publisher of the papers, has said there will be staff reductions at both papers as a result of the merger. And Tribune employees are assuming that they will take the brunt of the cutbacks.
Still, many employees at both The Union and The Tribune expressed cautious optimism about combining the papers.
"If it's done right, we could combine resources to make a super paper that covers Mexico, Arizona and more of California," said Steve Downes, an assistant news editor at The Union. "If I don't get laid off, it could be a lot of fun."
Some Tribune reporters and editors, however, are concerned about the tone of the combined paper. The Union is known as an extremely conservative voice in a conservative city. The Tribune is considered more independent, with a less conservative stance.
In addition, The Tribune focuses more closely on local issues than does The Union.
Many readers say they prefer The Tribune because it is the livelier, more aggressive paper. "The local columnists made the difference," said Don Canning, a deputy county prosecutor.
Indeed, The Tribune has won two Pulitzer Prizes -- one in 1979 for its coverage of a midair collision and the other in 1987 for its editorials on immigration reform.
Copley is not the only one likely to gain from the Union-Tribune merger. The Los Angeles Times, which publishes a daily San Diego County edition, is already studying ways to pick up Tribune readers, said Phyllis Pfeiffer, the edition's general manager. The San Diego edition currently claims a circulation of more than 75,000.
 
Desirable Readers
 The Tribune asserts that it has the kinds of readers that newspaper advertisers like. Unlike many afternoon newspapers, The Tribune does not cater to an older, blue-collar audience. Tribune managers say their studies show their readers are younger and more educated with higher incomes than Union readers.
"I'm satisfied we were the right paper for the right people, but came out at the wrong time of day," Mr. Morgan said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Disabled People Gain Roles in Ads and on TV

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
NBC could easily have promoted the premiere of "Reasonable Doubts" as a
recedent-setting event in the struggle of disabled Americans to enter mainstream society.
The series, which makes its debut Friday at 10 P.M., Eastern time, arguably breaks new ground by featuring a deaf actor, Marlee Matlin, who plays an assistant district attorney and delivers some lines in sign language. The plots of each episode -- the prosecution of criminals and romance with Mark Harmon, the co-star -- have little to do with disability. 
 Indeed, NBC executives bristle when the series is described as a program about the disabled. "This is a provocative adult drama," said Charisse McGhee, the network's vice president of current dramatic programming. "It's not that we don't take into account Marlee's hearing impairment, but that's not where the story line comes from."
 
A Growing Media Trend
 Still, the character in "Reasonable Doubts" is an example of a growing trend in television, advertising and marketing. From Corky, who has Down syndrome on the ABC series "Life Goes On," to models in wheelchairs in catalogues for retailers like Eddie Bauer and Nordstrom, to shots of wheelchair marathoners and people talking in sign language in commercials for companies like Chrysler and McDonald's, there is a steady stream of what advocates for the disabled call more "real life parts."
While ads including disabled people have been appearing since the early 1980's, more recent ones are displaying them in a greater variety of roles and are even treating disability with some humor. One commercial had the quarterback Joe Montana laughing as the singer Ray Charles, who is blind, was handed a Diet Coke instead of a Diet Pepsi.
"When I first saw it, I thought, 'Whoa, they're walking a fine line there,' " said Ted Bell, president of Leo Burnett U.S.A., which creates ads for McDonald's. "But it works. Ten years ago, you would never have done something like that."
The change comes as the Federal Government begins enforcing a Federal law that bans discrimination based on physical or mental impairments. Groups that lobbied for the law, like Media Access and the National Easter Seal Society, have also been working to change media and advertising portrayals of handicapped people.
 
'Slowly Beginning to Change'
 "Our situation is slowly beginning to change in the same way as it changed for people of color," said Paul K. Longmore, a visiting professor of history at Stanford University who is disabled and has been researching media protrayals of the handicapped. But, he added, "We're still at a point with disability where a lot of advertisers fear that we will drive viewers away."
Robert G. Thatcher, vice president of marketing at the Target discount division of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, said that when an employee suggested that a photograph of a child in a wheelchair be included in a sales circular, he was enthusiastic, but also wary. Mr. Thatcher has a daughter who was born without a left hand, but he feared the ad could lead to complaints that Target was exploiting the handicapped.
The photograph, however, drew an opposite reaction. Target has received more than 2,000 letters of praise, Mr. Thatcher said.
Advocates for the disabled attribute such changes, in part, to a recognition of the economic power of handicapped people. They note that disabled people represent a large market that buys soap and toothpaste, and watches television, like other consumers. But many advertisers that have used disabled people in their ads say they are trying to reach a broad audience, not a niche market.
"Our customer base is everyone who eats," said Chuck Eberling, a spokesman for McDonald's.
 
Problems With Stereotypes
 But while disabled people have become much more prevalent in ads and television programs, advocates for the handicapped worry that certain stereotypes have arisen. Alan Toy, a disabled actor who uses crutches or a wheelchair, described how he usually auditioned for parts as an alienated Vietnam veteran or an embittered accident victim. While he recently appeared as a businessman in a commercial, he added, many advertisers and their agencies want wheelchair marathoners.
And the advocates say older stereotypes still prevail. "Good and Evil," an ABC situation comedy that will make its debut on Wednesday, has been sharply criticized by the National Federation of the Blind. In the opening epsiode of the satirical comedy, a blind man walks into a laboratory and, waving his cane in the air, proceeds to smash beakers.
An ABC spokesman said every character in the series was meant to be ridiculous and unrealistic.
For disabled people, "Reasonable Doubts" is a test of whether television viewers are ready to accept a disabled star on a weekly series that has little to do with disability.
"If this fails, it's going to be blamed on the disability issue," Mr. Toy said. "They're not going to do demographics that show Mark Harmon isn't cute any more."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
A Fall Migration to the Networks

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
The first week of the new television season did not solve all the problems that have afflicted the three big broadcast networks over the last several years, but it almost certainly postponed any orders for "going out of business" signs.
Audiences returned to network prime-time programs last week in numbers that were sharply higher than those as recent as the week before. Network executives called this encouraging evidence that viewers still look to the networks for new fall entertainment. 
 Two weeks ago, the three-network share of the audience -- the percentage of viewers who were tuned in to network programs -- was only a 57. By contrast, on the first two nights of the new season that three-network share was well over 70.
 
A 91 Share in New York
 And on Thursday, when the Fox Broadcasting Company had strong programs of its own to entice viewers, the four-network share hit a high of 78. At 8 P.M. on Thursday in the nation's largest television market, New York, the four network broadcast stations hit a figure not seen since the cable invasion: a 91 share.
"Maybe the dire situation facing the networks isn't so dire after all," said Robert Niles, the vice president of research for NBC.
The evidence is still quite preliminary, of course; the networks had some good performances early last season that did not hold up. And there may be no immediate financial gain for the networks' early success because demand for network commercial time is still soft, advertising executives say.
But the strong ratings did indicate a surge of interest in network programs once again.
Several new series did well in their first episodes, but network executives were pointing to the especially strong showings of returning series. These longtime favorites included ABC's "Full House" and "Roseanne," NBC's "Cheers" and "The Cosby Show," Fox's "The Simpsons" and CBS's entire lineup of Monday night comedies. Indeed, each of CBS's shows scored its highest rating ever, with "Murphy Brown" at the top.
"Murphy Brown" benefited from the skillfully promoted interest in a cliffhanger plot line from last season involving the main character's possible pregnancy. The show scored a 23.8 rating with a 35 share for an hourlong special episode. (Each rating point equals 921,000 homes.) Very few programs in the last year reached a rating that high. The previous high for "Murphy Brown" had been a 20.
Even the advertising industry noticed the networks' success. "I think what it shows is that the networks have gotten back to blocking and tackling and doing the basics well," said Gene DeWitt of DeWitt Media.
One of those basics is stoking interest in the start of the new season. This summer, as network shares fell to new lows, network executives faced questions about whether the still-dominant rerun glut was going to drive more and more viewers away to cable channels during the regular television season.
The executives responded by saying that viewers would be back as soon as premiere week began.
"I think what you're seeing now is a strong argument for the power of premiere week," said Howard Stringer, president of the CBS Broadcast Group. He added that it was gratifying for the networks to perform so well last week, given the overwhelmingly congested climate of the fall season, with so many channels and programs seeking viewers' attention.
"Sometimes, you think the forest is so big if a tree falls you won't hear it unless it has firecrackers tied to it," he said.
For the third straight year, CBS tied its fall premieres to a promotion in conjunction with the K Mart Corporation. George Schweitzer, CBS's senior vice president of communications who initiated the K Mart campaign, said the network was improving it each year, and that this year's association with the Walt Disney Company (trips to Disney World were the top prizes) had greatly enhanced the promotion.
The K Mart campaign has helped CBS get off to outstanding starts in the last two seasons. But viewership fell off quickly for many of the CBS programs in those years. "The difference this year," Mr. Schweitzer said, "is we simply have better programs to promote."
 
'It's a Cliche but It's True'
 Indeed, what the early results demonstrate is that programs make all the difference, said Alan Wurtzel, the senior vice president of research for ABC. "It's a cliche, but it's true," he added. "When good programs are there, people come to watch."
The problem, Mr. Wurtzel said, is that viewers had 'no tolerance" for a show they did not like.
"We have an obligation to meet their expectations, or we'll lose them very quickly," he continued. "What the last few seasons have proved is that there is no longer an artificial floor."
The intolerance for lesser programs was also demonstrated last week. After the first two nights when all three networks put on series, specials or movies with strong appeal, ABC made two programming moves that executives at CBS and NBC found curiously lackluster for premiere week.
On Wednesday night, ABC inserted what amounted to a used cable movie instead of the strong comedies scheduled for that night. (Mr. Wurtzel said some of those shows had problems delivering episodes on time.) The movie, "Stop at Nothing," had already played on the Lifetime Channel; it was the first cable movie to switch over and play on a network.
But "Stop at Nothing" was watched by only 16 percent of the audience. Though both other networks did well on Wednesday night, ABC's movie helped push the three-network share down to a 66.
Then on Thursday night, ABC carried a repeat of the movie "Jewel of the Nile" against the season premieres of both "Cosby" and "The Simpsons" and again suffered the consequences. The network finished dead last in the four-way network competition on Thursday.
Mr. Wurtzel said it was important to ABC to make sure its shows were started well. "And if that means holding them off for a week or so, that makes sense," he added.
But both CBS and NBC said they believed in going all out in the first week. "The public is in a sampling mood right now," Mr. Poltrack said. "They will make decisions the first week that they will stay with all season. If you don't get them now, it'll take 10 or 12 weeks to get them through word of mouth or whatever."
Despite the strong showing in the first week, the economic picture for the networks is not necessarily brighter, Mr DeWitt said. But he agreed that the networks should be encouraged by the results of the season's first week. "The audience came back, just like it has for the past 30 years," he said.

HEADLINE: Insurance Reform in a Deadlock

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 22

 BODY:
Despite widespread agreement that the auto insurance system is in dire need of reform in many states, most revamping efforts remain stalled or ineffective, forcing drivers to pay ever-higher rates and insurers to grapple with escalating legal, medical and car-repair costs.
The announcement last week by the Allstate Insurance Company that it planned to stop doing business in New Jersey, where it is the largest auto insurer, was the latest example of the confusion and frustration building around the issue in some populous states. 
 Allstate said New Jersey officials were unreasonably denying it rate increases despite years of losses and rising costs. New Jersey regulators and consumer advocates responded that Allstate's operations were simply inefficient and that the company should actually cut its rates.
 
A National Problem
 Here in California, regulators remain mired in a legal battle with the industry over whether the state can force insurers to roll back rates, as required by a ballot proposition passed nearly three years ago. Most drivers in California have long since given up hope of seeing the promised rebates anytime soon, and for many, rates have continued to rise.
Massachusetts, having tried both deregulation and extremely tight regulation -- only to find that neither system pleased consumers or the industry -- is now considering its third regulatory overhaul in 15 years.
While the auto insurance problems are most severe in New Jersey, California, Massachusetts, Texas, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and a handful of other states, they exist to some degree virtually nationwide.
Insurers have argued for years that they are trapped between rising costs over which they have no control -- for medical treatment, auto-body repairs, fraud and litigation expenses -- and a backlash against higher rates from consumers and among politicians who sense an emotional new issue.
Many insurers say that they are losing money in some states -- Allstate contends that it lost $72 million on auto insurance in New Jersey in the last year -- and that the business is only somewhat profitable in other states. Orrin Kramer, an industry consultant in Princeton, N.J., said auto insurers nationwide lost 1 cent for every $1 of premiums taken in from 1986 through 1990.
"Average profitability is substantially lower in rate-suppressing jurisdictions, making a mediocre business worse or totally uneconomical," Mr. Kramer said.
Other analyses, however, suggest that the industry is still profitable over all, and the nation's largest auto insurer, State Farm, which operates in every state, said its business was still reasonably healthy. C. A. (Pete) Ingham, the State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company's general counsel, said the company had no plans to withdraw from any state, though it is battling regulators over rate issues in a number of states, including New Jersey. Indeed, despite some threats, few companies have actually withdrawn from big markets like California and New Jersey because of rate regulation.
Some companies, including the Aetna Life and Casualty Company, are withdrawing from the auto insurance business in many states. But their departures stem mainly from their use of independent agents to sell policies. These sales systems are expensive and increasingly uneconomical in the face of growing competition from insurers with their own sales forces, or from rivals that have dispensed with agents altogether and deal directly with customers over the phone and through the mail.
"We're talking about an industry with low profits, declining profits and a lot of problems," said Sean F. Mooney, an economist with the Insurance Information Institute, an industry-financed research organization. "The costs are going up and the prices aren't going up sufficiently to match the cost increases because of regulatory pressures, especially in states like California and New Jersey."
Consumer groups and growing numbers of politicians say insurance companies must learn to reduce administrative costs and live with less profit.
"There's a serious problem in that rates have gone up fast and many people can no longer afford coverage," said J. Robert Hunter, the head of the National Insurance Consumers Organization, a research and lobbying group. "The inefficient companies are going to feel pressure. The efficient companies will do fine and are doing fine."
 
Outstrip Cost of Living
 There is no question that rates have risen sharply over the last decade, making auto insurance a significant -- and sometimes unaffordable -- expense for drivers in many states. In part, the increases were a result of more accidents as roads have become more crowded, but the number of accidents appears to be leveling off.
Rate increases nationwide have significantly exceeded increases in the overall cost of living for the last nine years, with rates rising 6.8 percent last year compared with a 5.4 percent rise in the cost of living, according to the Insurance Information Institute.
In 1989, the most recent year for which figures are available, the cost of basic coverage in New Jersey, including liability, comprehensive and collision policies, averaged $1,074, the highest in the nation, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The District of Columbia was next at $895, with California third at $875. New York was seventh at $798.
For many drivers, in those states as in others, rates were much higher, especially for those who live in urban areas, those with higher levels of coverage and those with bad driving records. In Los Angeles, for example, rates routinely exceed $2,000.
The least expensive state was Iowa, at $365.
 
The Faults of No-Fault
 For two decades, reform efforts have centered on no-fault insurance proposals. In simple terms, no-fault provides consumers with a trade-off: in return for a lower rate, they give up their right to sue for certain types of damages, especially in minor accidents. Under most no-fault laws, for example, a driver could not sue for pain and suffering damages after an accident that caused no significant physical injury.
Only 40 percent of payments by insurers for bodily injury liability claims cover actual economic losses like medical costs; the rest goes to payments for claims of pain and suffering and the like. Fewer lawsuits mean that fewer settlements and jury awards must be paid by insurers, who in turn could afford to offer lower rates.
More than a dozen states passed no-fault laws during the 1970's, but both industry and consumer groups consider most of them failures, and large states like California never enacted such laws. Typically, the laws state that a driver can sue only after exceeding certain minimum expenses created by an accident. Instead of dissuading drivers from suing after relatively minor accidents, it simply led them to try to run up their medical and other expenses to make it over the minimum and win the right to sue, industry executives and analysts say.
Industry and consumer groups agree that no-fault has worked fairly well in a few states, including New York and Michigan. Those states do not base the right to sue on monetary factors; rather, it is based on the type and severity of the injuries suffered. Regulators in other states, including Massachusetts, are discussing whether to modify their no-fault laws or draft new ones along such lines.
But enacting new or tougher no-fault laws has been almost impossible politically in many states, largely because of the opposition of trial lawyers, who have lobbied hard against any legislation that would limit the right to sue. Trial lawyers' groups have also made large campaign contributions to legislators.
Still, there appears to be new support for no-fault, or some variation of it. John Garamendi, a Democrat who took office in January as California's first elected Insurance Commissioner, ended months of fence-straddling on the issue three weeks ago when he came out in favor of a no-fault plan. Mr. Garamendi proposed that no-fault be part of a package intended to put caps on auto-repair and replacement costs, limit medical expenses and combat fraud.
It is unclear whether Mr. Garamendi's stand will help give new life to no-fault proposals in California, where the lawyers' lobby is particularly powerful. Many analysts, industry executives and consumer groups are instead watching Pennsylvania, which last year enacted legislation that gives consumers the right to decide individually whether they want no-fault, and lower rates, or traditional and more expensive policies with no restrictions on the right to sue.
 
A Need to Hold Down Costs
 On both the national and state levels, insurers and consumer groups are banding together to help control costs by pushing for more stringent safety laws, including lower speed limits and stricter enforcement of seatbelt laws, and by lobbying for other mutually beneficial changes like stronger bumpers.
But most agree that meaningful improvement will come only with broad changes that alter not only the civil-litigation system but procedures for medical-cost reimbursement and auto repairs.
"Ultimately, we'll have to get at the root of it," said Kay Doughty, the Massachusetts Insurance Commissioner, "like hospital bills and car-repair bills that are high."

Weak Outlook for Fall Could Spur Cut in Rates

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The beginning of fall is often accompanied by a quickening economic pace. This year may be different.
To a number of analysts, the economy is entering the final quarter of the year with less momentum than was visible when summer began. 
 This anemic outlook and the prospect of favorable inflation figures are the leading reasons why many analysts say there is at least an even chance that the Federal Reserve will lower short-term interest rates again, possibly some time next month.
"On a risk-reward basis, the Fed won't be penalized very much for doing too much" to insure the recovery, said Leonard J. Santow, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm. But if "the economy turns down again and the Fed does nothing, Congress and the Administration won't be willing to take all of the blame."
 
Concern Over Manufacturing
 Economists are especially concerned about the health of the manufacturing sector, the area that in the July-September period appears to have been lively enough to insure that the economy expanded, albeit modestly, in the third quarter.
But the boost from production seems to be waning. Industrial production has risen for the last five months, but in the June-August period the rate of increase slowed markedly. And despite a rise in disposable incomes, consumer spending remained weak throughout the summer.
"We are coming around to the view that growth in the fourth quarter will be weaker than it was in the third," said Gary Schlossberg, a vice president and senior economist at Wells Fargo & Company in San Francisco.
"I don't see anything that would give us more of a lift," he said. "At the same time, I don't think we are looking at one quarter of growth and then a relapse."
 
Autos Considered Key
 The key to continued growth in manufacturing over the rest of the year, economists say, rests with the auto makers. Unless auto sales stage a sharp rebound from current levels, the outlook is not promising.
"Auto production was the major reason for the lift in the industrial sector in the third quarter," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. "But it may not provide anything in the fourth. I would argue that the industrial sector will grow, but will do so with a good deal less intensity than it did in the third quarter."
Because of the questionable outlook for the economy, investors are already anticipating sharply lower rates. With rates already down on money market accounts and certificates of deposit, increasingly large amounts of money are being redirected out of banks and into higher-yielding fixed-income assets at mutual funds.
"We have had the highest level of sales in the last couple of years, particularly in bond funds," said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. "In talking with brokers, the pace accelerated in September. A genuine panic among retail investors is under way."
 
Await Bigger Spread
 Investors are buying longer maturities to regain some of the yield that banks are no longer offering. But so far the extension has been modest. Money managers said it was difficult to foresee circumstances that would push small investors into highly speculative 30-year bonds.
"Until yield spreads between 10-year notes and 30-year bonds widen out to more than a full percentage point, I don't think you will see much movement into bonds," said Loren A. Hansen, a senior investment counselor at the Northern Trust Company.
By the end of last week, yields on the Treasury's 30-year bonds stood at 7.88 percent. Ten-year notes, meanwhile, were yielding 7.56 percent.
A willingness to lengthen maturities ought to be good news for the Treasury, which is scheduled to hold auctions of two-year and five-year notes this week. And it is a welcome source of additional demand for the tax-exempt municipal bond market.
The decline in short-term rates is "helping all long-term, higher-yielding markets," said George Friedlander, a managing director at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. "But a lot of the money that had been held in short-term accounts at banks that has moved into municipals should have been in tax-exempts to begin with."
 
Success for New Fund
 The strength of retail demand for tax-exempt securities was seen last week, when John Nuveen & Company, the big municipal bond mutual fund company, raised more than $1 billion in an initial public offering of shares in a closed-end fund investing in insured municipal securities.
Nuveen initially intended to sell 10 million shares in the fund. It ended up selling 75 million.
Analysts say the trend toward lower short- and long-term interest rates remains in place, but they add that further progress toward that end seems unlikely over the next week or so.
Indeed, with the exception of a report expected Wednesday on durable-goods orders, there is little on the economic calendar this week with the potential to spark much interest.
Because of the huge 11.2 percent rise reported for July, analysts will pay a good bit of attention to how durable-goods orders fared in August.
After such an enormous gain, most economists are projecting that new orders fell last month, possibly by as much as 5 percent.
A more modest decline, or an increase, would probably get a poor reception in the fixed-income markets.

HEADLINE: Clarke Offering a Defense Of Record as Comptroller

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
With his nomination to another term as one of the nation's top banking regulators in jeopardy, Robert L. Clarke today defended his record of five and a half years as the Comptroller of the Currency and vowed to increase supervision of banks if he is confirmed.
In a letter to the head of the House Banking Committee today and in remarks he released that are to be delivered on Monday before an industry group, Mr. Clarke said his agency would be hiring 300 examiners in the next two years, the equivalent of increasing its field force by about 15 percent, and would also conduct examinations of small banks more frequently. 
 On Thursday, Mr. Clarke is scheduled to appear before the Senate Banking Committee in what is expected to be a confrontational proceeding. Responding to a torrent of personal and professional criticism in recent weeks, Mr. Clarke and his senior aides have been preparing to release new information about his finances and track record before the hearing.
The appointment of Mr. Clarke and several other senior regulators up for nomination may be pivotal to the Presidential election. With the health of the economy promising to be a key issue in the election, just 14 months away, the regulators' role has become magnified by their ability to stimulate industrial growth and consumer spending by controlling lending practices and the cost of credit. They also play a central role in deciding how fast to close insolvent banks and savings associations and in estimating the rescue costs for those troubled industries.
Neither of the other key regulators -- Alan Greenspan for another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and William Taylor to head the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation -- faces significant opposition. Mr. Taylor will appear before the Banking Committee on Tuesday. No date has been set for Mr. Greenspan's confirmation proceeding.
But a number of officials, banks and Republican Party supporters have urged an easing of bank regulation and attributed tight lending practices in many regions to excessive regulation and examiners who responded too strongly to criticism that they were asleep in the years leading up to the banking crisis. At the same time, some lawmakers as well as the General Accounting Office have urged the regulators to continue to apply regulatory standards strictly to prevent the banking crisis from growing.
Mr. Clarke, like Mr. Taylor, is perceived by senior Treasury officials as a team player who will not openly break ranks with the Administration or exert the kind of independence exhibited by L. William Seidman, the departing chairman of the F.D.I.C., who often irritated officials in the White House and at the Treasury by speaking his mind.
Again today, a senior Administration official blamed regulators in part for the state of the economy and tried to maintain that the regulators' independence had made it difficult for the Bush Administration to alter what many economists see as a sluggish recovery.
"The banks have been terrorized and so have the examiners," the official, Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said on the ABC News program "This Week with David Brinkley." "There needs to be a somewhat more refined discrimination. For example, with respect to real estate loans, they've essentially said all real estate is bad. That's ridiculous. Some is good. Some isn't good. And there need to be finer distinctions made so that good loans continue to be made."
Asked how officials can force greater lending if banks see it as too risky, Mr. Darman said: "It's influenced partly by their judgment, and they'll be influenced by their judgment about the economy, but also by the regulators themselves. They are somewhat independent by design, and so there's a limit on what we can do." He added that the recovery was "not coming up as strongly as we would want."
 
Opposition Growing in Congress
 Mr. Clarke's reappointment as supervisor of more than 4,000 banks, holding almost two-thirds of the industry's assets, was announced nine months ago by President Bush but has been delayed largely because of a growing view in Congress that he does not deserve another term.
Over the last few weeks, he has been the subject of an intense stream of criticism from the House Banking Committee, which rated his agency the worst of the major bank regulators; the General Accounting office, which said his office had mishandled the costly failure of the Bank of New England, and some Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee, who have urged him to step down.
Mr. Clarke declined a request for an interview before the Thursday hearing, saying through an aide that he was eager to use the hearing to respond to the growing number of questions.
Today he sought to defend his record in a letter and through the advance text of a speech to be delivered on Monday to the Consumer Bankers Association in Hot Springs, Va.
"I understand and share the anguish caused by the high cost of bank failures," Mr. Clarke said in a letter to Represenative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who heads the House Banking Committee. "But, frankly, I am dismayed when the O.C.C.'s regulatory activities are unfairly criticized."
Employing a strategy that has appeared to be working in recent weeks for Robert Gates, the President's nominee to head the Central Intelligence Agency, Mr. Clarke also took a somewhat contrite view.
"Looking back with the clairvoyance that the passage of time provides, the O.C.C. could have devoted more attention to small banks," he said in the speech. "The criticism that we've received for being too tough has been exceeded only by the criticism that we've been too lax."
Last week, Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, the head of the Senate Banking Committee, asked the Administration to reconsider the appointment of Mr. Clarke and strongly signaled that his confirmation hearing on Thursday would be confrontational. Other Democrats on the committee have also criticized the appointment as well as at least one Republican on the panel, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York.
 
Favorable Ethics Review
 On Friday, Mr. Clarke received somewhat better news from the Office of Government Ethics, which concluded that there was no evidence that his numerous personal investments in junk bonds were made "with disregard for ethics standards" and that there was no evidence that he had improperly used his position and privileged information for making investments.
The ethics investigators also found that Mr. Clarke had inaccurately disclosed a loan to a subordinate in his office but that it was the result of mistaken advice by unidentified ethics officials at the Treasury Department and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
The conclusions of the Office of Government Ethics largely mirrored the findings in June of an investiation by the Treasury Department.

HEADLINE: Poor Nations' Growth Hurt By Gulf War

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
The world's poorest nations experienced financial setbacks last year, compounded by economic shocks from the Persian Gulf crisis, the World Bank said today in its annual report.
The lending agency, whose membership comprises 155 nations, said overall economic growth in the third world edged up 2.3 percent last year, the worst showing since 1982. 
 The situation was even more dire when the weak growth was measured against population increases in the developing nations, the report said.
 
Income Up 0.2%
 Per-capita income in the third world rose two-tenths of a percent in 1990, compared with gains of 2 percent in 1988 and 1 percent in 1989.
The poor economic showing was attributed to many factors, including the spillover effect of the economic slowdown in rich industrial countries and less growth in world trade.
But the report said many of the shocks stemmed from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August of last year, which caused oil prices to rise, disrupted trade flows and sent a flood of refugees streaming from the war zone.
The economic difficulties were widespread throughout the third world. Only in Asia did per-capita income rise in developing countries, the report said.
 
East Asian Growth
 Among the 18 countries in East Asia, per-capita incomes rose an average of 4.3 percent. The World Bank said slower-than-average growth in China was offset by vigorous gains in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.
The eight countries in South Asia, including India, Bangladash and Pakistan, experienced an increase of per-capita income of 2.1 percent in 1990, but the report warned that continued growth was threatened in India.
Developing countries in all other regions experienced declines in per-capita income last year. The biggest setback occurred in Latin America, where per-capita incomes fell by 2.6 percent last year. The report said the situation was most severe for Argentina, Brazil and Peru, as their economies continued to be plagued by high levels of debt.
 
African Nations' Effect
 The nations of sub-Saharan Africa, including some of the poorest countries in the world, saw per-capita incomes fall by 2.1 percent last year, while the developing countries in North Africa, the Middle East and Europe experienced a 1.3 percent drop in per-capita incomes, the first decline for the region since 1987.
The Eastern European countries had negative growth rates stemming primarily from the disruptions as they transform their economies to free-market systems.
The World Bank noted that it had increased its lending to former Soviet bloc countries to try to support their economic reform movements. Poland received the largest amount, $1.44 billion.
Only countries that are members of the World Bank qualify for loans. The Soviet Union has applied for membership but the United States has successfully led the effort to block it.

HEADLINE: NEW LAW TO BRING WIDER JOB RIGHTS FOR MENTALLY ILL

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
A Federal law that takes effect in July will provide far-reaching employment rights to the mentally ill, requiring most businesses to alter hiring practices and workplace conditions.
Psychologists and Government officials say they expect the law and the recently issued regulations explaining it to diminish the stigma of mental illness and reduce discrimination involving millions of Americans. At least 60 million Americans between the ages of 18 and 64 will experience a mental disorder during their lifetimes, Government economists say. 
 The Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, which applies to all businesses with 25 or more employees, bars employers from asking job applicants standard questions like whether they have a history of mental illness. Once hired, employees with these problems will be entitled to extra support and accommodation from their employers so long as they can perform essential job requirements. The rules will be extended in 1994 to cover companies with 15 or more employees.
 
Emerging Implications
 Many large corporations are only beginning to recognize the law's implications. Lawyers involved in mental health issues say companies are unlikely to try to get rid of mentally ill workers before the law takes effect, in part because many of these employees have not come forward and are hard to identify.
"As this law starts to be taken seriously, it will be a tool that protects people from the widespread and deep-seated fear and hostility toward any kind of mental illness," said Leonard S. Rubinstein, a lawyer who is executive director of the Mental Health Law Project, a public interest law firm in Washington.
The new Federal law does not protect workers who cannot perform the fundamental duties of their jobs, but it is nonetheless expected to have sweeping repercussions. Most states have laws protecting the handicapped, but disability-rights lawyers say many of those laws, including California's, exclude people with mental disabilities.
 
Few Current Cases
 Mentally ill employees have brought relatively few complaints under existing state laws. "Cases often aren't brought; people with mental illnesses don't assert their rights because of the stigma," said Ellen M. Saideman, director of disability law with the New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, a nonprofit group. "And a lot of employers have had no idea what their obligations are."
Under the new Federal law, Ms. Saideman said, "we expect more people will be aware and filing complaints."
The law covers a broad range of mental problems, including retardation and learning disabilities. It also protects workers who have overcome alcohol or drug addiction. Employees may still be dismissed for intoxication or for using illegal drugs at work.
Employers usually deal with mental illnesses and substance abuse as related problems, treated by the same counselors and institutions and provided for in the same budget. Drug and alcohol problems affect about 27 million people of working age, the Government estimates.
The cost of mental health care is growing rapidly while companies struggle to control health-care costs in general, and many businesses have limited payments for treating mental illnesses. Richard J. Sinni, a health-management specialist with Buck Consultants in New York, said many employers already spend 10 to 20 percent of their medical-benefits budgets on treatments for mental illness.
 
Medical Rejections Curbed
 Under the new Federal law, businesses cannot reject job applicants because they might add to a company's medical costs. But legal experts say the law does not prevent employers from limiting benefits for the treatment of mental illness, as many companies are now doing. Some seriously ill employees, for example, are forced into disability status and dropped after receiving disability payments for two years.
Federal officials estimate that at least 15 million adults will experience one or more of three types of severe mental illness -- schizophrenia, manic-depressive disorders or major depression -- in their lifetimes. And an estimated one of four Americans will have one of a wider range of mental problems, including anxiety disorders like claustrophobia, personality problems and mental retardation.
These would all be covered by the law. Conditions not covered include kleptomania, pyromania, compulsive gambling and certain types of sexual behavior, like transvestism.
"In the past, in the manufacturing and producing segment of the company, there has been more of a standard that a person is either 100 percent qualified for a job or not," said Kenneth R. Collins, manager of employee assistance programs at the Chevron Corporation. "That will have to be very carefully reconsidered." He said Chevron had been more flexible in making accommodations for office workers with mental disorders.
Special provisions for the mentally handicapped might be as minor and inexpensive as providing more frequent breaks or quieter work areas. "The law will not require a large amount of money for physical changes," said William A. Anthony, executive director of the Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation at Boston University.
But for those who require hospital treatment, the cost can be $10,000 or more.
The law covers physical as well as mental problems, and regulations issued in July by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission are much more specific on the physical side. Most experts agree that workplace conditions for the physically handicapped have improved greatly over the last two decades, but they say enforcement has been spotty.
The National Federation of Independent Business, a lobbying group for small businesses, said about 10 members were calling each week seeking advice on their obligations under the new law. One business owner is trying to determine his rights in dealing with a mentally ill employee who refuses to take prescribed medication. Federal officials and business lawyers predict that the answers to such questions will be determined in thousands of lawsuits.
 
Possibility of Savings
 Mental illness is a drag on the economy and, in the long run, the law might actually save businesses money by reducing absenteeism and turnover and improving the productivity of the mentally ill, some psychologists say.
The National Institute of Mental Health said last year that mental illness had cost the nation $129.3 billion in 1988, of which $57 billion was in lost productivity.
The new law catches many companies unprepared, though none would publicly admit as much. "Many employers haven't thought about the implications of the act for accommodating mental disabilities," said Veronica Vaccaro, manager of mental health promotion with the Washington Business Group on Health, an employers' organization.
Some large employers like Wells Fargo, Prudential Insurance and Chevron already have committees of executives studying how to meet the new obligations. Other companies are considering how they may have to change their practices.
Federal law already protects the mentally ill at companies with Government contracts. So large contractors like the International Business Machines Corporation might not have to adjust their policies, although the new law could make employees more aware of their rights.
At many contractors, the mentally ill have advanced. Tony Cerqueira, the president of the Manic-Depression Depressive Association of Los Angeles, a support group, has worked for the Prudential Insurance Company for six years. Mr. Cerqueira, who is 34 years old, said he disclosed his illness, which he controls with medication, when he was hired to write group contracts. Two years ago, he was promoted to what he calls a high-profile auditor's position by a manager fully aware of his condition. "She is very supportive," he said.
Prudential, a Federal contractor, has a policy of encouraging the hiring of people with mental and physical disabilities. And a number of companies already have programs to recruit and train retarded employees; the McDonald's Corporation has hired thousands over the years.
 
Hiding the Disorder
 But most people with mental disorders say they still hide their problems. Patricia M., who asked that her name not be used, works on computer graphics for a large company in Manhattan. Although she has been there for 11 years, she said, "I have not told my bosses that I take medication for unipolar depression." The illness "hasn't really kept me from work," she added, "though sometimes it has been a monumental effort" to keep going.
Bryan Lawton, a clinical psychologist who is a vice president and director of employee assistance services with the Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco, runs a program for people with mental disorders. "There are a number of unknowns" in the new law, he said, adding, "It's not going to be nearly as great of a burden as some people may fear." 
And Patricia M. Owens, a former Social Security Administration official who is a vice president with Thomas L. Jacobs & Associates, a disability consulting firm, commented, "Many of these people want to work and are going to try to minimize the impact of their disability."
Health-benefits experts say it is hard to figure the possible costs of complying with the new law. Dr. Mary Jane England, a psychiatrist who is president of the Washington Business Group on Health, said companies were already paying for many mental health problems -- through lost productivity and disability payments for physical ailments, like aching backs, that often have psychological causes.
But the law may help improve the productivity of the mentally ill by relieving the strain of prejudice.
"There is a lot of fear around mental illness," said Karen Danley, a program director with the Boston University rehabilitation center. "People feel vulnerable. They have all had some experience of being out of control or emotionally undone. When they see someone else who is labeled as mentally ill, it's scary."

The Economy
A new law will provide far-reaching employment rights to the mentally ill, requiring most businesses to alter hiring practices and workplace conditions when it takes effect in July. Psychologists and Government officials say they expect the Federal law and regulations explaining it to diminish the stigma of mental illness and reduce discrimination involving millions of Americans. But companies are only beginning to recognize the implications. [Page A1.] 
 Efforts to overhaul auto insurance systems remain stalled or ineffective, forcing drivers to pay higher rates and insurers to grapple with escalating legal, medical and car-repair costs. [D1.]
Robert L. Clarke defended his record as Comptroller of the Currency and vowed to increase supervision of banks if he is confirmed. With his nomination to another term appearing in jeopardy, Clarke said his agency would hire 300 new examiners. [D1.]
Federal agencies are collaring industries and interest groups and getting them together to decide what new regulations will say. At stake are rules that govern everything from who may sit in the exit rows on airliners to how much a power plant can pollute. [A1.]
Black professionals are becoming more concerned that they are being disproportionately hurt by widening layoffs and that their opportunities for advancement are being crippled. [D1.] Blacks have been steadily returning to the South, reversing an exodus of nearly 50 years. [A1.]
 
Companies
As Wal-Mart and Target pursue aggressive expansion, their paths are crossing with increasing frequency. And with a revitalized K Mart in the fray, the battle for discount shoppers' hearts and pocketbooks promises to be among retailing's fiercest fights. [D1.]
Regulators have forced Alyeska Pipeline Service to spend at least $15 million repairing air-pollution control equipment because of a determined tipster. As the repair work progressed, Alyeska became deeply involved in an extensive undercover operation to root out people inside the company who secretly provided tips. [A14.]
 
The Media Business
The television networks attracted sharply higher audiences last week for the fall premieres of their prime-time programs. Executives called this encouraging evidence that viewers still look to the networks for new entertainment. [D1.]
Time magazine is trying to redefine itself as it conducts, with secrecy, a big redesign. Deirdre Carmody: Magazines. [D14.]
Disabled people are finding more "real life parts" in ads and on television as these roles gain acceptance from companies like Chrysler and McDonald's. [D14.]

HEADLINE: Three Killed in New Haven During a Sickout by Police

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
The City of New Haven experienced one of the most violent weekends in recent memory, the police said yesterday, with 3 people killed and at least 7 wounded by gunfire beginning Friday night. The killings occurred on a weekend in which many police officers called in sick to protest disciplinary action by the department.
The president of the police officers' union, Sgt. Louis Cavalier, said that as many as 60 officers called in sick beginning Friday night and that the department was operating at almost half strength on some shifts. Friday evening, for example, when 40 officers normally are on duty, only about 25 officers reported to work, he said. 
 Sergeant Cavalier said the union did not condone any move by an officer to call in sick unless he or she were ill, and he denied that there was any connection between the reduced patrols and any of the killings.
 
At Least 26 Killed This Year
 The shootings, including two deaths that resulted from a noisy gang fight outside a restaurant, brought the toll of slayings this year in New Haven to at least 26, compared with 16 in the comparable period of 1990. Some residents were asking yesterday if some of the violence over the weekend might have been prevented if more officers had been on duty.
"I'm sure if a police officer had been there they would have just gone out, or called for a backup or something and stopped it," said Chris Papanikolaou, co-owner of the Athenian Diner on Whalley Avenue, where the gang fight broke out early Saturday. Two people were shot to death and one person was wounded, the police said.
Mr. Papanikolaou said he routinely paid the city to have a uniformed officer assigned to the restaurant from midnight to 5 A.M. Friday through Sunday. But on Friday, as talk of the possible sickout protest swept the department, he said, he was told that no officers would be available.
 
'The Blue Flu'
 "Because of the blue flu they didn't have any extra officers," Mr. Papanikolaou said in a telephone interview.
Sergeant Cavalier of the union said that officers were angered by a decision on Tuesday by the city's Police Chief, Nicholas Pastore, to recommend disciplinary proceedings against two officers involved in the killing of a drug suspect in June. The officers had been cleared of any criminal wrongdoing.
The New Haven Register reported that the police officers' union voted on Thursday to ask the chief to resign.
"The morale at the New Haven Police Department is basically at an all-time low," the sergeant said. "The officers feel that they have a chief who is not concerned about their safety."
 
Coping With Sickout
 The Associated Press quoted Chief Pastore as saying on Friday that officers were being reassigned to cope with the sickout and that adequate police protection would be provided.
Sergeant Cavalier of the union said the officer who was to have worked at the diner on overtime had been instructed instead to work in a patrol car.
The two men killed in the melee in the parking lot at the diner were Hury Poole, 23 years old, and Andrew Pasley, 22, both of New Haven. In the other fatal shooting, a man was killed Saturday night as he apparently tried to rob a Sunoco gas station on Goffe Street. Two of the station's employees were wounded, one of them critically.
Sgt. Walter Kuntz, a Police Department spokesman, said that the slayings were still being investigated and that details were sketchy. He refused to comment on how any officers may have been reassigned on Friday night, saying that questions about staffing over the weekend would have to be answered by Chief Pastore.
Calls to Chief Pastore's office were not answered and the number at his New Haven home is unlisted.
 
Shoplifting Complaints
 Anecdotal accounts indicated that the police presence was lower in at least some areas of the city.
Jason Joyner, a security guard at the Chapel Square Mall, said that 10 to 20 officers usually patrolled the mall through part of the weekend, but that he could not recall seeing any in the last two days. He said that mall security officials had called the New Haven police three times over the weekend to report shoplifting incidents, but that no officer came to the shopping center.
"We had to let the suspects go," Mr. Joyner said. "There's nothing we can do about it."
Sergeant Cavalier said that the decision by Chief Pastore to discipline the two officers involved in the June shooting had inflamed anger that was already smoldering over stalled contract talks. The union members, who have been working without a contract since June 30, are trying to bargain with a city whose finances have been hit hard by the recession.
The two officers involved in the disciplinary inquiry, Giro Esposito and Thomas Herbert, killed a drug suspect after the man apparently tried to run one of the officers down with his car. The were both cleared of any criminal action by the Connecticut state Attorney's office, but the departmental inquiry ordered by Chief Pastore could theoretically result in their dismissal from the force.

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
Democrats Review Presidential Bids, Vowing to Avoid the Losers' Mistakes

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 22

 BODY:
The ghost of elections past always stalks the hallways of Democratic National Committee meetings, and it was there this weekend -- lurking in the speeches, the slide presentations, and the black humor in the bars and lobbies of the grand old Biltmore Hotel, where the committee gathered for its fall meeting.
Implicit or explicit, the message from many of the candidates here was simple: I will not make the mistakes that the failed nominees have made. This helps explain why so many of them seem so eager to pummel President Bush, after watching Michael S. Dukakis, their most recent nominee, take so many body blows, so passively, in 1988. 
 It explains the scramble of most of the hopefuls to redefine their party's image -- from the pro-business liberal dogma of former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts to the emphasis on personal responsibility by Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. It also helps explain why even though Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska did not attend this meeting, he was the focus of much interest. Many in the party yearn for the charismatic candidacies of their glory years, and his allies say Mr. Kerrey, who will announce his candidacy on Sept. 30, has the ability to provide one.
In a slide show for the Democrats on Friday afternoon, focusing in large part on voting patterns and campaign mechanics from 1988, researchers from the national committee showed how that election might have been different.
On Saturday, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, another contender, drew some of the loudest applause of the meeting when he declared, "If I'm your nominee, you will not see hordes of young Iowans coming into your state to tell you how to run your state." Among the 413 members of the Democratic National Committee, that is a memory that dies particularly hard: The bright-eyed, overconfident young Northeasterners from the Dukakis campaign who, in the end, did not deliver.
But the new class of candidates says it will be different this time.
 
Presidential Cattle Show
 Seven Presidential hopefuls spoke to the committee this weekend, in a cattle show that became all the more important because the race is starting so late and the field is so little known, even to many of the more active Democrats gathered here. "I think they all did well," said Phil Angelides, the California Democratic chairman. "But there's such a low level of knowledge that people aren't so much jumping as watching."
Still, some Democrats, like committee member Jim Ruvolo of Ohio, said they thought Mr. Harkin and Mr. Clinton were particularly well received.
Mr. Harkin delivered his trademark mix of traditional Democratic liberalism and rough-edged populism. It was greeted with the hearty applause that usually generates from the party faithful, which is why some analysts say Mr. Harkin is a formidable force in the primaries, despite all the criticism that he is just another Democrat too liberal for the voters at large.
Mr. Clinton, as is his custom, called for a new emphasis on values, personal responsibility, and a government that brings a fresh approach to poverty, education and economic decline. But Mr. Clinton's stump speech has slowly but unmistakably changed since he first took it around the country as chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council. Back then, he was heading a group devoted to pushing the party to what it considers the political center, a group that often feuded with Mr. Harkin's wing of the party.
Mr. Clinton left that post in late summer as he moved toward a presidential campaign. Since then, as he takes his message to the active, more liberal Democrats who participate in primaries and caucuses, he has acquired more and more of a populist tone, railing about the abuses on Wall Street and elsewhere at the top of the economic ladder.
Is a trace of Harkinism creeping into Mr. Clinton's message? Stan Greenberg, one of his advisers, asserts that it is a middle-class populism, "whereas Harkin is much more of a labor-capital kind of populism, and therefore much more of a class message than Bill Clinton's."
This tinkering with message, one of the hallmarks of a party that has lost five out of the last six presidential campaigns, is perhaps the surest sign that the 1992 election is underway.
 
Will Jesse Run?
 The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has not yet closed the door on a third race for the nomination, was also paying attention to the messages offered by his fellow Democrats this weekend. Clearly, he told the committee, the other contenders are environmentalists. "I heard a lot of my speeches recycled," Mr. Jackson said.
But, as he later told reporters, he is often imitated, never duplicated. And indeed, while his fellow candidates reached for their own oratorical heights, Mr. Jackson once again proved his ability to hold and move an audience, even one that includes some Democrats who would prefer he did not run. He provided few hints about whether he will run again, although many continue to believe he will not. He focused his speech on the need for vision and purpose and moral commitment in the Democratic Party.
Mr. Jackson used the recent, devastating fire at a poultry processing plant in Hamlet, N.C., as the heart of his speech, returning, again and again, to the plight of many working women. "We must rescue these women," he told an audience that was utterly hushed. "They must not be abandoned."
And he closed with what is one of his favorite Biblical texts, applied, this time, to 1992: "I know it's dark," he said. "I see the polls. But if we hold on together, as surely as it is dark, the morning cometh." The candidates, potential and declared, are trying once again to dispel the ghosts.

HEADLINE: Kenya Tightening Curbs on Dissident Groups

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Sept. 22

 BODY:
Increasingly isolated in Africa as it resists calls for multiparty democracy, Kenya's Government seems to be on a collision course with opposition forces.
A senior minister in the Government of President Daniel arap Moi said on Saturday that a scheduled meeting here in the capital by a newly formed opposition group, the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy, would be "crushed" if it went ahead as scheduled on Oct. 5. The minister, Nicholas Biwott, a close ally of Mr. Moi, has barred opposition leaders from the Rift Valley province where he holds a parliamentary seat. 
 At the same time, Kenyan lawyers who have been at the heart of the push for more democracy urged the Government at a meeting this weekend to hold a referendum that would decide whether Kenya would remain a one-party state. The East African nation officially became a one-party state in 1982.
At the two-day meeting of the Kenya branch of the International Commission of Jurists, the lawyers also urged the repeal of sedition laws that make much political activity a crime. The chairman of the Kenya Law Society, Paul Muite, is currently on trial in Nairobi with 10 other members of the society on contempt-of-court charges for criticizing a series of rulings by the Chief Justice of Kenya and another judge of the High Court. Mr. Muite, who is not in custody, faces jail if the Government wins the case.
The standoff this weekend between the Government and its critics comes as the United States Congress is about to consider whether to cut off all economic and military aid to Kenya. The Senate version of the foreign aid bill calls for an end of aid to Kenya on the ground that not enough progress has been made toward political pluralism. The third largest donor to Kenya after Japan and Britain, the United States gave about $30 million in economic aid and $5 million in military aid to Kenya this year.
Senators seeking the cut-off are particularly incensed that the Moi Government has refused to register a new political party formed by a well-known politician, Oginga Odinga, and has punished those who have urged its legalization. Mr. Odinga's son, Raila Odinga, recently released from jail, where he was held for a year without charges, was fired on by gunmen 10 days ago while he was driving his car.
After Mr. Muite called on the government to register the Odinga party, four lawyers acting on behalf of the Government got an injunction against Mr. Muite that barred him from making statements construed to be political. The contempt charges were called the "capstone of a repressive campaign" against Kenyan lawyers by the New York City Bar Association, which has been monitoring human rights abuses in East Africa.
During his 13 years in office, Mr. Moi has gradually consolidated his political and financial powers. Many members of his tribe, the Kalengin, have attained prominent positions even though the tribe is one of the smallest in Kenya.
 
Democracy Centuries Away?
 In arguing that one-party rule is best for Kenya, Mr. Moi insists that multiple parties would result in a rise of "tribalism," with parties formed along tribal lines. Many educated, younger Kenyans say they find this fear exaggerated. In a new twist, which many Kenyans said they found insulting, Mr. Moi said last month that Kenya was "at least 200 years behind" the West in economic development and therefore should not expect Western-style democracy for another two centuries.
Mr. Moi came under new pressure this month when the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, changed the tone of British diplomacy toward its favored former colony. He said explicitly that "I would like to see multiparty democracy eventually restored to Kenya." During his visit here, Mr. Hurd urged greater freedom of expression and met with two opposition leaders, Martin Shikuku and Masinde Muliro.
Mr. Hurd said: "I would not complain at all if the opposition here, critics of the government here, use my visit to air their criticism." In the past, the British, who have substantial investments here, have given only fulsome praise to Mr. Moi.

HEADLINE: U.S. Aid to Israel: $77 Billion Since '67

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
The controversy over Israel's request for $10 billion in United States loan guarantees has focused wide attention on a large-scale but little-understood American aid effort that since 1967 has totaled at least $77 billion -- $16,500 for each Israeli citizen -- when adjusted for inflation.
American aid to Israel may actually be larger than that, since it consists not only of the well-known grants and loans that prop up the Israeli economy and bolster its military, but also seldom-noticed indirect assistance. This includes such items as huge transfers of surplus military equipment, subsidies for Israel's foreign aid program and assistance to refugees arriving from the Soviet Union, State Department and Congressional officials say. 
 Moreover, Israel alone among recipients of American aid receives its money at the beginning of each fiscal year, instead of in payments over the course of the year, allowing it to invest in United States Treasury securities and collect interest on the money until it is actually spent.
Nearly three-quarters of Israel's aid consists of grants, according to figures from the Bank of Israel. Israel reduced its annual interest on the remaining $13 billion in loans by $150 million several years ago by refinancing at a lower interest rate, a privilege also made available then to 37 other American allies with weak economies.
 
No Need for U.S. to Pay
 Israel is seeking the $10 billion in loan guarantees now to help resettle up to a million Jewish emigres expected by 1995. With the loan guarantees, banks would lend to Israel at reduced interest rates with the assurance that the United States would be responsible for any principal or interest payments that Israel could not make. Israel's credit rating is fairly good, and its officials say there would be no need for the United States to pay any money.
Israeli officials contend that without the guarantees their country would be unable to provide the housing and jobs needed to use fully the many skills of immigrants from the Soviet Union. The Israeli economy and imports from the United States would suffer, they contend.
But President Bush has insisted that granting the aid now would needlessly upset the Middle East peace process, and he has asked Congress to put off debate on the matter for four months.
The current political uproar has strengthened Congress's interest in examining the financial burden of the American relationship with Israel, which has not been well understood because Israel has tapped many sources outside the main foreign aid programs.
 
List From State Department
 Representative Lee H. Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat who heads the House Subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East, said he had recently received a list of readily measured aid from the State Department totaling $4 billion for the fiscal year ending this month. The list separately included several programs with costs that are hard to estimate, partly because not all of the money in them had been spent, he said.
"So far as I know it's a comprehensive list, but things keep popping out," Mr. Hamilton said.
An Administration official who insisted on anonymity said "it's really an aid industry," in which no one keeps a full tally of the aid provided.
Mr. Hamilton, Congressional aides and Israeli officials stressed that the United States received much in return for its assistance. Israel has been the nation's main military partner for decades in a region both vital to United States interests and highly unstable.
The $300 million for the stockpiling of American military equipment in Israel, for example, could not be labeled solely as aid to that country, since it is very advantageous to the United States to be able to store its gear there, Mr. Hamilton said.
Economic and military aid programs to Israel, without adjustment for inflation, totaled $47.8 billion from 1967 through last year, according to the figures from the Bank of Israel. But Israeli officials themselves pointed out that it would be more accurate to adjust for inflation. Using the consumer price index in the United States, the aid to Israel would be to $77 billion in 1991 dollars.
 
Some Hard to Estimate
 The programs that are hard to estimate include up to $700 million in surplus military equipment, most of it from American forces being withdrawn from Europe, that is to be turned over to Israel; $400 million in loan guarantees; $150 million in annual interest savings from the refinancing of United States military loans five years ago; $300 million for eventual stockpiles of American equipment in Israel; $60 million in price reductions for military equipment sales and $42 million for a joint air defense development program.
Israel's request for $10 billion in loan guarantees would not involve any immediate outlay for the United States. But under a new law that takes effect on Oct. 1, Congress would have to set aside some money to reflect the risk of potential defaults.
Congress's current budget rules also impose a cap on international spending, including foreign aid. Depending on how different types of aid are categorized, this means that Congress could be confronted with a difficult choice this year on how to divide up limited money among Israel, the Soviet Union and other candidates for American assistance.
The proposed $10 billion in loan guarantees for the resettlement of Soviet Jews in Israel would be much more generous than Mr. Bush's $1.5 billion agricultural loan guarantee program to feed the Soviet Union. The food loan program only guarantees 98 percent of the principal and the first 4.5 percentage points of interest.
 
Banks Are Reluctant
 Commercial banks have been reluctant to take part in this program for fear of losing the unguaranteed part of any loans.
By contrast, Israeli officials want their guarantees to cover all of the loans' principal and all of the interest. Because existing American loan guarantee programs do not have such generous terms, a new program would probably have to be created for Israel, Congressional aides said.
American loan guarantees could save Israel as much as $200 million a year in interest payments, said John F. H. Purcell, the director of the sovereign research group at Salomon Brothers Inc. This is because Israel has a BBB credit rating, forcing it to borrow at an interest rate that is 2 percentage points higher than the rate for United States Government-guaranteed debt, he said.
Such a calculation assumes that Israel would be able to borrow the money at all without the guarantees and without lowering its credit rating, which would result in higher interest rates. "Anybody but the very large countries would have trouble borrowing $10 billion," Mr. Purcell agreed.
Israeli officials estimate that with the guarantees they could borrow as much as $2 billion a year for five years, while without them they would be limited to $500 million a year.

HEADLINE: Gunmen Kill Grocery Owner in Bronx

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
For 14 years Luisa Caban ran her grocery on Gildersleeve Avenue in the Bronx like a small-town general store, chatting with neighbors, dispensing friendly advice to anxious young mothers, and quietly extending credit to those facing lean times.
But this weekend the slow and easy rhythms that usually prevail in the Clasons Point section, a secluded community of tidy one-family homes nestled onto a peninsula jutting into the East River, were jolted when robbers shot and killed Mrs. Caban during a failed robbery attempt. 
 Two or three youths brandishing automatic weapons entered the store, Roberta's Grocery, shortly after 7:30 P.M. on Saturday, said Detective Frank Corsillo of the 43d Precinct Detective Squad. They demanded that Mrs. Caban open the cash register, and when she did not react fast enough, she was shot twice, in the chest and the left arm.
Her assailants pistol-whipped an employee, but fled empty-handed when he failed to open the cash register, Detective Corsillo said. The suspects, possibly as many three Hispanic males in their late teens or early 20', are still at large, he said.
 
Coping With Grief
 A leafy green wreath hung on the store's rolled-down shutters yesterday, while friends, neighbors and relatives made their way around the corner, to the apartment where Mrs. Caban lived with her mother, three daughters and a grandson. They grappled with the unfamiliar rituals of grief, in a community that many said had been free until recently of the wanton violence that has marred life in other neighborhoods.
In a neighborhood where people still look out for one another, Mrs. Caban looked out for everybody.
"She was one hell of a fighter," said Zoraida Marquez, a friend of Mrs. Caban who has lived in the neighborhood for 22 years. "She would never close her door to anyone in need. I don't know why this would happen."
Mrs. Caban, 43 years old, came to the United States from Ecuador 17 years ago and was an American citizen. She and her husband Roberto, from whom she separated recently, bought the store 14 years ago, naming it after their youngest daughter Roberta, who is now 16.
"She was so proud of her kids," Ms. Marquez recalled. "She wanted them to go to school so they could make something of themselves. Roberta had everything a kid could want -- Barbizon, karate lessons, tap dancing."
She was also a soft touch for those who were short on cash or luck.
"I had my situations when I've been economically down and she always extended credit to me and offered herself to me in many ways," Ms. Marquez said. "We would talk and discuss our teen-age kids' problems, like one mother to another."
Outside the cramped hallway to the family's apartment, children astride bicycles stood quietly watching as neighbors went to express their condolences to the family. Clementina Lopez, Mrs. Caban's mother, tearfully hugged neighbors.
 
'Don't Wait for Death'
 Mrs. Lopez and her great-grandson Jaime were in the store during the robbery. She had often told her daughter that a bodega was no business for a single mother to be involved with.
"Don't wait for death there," she recalled telling her. "But she would say 'What can I do? If something is going to happen it will happen wherever I work.' "
Orville Barnes lived upstairs from Mrs. Caban -- she helped him get the apartment, he said. He was was walking back to his apartment after visiting his son Saturday evening when he saw a police car outside the store. Rushing inside, he saw Mrs. Caban slumped on the floor behind the register, bleeding and twitching.
"Whenever you needed something, she was there for the calling," he said. "She was a nice person, never hurt anybody."
Lillian Santiago recalled how Mrs. Caban concocted a home remedy that cured her daughter's cold last year. "She mixed honey, onions and lemon in a jar," she said. "It worked, my daughter spit everything up."
To many in the neighborhood, Mrs. Caban's death marks the undeniable realization that the violence that has shaken many other communities has forced itself upon their out-of-the-way haven of narrow tree-lined side streets where until recently the only disturbance was the regular roar of low-flying jets making their landing approach at La Guardia Airport.
"You see more people, more kids running around in the traffic," said Norma Duran. "It's just not the same as before."
Nelson Malave grew up in a house a few doors from the store, and although his family moved from the neighborhood, he returned often to talk with friends outside and help Mrs. Caban unload groceries and other odd jobs.
"I know who the strangers are around here," he said. "I just throw them off the block."
A migraine kept him home Saturday night.
"I should have been here," he said. "I either would have been killed or wounded, but I know I definitely would have gotten one of them."

One Man's Rx For an Economy That's Still Ailing

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In 1984, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo galvanized Democrats by challenging President Reagan's vision that economic recovery had transformed America into a "shining city on the hill."
Now, less than a year before another Democratic national convention, New Yorkers are anxiously awaiting another overdue recovery. The Governor, meanwhile, is grappling with the consequences of Washington's inattention and local inertia, which have transformed New York into a pining city in a slump. 
 Even before he delivers it, Mr. Cuomo's two-pronged prescription for recovery is being billed as an equally visionary if more pragmatic version of his defining 1984 speech. To distinguish the soaring oratory for which the Governor is best known from the unusually specific programs he is about to advance, Mr. Cuomo's private preview at the Equitable Center tonight for opinion-makers and his public appearance tomorrow before the Association for a Better New York are being promoted not as a speech at all but as a "presentation."
What will he present? A potentially fundamental change in how New York pays for Medicaid. And an infusion of state public works projects to jump-start the local economy by generating jobs and spurring investment.
Albany would assume responsibility for administering Medicaid. In return, the city would agree to curb certain costs. It would also cede to the state a portion of the city income tax, which has been growing more slowly than the local share of Medicaid. Over seven years or so, the state would complete the assumption of local Medicaid costs that the Governor had begun modestly years ago.
Coupled with phased budget relief, Mr. Cuomo will unveil an ambitious economic revitalization agenda with options that include building mass transit "people movers," possibly on the Van Wyck Expressway and Grand Central Parkway medians, to carry travelers to and from Kennedy and La Guardia Airports and to be paid for through a new tax on airline passengers; advancing two large residential and commercial deveopments, Riverside South in Manhattan and Hunter's Point in Queens; further renovating Grand Central Terminal and Pennyslvania Station and spurring a proposed rail freight operation.
Why now? For fully a year, since the Governor invited business and labor leaders to a gripe session, he has been grappling to balance demands that he intervene to save the city from itself and equally emotional appeals that he do nothing that might be perceived as undermining Mayor David N. Dinkins.
In June, the Governor struggled to devise a vehicle that would temporarily allow the city to stretch out its debt while it restructured services, but without the stigma of ceding control to the Financial Control Board, whose oversight role would be triggered by a deficit.
His good intentions exceeded the grasp of his imagination, though.
In July, he lured the city into a joint project to overhaul government -- only to be rebuffed by the Dinkins administration once it became clear that the government he hoped to overhaul was the city's, and without the Medicaid relief that might let defenders of the status quo off the hook. Since then, the Dinkins administration's negotiations with its unions in search of concessions have not progressed much. The Mayor's Management Advisory Task Force won Mr. Dinkins's approval last week to gauge support for its bold proposal to impose tolls on the three East River bridges, but that suggestion has generated skepticism, Mr. Cuomo's included.
Under Mr. Cuomo, the state has spent about $50 billion on building or re-building the subways, roads and the State University, although he may be remembered more for expanding the prison system and for his ringing but abstract oratory than for concrete solutions.
The Governor believes that as the Mayor drafts a revised four-year financial plan, even a still elusive budgetary solution alone won't be enough to revive the city when private investment and confidence has evaporated.
Immigration is helping to replenish New York's depleted middle class. The Columbus quincentenary next year may raise morale. So might the Democratic national convention, which, as it was in 1976, will be held in New York next year. But spirit alone, even the heights to which Mr. Cuomo's words can raise it, will not substitute for some heavy lifting.
Nearly 60 years ago, on the eve of another national convention, Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt appealed for an overhaul of unaffordable government and for an infusion of public works.
That Mr. Cuomo is now pursuing a similar course does not necessarily imply that the two share the same political ambitions. What it does mean, though, is that an accomplished builder of coalitions and public spirit is again raising expectations that he can deliver on his promise as well as he can deliver a speech.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Medicaid Plan Stirs Cautious Reaction

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Sept. 22

 BODY:
New York City officials and the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation reacted cautiously today to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's proposal for a state Medicaid takeover, warning that the financial help might not come soon enough for the city and that the Legislature could prove a serious obstacle.
But state officials responded that the Medicaid plan was only feasible as a long-term strategy. And they expressed frustration, as they have in the past, that the city was continuing to look to the state for a bailout when the state has severe fiscal problems of its own.
 
Taxing Authority
 As part of a plan for state aid to the city, Mr. Cuomo has suggested that the state assume the share of Medicaid costs currently paid by New York City and other local governments. In exchange, local governments would cede existing taxing authority to the state. 
 Cuomo administration officials believe the plan could save nearly $2 billion for local governments by the turn of the century, including about $1 billion for New York City. Mr. Cuomo is scheduled to outline the Medicaid proposal and a variety of economic development proposals in a pair of speeches in New York City on Monday night and Tuesday morning.
Senior city officials said today that they were pleased that Mr. Cuomo was pressing ahead with plans for a Medicaid takeover, a possibility he had relegated to the "removed future" only three months ago. But they expressed concern about Mr. Cuomo's timetable for concluding the takeover by the year 2000, particularly since the whole idea of a takeover, from the city's view, was to relieve budgetary pressures in the next four years.
"At this point, the state seems to be back-loading, rather than front-ending," said Mayor David N. Dinkins's press secretary, Leland T. Jones. "If it's in the year 2000, gee, we might all be old and gray by then."
Mr. Dinkins, who has presided over severe budget cuts, is expected to face a difficult re-election campaign in 1993.
 
Concern Shared by Rohatyn
 Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, shared Mr. Jones's concern. "Certainly in the early years, it isn't going to be a big boon to the city's expense budget," Mr. Rohatyn said.
Mr. Rohatyn's views are significant because he will determine whether the city will reap a four-year windfall of $1 billion from a proposed refinancing of M.A.C. bonds. But Mr. Rohatyn has said repeatedly that such help is conditional on a long-term plan by the city and the state to cut costs and restructure government.
But Andrew J. Zambelli, the Governor's chief of staff, said political and fiscal realities dictated that a Medicaid takeover be stretched over the course of the decade.
"If you were going to do a takeover that was totally front-loaded, you would guarantee that it would never occur," he said. "The Legislature doesn't have $1 billion to give out to local governments next year. You would doom it to failure."
That, Mr. Zambelli said, is why Mr. Cuomo will propose a comprehensive plan of aid for the city that "will save the city hundreds of millions of dollars" in the next four years. Mr. Zambelli said the Medicaid takeover, which would be carried out in phases, could save the city up to $300 million in the third year of the plan.
"It's designed to assist the city in the last three years of its four-year plan, not to bail them out of the other actions they need to take," he said.
Mr. Zambelli and his counterpart at City Hall, First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel, made clear that the political battle to come would concern the structure and timetable for a Medicaid takeover, with the city pressing for relief in a hurry and the state resisting that pressure.
"There are a number of different scenarios that are being talked about and until we have a chance to put together a single package, I don't want to prejudge it," Mr. Steisel said. "Our concern is to put together a program that puts that city on the road to structural balance but also recognizes the state's fiscal circumstances."
One Dinkins administration official, however, was less delicate. "If the Governor wants to be perceived as helping, the help can't be hollow," said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The second political fight will be in Albany, where Mr. Cuomo and local government leaders must convince a skeptical Legislature that they can trim the cost of the state's $12 billion Medicaid program.
Only then would the Republicans who control the State Senate be willing to approve a state takeover of the Medicaid program, which provides health coverage for the poor. Currently, the Federal government pays for about half of all Medicaid costs, with the state and local governments splitting the rest.
 
'A Bit Skeptical'
 "We have to somehow save $1 billion in real money," said Senator John B. Daly of Lewiston, one of three Republican Senators on a state Medicaid task force. "Until then we have to be a bit skeptical."
In recent years, the Legislature has balked at serious efforts to contain Medicaid costs, which have been growing at about 15 percent a year statewide. But Patrick G. Halpin, the Suffolk County Executive, said the strain that Medicaid was placing on local budgets, and thus on real property taxes, could no longer be ignored.
"It is literally bankrupting counties and the city of New York and forcing us to make very difficult choices," said Mr. Halpin, who has watched his county's share of Medicaid costs rise to $109 million this year from $80 million two years ago. "I'll gladly give up a portion of our sales tax revenue knowing that Medicaid costs are going to continue to be growing into the future."

HEADLINE: South's New Blacks Find Comfort Laced With Strain

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SALUDA, S.C.

 BODY:
Two and a half years ago, when life in Los Angeles became too stressful, Delores Watson moved back to her hometown more than 2,000 miles away to go into business and start a new life.
Over the years her family had operated the small town's only black funeral home, a restaurant and a barber shop, but she and her husband, Rodney, had two teen-age children to raise as well. And raising them here in Saluda, even against a backdrop of racial prejudice, seemed a bargain when compared with the gang problem and the drugs that had begun to penetrate the black upper-middle-class enclave where they lived. 
 The Watsons are among a steady flow of blacks who have been returning to the South over the last decade, reversing a nearly 50-year-long exodus. Their return is not new, but recent figures from the current population survey of the Census Bureau show the stream surging as black retirees and Northern-born blacks seeking greater economic opportunities appear to be swelling their ranks.
 
Like Those Who Moved North
 The reasons given for the moves are on one level as varied as the people citing them: personal considerations, improved economic opportunities, easier life styles and vastly improved race relations. After a time, though, the stories of the migrants and their lives in the South grow remarkably similar in tone, if not content, to those told a generation or two ago by blacks lured from the rural, agricultural economy of the South to the urban and industrial economy of the North in one of the nation's more significant migrations.
But there are constant reminders of both the positives and negatives that such a move can hold for a black person, and both can appear in a single, complex event. For Mrs. Watson, a stark example occurred just recently.
The 45-year-old owner of a health care and supply company, Mrs. Watson was at the post office in this town of 3,000 people when she saw an elderly white woman who had been a patient of one of her home health care aides. There was brief eye contact, Mrs. Watson said, but her greeting went ignored. She said she let the slight pass because she was used to being "invisible" to some whites in town.
A minute later, though, that same woman, unable to get her grandson to mind, threatened him by openly pointing to Mrs. Watson and saying, "That girl's gonna get you."
It was one thing to be ignored, Mrs. Watson said, but it was something altogether different to be demonized.
"I had to confront her," she said. "I told her that she had to understand that she was creating a negative image of black people for this young child by suggesting that a black woman who had no real interest in him might harm him.
"She apologized and left."
It was a defining moment of sorts for Mrs. Watson, a former personnel officer in Los Angeles city government. There had been racial incidents in Los Angeles that had tried her patience and angered her, she said, but they had been more subtle, more a glancing blow than a direct hit, and her responses were therefore more diffuse.
 
More Effort but More Reward
 "Life in general requires a lot of psychic energy for black people on racial things," she said, "and on balance the things I run into here are more demanding because I am more engaged in this small town and its small-town atmosphere. In Los Angeles I was just sort of an anonymous one of many, but here I feel that the energy I expend gets a one-to-one response, and that is more gratifying."
For Mrs. Watson and her family the move has on balance been a positive one that has fed the soul's yearnings, simplified life and its pitfalls and opened up economic opportunities. It is a much-changed South that she and others blacks have returned to, and there are indications as well, said Isaac Robinson, a sociologist at North Carolina Central University, that many of them were actually born in the North and have little concept of the Old South.
"There is a whole generation out there whose idea of the South has very little to do with lynchings of blacks, segregation or the Ku Klux Klan," he said. "They know that there is some racism, but it is not the predominant thing in their minds."
This flow of blacks to the South was first noticed as a trickle in the late 1970's, but grew to be a good-sized stream in the 80's. From 1985 to 1990, the surveys found, a net of 355,000 black Americans moved to the South, compared with 89,000 the five years before and 193,000 from 1975 to 1980.
A significant factor for the increase, the researchers said, was a reversal of the decades-long black exodus from the South. By 1988, Federal data showed the proportion of blacks in the South rising for first time, reaching 56 percent.
 
Spreading the Word
 The migrants, many of them black retirees returning to the areas where they were born, have spread the word about a host of tangible and intangible advantages of living in the South. Among the tangibles, said George Gaymon, a 52-year-old health services administrator in South Carolina government, is the fact that his Columbia home has triple the square footage that his Montclair, N.J., home had at half the cost.
Mr. Gaymon, who was born in Panola, 50 miles south of Columbia, said the intangibles included friendliness and an excitement at being part of a growing region.
Others talked about the comfort they felt from familiar surroundings and familiar patterns of life. Their return promoted a sense of safety for some, said Phoebe Benson, a single parent in her 30's, who grew up in Columbia and moved back six months ago after a 10-year absence. It also contributed to a sense of being plugged into African-American roots and family roots.
"There are patterns that are very comforting here," said Ms. Benson. "It's like the smell of fresh-washed sheets and bacon frying in the morning. These are verities and they are reassuring for me."
 
Fleeing Specter of the Gangs Scene
 Delores Watson was looking for reassurances as well in her life and in the lives of her children when she decided to return to Saluda and small-town life after 20 years in sprawling Los Angeles. There, she said, she had felt an ever present fear of random violence. But most worrisome was the specter of the corrosive effect the city's gang scene could have on her two children, Akintunde, 17, and Monifa, 15.
"I have two bright children, and I did not want them pressured into participating in a gang or ostracized for being bright," she said.
The family also had a practical reason to return to Saluda: the opportunity to run a business in an economic atmosphere that was less pressured and more forgiving than Los Angeles's.
After years of working in government, Mrs. Watson said that she felt she had reached "the glass ceiling" that so many other highly trained, black professionals reach. Starting her own home health services and health supply business, American Sein Pro, seemed a path to greater satisfaction.
"My family has an entrepreneurial tradition here," said Mrs. Watson, adding, "In a way I came back to an incubator for small businesses that I didn't have in California."
Not everything has been rosy, she said. For one, she and Mr. Watson recently decided to buy a home 48 miles away from Saluda in Columbia, the state capital. With a population of 106,000 and a metropolitan area population of nearly a half million, Columbia offered more housing options, "a better social atmosphere" for her two teen-agers, more amenities and expansion opportunities for her business.
"I will keep the business based here and keep the kind of closeness and community life it offers," she said. "But I really just got tired of driving 48 miles to go to a movie theater."
 
A 'Less Global' Life
 While the small world of Saluda insulated her children from the pressures they had faced in Los Angeles, she said, it also meant moving in a much narrower band of the social spectrum. No Asians or Latinos live in Saluda, she said, and so her children's exposure was "less global" than she wished.
Blacks as well as whites returning to or migrating to the South are overwhelmingly choosing cities and metropolitan areas, said John Kasarda, a sociologist and director of the Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, often for precisely the reasons cited by Mrs. Watson.
Many may have been born elsewhere and are simply going where the jobs are, Mr. Kasarda said. Cities like Atlanta, Columbia and North Carolina's Chapel Hill, Raleigh and Durham in the so-called Research Triangle have in the last decade gained technical, white-collar and manufacturing jobs.
Marshal Logan and his wife, Barbara, chose to retire to the Asheville, N.C., area where Mr. Logan was born and raised. But the small city of 61,000 is not the place they would recommend for their five grown children, who continue to live in the Trenton, N.J., area that the Logans left two years ago.
"With their educational background, their exposure, this is not the place for them," said Mrs. Logan, who was born in Princeton, N.J., and has never lived in the South. "There still aren't great opportunities for young black people in small southern cities like this. They would be better off in an Atlanta or even a Columbia, S.C."
Mr. Logan, a 59-year-old retired school administrator, said he returned to Asheville because the lower cost of living allowed him, on his retirement pay, to maintain the style of living he had had in the Northeast. Safety was also a major factor, he said, and he had heard those same concerns expressed among many other returnees recently when he attended a reunion of his class from Asheville's once-segregated, black high school.
Mr. Logan said he had left Asheville reluctantly in 1958 to go "up east," but added: "That was where the jobs were. I thought I might stay just a few years but with family and a career, that just didn't happen. Now I feel that I have returned to my roots. I go to the church that I grew up in and I have restored an old home next door to my 93-year-old uncle. I feel really at home."

HEADLINE: For the 'Bessie' Festivities, Awards and a Little Music

BYLINE: By JACK ANDERSON

 BODY:
Dance Theater Workshop presented its eighth annual New York Dance and Performance Awards on Friday night at the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center. The awards honored achievements in dance and performance art for the 1990-91 season, and the recipients were chosen by a panel of dancers, producers and dance writers who attended 1,200 performances by approximately 900 artists and companies.
Familiarly known as the Bessies, the awards are named after Bessie Schonberg, a highly regarded teacher of dance composition. Award-winning choreographers and performance-art creators received cash gifts of $1,000. Winners in other categories received $500. 
 Presenting one of the event's three special citations, Miss Schonberg acknowledged that these are economic hard times. Then she said: "Cheer up. We'll all be poor together." The citation went to Nancy Duncan, artistic director of Codanceco, a repertory company that has commissioned more than 50 new works representing many choreographic styles.
 
Special Citations
 Other special citations were presented by Larry Greene, an arts administrator, and Francis Mason, editor of Ballet Review and dance critic for WQXR. They went to Carlos Gutierrez-Solana, director of the visual arts program of the New York State Council on the Arts, and Yuriko, a dancer who has been associated with the Martha Graham Dance Company for 48 years and is now the group's associate artistic director.
Choreographers and creators of performance arts pieces who received awards were Paul Clay, Lora Nelson, Cydney Wilkes, Richard Elovich, Alice Farley, Dan Froot, David Gordon, David Hammons, James Luna, Paul Zaloom, and Gusmiati Suid, Syekh Lah Genta and Atif Usman, directors of the troupes that participated in "Music and Dance of Sumatra: Aceh and Minangkabau," an attraction of last season's Festival of Indonesia.
Winners in other categories included:
Performers: Kyle de Camp, Paula Gifford, Chris Komar, Jeremy Nelson, David Neumann and Desmond Richardson.
Visual design: Anthony Chase, Mimi Gross, Sue Rees and Huck Snyder.
Composers: Tom Cora, Julius Hemphill and Pauline Oliveros.
Liz Prince, Mimi Goese, Sean Curran, Norwood Pennewell, Ann Carlson and Garth Fagan served as awards presenters. The evening's hosts were John Killacky, curator of the performing arts at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, and Reno, a performance artist.
 
A Bit of Satire
 Musical interludes during the program, which lasted almost 3 hours and 15 minutes, were provided by the Feetwarmers, a seven-piece swing combo, and Nana Vasconcelos, a Brazilian singer and percussionist who performed in a collaboration with Scott Lehrer, a sound designer. Jason Wilcox, a female impersonator, portrayed a leather-jacketed Medea modeled upon the pop singer Cher in a scene from a satirical update of Greek mythology.
After a moment of silence that paid tribute to people in the arts who have died of AIDS, the evening came to a joyous conclusion with songs by Lavender Light: The Black and People of All Colors Lesbian and Gay Gospel Choir.
Established with the aid of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, which continues to provide support, the Bessies this year were also made possible by grants from The Village Voice, the Candy Jernigan Memorial Fund and an anonymous donor. In addition, the presentation was aided by the Joyce Mertz-Gilmore Foundation, the Harkness Foundation for Dance and individual donors.

Questions Abound In the Case Of Noriega

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
CNN's busy special assignment branch has come up with a report on America's dealings with Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega that is not likely to add to the foreign policy luster of the Reagan-Bush Administration. "The General's Price: The Full Story," which was first shown about a week ago, can be seen beginning tonight in four installments of about 15 minutes each on the cable channel's 6 P.M. news program. It is more solid than the fare usually provided by the competing local news shows.
Timed to coincide with the Miami drug trial of the former Panamanian strongman, the program goes back to the years when, as the evening's reporter, John Camp, recalls, General Noriega was considered "Washington's man in Panama." He was courted by American intelligence services despite suspicions that he was chronically corrupt. Richard M. Helms, a former Director of Central Intelligence, puts it pithily: "He's a bum." The pictures of General Noriega, which serve as a backdrop to much of the report, make him look like the heavy in a B movie. 
 By tonight's account, even while ostensibly cooperating with the United States Drug Enforcement Agency, General Noriega was on the take from Colombian drug dealers who used Panama as a transshipment point for cocaine bound for Miami. By the mid-1980's, however, says Elliott Abrams, an Assistant Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration, Washington was warning its sometime ally to clean up his act. But the act only got worse. In February 1988 he was indicted in Miami on drug charges, and in December 1989 American forces invaded Panama in what was called Operation Just Cause, and he was brought back to face trial.
The prosecution case, Mr. Camp notes, has certain problems. There is the question of whether the United States violated international law by arresting a country's leader on his own soil. The prosecution's taping of hundreds of telephone calls, including many involving the Noriega defense team, has already been challenged. And jurors will find most of the evidence against the defendant coming from convicted drug dealers who have been offered generous reductions of their own sentences for their testimony.
In Panama, meanwhile, Mr. Camp reports that despite the praise President Bush and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney are heard delivering for the accomplishments of the invasion, drug smuggling seems to have increased. And as Operation Just Cause approaches its second anniversary, political and economic disarray persists. Few viewers are likely to come away from this incisive program feeling sorry for General Noriega; but some are bound to wonder about what Washington thought it was up to in this corner of Central America.

HEADLINE: U.S. Agencies Use Negotiations To Pre-empt Lawsuits Over Rules

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Washington, a city of lawsuits, is embracing a new way of doing business. At stake are rules that govern everything from who may sit in the exit rows on airliners to how much a power plant can pollute.
More and more, Federal agencies are collaring industries and interest groups and getting them together to decide what the new rules will say. 
 So far the reviews are glowing. And one of the most popular elements of these negotiations is that all parties promise not to use lawsuits to upset any settlements that they reach.
 
The Lawsuit System
 Lawsuits to overturn regulations have become commonplace under the system that has been used for 45 years: an agency studies an issue, writes a rule, takes comments, issues a final version and then defends it in court against attacks by industry associations or citizens' groups. That system still predominates, but agencies are seeking negotiated settlements wherever they can.
The Environmental Protection Agency used the new system recently to develop rules to put into effect provisions of the Clean Air Act.
"We had people at the table who probably wouldn't have returned each other's telephone calls," said William Rosenberg, deputy administrator for air and radiation. The environmental agency cannot hope to write all the regulations needed under the new law without similar negotiations in other fields, he said.
One of those at the table was Urvan R. Sternfels, president of the National Petroleum Refiners Association, who said he was an advocate of the new system. "It's a better situation," he said, "when people who are adversaries can sit down at the table and talk about it rather than throwing bricks at each other in courtrooms and the press."
Environmental groups like the new system, too. "We'd love to see it used again and again," said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, which recently concluded a negotiation over air pollution from a power plant near the Grand Canyon. "The E.P.A. brought the environmentalists and the industry together to hammer out a creative, strong solution."
One such agreement was celebrated Wednesday, when President Bush and William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, spoke at the Grand Canyon about an agreement to reduce the emissions of a coal-fired generating station that has been blamed for producing haze in the area.
In coming months, the E.P.A. hopes to conclude negotiations on rules governing everything from how to dispose of lead-acid batteries, which can contaminate underground water, to how to glue down wall-to-wall carpeting, which can poison indoor air.
 
Airplane Seating Rules
 Recently the Federal Aviation Administration conducted negotiations among airlines and advocacy groups for people with disabilities, setting rules on who can sit in the rows next to exits over wings on airplanes.
This process was formalized by Congress last year, in the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990, but it has been in sporadic use on the state and Federal level for most of the last 10 years. It is being used so much by the environmental agency that it seems as if the battle lines of environmentalism are now in a conference room.
This is a major advance, Mr. Reilly said, because in recent years the main battleground has been the courts.
"Four of every five decisions I make are contested in court," he said in a recent telephone interview. "We spend as much time designing our rules to withstand court attack as we do getting the rules right and out in the first place."
Mr. Reilly is not the only one who wants to keep the environmental agency out of court. In the just-concluded agreement for clean fuels, oil refiners were expecting to spend billions of dollars, and wanted assurance that they would not be racing to comply with requirements that would be overturned later by a judge. As part of that negotiation, environmental groups and the oil industry promised that neither would sue to overturn the provisions of what they had agreed to.
 
Discouraging Defectors
 They even agreed that if a defector emerged from one side or the other -- for example, an oil company that broke ranks and decided to challenge the rules, or an environmental group that took legal action to block one portion of the rules -- the other oil companies or environmental groups would go to court to support the consensus.
In the negotiations over clean fuels, other participants were the states, which have the authority to issue their own rules within their borders and were believed ready to do so if they thought the Federal regulations were not strong enough. The threat that they would do so, creating a patchwork system of gasoline regulations, was another incentive for the industry to reach an agreement.
The negotiations do not set policy; that is supposed to be done by Congress. But often the law is a bare-bones structure, and the affected parties sometimes disagree over exactly what the language means.
In the agreement on clean fuels, the law set certain standards for the content of gasoline, but the petroleum industry won a provision in the regulations so that the standards had to be met on average, rather than in every case. The industry believes that this interpretation will reduce its cost.
Environmentalists gained in resolving an apparent ambiguity in the legislative language. At one point, Congress appears to set an absolute limit on a parameter of gasoline called Reid vapor pressure, which measures the tendency of the fuel to evaporate. But in another section, the law appears to require a percentage reduction in Reid vapor pressure, leaving unclear whether the percentage was to be applied to the absolute limit or to the existing level.
 
Grand Canyon Compromise
 In the Grand Canyon case, industry and environmentalists compromised on how reliable the anti-pollution equipment on the power plant would have to be, settling on a rule that requires a 90 percent reduction in emissions on an annual basis, rather than the original proposal of 70 percent in any given month. The change eliminated the need for a backup unit for reducing emissions.
According to Mr. Rosenberg, the E.P.A. air and radiation official, settling for 90 percent a year instead of 70 percent each month resulted in a 40 percent greater improvement in visibility at a 20 percent lower cost.
Experts say both those settlements are "win-win" solutions, in which both parties gain from being flexible.
Finding such compromises, reducing costs and staying out of court are also goals for environmentalists, said Mr. Krupp of the Environmental Defense Fund, which had sued over the air at the Grand Canyon. If the job is done more economically, he said, that leaves more money to use elsewhere, and keeping the case out of court "can foreclose the industry from appealing the regulations and bringing the process to a stall."
While negotiations are more frequent now, they are not new. Philip J. Harter, a lawyer in Washington and professor of administrative law at American University Law School, who drafted the 1990 law, traced the origin of the technique to Washington State, where it was used in the mid-1970's to plan a route for Interstate 5 across a scenic lake near Seattle.
But negotiation is far from universally successful. Chris Kirtz, chief of the consensus and dispute resolution staff at the E.P.A., said his agency had tried over the years to steer 60 disputes into negotiation, but only 12 succeeded.
Sometimes, he said, the dispute was too politicized, or the potential participants thought they faced a backlash. For example, he said, environmental groups declined to enter negotiations on radioactive waste regulations, fearing that whatever they agreed to would anger their constituents.
The new system will also fail in cases where the decision is "bipolar," said Mr. Harter, such as, "Are we going to locate a nuclear plant in your back yard, yes or no?"
But it can settle disputes that have persisted for years. Mr. Harter cited the first Federal use of the new system, by the F.A.A., to revise 30-year-old rules on when pilots are required to take rest breaks.
The revision was needed because the industry had gone from DC-3's to 747's, he said, but "every time the F.A.A. tried to revise the rules some political group had the horsepower to knock it down." As a result, Mr. Harter said, the agency kept issuing interpretations of its rule, until they had reached a total of 1,000 pages. The negotiated settlement, he said, was two pages.

Leahy's Compromise

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
George Bush is on the verge of a Pyrrhic victory. He picked a fight with Israel just before a peace conference, demanding that loan guarantees to Soviet refugees be again delayed, giving him a lever to force Israel to freeze settlements and in effect hand over the West Bank.
He knows his veto would be sustained in Congress, as all others have. He has Washington Post and New York Times editorialists behind him. In a test of strength, he would humiliate Israel and its American supporters, delighting Arab despots. 
 But at what cost? By inflicting unforgettable punishment, Mr. Bush would boost superhawk Ariel Sharon in Israel, win unwanted backing here from gleeful neo-isolationists, hearten the lunatic fringe, harm his party and earn a place in history as domestic polarizer rather than global peacemaker.
Cool heads in Congress are looking for a way to avert this political Armageddon. The key player, according to senators on both sides of the aisle, is Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat whose Senate committee controls all foreign-aid appropriations.
Pat Leahy is a maverick establishmentarian, a parsimonious liberal, an Italian-Irish Yankee. His Agriculture Committee failed in its oversight of commodity credits to Iraq through the Bank of Lavoro, and he has been an implacable foe of the Stealth bomber. He is his own man, however, and was the Democrat that George Bush counted on, after a private meeting excluding John Sununu, to delay Senate consideration of the loan guarantee to house Soviet immigrants to Israel.
Senator Leahy delivered; the Senate version of the House-passed bill will not be taken up until Congress returns from its post-Thanksgiving recess, probably at the end of January. Nobody knows what assurances Mr. Leahy received from Mr. Bush about support of the bill in return, but bipartisan deals are rarely one-way.
According to Senate colleagues who have been approached by Senator Leahy over the weekend, here are the elements of the Leahy Compromise:
1. The $10 billion guarantee spread over the coming five years will be part of a "must pass" bill, tied to all other foreign aid including Egypt's; it will not be stand-alone legislation that can be singled out for veto; nor will it be subject to further delay.
2. For every dollar Israel spends on settlements in the West Bank, the loan guarantee will be reduced by one dollar. This answers the "fungibility" argument, which holds that guarantees for housing within pre-1967 Israel would free up money that could then be used to settle the West Bank. It enables Mr. Bush to assure Arabs that no American aid is directed to Israeli West Bank settlement.
How much of an economic disincentive would the dollar-for-dollar proviso be? Last year, Israeli spending on new settlements was about $85 million; if Israel spends, say, $100 million next year, that much in loan guarantees would be deducted from the year's $2 billion.
Whose figures would be used? The Leahy compromise envisages a Government Accounting Office continuing on-site review, not dependent on Israeli, Arab or State Department estimates.
3. The guarantee will be tied to Israeli economic reforms. This will be met with cheers from conservatives who wish Israel well and wish it to abandon old socialist economics; in Jerusalem, it will make necessary habit-breaking palatable.
According to a jowly O.M.B. official in a baseball cap, such reforms would affect the amount needed for U.S. budgetary set-aside, which could be brought down to 5 percent of the guarantee, or $100 million a year, as credit ratings improve; Israelis say it could go as low as 1 percent.
Would the Israelis accept the Leahy approach, which permits the President to hold a million Soviet Jews hostage for four months as a negotiations whip, forces settlement spending to come out of Israeli defense dollars and dictates systemic changes? They don't have much choice.
Will Mr. Bush buy into the compromise? He could send Secretary Baker to the Congress with a different plan, or double-cross Senator Leahy by vetoing all foreign aid if Israel does not follow orders at the peace table. He might still win, but as Plutarch reported King Pyrrhus to have said, "another such victory and we are ruined."

BYLINE: By Hugh B. Price; Hugh B. Price is vice president of the Rockefeller Foundation.

 BODY:
"Was Cleopatra black?" That question, posed recently on the cover of Newsweek, encapsulates the raging debate over multicultural education in America. Mainstream academicians say the movement mangles history. Aggrieved minorities and women claim that history texts are full of glaring omissions, cultural stereotypes and misrepresentations of their histories.
These accusations ring true to me as an African-American. I grew up in the District of Columbia and am old enough to have attended segregated schools and witnessed the onset of integration. In the newly integrated schools of the 1950's, we were taught one version of the Civil War -- the Southern version. Of course, there was another version of the war that we weren't taught. And those contrasting versions clearly were the product of conscious decisions by historians, textbook publishers and school teachers. 
 I was an adult before I learned that Aleksandr Pushkin and Alexandre Dumas were partly black. No literary anthologies in my high school or college courses mentioned those facts. This pattern of denial and duplicity helps explain the deep-rooted suspicions among minorities and women about the accuracy of history taught in schools.
Is it even necessary to present all history as settled truth? Where there is sharp disagreement, for example, between traditionalists and Afrocentrists over the ethnicity and contributions of Egypt, why not pose the contrasting positions to students as propositions to be studied? Teach them how to use primary sources, weigh evidence, critique arguments and form their own views.
Those aspects of my early education that did pay homage to African Americans made a huge impression. We were taught that Ralph Bunche, the American statesman, won the Nobel Prize for bringing peace to the Middle East in the late 1940's; that Dr. Charles Drew discovered blood plasma and saved the lives of many American soldiers in World War II; and, yes, that Jackie Robinson had integrated major-league baseball.
In other words, we learned that blacks were of value to society, whether others thought so or not. It's impossible to overstate the impact of this individual and collective self-confidence on our will to succeed in school and beyond.
We may argue that instilling self-esteem isn't the province of schools, but we delude ourselves if we think there isn't a link between self-esteem and achievement. Or that the nexus between schools and well-functioning families hasn't done this all along for white children. If schools are to succeed for the millions of minority children who lack support at home and in the community, then educators must fill this void.
Multiculturalists also challenge the melting pot metaphor. It is said that most people who have emigrated to the U.S. over the years have arrived expecting to become unhyphenated Americans. The trouble is that the melting pot still excludes many minorities and women. It took decades of marches and lawsuits to eradicate official segregation. Yet housing and employment discrimination persist.
Growing economic hardship may lie at the heart of today's ethnic tensions. How can we expect millions of Americans, a disproportionate number of them minority, to embrace, much less treasure, Western history and values when they're under economic siege?
I wonder whether those who worry that multiculturalism will ruin the melting pot haven't misread American history. Isn't it the opportunity to breathe politically and advance economically that has lured millions of immigrants to our shores? That is the attribute that defines our society, bonds us together and sets our nation apart from others. Were those who preach inclusiveness truly to practice it, then perhaps our collective anxiety about the growing intolerance and insularity in America would, shall we say, melt away.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Continues to Fall; Data on Economy Awaited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar drifted lower in quiet trading yesterday, continuing a weak performance as market participants awaited new details on the economy's future.
The dollar lacked a sense of direction throughout the session, and moved lower mostly in technical dealing, traders said. 
 The market was largely unmoved by reports of tension between Iraqi guards and a United Nations peace-keeping force.
Kevin Lawrie, a vice president at the Bank of Boston, said the incident caused a brief rise in dollar prices.
"That was the thrill of the day, but you had to be quick to catch it," Mr. Lawrie said.
Two reports scheduled for release later this week -- durable goods orders for August and the second quarter gross national product -- may provide guidance on the economy's health and a direction for the dollar, Mr. Lawrie said.
Other traders said the United States currency fell through a significant technical level against the Japanese yen in New York trading, closing at 132.84 yen, down from 134.15 late Friday.
Markets were closed in Japan today because of Autumnal Equinox Day, a national holiday. In London, the dollar traded at 133.00 Japanese yen, lower than the 134.72 yen quoted in Tokyo late Friday.
The British pound closed at $1.7445 in London, up from $1.7290 late Friday. In New York, sterling cost $1.7425, more expensive than $1.7315 late Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.6735 German marks, down from 1.6845; 1.4580 Swiss francs, down from 1.46985; 5.7035 French francs, down from 5.7395; 1,252.25 Italian lire, down from 1,260.00, and 1.13415 Canadian dollars, down from 1.13445.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Mortgage Lender Is Back for More

BYLINE: By Michael Quint

 BODY:
FOR most companies, one public stock offering a year is plenty. But rapid growth and a sharp rise in its stock price have led Countrywide Credit Industries, a Pasadena, Calif., concern that specializes in home mortgage financing, to ask for a second helping.
The second stock offering -- 6 million shares offered today by Merrill Lynch & Company at a price of $27.375 for a total of $164.3 million -- will be much more rewarding to the company than the offering in March of 3.7 million shares at $12.25 each. The company's stock price has more than doubled since March, and demand for the new offering was strong enough that the size was increased from 4 million shares. 
 At Monday's closing price of $27.375 a share, down 12.5 cents on the New York Stock Exchange, Countrywide stock is only a shade below its high of 28.125 on Friday and has more than doubled in value since the March sale.
In an interview with American Banker, a trade newspaper, Angelo R. Mozilo, vice chairman of Countrywide, said the company expected to handle a record $1 billion of new mortgages this month, up sharply from the $1.8 billion total for the three months that ended on May 31.
The difficulties of others in real estate, where housing starts are running at a low annual rate of about a million units a year, seem to have opened the door for Countrywide to grow faster.
"With all the pressure on savings and loans and banks, there has been an opportunity for Countrywide to gain market share," said G. Kenneth Heebner, president of Capital Growth Management, an investment advisory firm in Boston. Even Citicorp, the most active new-mortgage lender in recent years and the largest servicer of existing mortgages, has been pulling back, he noted.
The strategic opportunity, plus the strong growth in mortgage lending that Mr. Heebner expects as interest rates fall, led him to accumulate 2.24 million shares, or 9.6 percent of the company as of June 30, making Capital Growth the largest single investor.
While demand for Countrywide stock has been strong, a few company insiders have been sellers. Mr. Mozilo, for example, has sold 78,500 shares this year at prices ranging from $14.50 to $21.125, reducing his holdings to 238,866 shares.
One reason Countrywide earns high marks is its use of computers and communications technology. In a business that is largely paper shuffling, as mortgages are issued and then sold to investors, Countrywide has become a low-cost operator able to handle rapid growth.
"They use technology in ways that give them a competitive advantage and set them apart," said Brian F. Hershkowitz, an associate director of the Mortgage Bankers Associaton. "They were operating with excess capacity, and now they are putting it to use."
In the servicing business, where Countrywide collects monthly payments for more than $19 billion of mortgages, the company has told securities analysts that it uses one employee for each 760 loans, compared with an industry average of 650 loans per employee. With this cost advantage, Countrywide has told analysts that it plans to more than double its servicing business to $46 billion of mortgages by 1996.
All mortgage services are computerized, but few have gone so far as Countrywide. Mr. Mozilo, a founder of the company in 1968, was an early convert to computer power. The company's network of 112 offices includes about 90 that are staffed by three people who act as a sales force, rather than clerks, because the company years ago developed a computer that can handle local chores at the same time it disgorges data to the central office.
In place of the blank forms for the more than 80 different documents a branch office might need, Countrywide uses its computers and laser printers to produce printed versions of completed forms, thus saving on inventory, storage space and clerical time. When a homeowner calls Countrywide, telephone operators retrieve the customer's account history on a computer screen rather than fetch paper documents.
More technological applications are coming. Countrywide is working with I.B.M. to develop computer software to make mortgage lending more uniform and, it hopes, less risky. Mr. Mozilo said earlier this year that he still wanted a process in which a branch manager "can see the look in your eyes" when he asks if an applicant can make the payments.
"The company is perceived by some as a growth stock," said David Hochstim, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company. "I think it's a fine company with excellent management, but it's a finance company whose stock right now seems expensive relative to other financial companies I follow."
For example, at its current price, Countrywide's stock sells at about 16 times Mr. Hochstim's earnings estimate of $1.60 a share for 1992, while stocks of the Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, known as Freddie Mac, sell at only 9 or 10 times next year's earnings.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Up a Bit in Price

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities improved slightly in slow trading yesterday, as dealers continued to adjust portfolios in advance of two-year and five-year note auctions to be held today and tomorrow.
Market participants said demand for the new notes should be good. 
 "Over the past couple of weeks, demand has improved for intermediate-term securities," one government bond trader said. "A lot of that stems from money that is moving out of money market accounts and bank certificates of deposit and into higher-yielding intermediate bond funds."
Late yesterday the new two-year notes, were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.16 percent. The five-year securities to be sold tomorrow were offered in when-issued trading late yesterday at a price to yield 7.06 percent.
"With rates on C.D.s and other items for individuals at unattractive levels relative to market rates, money is pouring into mutual funds and the market directly," said William M. Brachfeld, an executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc.
 
Treasury's Weekly Auction
 Activity at the Treasury's weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills was fairly brisk, but yields on the new short-term securities were little changed from a week ago.
The new three-month bills sold yesterday were auctioned at an average discount rate of 5.18 percent, little changed from the 5.19 percent average rate at last week's sale.
Bids on new six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 5.23 percent, compared with an average rate of 5.22 percent at the auction a week ago.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 102 29/32, up 5/ 32, to yield 7.87 percent, compared with 7.88 percent late Friday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 10/32, up 6/32, to yield 7.53 percent. And the outstanding 6 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 14/32, up 1/32, to yield 6.12 percent.
 
Reserve Bank Resignation
 An announcement that F. Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, had submitted his resignation prompted much comment but had little impact on prices of Treasury securities.
Mr. Hoskins, an ardent inflation-fighter, was scheduled to become a voting member of the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee next year.
"His departure should add to a more dovish F.O.M.C. next year," analysts at MMS International noted in their daily market commentary.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, a financing subsidiary of the Household Finance Corporation, offered a total of $714 million worth of securities backed by credit-card receivables through an underwriting group led by Salomon Brothers.
The bulk of the issue consisted of $614 million worth of 7 3/8 percent notes with an average expected life of four years.
The securities were priced at $99.48, to yield 7.56 percent, 83 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on Treasury securities of comparable maturity.
These securities are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The remaining $100 million of the issue consisted of 8 1/8 percent notes with an average life of 4.6 years. These securities were priced at $99.63, to yield 8.28 percent, 1.20 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/4 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
This part of the issue is rated A-2 by Moody's and A-plus by Standard & Poor's.
American Airlines offered a total of approximately $210 million of pass-through certificates through an underwriting group led by Morgan Stanley & Company.
The issue consisted of $140 million of securities with an average life of 11.8 years.
These 8.97 percent certificates were priced at $100, or par, 1.42 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The remaining $70 million worth of securities have an average life of 20.7 years. These securities have a coupon of 9.73 percent and were also priced at $100, or par, 1.85 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing.
Both parts of this issue are rated A-2 by Moody's and A-minus by Standard & Poor's.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, the Arizona Transportation Board offered $170 million worth of serial bonds in a negotitated sale through Dean Witter Reynolds.
Interest rates on the serial bonds range from 6.30 percent on securities maturing in 2003 to 6.65 percent on bonds maturing in 2011.
The issue is rated AA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues dipped by about 1/4 point in sluggish trading.
Participants in the secondary market for municipal bonds said prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about 1/8 point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98,691	97,356	Discounted Rate	5.18%	5.23%	Coupon Yield	5.33%	5.46%	High Price	98,696	97,361	Discounted Rate	5.16%	5.22%	Coupon Yield	5.31%	5.45%	Low Price	98,691	97,356	Discounted Rate	5.18%	5.23%	Coupon Yield	5.33%	5.46%	Accepted at low price	52%	48%	Total applied for	$34,101,820	$34,074,740	Accepted	$10,607,465	$10,711,115	N.Y. applied for	$31,228,650	$31,390,220	N.Y. accepted	$9,374,095	$9,508,515	Noncompetitive	$1,422,850	$1,286,320	
Both these issues are dated Sept.26, 1991. The three-month bills mature Dec.26, 1991 and the six-month bills, March 26,1992.

Silver Hits a 2-Month High; Economic Confidence Cited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of silver futures charged to a two-month high yesterday the Commodity Exchange in New York on technical buying stemming from perceptions that the economy is climbing out of recession.
Silver for September delivery settled 8.1 cents higher, at $4.168 an ounce, the highest settlement of a near-term contract since July 23. Gold for October delivery rose $2.20, to $351.10 an ounce. 
 Analysts said most of the silver buying was inspired by optimistic technical signals after a stronger opening.
Many buyers were thought to be metal dealers and users, which suggested that confidence in an economic recovery was growing. Silver prices have been depressed by slack industrial demand for much of the year.
News of a drawdown of four million ounces in the Commodity Exchange's warehouse stocks of silver last Friday bolstered ideas that industrial demand is growing, said Tom Griffo, an analyst at Cargill Investor Services Inc.
The exchange's warehouse stocks rose by about 1.5 million ounces yesterday, to 268.7 million.
Precious metals also drew support from a weaker dollar and ideas the United States was leaning toward more financial assistance for the Soviet Union, said Peter Cardillo, the research director for Westfalia Investments Inc.
Increased Western aid would reduce the Soviets' need to sell precious metals for hard currency.
Mr. Cardillo said silver prices could rise 10 cents or 12 cents more before facing heavy resistance.
But Bernard Savaiko, the senior metals analyst with Paine Webber Inc., said dealer demand could dry up at $4.20 to $4.25 an ounce.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil prices rose, as traders stocked up on crude while keeping an eye on increased tensions surrounding Iraq and waiting for OPEC's meeting today.
Crude oil for November delivery settled at $22.07 a barrel, up 28 cents; October home heating oil rose 1.21 cents, to 63.80 cents a gallon; October unleaded gasoline rose 0.45 cent, to 61.35 cents a gallon; October natural gas rose 5.8 cents, to $1.80 for 1,000 cubic feet, but November deliveries fell 6.1 cents, to $1.919.
On the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, coffee futures fell sharply after coffee-producing countries failed to agree over the weekend on a plan to raise prices.
December coffee fell 1.6 cents, to 89.2 cents a pound.
Cotton futures collapsed on the New York Cotton Exchange on ideas that last week's gains, tied to cool, wet weather in Texas, were exaggerated. October cotton plunged 1.99 cents, to 64.08 cents a pound.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, grain and soybean futures prices settled mostly lower, amid forecasts for good harvest weather in the Middle West with little chance of frost.
December wheat ended 3 3/4 cents lower, at $3.26 3/4 a bushel; December corn was 1 1/4 cents lower, at $2.48 3/4 a bushel; December oats ended 1/2 cent higher, at $1.30 a bushel, and November soybeans fell 7 cents, to $5.92 a bushel.

HEADLINE: CAREERS;
Improving Technology In Services

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
DR. DANIEL BERG of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute suggests that this is the decade for stressing technological improvements in industries that provide services to customers, just as in the last decade companies concentrated on lowering costs and improving quality in manufacturing operations to compete better with European and Japanese rivals.
Dr. Berg points out that service companies account for more than 70 percent of the gross national product, and they employ 75 percent of American workers. Yet, he says, technological development and innovation lag in the service sectors. 
 Furthermore, few engineers or scientists have been trained to apply their expertise directly to service companies, and as a result few have been interested in working for these companies.
"The wave of the future involves getting students, especially engineering and science students, to understand this," he said last week in an interview in New York. Students must learn more about service industries and how they can work in a service economy, he contends, and service companies must realize the importance of using these students.
For example, for about a decade a few Wall Street firms have been hiring engineers. Some work in technological areas to improve the delivery of services to customers, but quite a few have become stock and bond experts, doing research and analyzing manufacturing companies.
Accounting and consulting firms like Arthur Andersen & Company have hired many engineers to help both in the technological aspects of their operations and in auditing and surveillance activities.
Dr. Berg pointed out that companies that made nuclear reactors and equipment for nuclear energy found their nuclear business in a slump some years ago. The General Electric Company set up a unit to service nuclear equipment and offers the service to its customers.
Similarly, G.E.'s unit that makes diesel engines for railroads also went into the business of supplying maintenance help. And GE Capital provides financing worldwide for tankers and other heavy equipment owned by others. G.E., once primarily a manufacturer, has become an important service company, with financial services accounting for 24 percent of revenues in 1990.
Dr. Berg wants more companies and more young engineering students to understand the importance of jobs in the service sector. There will be a growing need, he insists, for corporate chief technological officers. "They will report directly to the chief executive officer," he said, and will head departments of engineers and scientists who can keep the company up to date on equipment.
In a recent survey, he found that 11 of 14 major banks had a designated chief technological officer, with titles like chief technologist and executive vice president for technology strategic planning.
"While C.T.O.'s already are common in banks," he said, "research organizations similar to corporate research and development labs in the manufacturing sector are not."
For these reasons, Dr. Berg and some colleagues a few weeks ago began a multidisciplinary Center for Services Research and Education at Rensselaer, in Troy, N.Y. Dr. Berg is a former president of the institute and is now a professor there.
He says there is nothing like the center elsewhere in the country, although some work along similar lines is being done at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
Professors for the new center will come not only from engineering and science programs and from the graduate management school, but also from the humanities, including experts in psychology, sociology, economics and government.
On a trip to New York last week to spur interest in the center, Dr. Berg, who is its acting director, said a half-dozen major companies had been asked to join a workshop this fall: Citibank, Arthur Andersen, Duquesne Light, American Telephone and Telegraph and Aetna Insurance, as well as the G.A.O, the Congressional watchdog agency.
"There are no textbooks on the subject," he said, and not even any courses, but they will be introduced.
"We need courses to teach students about this," he added. "An intellectual challenge is to see how far the manufacturing paradigm overlaps that of services." He visualizes the center as offering workshops for corporations and regular courses for Rensselaer students, and publishing results of professors' research on technology and the service companies.
In addition, the institute's curriculum for Master of Business Administration candidates has been changed in several ways. One is that all courses in disciplines like marketing, finance, economics and even human resources will "emphasize the impact of technology," he said.

Fox Network Producer Named TV Guide Editor

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
Anthea Disney, executive producer of the Fox television show "A Current Affair" and a former editor of US and Self magazines, was named yesterday to be editor in chief of TV Guide.
Effective immediately, she replaces Joe Robinowitz, who moved to the newly created position of executive vice president of News America Publishing Inc., the subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation that operates his vastly reduced American magazine business. 
 Leslie Hinton, News America's president and chief executive, said the moves did not presage a big shift in the editorial direction of TV Guide, which has the highest circulation -- just over 15 million -- of any weekly magazine in the United States.
But Ms. Disney suggested that both she and Mr. Murdoch had a rather different TV Guide in mind.
"It's really important not to tear apart something that 40 million people read and like," Ms. Disney said in a telephone interview. But she added, "I would like it to be more controversial."
"I think people are ready for some strong opinions," she continued. "It shouldn't just be a program guide with some fluffy articles next to it. It should have some real content."
Mr. Hinton said Mr. Robinowitz would turn his attention to the development of new products that can be spun off from the magazine, such as the recently hatched monthly, "The Best of TV Guide Crosswords."
"It's been a success from the get-go," Mr. Robinowitz said of the puzzle compendium. "You can expect to see much more of that kind of project from us. Publishing projects, video projects, television projects, book projects -- you name it."
Ms. Disney, 46, gained unwelcome attention two years ago, after S.I. Newhouse, Jr., the chairman of Conde Nast Publications Inc., stopped by her Connecticut home while she was on vacation to tell her she was being removed as the editor of Self. In her yearlong tenure, Ms. Disney marshaled what was at the time thought to be a successful redesign of the magazine. But she clashed with the magazine company's powerful editorial director, Alexander Liberman, she and executives at Conde Nast said.
Ms. Disney, who had previously redesigned US magazine, went to work for Mr. Murdoch on the prototype of a new news magazine, only to have the project succumb to an unwelcoming economy. Still struggling with his company's huge debt, Mr. Murdoch sold nine of his magazines earlier this year for $600 million, keeping only TV Guide and Mirabella.
Next, Ms. Disney went to Mr. Murdoch's Fox Broadcasting Company, to join "A Current Affair" and quickly became the show's executive producer.
Mr. Robinowitz, 40, had spent two years as a senior editor at TV Guide, the second of them as editor in chief. He has worked for Mr. Murdoch since the Australian-born publisher bought his first American property, The San Antonio Express-News, where Mr. Robinowitz was a cub reporter.
In keeping with the slashing executive manner for which Mr. Murdoch is known, Ms. Disney said she first learned that she might be moved last Wednesday. The change was made final the next day, Mr. Robinowitz said.

Head of Cleveland Fed Leaves to Run Bank

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The most vocal and effective advocate of zero inflation among the Federal Reserve's regional bank presidents has resigned to run a $9.5 billion Midwestern commercial bank.
W. Lee Hoskins, who heads the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, will take over in mid-November as president and chief executive of Huntington National Bank, a solid if not spectacular regional bank based in Columbus, Ohio. In the meantime, Mr. Hoskins will no longer participate in making monetary policy or bank supervision. 
 An ardent monetarist and admirer of free markets, Mr. Hoskins made quite a mark within the Federal Reserve System since he came to the Cleveland Fed in 1987 with his tireless advocacy of zero inflation. He gave an average of 50 speeches a year, mostly on that topic. He said he had achieved one of his objectives. "I've been very comfortable with the Greenspan monetary policy, which has produced a lower rate of inflation and should continue to do so," he said.
Mr. Hoskin's clean-cut looks, quick mind and sly sense of humor -- along with his doctorate in economics and solid grasp of economic data -- made him more effective than many of Milton Friedman's disciples in advancing his views. "By focusing as much as he did on price stability, he helped us focus on that as a long-term goal, " said Robert Forestall, president of the Atlanta Fed and one who has often disagreed with Mr. Hoskins.
The impact of Mr. Hoskins's departure is less likely immediately and directly to affect the course of monetary policy than subtly to shift the tenor of debate within the Federal Reserve. "Now even dyed-in-the-wool hawks agree that inflation is coming down, money growth is on the low side and the Fed might have to ease," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston, a securities firm.
Mr. Hoskins, who recently has not been a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, was due to resume a voting role on Jan. 1. Despite the fact that he cast more dissenting votes than virtually any other member, often in favor of tighter money, his influence was based on his view that the central bank's No. 1, 2, and 3 jobs were to wring inflation out of the economy. "The difference between Lee and most of the others is that he was so consistently on the anti-inflation side that when he argued for easier money, it didn't rattle the bond market," said Jerry Jordan, chief economist at First Interstate Bancorp.
Running a bank has long been on the personal agenda of Mr. Hoskins, who from 1980 to 1987 was the chief economist at PNC National Bank in Pittsburgh. "When Lee came to the job at the Fed he viewed himself as a private sector person who was doing an interim stretch in the public sector," said Karen Horn, chairman and chief executive of Bank One, Cleveland.
Mr. Hoskins takes over a bank that does not face the kind of wrenching restructuring of many in the industry. The main challenge, Mr. Hoskins said, will be "to increase shareholder value." Mr. Hoskins has a track record as a manager. "The Cleveland Fed is one of the best-managed Reserve banks," said Frank Wobst, chairman of the holding company of the Huntington bank and a member of the Cleveland Fed's board.
"I had a terrific job," Mr. Hoskins said, "but I turned 50 in February and I started to think about what I wanted to do with my next 15 years." One thing that won't change, however, is Mr. Hoskins's outspokenness, though he will mostly be speaking out on another, if less well-known, topic: bank reform. "I will not discourage him from speaking out at all," Mr. Wobst said.

HEADLINE: Economists Say Recession Ended in Spring

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 23

 BODY:
Despite scant evidence so far of consumer participation, an overwhelming majority of economists insist that the recession ended at least three months ago. And two members of the committee charged officially with dating it said today that the bottom most likely occurred in May.
Still, Michael J. Boskin, chief economic adviser to President Bush, persisted in expressing concern about possibly overly restrictive monetary policy by the Federal Reserve that could threaten recovery. 
 "If money growth doesn't pick up soon, the Fed will have to accommodate further," Mr. Boskin said after an appearance before the National Association of Business Economists at the Biltmore Hotel here.
Mr. Boskin, who has long contended that the upturn has begun, said the economy "turned the corner some time in the spring," but declined to specify a month.
According to a poll of group members who regularly forecast the economy, 79 percent believe the recession ended during the April-June quarter and 9 percent believe it will end in the three-month period that ends next week.
And only 11 percent considered it likely that the economy will slip back into recession in the next 12 months.
The survey was conducted in late August, before the Federal Reserve's latest round of interest rate cuts.
Geoffrey H. Moore, director of the Center for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University, declared at a panel discussion this morning that recovery is "under way." He added, "At the moment, I would pick May as the most likely date of the bottom of the recession."
But Mr. Moore said it was "not entirely clear" that the recession had ended and that it would probably be months before the seven-member dating committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private group of which he is a member, would convene to make a formal determination.
Victor Zarnowitz, professor of economics at the University of Chicago and another committee member, agreed that recovery began during the second quarter -- "maybe May, and maybe later" -- but cautioned that the National Bureau "would be well advised to wait a bit" before making an official call. The recession started in July 1990.
As is typical at such turns in the business cycle, manufacturing has set the pace, particularly in the Midwest and South, but consumers have been slow to join in, a reluctance reflected in a sizable decline in retail sales during August that, at least in the case of automobiles, appears to have continued this month.
 
A Wobbly Service Sector
 And unlike previous recessions, the service sector has been battered, another reason for lack of confidence that the rebound will be vigorous. The survey predicts that gross national product, adjusted for inflation, will grow 2.5 to 3 percent over the next 12 months, slightly less than half the 6 percent historic average for the economy coming out of recession.
Mr. Boskin said that while the economy could do better than that, it also "could do worse," citing, in addition to the Federal Reserve, the drag of state and local government cutbacks, overzealous regulators who discourage bank lenders or foreign slumps that depress demand for American exports.
Mr. Moore also offered an optimistic view of the length of the fledgling recovery. Examining the behavior of the prime interest rate after the postwar recessions since 1954, Mr. Moore found that the longer it takes for the prime rate to rise once recovery has begun, the longer the expansion will be. Thus, if May was the trough of the recession and four months have already gone by without a rise -- the latest change, in fact, was a cut earlier this month -- history suggests the expansion is already likely to last 21 months, or until February 1993, Mr. Moore said.
This correlation of the lag in the prime rate with the length of the upturn is one of the strongest he has ever seen in any of his research, Mr. Moore said.

HEADLINE: Hotels Await the Wake-Up Call

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
The nation's economy may be sputtering toward a recovery, but the hotel industry remains mired in its worst morass in decades, headed for its 10th consecutive year of losses.
"Sixty percent of the hotels in the U.S. are experiencing a net operating loss," said Bjorn Hanson, a partner in Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm. "And this year that loss will reach a little more than $1,000 per room." 
 The hotels' losses have been the travelers' gains, with business executives and vacationers alike clearly benefiting from comparatively low rates and a wide choice of accommodations. Newspaper and magazines have been full of ads from Marriott, Hyatt, Omni and other big chains, all offering such incentives as free meals, additional nights at no charge, rooms discounted as much as 60 percent and suites for the price of regular rooms.
And no quick recovery is in sight, industry executives and analysts say.
 
Plenty of Rooms Available
 The recession and the fallout from the Persian Gulf war, which dragged business travel almost to a halt, held the average occupancy rate to 60 percent for the first half of this year. That is the lowest figure in more than a decade and far below the 65 percent the typical hotel or motel requires to break even.
Among the full-service hotels, which offer room service, restaurants, swimming pools and other amenities, the occupancy rate is slightly lower -- 59.2 percent in the first sixth months of the year, down from 62 percent a year earlier, according to Smith Travel Research, which compiles the statistics used by the United States Department of Commerce and the American Hotel and Motel Association.
In response, full-service hotels like Hilton and Sheraton and even some luxury chains like the Four Seasons Hotels, have been among the most agressive in offering a variety of inducements that include cash rebates, free airline tickets and frequent-flier mileage credits. Whether these incentives have helped will not be known until Smith Research data become available at the end of October. But early indications are only mildly encouraging.
"So many travelers who used to stay in the full-service hotels discovered they didn't need a lounge, or a pool or a restaurant if they were staying just a night or two," said Jackson B. Reynolds, general manager of the Golden Lamb Inn, a small full-service establishment in Lebanon, Ohio. "So they traded down to the newer economy hotels."
As might be expected, economy hotels, the fastest-growing segment of the industry, have fared somewhat better. In the first six months of 1991, the average occupancy rate at economy hotels was 62.4 percent. That was down from 63.7 percent in the corresponding period last year, but still above the industry average.
"A major reason for the shift from full-service to limited-service hotels is that corporate travel budgets have been reduced," said David A. Dittman, dean of the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University.
But whether travelers have been frugal or profligate, the national glut of hotel rooms -- created by the hotel construction boom in the easy-financing days of the 1980's -- has helped keep increases in room rates well below the rate of inflation for the last four years.
So while travelers are finding bargains, investors are taking a drubbing: the hotel industry lost an estimated $350 million last year. And an estimated $2.1 billion in hotel loans were delinquent or in the process of foreclosure as of September 1990, according to the most recent figures available from Coopers & Lybrand, representing a 4.2 percent increase over 1989.
 
The Nation's Innkeeper Indeed
 Not surprisingly, perhaps, one of the fastest-growing hotel owners in the nation is the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency charged with selling the real estate loans that the Government acquired from failed savings and loan associations. The R.T.C. now operates more than 150 financially distressed hotels, including the 605-room Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Ariz., a $250 million complex that had been 55 percent owned by the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, formerly headed by Chares H. Keating Jr.
"We just completed a study on the profitability of 2,200 hotels, and in general they lost buckets of money," said Mark Lomanno, research manager at Smith Travel Research of Gallatin, Tenn. With the real estate market depressed, Mr. Lomanno said, the appraised values of many hotels are "dropping like a rock."
The proliferation of the economy hotels, the fastest-growing segment of the industry, reflects not just the budget consciousness of travelers, but also the segmentation of the hotel market into many niches, ranging from luxury to bare-bones.
Some hotel operators have begun creating their own niches. The Marriott Corporation, for example, now offers its Residence Inn chain for out-of-towners who need a place to stay for an extended period, and its mid-priced Courtyard hotels for thrifty travelers.
Some analysts say the industry segmentation has been overdone and more than a little cynical, because it has enabled the major hotel companies in some cases simply to cluster more franchises in popular locations.
But Dan Daniele, a consultant, said that like it or not, "segmentation is here to stay because, just like the automobile industry, you have to have different lines."
And yet, predicted Mr. Daniele, who directs hospitality industry consulting for Ernst & Young in Chicago, hotel companies will not do as well as they expected with segmentation. The discounting by the full-service hotels, he said, has greatly narrowed the gap between the market's high and low ends.
Mr. Dittman of Cornell also sees the operating margins continuing to narrow. "The hotel manager of the future will have to be able not only to provide fine wines and cuisine, but in a cost-effective way," Mr. Dittman said. "He or she will have a firm understanding of quality-cost trade-offs."
Despite the industry's current woes, analysts do expect the lodging business eventually to recover, albeit at a slow pace.
"The industry normally lags behind the general economy by one or two quarters," said Dan Lee, hotel analyst for the First Boston. "This time it was hit so hard it will probably take longer," he added. "But occupancy will eventually increase, rates will rise and the industry will return to profitability."
Analysts expect increases in room rates to pass the rate of inflation by the third or fourth quarter of 1993, but they warn it will probably be another couple of years beyond that before the industry returns to health.
One trend that could stoke the industry's recovery is the current reluctance of lenders to finance hotel construction. Tight credit may enable demand for hotel rooms to finally catch up with supply.
"From 1980 to 1987 we had a 40 percent increase in the number of hotel rooms in the U.S.," Mr. Hanson said. "In 1985 alone, there were almost 160,000 new room starts." This year, he said, new starts will be around 24,000, but about 20,000 existing rooms will be removed from the inventory as hotels retire aging properties.
 
Outlook for Full-Service Hotels
 Once occupancy rates start to rise, even full-service chains are expected to make a comeback, and those like the Hilton Hotels Corporation, the ITT Sheraton Corporation and Loews Hotels, which have been renovating their properties during the recession, are expected to do especially well. Marriott will also return to health, analysts predict, but only after it sells the bulk of nearly $1.5 billion worth of mortgages on hotels and other properties it no longer wants.
"About three years ago, Marriott accounted for one of every three new hotels being built in the U.S.," said Mr. Lee of First Boston. "This year it didn't break ground on a single new hotel."
An industry rule of thumb is that every $1,000 spent in building a room translates into one dollar in the room rate charged to lodgers. By this reckoning, a room that cost $50,000 to build, for instance, should carry a rate of $50. But the high cost of building some hotels, like the quarter-billion dollars poured into the troubled Phoenician Resort, virtually guaranteed they would lose money.
So why were such hotels built? "Because the investors thought some Japanese or Martians would bail them out at higher prices," said Robert Hazard Jr., the chairman of Choice Hotels International, whose seven chains (including Comfort, Quality, Rodeway and Econo Lodge) represent more than 2,700 motels, hotels, suites and resorts.
 
High Debt
 The indebted investors elicit scant sympathy from Mr. Hanson of Coopers & Lybrand. "Because a lender was willing to lend 100 percent," he said, "doesn't mean you had to take it." But many did, with predictable results. In 1977, interest expense on the industry's long-term debt averaged about 6 1/4 percent of revenue, Mr. Hanson said. In 1990, it was about 14 percent.
Smith Travel Research has found that the biggest financial problem for most hotels is not their operating efficiency but debt service. "Interest is eating them alive," Mr. Lomanno said.
Those problems will ease when rates and occupancies rise, analysts say. But by then many hotel properties are likely to be in other hands, as creditors become equity holders.
"Very seldom does a hotel close," Mr. Lee said. "They keep operating, but their ownership structure changes."

HEADLINE: Baby Boomers Fail as Born-Again Savers

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
For years, optimists have been counting on the middle-aging of the baby-boom generation to lift the nation's sagging savings rate. As members of that generation abandoned late nights at discos for early dinners at home with the children, they were supposed to start saving for retirement or college the way June and Ward Cleaver did.
If only "Leave It to Beaver" were true today. Personal saving habits peaked in the early 1970's, when the average citizen stashed away more than 9 percent of take-home pay, and declined through the late 80's when saving reached a nadir of less than 3 percent.
 
Maturing Is Not Enough
 A few years ago it seemed that thrift was getting trendy again, but lately saving has slumped anew. Worse, economists have concluded that there is little reason to believe that younger Americans, merely by maturing, will turn sufficiently thrifty to lift the nation's savings rate much. 
One reason is that as the baby-boom generation moves into middle age and saves more than it has, it is still saving less than earlier generations. What's more, older Americans spend more than they earn in retirement, and the ranks of seniors are growing rapidly -- so much so that younger people would have to save a substantial part of their income to offset the spending pattern of retirees and raise the nation's modest savings rate.
Such a shift is unlikely, economists say, for several reasons, including the fact that average incomes are modest for households headed by those moving into middle age.
 
Bad News for Investment
 That finding is bad news for investment and, hence, for te economy's long-term ability to generate higher productivity growth and living standards. A smaller amount saved by the nation's households, businesses and governments puts a ceiling on new investment -- even if some of it can be financed by foreigners. There is already a broad consensus that the nation is investing too little.
The decline of personal thrift is particularly worrisome because Washington is likely to keep racking up huge deficits, and corporate saving, which may well strengthen in the 90's, is not likely to offset the decline in household saving.
But the maturing of a generation will not rescue the nation from its spendthrift ways, many economists say. "The baby boom had nothing to do with the long-term decline in saving, so I see no reason for expecting saving to rebound now," said Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution who was the co-author of a recent savings study.
Edward F. McKelvey, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, dismisses as a "cruel hoax" the notion that shifting demographics will cause a savings surge.
In July, the most commonly cited measure of saving, the personal savings rate -- after-tax personal income minus consumer expenditures -- was 3.7 percent. That was down from 5.2 percent last May.
Economists expect saving to edge up with real income in the recovery, but fewer and fewer expect it to reach its 6.5 percent post-World War II average, much less the double digits that some Wall Street economists have predicted. Forecasters at DRI/ McGraw-Hill project that the savings rate will hover around 4 percent in the 90's.
 
A Seductive Theory
 It is easy to see why the prospect of a spontaneous revival of thrift has seemed so seductive. For Wall Street, more saving is the tide that could keep the stock and bond markets afloat. For people who fret about declining United States competitiveness, more saving would encourage investment. And for the baby boomers themselves, lacking faith in Social Security, more saving would improve the prospect of a more secure retirement.
More than anything, though, the demographic landscape seemed set for increased saving. Households headed by people 40 to 50 years old historically squirrel away a bigger slice of their income -- as much as 16 percent of it, which is more than any other age group does. Now that the leading edge of the generation born between 1946 and 1961 is moving into that age bracket, it would seem to follow that the overall rate would rise.
Actually, it does not follow, several economists say. Members of this generation are saving more than they did when they were younger -- for college education, first homes and retirement -- but not as much as their parents did nor enough to affect the overall rate much.
"The pace of migration of baby boomers into the high-saving age bracket is much too glacial to deliver the promised increase in saving on its own," Mr. McKelvey of Goldman, Sachs said.
 
Job for Middle-Aged
 According to a projection by the Bureau of the Census, the proportion of all households headed by people 45 to 54 years old should swell by less than five percentage points, to about 20 percent, by 2000.
To raise the savings rate even one percentage point, say to 5 percent from 4, the middle-aged would have to set aside an unlikely 20 percent of after-tax income, Mr. McKelvey said. To reach 10 percent, he added, this group would have to save practically its entire income.
A second problem is that while one generation is moving into the high-saving years, the population of Americans 75 and over will also be growing. Like very young Americans, the very old generally spend far more than their current income. "That produces a substantial offset to the small contribution of the aging of the baby-boom generation," Mr. McKelvey said.
Mr. McKelvey also shoots holes in a variant of the aging baby-boomer theme, that of the repentant yuppie. These born-again savers supposedly shopped until they dropped in the 80's and are all shopped out. Besides, they are supposedly tired of materialism and plan to spend the 90's rediscovering traditional values.
But the overwhelming majority of households in the 35-to-44-year-old bracket do not have high incomes to begin with, Mr. McKelvey said. Their average income, $40,000 before taxes in 1989, was "hardly enough to pay for BMW's and trips to the Bahamas on top of basic household expenses."
Besides, contrary to what one might expect if everybody had been splurging on luxuries instead of saving, the fraction of income Americans spent on cars, electronic gizmos and travel did not budge in the 80's. What did take a bigger bite out of budgets, though, was medical care, whose share jumped 4.5 percentage points. That is enough, Mr. McKelvey said, to account for the decline in the savings rate.
There is new historical evidence that casts more doubt on the idea that one generation is to blame for the savings slump -- an idea advanced by the President's chief economic adviser, Michael J. Boskin, in an influential paper a few years ago. Much of that evidence is given in a recent study by three Brookings Institution economists, Mr. Bosworth, Gary Burtless and John Sabelhaus. The study examines data from household surveys in the United States, Japan and Canada.
 
Slipped in All Groups
 As it turns out, savings rates slipped in all age groups -- and in Japan as well as in the United States and Canada -- from the early 60's through the mid-80's. Contrary to what most economists have thought, the rates fell furthest among older households. Finally, demographic shifts between high savers and low savers explained virtually none of the slide in saving in the last decade.
One clue to why older households cut back on saving proportionately more than younger households: Saving by homeowners fell much more than that by renters. Prices of houses, which the middle-aged are much more likely to own, were appreciating rapidly in the late 70's and early 80's.
If neither a preponderance of youth nor yuppie excesses caused the decline in saving during the 70's and 80's, middle age and newfound sobriety are not likely to raise it. Mr. McKelvey detects a number of trends that could discourage saving even more, among them the rising birth rate among women in their 30's and the leveling out of the percentage of women in the work force.
 
Spending on Diapers
 "The very generation that is supposed to stop buying too many BMW's may find itself spending money on diapers and day care instead of T-bills," he said.
The true culprit in the savings slump, Mr. Bosworth suggested, may be psychological. People operate with rules of thumb that are formed by critical experiences, like the Depression, he said. As the Depression has receded in memory, he added, the rule of frugality has gradually broken down.
Lawrence H. Summers, chief economist at the World Bank, said he believed that people might have less to worry about than they used to. Twenty years ago the rate of poverty among the elderly was twice that of younger Americans. Today it is lower. "My guess," he added, "is that many more people form a view about retirement by looking at whether their parents seem rich or poor than by looking at the report of the Social Security actuaries."

HEADLINE: Shift in Industrial Aid Is Urged

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
New York City would benefit by concentrating less on trying to retain existing manufacturing jobs, and instead focusing more support on emerging businesses, a report released yesterday by the office of Deputy Mayor Sally Hernandez-Pinero recommended.
The report's conclusions indicate that the city is considering recasting its economic development strategy. 
 It is not clear whether Ms. Hernandez-Pinero will accept all the recommendations. "We wanted this to serve as the factual underpinning for whatever we do in the future," said the Deputy Mayor, who heads the Office for Economic Development.
The report said that manufacturers benefit less than other companies from being in New York, making it harder to justify a general effort to retain them. Moreover, the report concluded, "None of the manufacturing industries forecast to grow rapidly at the national level in the 1990's have any meaningful presence in New York City."
 
'We Shouldn't Pull Our Hair Out'
 Instead of supporting companies and industries that have been around for decades and are struggling, the report suggests that the city focus on those that are new and emerging.
"The message is that we shouldn't pull our hair out of our heads whenever somebody leaves, because that's not necessarily the most important thing for the economy," Ms. Hernandez-Pinero said. She cited figures in the report showing that between 1976 and 1986, new businesses generated nearly 464,000 jobs. By contrast, companies that moved to New York City from elsewhere produced only 37,000 new jobs.

HEADLINE: Shifting the Risk;
Under Cuomo's Medicaid Plan, Albany Assumes the Burden of Curbing Costs

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
By proposing state assumption of Medicaid expenses, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is recommending not only a shift in costs, but, perhaps even more important, a shift in risk.
As outlined by the Governor, local governments would have to give up some of their tax revenues in a swap with the state. That is a trade that, under most circumstances they would greet with outrage. 
 But the rapidly escalating cost of Medicaid, compared with the slow growth in most tax revenues, makes the Governor's offer attractive to most municipalities these days. The state, in assuming the local share of Medicaid, would be assuming the full risk of future growth in Medicaid -- and the full responsibility for trying to restrain that growth.
Edwin L. Crawford, executive director of the New York State Association of Counties, said local officials want to pass along the cost of Medicaid for the same reason the state has resisted such a move. "In addition to being so expensive," he said, "it has this horrendous growth to it."
The Governor's Medicaid proposal is the centerpiece of a larger plan to help stimulate the New York City economy with bold construction projects and new jobs. To many politicians, the most significant aspect of the proposal is that it offers proof that someone is grappling with the city's problems at a time when they seem to be slipping out of control.
The proposed state assumption of Medicaid costs is certainly not an idea original to the Cuomo administration. But Mr. Cuomo is the first Governor to open a debate in Albany on the issue by formally proposing it. "This is something that every Governor knew needed to be done," said Meyer S. Frucher, a longtime adviser to Mr. Cuomo.
The high price of Medicaid in New York -- one of the few states in the country to require local governments to pay for part of the program -- has placed an enormous strain on municipal governments, most notably in New York City. But it is the tremendous escalation in Medicaid costs, even more than the cost itself, that has wreaked havoc on local budgets, prompting precipitous tax increases.
Over the last five years, Medicaid spending has grown 60 percent in New York. Last year, New York's program cost almost $12 billion, more than any other state's. Almost half this cost was picked up by the Federal Government; the rest was split between the state and local governments, with the state paying roughly 30 percent and the localities 20 percent.
 
Some of the Sales Tax
 Governor Cuomo has not revealed many details of the proposed shift, but he has made it clear that in return for the state's assuming the full cost of Medicaid it would expect local governments to hand over a portion of their tax revenues. In the case of counties like Nassau and Westchester, this would mean giving the state a portion of the county sales tax. In New York City, it would mean handing over either some of the city income tax or part of the sales tax.
Certainly it would be possible to arrange the swap so that when it took place -- most likely over the course of several years -- the additional taxes the state was taking in would equal the increased Medicaid costs it had assumed. But given the historic growth rate in Medicaid costs and the weakness of the state's income and sales taxes, the state's new costs would, over time, almost inevitably outstrip its new revenues.
In his address to business and civic leaders yesterday, the Governor portrayed the Medicaid swap as a measure intended to help New York City, something he has faced rising pressure to do. But the swap is more politically viable than most proposals to aid the city precisely because the city is not the only local government that it would help.
"It's hard to find a county that does not have significant cost growth in relation to their budget," said Assemblyman James Tallon, a Binghamton Democrat. "I think it is important that this is viewed as something that does not just benefit New York City."
 
Their Immediate Plight
 The benefits of the proposed swap for the city, which consumed almost 70 percent of the Medicaid dollars in the state last year, are clear. City officials have complained that the swap would not take place quickly enough to ease their immediate plight, but over time, the Governor has estimated that it would save the city $1 billion a year.
For counties with smaller Medicaid budgets, the advantages of the swap are less striking, but they are present nevertheless. In many rural counties, the growth rate for Medicaid costs rivals that of New York City, and the strain this growth places on small local budgets is proportionately grave.
If most local governments would benefit from a swap, then it follows that the state would lose. Indeed, Governor Cuomo estimates that the swap would leave the state with almost $2 billion a year in added Medicaid bills -- and that is if it is successful in containing the growth in Medicaid. These additional costs would inevitably translate into state tax increases or cuts in other programs.
Given these unpleasant inevitabilities, why should the Governor and the State Legislature be interested in a swap?
Those who advocate it, like Mr. Cuomo, argue that eliminating local governments from the Medicaid program will streamline its administration, making it easier and cheaper to run.
Advocates also argue that only by concentrating the responsibility for Medicaid with the state will it be possible to take the politically tricky steps necessary to cut costs. "It may be that a state-run system is something you need to really control costs," Mr. Tallon said.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST DIPLOMACY;
Excerpts From Bush's Address to General Assembly: For a 'Pax Universalis'

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 23

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's address today to the General Assembly:
My speech today will not sound like any you've heard from a President of the United States. I'm not going to dwell on the superpower competition that defined international politics for half a century. 
 Instead I will discuss the challenges of building peace and prosperity in a world leavened by the cold war's end and the resumption of history.
Communism held history captive for years, and it suspended ancient disputes and it suppressed ethnic rivalries, nationalist aspirations and old prejudices.
As it has dissolved, suspended hatreds have sprung to life. People who for years had been denied their pasts have begun searching for their own identities, often through peaceful and constructive means, occasionally through factionalism and bloodshed.
This revival of history ushers in a new era teeming with opportunities and perils. And let's begin by discussing the opportunities. First, history's renewal enables people to pursue their natural instincts for enterprise. Communism froze that progress until its failures became too much for even its defenders to bear.
And now citizens throughout the world have chosen enterprise over envy, personal responsibility over the enticements of the state, prosperity over the poverty of central planning.
 
Free Markets and Ideas
 The U.N. Charter encourages this adventure by pledging to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples. And I can think of no better way to fulfill this mission than to promote the free flow of goods and ideas.

 	 	 		. . .	 	By the same token, the world has learned that free markets provide levels of prosperity, growth and happiness that centrally planned economies can never offer. Even the most charitable estimates indicate that in recent years, the free world's economies have grown at twice the rate of the former Communist world. Growth does more than fill shelves. It permits every person to gain, not at the expense of others, but to the benefit of others. Prosperity encourages people to live as neighbors, not as predators. Economic growth can aid international relations in exactly the same way.
Many nations represented here are parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Uruguay Round, the latest in the postwar series of trade negotiations, offers hope to developing nations, many of which have been cruelly divided, cruelly deceived by the false promises of totalitarianism.
Here in this chamber, we hear about North-South problems. But free and open trade, including unfettered access to markets and credit, offer developing countries means of self-sufficiency and economic dignity. If the Uruguay Round should fail, a new wave of protectionism could destroy our hopes for a better future.

 	 	 		. . .	 	I cannot stress this enough. Economic progress will play a vital role in the new world. It supplies the soil in which democracy grows best. People everywhere seek government of and by the people, and they want to enjoy their inalienable rights to freedom and property and person.
Challenges to democracy have failed. Just last month, coup plotters in the Soviet Union tried to derail the forces of liberty and reform, but Soviet citizens refused to follow. Most of the actions in this chamber stood with the forces of reform led by Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin and against the coup plotters.
 
Democracy Flourishes
 The challenge facing the Soviet peoples now, that of building political systems based upon individual liberty, minority rights, democracy and free markets, mirrors every nation's responsibility for encouraging peaceful democratic reform.
But it also testifies to the extraordinary power of the democratic ideal. As democracy flourishes, so does the opportunity for a third historical breakthrough: international cooperation.
A year ago, the Soviet Union joined the United States and a host of other nations in defending a tiny country against aggression and opposing Saddam Hussein. For the very first time, on a matter of major importance, superpower competition was replaced with international cooperation.
The United Nations, in one of its finest moments, constructed a measured, principled, deliberate and courageous response to Saddam Hussein. It stood up to an outlaw who invaded Kuwait, who threatened many states within the region, who sought to set a menacing precedent for the post-cold-war world.
The coalition effort established a model for the collective settlement of disputes. Members set the goal -- the liberation of Kuwait -- and devised a courageous unified means of achieving that goal.
And now, for the first time, we have a real chance to fulfill the U.N. Charter's ambition of working to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and nations large and small to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. Those are the words from the Charter.
 
Nationalist Passions Flare
 We will not revive these ideals if we fail to acknowledge the challenge that the renewal of history presents. In Europe and Asia, nationalist passions have flared anew, challenging borders, training the fabric of international society.
At the same time, around the world many age-old conflicts still fester. You see signs of this, of this tumult right here. The United Nations has mounted more peacekeeping missions in the last 36 months than during its first 43 years.
And although we now seem mercifully liberated from the fear of nuclear holocaust, these smaller virulent conflicts should trouble us all. We must face this challenge squarely, first by pursuing the peaceful resolution of disputes now in progress.
Second, and more importantly, by trying to prevent others from erupting. No one here can promise that today's borders will remain fixed for all time, but we must strive to insure the peaceful negotiated settlement of border disputes.
We also must promote the cause of international harmony by addressing old feuds. We should take seriously the Charter's pledge to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors.
 
Repeal Racism Resolution
 U.N.G.A Resolution 3379, the so-called "Zionism is racism" resolution, mocks this pledge, and the principles upon which the United Nations was founded, and I call now for its repeal. Zionism is not a policy. It is the idea that led to the creation of a home for the Jewish people, to the state of Israel. And to equate Zionism with the intolerable sin of racism is to twist history and forget the terrible plight of Jews in World War II and indeed throughout history.
To equate Zionism with racism is to reject Israel itself, a member of good standing of the United Nations. This body cannot claim to seek peace and at the same time challenge Israel's right to exist. By repealing this resolution unconditionally, the United Nations will enhance its credibility and serve the cause of peace.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Some nations still deny their basic rights to the people, and too many voices cry out for freedom. For example, the people of Cuba suffer oppression at the hands of a dictator who hasn't gotten the word, the lone holdout in an otherwise democratic hemisphere, a man who hasn't adapted to a world that has no use for totalitarian tyranny.

 	 	 		. . .	 	In a world defined by change, we must be as firm in principle as we are flexible in our response to changing international conditions. That's especially true today of Iraq.
Six months after the passage of U.N. Security Council Resolution 687 and 688, Saddam continues to rebuild his weapons of mass destruction and subject the Iraqi people to brutal repression. Saddam's contempt for U.N. resolutions was first demonstrated back in August of 1990, and it continues even as I am speaking. His Government refuses to permit unconditional helicopter inspections and right now is refusing to allow U.N. inspectors to leave inspected premises with documents relating to an Iraqi nuclear weapons program.
 
Keep Sanctions in Place
 And it is the United States view that we must keep the United Nations sanctions in place as long as he remains in power, and this also shows that we cannot compromise for a moment in seeing that Iraq destroys all of its weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them, and we will not compromise.
This is not to say -- and let me be clear on this one -- that we should punish the Iraqi people. Let me repeat: Our argument has never been with the people of Iraq. It was and is with a brutal dictator whose arrogance dishonors the Iraqi people.
Security Council Resolution 706 created a responsible mechanism for sending humanitarian relief to innocent Iraqi citizens. We must put that mechanism to work. We must not abandon our principled stand against Saddam's aggression.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The resumption of history also permits the United Nations to resume the important business of promoting the values that I've discussed today. This body can serve as a vehicle through which willing parties can settle old disputes.
In the months to come, I look forward to working with Secretary General Perez de Cuellar and his successor as we pursue peace in such diverse and troubled lands as Afghanistan, Cambodia, Cyprus, El Salvador and the Western Sahara. The United Nations can encourage free-market development through its international lending and aid institutions. However, the United Nations should not dictate the particular forms of government that nations should adopt, but it can and should encourage the values upon which this organization was founded.
Together we should insist that nations seeking our acceptance meet standards of human decency. Where institutions of freedom have lain dormant, the United Nations can offer them new life. These institutions play a crucial role in our quest for a new world order, an order in which no nation must surrender one iota of its own sovereignty, an order characterized by the rule of law rather than the resort to force, the cooperative settlement of disputes rather than anarchy and bloodshed, and an unstinting belief in human rights.
And finally, you may wonder about America's role in the new world that I have described. Let me assure you, the United States has no intention of striving for a Pax Americana. However, we will remain engaged. We will not retreat and pull back into isolationism. We will offer friendship and leadership. And in short, we seek a Pax Universalis, built upon shared responsibilities and aspirations.

HEADLINE: After 2 Killings on L.I., a Search for Answers

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CARLE PLACE, L.I., Sept. 23

 BODY:
A day after an apparent argument between a security guard and five young men at the high school here ended with two of the men dead and three others injured, the people closest to the tragedy cannot agree on how things escalated the way they did.
To the distraught father of the 20-year-old security guard, who was charged with murder, his son's action was the inevitable response to an unbearable barrage of taunts and racial slurs. To the shocked parents of the victims, it was an eruption of violence beyond comprehension. 
 Here in this close-knit hamlet, where young people buy houses within blocks of their grandparents' homes and where no one remembers the last time someone was shot, or even mugged, residents are struggling to piece all the events together.
Some heard the shots, about 15 of them, fired at 2:30 A.M. Sunday in the parking lot of the high school, on a quiet suburban street in this mile-square community. Five men in their early 20's, who had graduated from school years earlier but continued to gather on weekend nights at the high school, had driven up in a 1982 yellow Cadillac, as they often did.
 
'There Was Some Involvement'
 By most accounts, the men, and others who frequented the school on weekends, had had a testy relationship with the security guard, John Padilla, ever since Mr. Padilla had begun working there two Saturdays earlier. While other guards had apparently allowed the men to congregate on school property after hours, Mr. Padilla had a strict policy of ordering them to leave. This made the men angry, said Detective Sgt. Robert Edwards of the Nassau County Police Department Homicide Squad.
"There was some involvement with these kids in the past," he said. "There may have been some eggs thrown on the defendant's car. There may have been some name-calling back and forth."
Two weeks before the incident, Sergeant Edwards said, the security guard had called the police to report that he was being harassed. But Albert Inserra, the superintendent of the Carle Place School District, said Mr. Padilla had never reported any trouble to him, as he was supposed to do. His log sheets for the first two Saturdays he worked, Mr. Inserra, said "all secure."
It is not certain what exactly happened between the guard and the men. But Mr. Padilla's father, who is also named John and is a 42-year-old electrician, said the young men had made the job miserable for his son, who had left New York City to make a new start for himself in the suburbs. When he was hired this summer by the H.S.C. Security Corporation, which patrols the schools here, the younger Mr. Padilla was on five years' probation for drug and weapons-possession convictions in New York City.
Mr. Padilla's father said that his son was hoping to put that behind him. With his wife, Nanny, and 6-month-old daughter, Christine, he had moved into a house in Brentwood. His father paid the rent and loaned him a black Audi, promising to buy him a car if he did well at work. "He wanted to prove to me he could hold on to a job," the elder Mr. Padilla said.
Speaking in an interview at Nassau County Police Headquarters, the elder Mr. Padilla said that on the two prior Saturdays, the men had thrown rocks and eggs at his son's car and had followed him home in their Cadillac, calling him names all the while. He had had to replace his son's windshield and car window, he said.
The men had used an ethnic epithet, he said, and added, " 'Puerto Rican, get out of here,' and he retaliated," the father said. "He was forced to do what he had to do out of desperation and fear."
But Robert Connor Sr., whose son, 23-year-old Robert Jr., was one of those killed, said it was the security guard who caused the trouble. Sitting in his small house not far from the school, surrounded by his grieving family, he said the guard had been harassing the men ever since he began working for the school district.
Mr. Connor said his son, who worked driving a coffee truck, had gone with his four friends to Little Italy on Saturday night before returning to Carle Place. The five, all of whom still lived with their parents, had grown up together and still spent much of their free time together, he said.
Sam Scotti, 23, who was wounded in the attack, lived across the street from the high school, and that was where he and others from the neighborhood gathered on weekends. "This is their home," said a neighbor, Samuel P. Caliendo. "The kids have been hanging out there since they were 12, 13 years old, and we've never had a problem."
Mr. Connor and Frank Scotti, Sam Scotti's father, both contended that on Sunday morning, Mr. Padilla had gotten into his car and chased the men, also in their car, into the high school parking lot. It was there that he pulled a 9-millimeter semiautomatic weapon out of his car, the police said, and opened fire.
The barrage killed Robert Connor Jr. and Dean Rose, 21, who was unemployed and lived in nearby Westbury. It wounded Sam Scotti, a landscaper; Peter Pinto, 21, a part-time roofer and carpenter, and Michael Russo, 22, a weightlifter and housepainter. Mr. Pinto was listed in critical condition at Nassau County Medical Center today, while Mr. Scotti and Mr. Russo were listed in critical condition at Winthrop-University Hospital.
The security guard pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and attempted murder in First District Court in Hempstead today and was held without bail.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Runs Against Florio, Who's Not Running

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 23

 BODY:
With control of both houses of the New Jersey Legislature at stake in November, Republicans are running hard against a man who is not on the ballot -- Gov. Jim Florio. Democrats, if not openly running away from the Governor, do not want to run with him.
"Our strategy is quite simply to focus voter attention on the disastrous record of the Democrats and of Jim Florio," said Jeffrey Michaels, executive director of the Republican State Committee. "What we are doing in targeted districts is educating voters for the first time that the incumbent Democrats are responsible, telling them that Jim Florio could not have done it alone. They did it together." 
 Democrats concede that they have an unpopular Governor to contend with but question the impact that will have in November.
"Saying all Democrats are bums because Florio is will have only limited success," said Steven DeMicco, executive director of the Democratic State Committee.
 
Established Political Jargon
 Nonetheless, "the Florio factor" is already established political jargon in New Jersey, an integral part of discussions about races like the one in the 13th Legislative District in Monmouth and Middlesex Counties. Joseph Kyrillos, the Republican Assemblyman who is trying to take away the Senate seat of Jim Phillips, mentions the Governor and "the Florio tax plan" no fewer than four times in a 60-second radio commercial, and Mr. Phillips not once.
Mr. Phillips has countered by posing with a life-size cutout of Mr. Florio, which he dramatically shoves away, calling on his opponent to also "push aside Governor Florio as an issue in this race for State Senate."
The Governor's popularity plummeted when the Legislature adopted a budget that included a record $2.8 billion tax increase in June 1990, six months after Mr. Florio took office after a campaign in which he repeatedly assured voters that he did not think a tax increase would be necessary.
The extent of his decline in popularity was underscored in the latest Star-Ledger/Eagleton poll, which was released on Sunday. In that poll, 23 percent of the respondents gave the Governor an "excellent" (3 percent) or "good" (20 percent) rating, while 73 percent rated him "only fair" (39 percent) or "poor" (34 percent). The telephone survey of 800 New Jerseyans was conducted from Sept. 11 to 19 and has a sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
The poll suggested that about 2 million property tax rebate checks ranging up to $500 apparently did little to ease resentment over the tax increase. Neither did two other Florio programs: increased aid to local governments and school districts intended to halt or reverse soaring property taxes and an automobile insurance restructuring law intended to reduce premiums for most drivers.
Altogether, the polls could bode ill for Democratic legislators if the Republicans succeed in tying them to the Governor and his policies.
 
Setting Stage for Challenge
 The state and national Republican Party hopes to take advantage of Mr. Florio's poor showing to capture the Legislature, which would help offset the loss of the governorship, held by Thomas H. Kean for eight years. They also hope to embarrass Mr. Florio in the process, setting the stage for a strong Republican challenge in 1993.
To help in that effort, President Bush will be host at a fund-raiser on Tuesday at the Ramada Renaissance in East Brunswick to benefit Republican legislative candidates. A central theme at the event, which is expected to raise $800,000, will be "the Florio-Democrat tax and spend agenda." said Chuck Haytaian, the Assembly Republican minority leader.
Several other prominent Republicans, including Vice President Dan Quayle, John H. Sununu, the White House Chief of Staff, and Clayton K. Yeutter, the Republican National Committee chairman, have already visited the state in the last several months to help bolster Republican chances.
In the 19th Legislative District, including the Middlesex County municipalities of Perth Amboy, Sayreville and Woodbridge, the Republican challenger, Randall Corman, a Sayreville Council member, and the Republican committee are trying to portray Senator Laurence S. Weiss of Woodbridge, a four-term Democrat, as a leading architect of the Florio tax program.
Similarly, in the 10th District in Ocean County, Republicans are using the Florio issue against two Democrats, the incumbent Assemblywoman, Marlene Lynch Ford, and John Paul Doyle, an Assemblyman trying to step up to the Senate. Both voted for the tax package, but Ms. Ford was also the architect of the Homestead Tax Relief Act in 1985, which led to the largest property tax reduction in state history.
 
Another Problem
 The situation in the 10th District underscores another problem faced by Democrats: the retirement of several senior officeholders.
In the 10th, the former Senate President, John F. Russo of Dover Township, is not seeking re-election. Mr. Russo, who served five terms and rivaled governors in power, is one of four leading Democratic Senators whose departure will strip the party of incumbency power in their districts and, to an extent, reduce the party's fund-raising ability.
The others are Richard Van Wagner of Monmouth, who served five terms in the Assembly and two in the Senate; Daniel J. Dalton of Camden, the Democratic majority leader, and Carmen A. Orechio of Nutley, who served five terms and was a Democratic leader. Mr. Nutley lost his seat in redistricting. Another Democratic incumbent Senator, Thomas Paterniti of Edison, lost a primary race in which he spent $200,000, in part because he raised property taxes while Mayor of Edison.
Retirements also hurt Democrats in the Assembly, where five incumbents chose not to run. They are Edward H. Salmon of Ocean City, Joseph D. Patero of Manville, David C. Schwartz of New Brunswick, Frank M. Pelly of North Brunswick and James E. McGreevey of Woodbridge.
Only one Republican, former Assembly Speaker Chuck Hardwick of Westfield, decided not to run again.
 
More Level Playing Field
 The retirements, along with a stagnant economy, have created a more level playing field in several races.
All 40 seats in the Senate and all 80 Assembly seats are at stake in the November election.
If they gain control, the Republicans pledge to roll back the one-cent increase in the state sales tax that was imposed last year and to review increases in the income tax.
Assembly Speaker Joseph V. Doria Jr., who initiated the Florio legislative program, said the Republican call for a rollback of the sales tax increase "fails to provide a satisfactory answer to how the revenue will be made up."
"The Republicans seem to believe relief from 1 percent worth of sales tax will send residents into a spending frenzy," Mr. Doria said. "Don't Republican leaders understand that people would have to spend nearly $11 billion to make the sales tax revenue whole? Do the Republicans actually believe New Jerseyans have $11 billion in disposable income?"
