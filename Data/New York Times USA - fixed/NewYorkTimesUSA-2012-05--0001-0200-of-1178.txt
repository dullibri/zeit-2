HEADLINE: What's On Today

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
1 P.M. (BBC America) JAMIE'S MEALS IN MINUTES In this new cooking series Jamie Oliver, above, continues his mission to improve people's lives through food and to counter obesity by offering instruction on cooking from scratch. ''No Kitchen Required,'' at 10, follows Michael Psilakis, Madison Cowan and Kayne Raymond as these chefs are dropped by helicopter on a seaside bluff in Hawaii, where they are treated to a luau and a lesson in culinary traditions. Then it's time for them to find ingredients -- hunting for wild boar, casting fishing nets and spearing octopus -- before creating a meal in an earth oven known as an imu. 
2 P.M. (Cinemax) MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD (2003) In Peter Weir's adaptation of two novels by Patrick O'Brian, Russell Crowe stars as Capt. Jack Aubrey, the commander of a British frigate whose crew must battle a faster, larger French vessel during the Napoleonic wars. Paul Bettany is Stephen Maturin, the ship's surgeon and the sensitive foil to his fierce friend Aubrey. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said that the film ''makes you wish Napoleon were still around, so we -- that is, I mean, the British Empire -- could beat him all over again.''
3:30 P.M. (HBO) CINEMA VERITE (2011) In 1973 members of the Loud family became a sensation when they welcomed a camera crew into their home in Santa Barbara, Calif., opening up their lives to public scrutiny and helping to create a genre: reality television. Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini recreate the drama -- the philandering, the marital discord, the invasion of privacy and questionable ethics -- with a cast that includes Diane Lane as Pat Loud; Tim Robbins as her husband, Bill; and Thomas Dekker as Lance Loud, their gay son. James Gandolfini plays Craig Gilbert, the producer who, inspired by the anthropologist Margaret Mead, devised the series ''An American Family,'' which featured the Louds and was shown on PBS. Writing in The New York Times, Alessandra Stanley called the film ''a clever, beautifully made but somehow underwhelming re-enactment of the breakup of the Loud marriage, on camera and off.''
8 P.M. (NBC) THE BIGGEST LOSER The Season 13 contestants reunite for one last weigh-in, with the previously eliminated contestants competing for the $100,000 ''at home'' prize, and the three finalists going after $250,000 and the title.
8:30 P.M. (TV5Monde) BOB LE FLAMBEUR (1956) In this Jean-Pierre Melville film, Roger Duchesne, below, plays Bob Montagne, a gambler who stakes everything on a daring plan to rob a casino. '' 'Bob le Flambeur' is a very funny, jaunty movie, and one can understand why Jean-Luc Godard, who was to make 'Breathless' just three years later, admired it so much,'' Vincent Canby wrote in The Times when reviewing it at a festival in 1981. ''Its realism is not the reality of life, but of the kind of movies that give shape to the disordered lives of the people who watch movies.''
9 P.M. (13, 49) MONEY, POWER AND WALL STREET In Part 2 of this ''Frontline'' investigation into the efforts in Washington and on Wall Street to rescue the economy, Martin Smith examines the inner workings of high finance and the effects of the reckless lending and borrowing on the world at large.
10:30 P.M. (21) LONG ISLAND BUSINESS REPORT Jim Paymar examines economic trends on Long Island, interviewing Kevin Law, president and chief executive of the Long Island Association; Lawrence Levy, executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University; and Nancy Rauch Douzinas, president of the Rauch Foundation, which helps disadvantaged children.
MIDNIGHT (Flix) ROGER DODGER (2002) Campbell Scott plays Roger Swanson, a slick-talking lothario, and Jesse Eisenberg is his 16-year-old nephew, Nick, who shows up at his uncle's New York office unannounced with the excuse that he has come to visit the Columbia campus. An evening of drunken carousing ensues. Nick craves sexual experience, and who better to tutor him on picking up women than his uncle? Writing in The Times, Stephen Holden described the role of the oily Roger as ''a small coup for Mr. Scott, who is normally the quintessence of earnest sincerity on the screen.'' But it is Mr. Eisenberg who steals the show. (Earlier, at 8:45 a.m., ''The Social Network,'' in which he portrays Mark Zuckerberg, will be on Starz.) ''The young actor's portrayal of an innocent but adventurous high school student finds a lovely balance between crude adolescent avidity and an inner sweetness that contradicts everything Roger stands for,'' Mr. Holden wrote.

HEADLINE: Spending at Humana Trims Profit

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Humana Inc. said Monday that its first-quarter profit fell 21 percent as the health insurer paid out more in claims and increased spending to handle expected growth in its lucrative Medicare Advantage membership. 
The company, based in Louisville, nudged up its earnings expectations for the full year to a range of $7.55 to $7.75 a share, from its previous forecast of $7.50 to $7.70 a share.
But the first-quarter results and the increased forecast were short of Wall Street expectations. The company's shares fell 8.1 percent, dropping $7.14 to $80.68.
For the three months ended March 31, Humana reported net income of $248 million, or $1.49 a share, down from $315 million, or $1.86 a share, in the same period last year. Revenue rose 11 percent to $10.2 billion.
Wall Street analysts expected earnings of $1.52 a share on revenue of $10.14 billion.
Humana cited favorable claims trends from previous periods in raising its forecast. In essence, Humana set aside more money in previous quarters than was needed to pay claims during a slowdown in the use of health care services by consumers who felt pinched during the recession.

HEADLINE: California Chosen as Home for Computing Institute

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
BERKELEY, Calif. -- The Simons Foundation, which specializes in science and math research, has chosen the University of California, Berkeley, as host for an ambitious new center for computer science, the university plans to announce on Tuesday.
The foundation's $60 million grant to establish the center, to be called the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at U.C. Berkeley, underscores the growing influence of computer science on the physical and social sciences. An interdisciplinary array of scientists will explore the mathematical foundations of computer science and attack problems in fields as diverse as health care, astrophysics, genetics and economics.
''We've been talking to astronomers, climate scientists, fluid mechanics people, quantum physicists and cognitive scientists,'' said Richard M. Karp, a Berkeley computer scientist who will be the institute's director. 
Part science and part engineering, computer science has long been viewed warily by scientists in other disciplines. But that is changing, not only because the computer has become the standard scientific instrument but also because ''computational thinking'' offers new ways to analyze the vast amounts of data now accessible to scientists. This new approach -- what researchers call the ''algorithmic'' or ''computational'' lens -- is transforming science in much the way the microscope and telescope did. When computer scientists train their sights on other disciplines, said Christos H. Papadimitriou, a Berkeley computer scientist who will help manage the institute, ''truths come out that wouldn't have come out otherwise.''
Moreover, the flood of experimental results generated by inexpensive sensors, combined with the Internet's ubiquitous connectivity, is threatening to drown scientists in vast data sets often called ''big data.''
''I do think there is this idea that big data is happening,'' said Peter Norvig, Google's director of research. ''Now there is more acceptance pencil and paper alone won't solve all of our problems.''
Tuesday's announcement is part of a broader trend toward expanding support for research in computational theory. The Rafik B. Hariri Institute for Computing and Computational Science and Engineering was created last fall at Boston University to turn a computational lens on an array of disciplines. (It is named for the former Lebanese prime minister who was assassinated in 2005; he was also a former trustee of the university.)
''It's analytics with big data, it's the ability to compute and analyze in massive parallel architectures,'' said Jeannette M. Wing, head of the computer science department at Carnegie Mellon University. ''All the science and engineering disciplines realize this is part of the future.''
Dr. Karp, the Simons Institute's new director, cited the example of the Berkeley cosmologist Joshua Bloom, who has automated the process of identifying interesting events in the night sky. Each evening the system must choose from millions of options.
''What should we track tomorrow?'' Dr. Karp said. ''There is a continually changing decision process. It's an online computation process par excellence.''
The institute will not be a scientific computing center, said Alistair Sinclair, a Berkeley computer scientist who will serve as its associate director. ''An astronomer won't come along with data and we all sit down and create algorithms to process his data,'' he said. ''It goes deeper than that. The astronomer will come and talk about the nature of his problems.''
The institute will have about 70 visiting researchers at any one time, including faculty members, postdoctoral researchers and graduate students. It will begin operating later this year and be fully operational in 2013.
The Simons Foundation, created by the hedge fund billionaire and philanthropist James H. Simons, has given hundreds of millions of dollars for research in autism, math and physical sciences, and life sciences -- and, last year, $150 million from both the organization and its founders to the State University at Stony Brook on Long Island.
Dr. Simons, who earned his doctorate in mathematics at Berkeley, was chairman of the math department at Stony Brook before creating Renaissance Technologies, a private investment firm. Forbes magazine estimates his current worth at $10.6 billion.

HEADLINE: S.&P. Posts Monthly Loss, Its First Since November

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index posted its first monthly decline since November on Monday, as stocks slipped on signs the American economy might be slowing and as a recession in Spain highlighted risks in the euro zone. 
Despite the decline, the picture was not overwhelmingly negative. The S.& P. 500 closed out April with a decline of 0.8 percent, after four consecutive days of gains last week helped the index pare much steeper losses.
Still, a recent string of economic data suggests the economy may slow in the summer and that has caused the market to stall just shy of the four-year highs reached earlier in the month. The latest evidence of sluggish growth came Monday in reports showing a slowdown in consumer spending in March and a sharper-than-expected decline in Midwestern business activity in April.
''We had such a strong first quarter, and we've lost that momentum in the last two weeks,'' said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive at Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Okla. The data ''reinforces the ominous tone on Wall Street, along with the fears we have about Europe.''
Spain reported Monday that its economy contracted in the first quarter, pulling the country into recession as deep government spending cuts to reduce a huge budget deficit and troubles in its banking sector most likely delayed any return to growth. Though expected, the news highlighted the trouble the world economy faces.
Banks were among the larger decliners after Standard & Poor's cut the credit ratings of 11 Spanish banks on Monday. The S.& P. 500 financial sector index fell 0.6 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 14.68 points, or 0.11 percent, to 13,213.63. The S.& P. 500-stock index fell 5.45 points, or 0.39 percent, to 1,397.91. The Nasdaq composite index lost 22.84 points, or 0.74 percent, to 3,046.36.
Many investors are still worried about the potential for a pullback heading into the seasonally weak period for stocks that starts in May, especially if it is accompanied by a slowing economy and more problems in Europe.
''In equities, we stepped back to neutral several weeks ago,'' analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a research note. ''Our general view is that the U.S. seems to be slowing -- though how much and for how long is an open question -- while equity market domestic growth views remain elevated.''
The 10-year Treasury note rose 5/32, to 100 23/32. The yield fell to 1.92 percent, from 1.94 percent Friday.

HEADLINE: New York on $15,000 a Year

 BODY:
Imagine trying to survive in New York City on less than $15,000 a year. That is what a person making the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour earns for a full-time job. It's time to do something about that. 
At legislative hearings across the state in recent days, New Yorkers have talked about how they struggle to survive on the minimum pay. A woman said she routinely waits until after 5 p.m. to buy end-of-day bread for her family. A health care worker has to borrow money for her own doctor's co-payment. A waiter survives on his restaurant's leftovers. A woman juggles two full-time minimum wage jobs for a 70-hour workweek.
State legislators should approve a bill by the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, that would raise the minimum wage in the state to at least $8.50 per hour in 2013 with annual inflation adjustments after that. The increase would raise the income of more than 880,000 workers, who would put virtually all the money right back into the economy.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said he approves of an increase in the minimum wage -- in principle. Backing Mr. Silver's bill would show that he means it.
This should be an easy sell. Polls show that more than 70 percent of New Yorkers say the nation's minimum wage (also $7.25 an hour) is too low. The State Senate's Republican leader, Dean Skelos, keeps arguing mistakenly that any increase would kill jobs. Mr. Skelos may be softening, hinting recently that he might even allow the issue to come to a vote. Legislators from both parties would almost certainly support this measure if it could get around Mr. Skelos and make it to the Senate floor.
The proposed increase is by no means outsized. Washington State recently went to $9.04 per hour, and Connecticut's minimum is $8.25. In his testimony this month to the Assembly Labor Committee, James Parrott of the Fiscal Policy Institute reminded legislators that it has been more than 30 years since a worker paid the minimum wage in New York could lift a family of three above the poverty line. Raising the minimum to $8.50 an hour would not end poverty in New York, but it would make a difference for nearly a million people.
Congress should increase the $7.25 minimum nationally and not just leave it to states. And a statewide increase should not affect the New York City Council's efforts to get higher wages for workers in the city.

HEADLINE: The Economics of Meetings

BYLINE: By MARTHA C. WHITE

 BODY:
Meeting and conference planners had plenty to say about the General Services Administration's lavish 2010 conference in Las Vegas, where guests were served $5 mini-Monte Cristo sandwiches and shrimp that cost $4 apiece. But unlike members of Congress, they argued that the hors d'oeuvres were among the few things that were properly priced.
Conference planning has its own opaque economics, which meeting experts say are poorly understood. 
''There's a lot of give and take that goes into negotiation,'' said Jonathan Howe, a lawyer who works with conference organizers on their event contracts.
Advocates of the process say it allows a seasoned negotiator to get a better deal. The G.S.A. would seem to fit the definition of an experienced bargainer, since its responsibilities include managing real estate for the government and setting the rules and daily spending allowances -- per diems -- on hotels and food for traveling federal government employees.
''My first thought was, 'Doesn't the G.S.A. know better, out of everyone?' '' said Teri Anticevich, owner of a meeting planning company that works with government clients.
The organizers of most meetings held at hotels in the United States do not pay for the meeting space their groups use. But the cost of this ''free'' space does not go away, said Patti Shock, a professor at the William F. Harrah College of Hotel Administration at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. The hotel still has to pay operating costs. Those expenses tend to get funneled into the cost of meals, coffee breaks and other services, Ms. Shock said.
To those outside the process, though, the listed costs for the food can seem high. In his report on the G.S.A.'s profligate spending at the Las Vegas conference, the agency's inspector general noted, ''G.S.A. also paid $30,207.60 -- or roughly $95 per person -- for the closing reception and dinner.''
''It's very easy to attack how lavish the meeting is by talking about the names of the food items,'' said Steven Rudner, a lawyer who represents hotels in contract negotiations and disputes. The real financial issues, he said, hide in the fine print of contracts.
Planning government meetings can be more complicated than private sector meetings because organizers have to work within per diems. But in the case of the G.S.A. conference, the inspector general's report details what seems to be an elaborate method to circumvent these spending limits.
Mr. Rudner argued that the current system was too vulnerable to manipulation. ''The spirit of the government regulations has been lost in the maze,'' Mr. Rudner said. The system, he said, ''invites abuse.''
The circuitous method of pricing and negotiating that is common in the United States is not the norm everywhere. In Europe, for instance, groups generally pay for meeting space.
The roots for these divergent processes go back nearly a century, according to Joe Goldblatt, professor and executive director of the International Center for the Study of Planned Events at Queen Margaret University, in Edinburgh, Scotland. In the United States, hotels were built with meeting space. In the second half of the 20th century, cities began building municipal convention sites, often making the space available below cost to attract out-of-town conventions that would bring in hotel, dining and tax revenue. To compete, hotels had to offer their space for little or nothing, then figure out a way to recoup the loss.
By contrast, Mr. Goldblatt said hotels in Europe developed without meeting space and European trade show halls tend to be for-profit, which eliminates the competitive pressure from publicly financed sites.
After all the bad publicity, the G.S.A.'s acting director, Daniel M. Tangherlini, announced that 35 of the agency's scheduled conferences had been canceled, which he said would save American taxpayers nearly a million dollars. Other federal agencies, according to Charles S. Sadler, executive director and chief executive of the Society of Government Meeting Professionals, also canceled sessions after the G.S.A. scandal, including the Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department.
But, it turns out, canceling conferences is not a simple cost-cutting move. Mr. Rudner said he was representing five hotels that held contracts to host federal conferences that were canceled. ''Based on my experience and sense of how they'll turn out, we'll probably recover between $600,000 to $750,000,'' he said.
Mr. Sadler said that if the organizers of government conferences go through a proper procurement process, there are no cancellation fees.
That may be a big ''if.'' In his report, the inspector general noted that in the original agreement the planner signed with the M Resort Spa Casino for the 2010 conference, ''That agreement required G.S.A. to pay a $50,000 fee if the event were canceled.''
A G.S.A. spokesman said that the agency did factor cancellation costs into its estimate of $1 million in savings and characterized the expense as minimal. He said he did not expect any litigation as a result of the cancellations.
The M Resort declined to comment on any issue related to the 2010 conference.
After the publicity about the G.S.A. conference, the Senate and House gave preliminary approval last week to legislation that would limit government travel spending and require more public disclosures of those expenses.
Ms. Anticevich, the meeting company owner, was among several conference professionals who said they feared the G.S.A. event had given their business a black eye. ''Even the people on the staff didn't know how to negotiate a proper contract,'' Ms. Anticevich said. ''It was kind of a mess from the get-go.''

HEADLINE: The Revolution Will Be Minimized

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL. 
E-mail: powellm@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The City Council passed a small so-called living wage bill on Monday, and the accompanying language, in classic New York style, was gloriously excessive.
The measure, Speaker Christine C. Quinn and her Council and labor allies proclaimed, would put in place the most extensive, most ambitious, ''most impactful'' (a leader in 2012's ugliest adjective of the year contest) living wage law in the country.
As revolutions go, however, this bill falls short of the Bolsheviks' storming the Winter Palace. 
Ms. Quinn spent months trimming and cutting the bill down to the size of a hat box. In the end, 500 workers in city-subsidized projects of a certain size under certain conditions in certain places will gain the right to make $10 an hour plus health benefits, or $11.50 an hour without.
Greg David, a business-friendly columnist at Crain's New York, took note of Ms. Quinn's handiwork and did the math: The bill, he noted, would affect 0.013 percent of the jobs in the city.
It's to take nothing away from those lucky New Yorkers to note that this is one of those moments in which symbolism and subtext trump text.
For Ms. Quinn -- who stalked away from a celebratory rally on the steps of City Hall because she proclaimed herself outraged that a demonstrator, in something closer to a mutter than a yell, said ''Pharaoh Bloomberg'' -- the victory is considerable. She champions a bill she neutered, and this all-but-declared mayoral candidate takes a salute from labor leaders on her left side.
Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, claims a victory, which sets him apart from the otherwise moribund grouping known as the city's labor leadership. He pulled together a sometimes unruly coalition. But his claims that the bill is the nation's most far-reaching measure sound far-fetched. Boston and Los Angeles have ordinances that encompass far more workers. And San Francisco's minimum wage, covering all of its workers, now stands at $10.24.
New York's bill carries carefully devised exemptions, not the least for development on Midtown's western flank. So the bill will apply, say, to deepest Queens but spares the vastly more profitable acreage in Midtown.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg spent months humming bars from ''Back in the U.S.S.R.'' This reasonably subtle plutocrat appears to lose his bearings entirely on this subject. He warned that a cloud of Soviet-style centralism would descend upon the world's financial capital. He has vowed a veto, and a court battle. ''If you think about it, the last time we really had a big, managed economy was the U.S.S.R., and that didn't work out so well,'' he said.
If you think about it, very little about this makes sense. The mayor, after all, has walked this path. Early in his first term, he signed a provision that extended a living wage to 50,000 home health care workers and 9,000 child care workers.
This bill shines a light on New York City's curious subsidized economy, in which some corporations hit the tax-cut daily double for no particular strategic reason other than that some other state casts a covetous eye at them. So Fresh Direct gets a $120 million tax subsidy for what still appears to be a modestly profitable business. (The mayor's proposed tech campus on Roosevelt Island, in fairness, seems a far better example of carefully targeted city subsidies, the difference perhaps between thinking and reacting.)
Business leaders grumble about the measure, although most agree that it would cost them but marginally.
The Lend Lease fiasco that was disclosed by prosecutors last week, meanwhile, points to where business and Mr. Bloomberg might far more profitably concentrate their fire: Construction unions routinely demand no-show jobs, and overtime for imaginary hours. And some minority contracting firms take cuts of lucrative public contracts, for very little work in return.
In the end, you can't help wondering if all of this cacophonous debate and battle might have gone more productively toward raising the state's minimum wage, which sits at a rock-bottom $7.25 an hour. The state's unemployment benefits are also far lower than in, say, New Jersey.
''We do not want a city for the very, very rich with enclaves for the very poor,'' the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, said. In a city where less than 1 percent of the population earns more than 40 percent of the income, this is no doubt a problem. Less clear is whether giving raises to 500 workers a year much turns the dial.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Rose At a Slower Pace in March

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans increased their spending more slowly in March, suggesting that some people were worried that their paychecks were not growing fast enough.
The Commerce Department said Monday that consumer spending increased just 0.3 percent in March after a 0.9 percent gain in February. 
Personal income grew 0.4 percent following a 0.3 percent gain in February. But after-tax income when adjusted for inflation increased just 0.2 percent in March. The gain followed two months of declines.
Consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic growth, rose 2.9 percent in the January-to-March quarter -- the fastest pace in more than a year. The increase was a bright spot in an otherwise weak first quarter for economic growth.
But Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics, noted that stronger spending in January and February drove the quarterly increase. And consumers spent more while saving less, which suggests they cannot sustain their spending pace without higher pay.
''Real incomes will need to grow at a faster rate to prevent consumption growth from slowing,'' Mr. Dales said. He noted that Friday's report on April hiring was a crucial sign of where the economy was headed.
The government reported Friday that the overall economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the January-to-March quarter. That is down from 3 percent annual growth in the October-to-December period. The weakness mainly reflected government budget-cutting and weaker business investment.
In March, consumers spent 0.9 percent more on nondurable goods, like clothing. Spending on durable goods, like cars and appliances, fell 0.3 percent.
An inflation gauge tied to consumer spending rose a modest 0.2 percent in March. Over the last 12 months, the index is up 2.1 percent, just above the Federal Reserve's 2 percent inflation target
Some economists worry consumers cannot keep spending as freely as they did in the first three months of this year without bigger pay raises. After-tax income rose just 0.6 percent in the first three months compared with a year earlier. That was the smallest pay increase in two years.
The savings rate crept up to 3.8 percent in March, after dropping to a 30-month low of 3.7 percent of after-tax income in February.
In a separate report on Monday, the Institute for Supply Management said its business activity index for Chicago and the Midwest dropped to 56.2 in April, its lowest level in more than two years. This was the index's second decline in two months.
A healthy job market could reinvigorate consumers. But the economy created just 120,000 jobs -- half the pace of the previous three months.
Economists forecast that employers added 163,000 jobs in April, slightly better than March's figures but below the pace from December through February.
A positive change since the winter was that gas prices appear to have peaked. That would give consumers more money to spend elsewhere.

PERSON: Fred Hakim 

HEADLINE: Fred Hakim, 83, Times Sq. Hot-Dog Vendor

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

 BODY:
Fred Hakim's family owned a hole-in-the-wall hot-dog counter in Times Square that was the last of its kind when New York decided to revitalize the area in the 1990s by condemning dozens of establishments like it. It was a seven-seat, 250-square-foot piece of Edward Hopper streetscape at 229-31 West 42nd Street, which Mr. Hakim's father had opened in 1941 and wryly named the Grand Luncheonette.
Mr. Hakim (pronounced HAY-kim) tried to keep the place open as a sort of living museum of the golden age of hawkers and honky-tonks in Times Square. But the city had other ideas, and after a two-year fight, he was evicted on Oct. 19, 1997. 
He died on April 25 at age 83.
Mr. Hakim seemed stumped by the economics of the Times Square redevelopment. In conversations with family members, and in interviews with the many reporters who crowded his joint in its last days, he often asked, ''Where are the people who just want a hot dog and a knish?''
Working for his father from age 13, Mr. Hakim was witness to a New Yorker's version of the history of the world. From the counter, he saw bobby-soxers rounding the corner to swoon over Frank Sinatra at the Paramount. He watched the crowds flood the street like a dam burst on V-E Day -- May 8, 1945 -- which also marked the end of the wartime brownout, when the lights in Times Square -- the billboards, the marquees, the windows in every building that had been dark for three years -- blazed once again.
He met a world of shoeshine men, longshoremen, sailors, drug dealers, prostitutes and policemen in the gritty years. ''He called it a symbiotic relationship,'' his son Mark said. ''You depended on each other, and no one was in anybody's business.''
Unlike his father, who had owned several hot-dog counters in Times Square at various times, Fred Hakim never fully depended on the Grand Luncheonette for his living. He worked there seven days a week, sometimes 20 hours on a weekend, but he also taught physical education and coached the handball team at Murry Bergtraum High School in Lower Manhattan.
Still, though Mr. Hakim liked teaching, the luncheonette was his calling. ''He loved the people there,'' his son said. ''The regular people, the shady people with rolls of dollar bills they peeled off. They were all his friends.''
Peter Sillen, an independent filmmaker, made a short documentary about the Grand Luncheonette in 1997, casting it as an emblem of the larger battle, since lost, to preserve some of the earthy character of Times Square.
Mr. Hakim comes across in the film as gentle (''Be right with you, young man''), authoritative (''Hot dogs, hot dogs! Git y'hot dogs hee-ah!'') and wise (''A knish? It's potatoes,'' he explains to an off-camera customer. ''Potatoes inside, outside, every side'').
Fred Hakim was born on Aug. 19, 1928 in the Bronx, one of three children of Albert and Luna Hakim. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees in education from the City University of New York.
Besides his son Mark, Mr. Hakim is survived by his wife, Jane; three other children, Adam, Glenn and Lisa Hakim; a sister, Ethel Matarasso; a brother, Michael; and three grandchildren.
Mr. Hakim lamented the closing of the Grand Luncheonette, but it turned out to be one of the luckiest days of his life.
If not for the eviction, he told his family and friends, he would most likely have been behind the counter when the building collapsed less than six weeks later, burying the luncheonette under tons of rubble. Demolition work next door, and a bit of wind, were cited as the probable causes.
''He used to say what a blessing it was,'' Mark Hakim said. ''Being made to close the business at 69'' -- Mr. Hakim's father, Albert, had worked into his 80s -- ''was very hard for him. He hoped to work till he was 90. But losing that fight was the best thing he ever did.''

HEADLINE: Veterans Need Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Does the V.A. Get It?'' (editorial, April 25): 
Along with hiring more psychiatrists to provide mental therapy for veterans, the Department of Veterans Affairs should also hire a significant array of employment specialists.
I can say from my own experience that there is a causal link between veterans' chronic unemployment and post-traumatic stress. The feelings of worthlessness for the thousands of veteran job candidates who send out hundreds of resumes to a numbing silence and no interviews creates an emotional hopelessness tied to economic helplessness.
Many of the 400-plus unemployed veterans I have interviewed personally have been unemployed for up to two years. They tell us that the interview with Veterans Across America is their last stop; they are considering suicide.
The symptoms of mental anguish persist even after the veteran secures a job. Everyone looks at job creation and few realize that there's a huge retention problem; a large percentage of veterans leave their jobs in the first year of employment.
Mental counseling has not been available to veterans in the pre- or post-employment cycle. The V.A. needs to establish a veterans' job lifeline to stem the tide of veterans leaving the work force.

HEADLINE: Abuse of Opiates Soars in Pregnant Women

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

 BODY:
The fast-growing abuse of prescription drugs has reached maternity wards in hospitals across the country, with the number of pregnant women addicted to opiate drugs -- and the number of babies born experiencing withdrawal symptoms -- rising sharply over the last decade.
A new study in The Journal of the American Medical Association has quantified the growth of the problem for the first time, as well as the increase in the costs of treating these newborns. 
The study estimated that every hour a baby is born in the United States with symptoms of withdrawal from opiates -- roughly 13,500 babies a year. The condition, known as neonatal abstinence syndrome, can cause seizures, breathing problems, dehydration, difficulty feeding, tremors and irritability. Many infants are hospitalized for several weeks while doctors treat them with methadone or morphine to gradually wean them from their dependence on the drugs that their mothers used.
''The incidence has gone crazy and I think it has the potential to become a national or international issue,'' said Marie J. Hayes, a clinical neuroscientist at the University of Maine, and an author of an editorial accompanying the study. ''People who previously might not have used heroin or the needle are more likely to use prescription opiates.''
It is unclear whether babies exposed to opiates in the womb will experience long-term consequences. In the 1980s, there was alarm over whether babies born to cocaine-addicted mothers would suffer developmental problems or other damaging effects, but studies later showed that such problems were far from certain and much more likely if the child had to contend with economic hardship, family instability, poor education and other factors.
The new study looked at two large databases that included a representative sample of patients from across the country and found that the number of pregnant mothers using opiate drugs jumped fivefold from 2000 to 2009. The number of infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome nearly tripled in the same period. The average cost of taking care of each infant climbed to $53,400 from $39,400, adjusted for inflation. Medicaid paid for more than three-quarters of the cases, since many of the women were low-income.
''These babies require a tremendous amount of nursing care,'' said Dr. Mark Hudak, chairman of pediatrics at the University of Florida College of Medicine in Jacksonville and an author of new guidelines on neonatal abstinence syndrome issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics this year.
Infants in the study spent an average of 16 days in the hospital, usually in neonatal intensive care units, which are especially expensive because of the specialized nursing care. Since 2000, the length of time infants spend in the hospital has not decreased, suggesting that doctors have not yet learned how to make treatment for withdrawal more efficient, said Dr. Stephen Patrick, an author of the study and a neonatologist in the University of Michigan Health System.
''Are there other places in the hospital that can treat them?'' like standard pediatric wards or outpatient clinics, Dr. Patrick asked. ''Are there different medications or ways to treat them?''
Dr. Hudak recommends trying to soothe babies first by cuddling them and placing them in darkened rooms. If that is unsuccessful, the newborns are given methadone, morphine or another drug related to what the baby was exposed to in utero; the drug is tapered off gradually until the baby is weaned. That process requires careful monitoring. ''These drugs are very easy to overdose babies with,'' Dr. Hudak said. ''There have been deaths.'' And if babies are weaned too soon, ''they can wind up getting rehospitalized.''
Still, despite the risks, studies suggest it is more effective to give the babies a drug related to what their mothers were taking, rather than just treating the symptoms of the babies' withdrawal -- seizures and breathing problems, for example, said Hendree E. Jones, a Johns Hopkins University researcher in psychiatry and behavioral sciences.
But the experts agreed that the best approach is to deal with women's drug addictions before they are pregnant.

HEADLINE: European Stocks Drift Lower on Spanish Recession

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- Stocks fell modestly in Europe on Monday, after confirmation that Spain had slumped back into recession in the first three months of 2012.
The Spanish economy contracted by 0.3 percent in the January-March quarter, the same rate of contraction as in the last quarter of 2011, the National Statistics Institute said in Madrid. The common definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of real economic decline. 
The Euro Stoxx 50 index, which tracks euro zone blue-chip shares, fell 1.6 percent by the close of trading. The FTSE 100 index in London was down 0.7 percent.
The Spanish economic news was not quite as bad as anticipated -- a Reuters poll had found a market consensus for a quarterly contraction of around 0.4 percent. Compared with the first quarter a year earlier, the Spanish economy shrank by 0.4 percent.
Still reeling from the collapse of a property market bubble, Spain is seeking to enact austerity measures to restore government finances, even as it grapples with an unemployment rate of 24.4 percent. The market reaction was muted, with Spanish and other bond yields -- the subject of intense scrutiny since the euro crisis began -- essentially unchanged.
The data suggested that ''the Spanish economy is not shrinking as rapidly as the other southern European economies,'' Ben May, an economist in London with Capital Economics, noted in a report. But he cautioned that ''the full effects of the recent fiscal measures on economic growth will not have yet been fully felt.''
He predicted the recession would ''deepen over the remainder of the year,'' with an overall 2012 contraction of about 1.5 percent this year and another 3.0 percent next year.
The Continent was trading nearly on autopilot, as many investors were taking advantage of the May Day holiday on Tuesday to take a four-day weekend.
The dollar was mixed against other major currencies. The euro fell to $1.3225 from $1.3238 late Friday in New York, while the British pound rose to $1.6245 from $1.6266. But the dollar fell to 80.09 yen from 80.27 yen.
Markets were closed in much of Asia, including Japan and mainland China. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index rose 1.6 percent, while the Australian benchmark index gained 0.8 percent.

HEADLINE: On A Tightrope, President Prods China On Rights

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS and ANDREW JACOBS; Steven Lee Myers reported from Washington, and Andrew Jacobs from Beijing. Jane Perlez, Didi Kirsten Tatlow and Clare Pennington contributed reporting from Beijing.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama on Monday gently prodded China to improve its human-rights record but pointedly declined to discuss the case of a prominent Chinese lawyer, Chen Guangcheng, now said to be under American protection in Beijing. His remarks highlighted the delicacy of an unfolding diplomatic dispute that analysts say may prove fiendishly difficult to resolve.
Both countries appear eager to avoid a standoff that threatens to mar relations and, most immediately, to eclipse annual talks scheduled to begin in Beijing on Thursday. But Mr. Chen's professed desire to remain in China could result in a prolonged stalemate that undercuts cooperation on other global security issues.
''Chinese leaders face a huge headache right now,'' said one Chinese academic at a government research institute in Beijing. ''I don't see any easy way out of this mess.'' 
With senior American diplomats descending on Beijing in hopes of quietly negotiating a resolution, Mr. Obama said that he was ''very pleased'' with the cooperation his administration had fostered between the United States and China, reflecting a balance he has long sought between partnership and concern over China's restrictions on basic freedoms.
Mr. Chen's daring escape from house arrest last week has badly strained that balance, with advocates, lawmakers and his presumptive challenger calling on the administration to do everything possible to protect Mr. Chen, his family members and others who helped him and now appear to have been arrested.
Responding to criticism that the administration had not pushed China forcefully enough on Mr. Chen's case, Mr. Obama said that ''every time we meet with China the issue of human rights comes up,'' though he refused to discuss the matter at all.
''It is our belief that not only is that the right thing to do, because it comports with our belief in freedom and human rights, but also because we actually think China will be stronger as it opens up and liberalizes its own system,'' Mr. Obama said as he appeared at the White House with Japan's prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda. ''We want China to be strong, and we want it to be prosperous.''
The handling of Mr. Chen's fate is so sensitive that American officials and diplomats have refused even to confirm whether Mr. Chen is inside the embassy, as supporters and Chinese officials have said, or somewhere else in American hands. Mr. Obama went so far as to decline to discuss what he called ''press reports'' about Mr. Chen's case.
Administration officials have made clear they hoped silence on the matter was the best chance to resolve the case, given the embarrassment Mr. Chen's escape has already caused Chinese leaders, who bristle at anything they perceive as foreign interference.
Mr. Chen, in a videotaped appeal to Premier Wen Jiabao, outlined his preferred solution: a deal that would allow him to be free and guarantee that he and his family are protected from the persecution that prompted his flight from a severe and extralegal house arrest.
Mr. Chen's supporters say he does not want the one thing American officials may be able to provide him -- asylum -- because he knows his influence will quickly diminish to the people who matter most to him if he leaves China.
China's leaders, however, are unlikely to allow Mr. Chen, a blind lawyer who became a media-savvy advocate, to have the freedom to continue his crusading legal defense work. Any major concession on such a sensitive internal affair seems especially unlikely during China's once-in-a-decade leadership succession process, now under way.
For the White House, handing Mr. Chen back over to Chinese authorities would leave it vulnerable to election-year criticism that it had abandoned him. ''This administration has made a calculated decision not to challenge the Chinese regime on its dismal human-rights record,'' the Republican chairwoman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, said in a statement after Mr. Obama's remarks. ''This is an opportunity to correct that mistake.''
With Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and other American officials scheduled to arrive in Beijing on Wednesday, China and the United States both appear to be under enormous pressure to find a resolution that does not overshadow the talks, known as the Strategic Economic Dialogue, or derail the broader relationship.
On Sunday, Kurt M. Campbell, an assistant secretary of state, arrived in Beijing to discuss the matter with Chinese officials. A deputy secretary of state, William J. Burns, also traveled there on Monday ahead of Mrs. Clinton's arrival, but administration officials would discuss neither the negotiations now under way nor any potential solution.
''We've worked hard to build an effective, constructive, comprehensive relationship that allows us to find ways to work together,'' Mrs. Clinton said at the State Department hours before departing, also refusing even to utter Mr. Chen's name, though she has in the past. ''Now a constructive relationship includes talking very frankly about those areas where we do not agree, including human rights. That is the spirit guiding me as I take off for Beijing tonight.''
Representative Christopher H. Smith, a Republican from New Jersey and one of Congress's most outspoken critics of Chinese abuses, urged Mrs. Clinton in a letter released on Monday to raise not only Mr. Chen's demands, but also the fate of others facing repression. ''I would request that you raise the issue of all harassed, arrested, disappeared and disbarred human-rights lawyers and defenders with the Chinese government on an ongoing basis and link this issue with the United States's interest in the rule of law and respect for human rights generally in China,'' he wrote.
Even if American diplomats could persuade Mr. Chen to accept political asylum in the United States, it is not clear whether Beijing would allow him -- and his family -- to leave. For one, Chinese officials are loath to set a precedent that could encourage other dissidents to seek protection in foreign embassies.
Still, if Mr. Chen were willing to leave, diplomats would find it easier to work out the logistics of a solution than if he insists on staying. Indeed, one Chinese figure who has knowledge of the attitudes of top leaders, said the government would probably be happy to see Mr. Chen leave, even if it meant a temporary loss of face.
But absent that, one veteran Chinese diplomat who works for the Foreign Ministry said, ''I predict that if Chen is in the embassy then he won't get out for years.''
There are few historical precedents for resolving a case like this. The last Chinese dissident to find refuge in an American diplomatic compound was Fang Lizhi, an astrophysicist, who walked into the embassy in Beijing with his wife in 1989, the day after the People's Liberation Army crushed pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square. China finally allowed him to leave, ostensibly for medical treatment in Britain, after a year living on the compound.
China now is in a far different position than it was two decades ago, when it was subjected to international censure for the bloody crackdown. And the United States is now far more reluctant to alienate a rising economic powerhouse whose diplomatic heft makes its cooperation crucial on many security matters, including North Korea and Iran.
On the contrary, Mr. Obama said on Monday that he hoped China would grow stronger and prosper, calling on it to ''be a partner with us in a set of international rules and norms that everybody follows.''
So far, the Chinese government has suppressed any news of Mr. Chen's escape by aggressively blocking and deleting posts on popular microblog services. Nonetheless, many people have already been swept up by his cause, said Murong Xuecun, a well-known Chinese writer who joined a grass-roots effort last year to break through the blockade around the farmhouse where Mr. Chen was held after being released from prison.
''People have been willing to take such risks for him because more and more people are so outraged by his mistreatment,'' he said. ''He has become a figure for people, a representative of their own grievances.''
If past news coverage of other dissidents is any guide, Mr. Murong said he expected propaganda officials to spin a new narrative once news of his predicament becomes impossible to tamp down, criticizing Mr. Chen as an enemy of the nation. In recent years, the government has used a similar playbook for Ai Weiwei, the artist and government critic, and Liu Xiaobo, the essayist and political reform advocate who won the Nobel Peace Prize while serving an 11-year sentence for subversion. Both men were portrayed in the official press as self-serving elitists seeking to tear the nation apart.
That could prove difficult in his case. ''A blind person and peasant as a destabilizing threat to the government?'' Mr. Murong asked. ''That would be a joke.''

Re ''Cheney File Traces Heart Care Milestones'' (April 24): I don't begrudge former Vice President Dick Cheney's access to the health care advances that have saved his life on more than one occasion, even if this access may be owing to his privileged economic and political status. I find it ironic, however, that Mr. Cheney benefited from ''every procedure, technology and class of drug available'' during a time when the Bush administration consistently vetoed or restricted increases to the National Institutes of Health budgets. 
N.I.H. funding is a critical source of support for research that has spawned the innovative procedures, devices and medications keeping the former vice president alive. One can only hope that Mr. Cheney's new heart will provide him with the compassion and understanding to speak out for increased federal support for medical research.

HEADLINE: Finish Off Al Qaeda. Stop Trying to Fix Afghanistan.

BYLINE: By ERIC GREITENS. 
Eric Greitens, a former Navy SEAL, is the author of ''The Heart and The Fist: The Education of a Humanitarian, the Making of a Navy SEAL.''

 BODY:
OSAMA BIN LADEN'S death a year ago Wednesday, at the hands of a Navy SEAL team, revealed that America has been fighting two wars in Afghanistan. One is against Al Qaeda, and is clearly in America's national interest; the other war, to fix Afghanistan, is much more questionable. We must take lessons from the way we fight terrorism in Somalia, Yemen and elsewhere: Focus more on finishing the fight against Al Qaeda, and less on bringing good government to a failing state.
After 9/11, American special operations and intelligence personnel killed and captured Al Qaeda leaders, eliminated its bases of operation, restricted its financing, and disrupted its ability to launch international attacks. Relentless pressure has kept Al Qaeda's ability to conduct attacks low. 
But in Afghanistan, it's hard to see whether American efforts are succeeding, and what we should do next. On 9/11 we were not attacked by a country. Yet because many Qaeda fighters were based and sheltered in Afghanistan in 2001, some Americans argued that to make victory permanent we had to not just oust the Taliban government, but also build a democracy, a modern economy and an effective national security apparatus for Afghanistan. It was like arguing that to put out a forest fire, we had to pave the forest.
Today, despite years of investment, the Taliban, associated fighters, criminal families and warlords still resist control from Kabul. President Hamid Karzai has been, at best, an unpredictable ally. Transparency International ranks Afghanistan as more corrupt than any country except Somalia and North Korea. Government security forces still cannot coordinate intelligence and operations across the country without our support.
Since Bin Laden's death, many Americans have decided that our job in Afghanistan is done. They see a victory in the counterterrorism campaign, and are tired of the corruption, confusion and dysfunction of the nation-building campaign.
But it would be a mistake to abandon the country entirely, and fortunately, leaving altogether is not the only alternative. America has learned to fight Al Qaeda in other failed and failing states -- Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan -- without completely rebuilding them. It's time to bring those lessons learned back to where we started.
The weakness of the Karzai government need not pose any more of a threat to America than the ungovernability of large areas of Yemen and Somalia does. These areas must be watched closely by intelligence resources and cooperative tribal leaders, and any new threat must be cut down quickly. But that essential mission can be carried out by intelligence and Special Operations personnel who can smother remnants of Al Qaeda without having to rebuild every country where it sets up shop.
As the Obama administration negotiates with the Karzai government and with Pakistan, we may be tempted to make commitments that, in the name of nation-building, restrict our ability to fight terrorists. If we must involve the Afghan government in every night raid, our operations will slow and targets will escape. If Pakistani officials must know in advance of every drone attack, intelligence will leak.
Rather than asking how to support the Karzai government, we should be asking how, given the realities of Afghanistan, we can most effectively disrupt Qaeda operations and kill Qaeda leaders. An effective strategy should be built around eight principles:
First, maintain America's ability to strike Al Qaeda with surprise, speed and violence. Don't compromise it for the sake of a relationship with an unreliable ally.
Second, focus on the mission, not the number of troops. Embedding Special Operations and intelligence personnel throughout the country will reduce our footprint without sacrificing our ability to hit Al Qaeda.
Third, put in place a long-term plan for maintaining effective signals and human intelligence. Intelligence is easily overlooked in talk about ''boots on the ground,'' but is our first line of defense.
Fourth, make clear that our support for Afghanistan's army and national police force depends on their ability to counter international terrorist attacks. Our continued investment must be dependent on their performance.
Fifth, if the Karzai government can't get the job done, work with people who can. Local allies like tribal leaders can be partners. Our time should be spent working directly with them, rather than trying to get them to partner with Kabul.
Sixth, expand our options by strengthening relationships with nearby governments, while ensuring that our plans for naval deployments maintain effective cruise missile and aircraft carrier strike capabilities.
Seventh, be true to our friends. See that Afghans who have taken risks serving with American forces -- translators, for example -- are cared for, along with their families.
Finally, remember what constitutes success. Success means eliminating Al Qaeda's ability to launch terrorist attacks against the United States and our allies.
Achieving that goal demands focus. Defeating a terrorist organization is like fighting a forest fire; there's never a clear moment of victory, and even after you've won, you have to watch carefully. The successes of the past decade have required discipline, focus and sacrifice from America's service members and their families. Now, to complete that mission, we must ask no less of our policy makers.

HEADLINE: Chen Guangcheng

 BODY:
Chen Guangcheng, a Chinese activist who escaped and sought refuge with the Americans, is a man of extraordinary courage. A self-taught lawyer who is blind, he has campaigned tirelessly against the forced abortions and sterilizations that are central to China's one-child policy.
The case is creating sharp new tensions in American relations with China just as the two countries are scheduled to hold their annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue. Scores of senior officials are scheduled to meet in Beijing this week to discuss an important agenda, including China's artificially undervalued currency, disputes over intellectual property and how much Beijing will do to help rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions and halt North Korea's nuclear weapons program. 
The United States needs to work with Beijing. But Mr. Chen's safety and that of his family is not negotiable. There would be no crisis if China's autocrats didn't deny their people the most basic rights. China, eager for international respect, will further damage its reputation if it continues to abuse its own citizens.
In 2006, Mr. Chen was sentenced to 51 months in prison on bogus charges of destroying property and assembling a crowd to disrupt traffic. His release in 2010 did not mean freedom. Local authorities put him under an extralegal form of house arrest with police surrounding his family farmhouse in Shandong Province. In a video posted on the Internet on Friday, Mr. Chen talks of being subjected to ''brutal'' treatment, including an incident when ''more than a dozen men assaulted my wife'' and also ''violently assaulted me.''
It is no wonder that he took desperate measures. According to The Times, he scaled the wall around his house, gave his guards the slip and made a 300-plus-mile journey to Beijing where American diplomats are believed to be sheltering him. But there are serious concerns about what has since happened to his wife, daughter and others who aided his escape.
The Obama administration has frequently spoken out on Mr. Chen's behalf, including a speech last November in which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton expressed alarm about his continued house arrest. On Sunday, after Mr. Chen sought American protection, Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell was quietly dispatched to Beijing.
At a news conference on Monday, President Obama prodded China to improve its human rights record, saying the country ''will be stronger as it opens up and liberalizes its own system,'' but he refused to comment on Mr. Chen's case. Chinese officials aren't speaking publicly about the case; we hope that means they are looking for a way out. And, for now, quiet diplomacy may hold the best chance for a solution.
We don't know for sure what Mr. Chen wants -- asylum in the United States or, as activists have said, assurances that would permit him to remain in China. In last week's video, he offered a possible face-saving path: He appealed to Prime Minister Wen Jiabao to ''personally intervene'' by investigating the case and punishing ''those who ordered county-level police and officials to break into my house, beat and hurt me, refused me medical attention -- without any legal foundation or officers wearing uniforms.'' That could allow Beijing to blame local authorities for the mistreatment, even though the culture of abuse and trampled rights starts at the top.
Corrupt officials and disregard for the rule of law are the true threat to China, not Mr. Chen and others who courageously defend human rights. Mr. Wen says he wants political reforms. This is his moment to show that China is ready to embark on a more honorable and sustainable path.

HEADLINE: Warfare Or Courtship In 2012?

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
What sort of thing is a presidential campaign?
Maybe a campaign is like a courtship. A candidate's job is to woo the electorate, to win the people's affection with charm, familiarity and compassion.
Maybe a campaign is like a big version of ''American Idol.'' It is a contest over who is the most talented. In this mode, a candidate's job is to endear himself to the people in the audience with likability and then wow them with his gifts.
Maybe, on the other hand, hiring a president is like hiring a plumber. Voters aren't really looking to fall in love with the guy; they just want someone who will fix the pipes. The candidate's job is to list the three or four things he would do if elected and then to hammer home those deliverables again and again. 
You could make a case that most campaigns are a little of all three, though the proportions vary from year to year. In 2008, Obama ran an uplifting campaign that was part courtship and part ''American Idol.'' Richard Nixon, who lacked such charm, ran workmanlike, plumber campaigns, no pun intended.
So far, though, the 2012 presidential campaign is fitting into none of these categories. It's being organized according to a different metaphor. This year, both organizations seem to visualize the campaign as a boxing match or a gang fight. Whichever side can hit the other side harder will somehow get awarded the champion's belt.
So far this year, both President Obama and Mitt Romney seem more passionate about denying the other side victory than about any plank in their own agendas. Both campaigns have developed contempt for their opponent, justifying their belief that everything, then, is permitted.
In both campaigns, you can see the war-room mentality developing early. Attention spans shrink to a point. Gone is much awareness of the world outside the campaign. All focus is on the news blip of the moment -- answering volley for volley. If they bring a knife, you bring a gun. If they throw a bomb, you throw two.
Both sides are extraordinarily willing to flout respectability to show that they are tough enough to bare the knuckles.
In November, the Romney campaign ran a blatantly dishonest ad in which President Obama purportedly admits that if the election is fought on the economy, he will lose. The quote was a distortion, but the effectiveness of the ad was in showing Republican professionals and primary voters that Romney was going to play by gangland rules, that he was tough enough and dishonest enough to do so, too.
Last week, the Obama campaign ran a cheap-shot ad on the death of Osama bin Laden. Part of the ad was Bill Clinton effectively talking about the decision to kill the terrorist. But, in the middle, the Obama people threw in a low-minded attack on Romney. The slam made Clinton look small, it made Obama look small, it turned a moment of genuine accomplishment into a political ploy, but it did follow the rules of gangland: At every second, attack; at every opportunity, drive a shiv between the ribs.
This martial-, gangland-style of campaigning apparently makes the people in the campaigns feel hardheaded, professional and Machiavellian. But it's not clear that it's actually the best way to win an election. That's because the style is based on a series of dubious assumptions: that the harshest language is the most persuasive to voters; that what feels good to you as a competitive combatant will also look most attractive to detached onlookers; that over the duration of a six-month campaign, daily combat will continue to look compelling rather than cumulatively revolting; that in a campaign dominated by ''super PAC'' negativity, a presidential candidate is better served by wading into the brawl rather than separating himself from it.
The campaign-as-warfare metaphor may seem sensible to those inside the hothouse. It may make sense if you think today's swing voters hunger for more combat, more harshness and more attack.
But it's probably bad sociology and terrible psychology, given the general disgust with conventional politics. If I were in the campaigns, I'd want to detach from the current rules of engagement and change the nature of the campaign. If I were Obama, I'd play to his personal popularity and run an ''American Idol'' campaign -- likability, balance, safety and talent. If I were Romney, saddled with his personal diffidence, I'd run a plumber campaign -- you may not love me, but here's four things I can do for you.
These would be very different campaigns than the ones we are seeing so far: more positive psychology, less negative psychology. A few big messages about fundamental change, less obsession with the daily news cycle. More attention devoted to those turned off by politics, less to the hard-core denizens who are obsessed by it.

HEADLINE: Ties to Romney in '08 Helped Fuel Equity Firm

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO and JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
About a month after Mitt Romney ended his bid for the Republican presidential nomination in February 2008, his eldest son, Tagg, and Spencer Zwick, the campaign's top fund-raiser, met with a beef company executive who had been a major campaign donor over dinner at the posh Torrey Pines resort in San Diego.
This meeting, however, was not about politics. Instead, the younger Romney, who had been a senior adviser to his father, and Mr. Zwick presented the executive, John R. Miller, with a business proposition: the opportunity to invest in a private equity fund they were starting, Solamere Capital.
Neither had experience in private equity. But what the close friends did have was the Romney name and a Rolodex of deep-pocketed potential investors who had backed Mr. Romney's presidential run -- more than enough to start them down that familiar path from politics to profit. 
Two years later, despite a challenging fund-raising climate for private equity, Solamere, named after a wealthy enclave in Utah's Deer Valley where the Romneys have a winter home, finished raising its first fund. The firm blew past its $200 million goal, securing $244 million from 64 investors, including a critical, early $10 million from Mitt Romney and his wife, Ann, and hefty commitments from wealthy supporters of the campaign.
The small firm, including Tagg Romney, 42, Mr. Zwick, 32, and a third partner they brought in, Eric Scheuermann, 47, the only one with a private equity background, is in line to collect at least $16.8 million in fees over the first six years of the fund, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm has earned a 20 percent return since 2010, despite having invested only about half of its money so far.
It is not unusual for start-ups looking for investors to approach friends and relatives. But the overlap between the elder Romney's political apparatus and Solamere adds a different, potentially nettlesome dimension, given the widespread presumption since the last presidential election that the former Massachusetts governor was next in line for the Republican nomination.
Solamere's founders dispute any notion that they have cashed in on their political connections, arguing that Solamere, like any fund, has had to persuade investors on its merits.
''No one we went to as an investor said, 'Oh, your dad is Mitt Romney, I'm going to give you $10 million,'' Tagg Romney said, noting that his father's political future was uncertain when the firm began. He added, ''Our relationships with people got us in the door, but that did not get us investors.''
Even so, Mitt Romney was the featured speaker at Solamere's first investor conference in Deer Valley in January 2010. Mr. Romney, who made his fortune in private equity at Bain Capital, also gave early strategic advice.
Building Solamere
While Solamere has not operated exactly as a subsidiary of the Romney campaign, it has seemed that way at times. The firm shared its first address with the Romney campaign headquarters in Boston. Later, the company was located in the same building as Mr. Romney's leadership PAC, Free and Strong America, before moving to trendy Newbury Street in Boston.
When Mr. Zwick was leading Solamere's fund-raising in 2008 and 2009, he was also raising money for the leadership PAC, which paid his finance consulting firm, SJZ, LLC, more than $425,000 during those years.
Solamere began sending offering memorandums to prospective investors in May 2008, around the time the leadership PAC began collecting checks, raising the possibility that Mr. Zwick was soliciting some people for both ventures.
Mr. Zwick insisted there was no conflict, explaining that the work he did for the political committee was relatively low-key. He said the payments to his firm went to other contractors, and that he was a volunteer.
Mr. Zwick was not the only one from the Romney finance shop who decamped to Solamere. One of the firm's early employees, Mason J. Fink, was Mr. Zwick's deputy during the 2008 campaign and had previously worked as a private equity analyst. Mr. Fink left Solamere in 2010 and runs day-to-day fund-raising for the Romney 2012 campaign, reporting to Mr. Zwick, who splits his time between Solamere and the campaign.
Laura Coleman, the director of donor relations for the Romney 2008 campaign, also joined Solamere for several months in 2008, according to her resume on LinkedIn. Simultaneously, she worked for Mr. Zwick's consulting firm, where he said she was an administrative assistant.
Kaitlin O'Reilly is another employee who pulled double duty. At Solamere, she researched potential investors, helped coordinate the investor conference, and lined up a $1 million investor, according to LinkedIn. At Mr. Zwick's consulting firm, she tracked donors and helped coordinate finance events for Free and Strong America. She later became a finance coordinator for the Romney 2012 campaign.
The plans for Solamere came together rapidly after the 2008 campaign ended. Within a week, Tagg Romney and Mr. Zwick were having breakfast with Mr. Scheuermann, whom they knew through a mutual friend. He had spent 14 years at Jupiter Partners, a New York-based private-equity firm. The three decided to take the plunge together.
The Principals
Solamere settled on a strategy tailored to wealthy individuals, requiring a minimum $10 million investment, with some exceptions. Unlike many private equity funds that specialize in scouting out companies to invest in directly, Solamere is a ''fund of funds'' that invests in 22 other private equity funds. The firm has also made eight co-investments, which give its investors the option of putting additional money into deals arranged by other firms.
Like many private funds, Solamere does not publicly disclose its portfolio. The co-investments appear to be mostly in smaller companies, including one that makes napkins and another that sells collectibles.
Mr. Zwick, who focused on the firm's fund-raising, has sometimes been called the Romney's ''sixth son.'' He worked as a personal aide to Mitt Romney at the Salt Lake City Olympics while still a student at Brigham Young University and then held various roles in Mr. Romney's governor's office and campaigns. Solamere's Web site describes him as the youngest person ever to serve as national finance director for a presidential campaign.
Tagg Romney has more business experience. A graduate of Harvard Business School, he had recently worked as a marketing executive for the Los Angeles Dodgers, as well as at Reebok.
When the partners drew up a lengthy list of potential investors, many were political acquaintances, they said, but others were not. ''I discussed our fund with people that I had a relationship of trust with, people I had either worked with or knew personally,'' Mr. Zwick said. ''Of course I cast the net far and wide.''
Mr. Miller, who attended the dinner at Torrey Pines in March 2008, was one of Solamere's first targets. The chief executive of National Beef Packing until 2009, Mr. Miller had been a national finance co-chairman for the 2008 Romney campaign. He has homes in Deer Valley and the La Jolla section of San Diego, near the Romneys' vacation homes, and is a longtime family friend.
Mr. Miller signed on with the firm in May 2008, as an investor and an operating partner. That same month, he also became among the first to donate $5,000 to Mr. Romney's leadership PAC.
Two other Solamere investors are Scott Frantz, a venture capitalist and fund-raiser for the Romney campaigns in 2008 and 2012, and Mark Chapin Johnson, a former health care executive who donated $73,000 to state political action committees affiliated with Mr. Romney in 2006.
Another investor was Meg Whitman, the former eBay chief executive and a national finance co-chairwoman of the 2008 campaign. She invested more than $1 million, according to financial disclosures, and was a featured speaker at Solamere's investor conference last year.
Matt Blunt, the former Missouri governor who backed Mr. Romney in 2008, is a senior adviser to Solamere, as is Mitt Romney's brother, Scott, a lawyer.
Despite the web of associations with his father's political world, Tagg Romney said he and Mr. Zwick knew only five of Solamere's investors solely from the campaign. He said other investors -- including two N.F.L. quarterbacks, several Nascar drivers, nine heads of private equity firms, the father of one of Tagg Romney's former girlfriends, and Lee Scott, the former head of Wal-Mart -- came from introductions or acquaintances beyond politics.
Mr. Romney acknowledged that some might have also backed his father, but insisted they did not view their investments as another way to show political support. ''The reason people invested in us is that they liked our strategies,'' he said.
Yet, several private equity executives said that what the Solamere partners accomplished -- given the tough economy and their limited experience -- would have been nearly impossible without their connections. Antoine Drean, founder of Triago, which raises money for private equity firms, said that given Mitt Romney's success at Bain, ''even without the politics attached to it, the name opens doors.''
The Romneys' $10 million investment in Solamere came through Ann Romney's blind trust, which was set up when Mr. Romney became governor.
Brad Malt, a Boston lawyer who administers the trust, said he invested in Solamere without consulting Mitt Romney. Mr. Malt said he liked Solamere's diversified approach and while he could have invested in more-established funds, his decision came down to knowing the founders. ''I had confidence in their talents, integrity and intellect,'' he said.
A New Venture
Since the firm's investment decisions are not publicly disclosed, they are difficult to assess. But in mid-2009, when the three Solamere Capital founders and some of their investors made a $100,000 personal investment in a North Carolina financial advisory firm, a news release announced the deal. It quoted Tagg Romney lauding the ''all-star lineup'' of financial advisers at the new firm, which took the name Solamere Advisors.
All but one of the firm's 11 employees, however, had come from the Charlotte office of Stanford Financial Group, which federal officials had closed earlier that year for selling sham certificates of deposit financed through a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme. Solamere's executives said that Solamere Advisors' employees had been with Stanford only briefly and knew nothing about the fraud.
The court-appointed receiver for Stanford, however, has filed a federal lawsuit contending that former Stanford employees ignored warning signs of the fraud, and seeking to recover money from more than 300 of them, including three Solamere Advisors founders. The three, Timothy Bambauer, Deems May and Brandon Phillips, were at Stanford just over a year and received incentive compensation derived from proceeds of the bogus C.D.'s, according to court filings.
Mr. Bambauer, who was a managing partner of Solamere Advisors but left the firm last year, earned commissions and bonuses totaling more than $210,000 from actually selling the C.D.'s. Records show that he sold at least 48 fraudulent C.D.'s to 37 customers, totaling more than $13 million, said Kevin Sadler, the lead lawyer for the receiver.
Herman Stone, 70, a Charlotte businessman, said he put $2 million into a C.D. after Mr. Bambauer and his assistant, Mr. Phillips, vouched for it. ''They said, 'Mr. Stone, this is so safe,' '' he said, adding that he plans to sue.
Mr. Bambauer declined to comment through a lawyer. A spokesman at Solamere Advisors said Mr. Phillips ''had absolutely no involvement in the recommendation or sale'' of Stanford C.D.'s. Mr. May did not return a call.
Tagg Romney emphasized that his father did not invest in the advisory firm. But the potential for fallout illustrates the double-edged nature of Solamere Capital's ties to the Romney world.
''We don't want to get the campaign mixed up with other things,'' Tagg Romney said. ''We've done our best to separate the two, because they're separate.''

HEADLINE: Law Firm Said To Tell Partners To Leave Now

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
7:39 a.m. Updated
Dewey & LeBoeuf, the New York law firm crippled by financial mismanagement, an exodus of partners and a criminal investigation of its former chairman, encouraged its partners on Monday evening to look for another job, according to an internal memo.
The firm's leadership has been scrambling in recent days to stave off failure by merging with another law firm and persuading its lenders not to push it into liquidation. ''All partners,'' said the memo, which was reviewed by The New York Times, ''are encouraged to seek out alternative opportunities.''
The memo represents the latest chapter in a tumultuous period for Dewey, which has come apart after disappointing profits forced its leadership to slash partners' compensation. An accelerating wave of partner defections since January - more than 85 of its 300 partners have left, including at least 11 on Monday - has imperiled the firm.
Last week the firm announced that the Manhattan district attorney had begun a criminal investigation into allegations of wrongdoing by Steven H. Davis, the firm's former chairman, who was stripped from his leadership posts this past weekend. 
If Dewey were to file for bankruptcy, it would most likely lead to the firm's dissolution, industry experts say. Unlike an operating company with physical assets that can reorganize in a bankruptcy, Dewey - a private partnership whose only real assets are lawyers - will be left with nothing to restructure once its lawyers walk out the door.
''There are no plans to file bankruptcy,'' Martin Bienenstock, the head of Dewey's restructuring practice and a member of the office of the chairman, said late Monday. ''And anyone who says differently doesn't know what they're talking about.''
Before the recent departures, Dewey employed about 2,000 people - roughly 1,000 lawyers in 25 offices across the globe and the other half support staff including legal secretaries, mailroom clerks and paralegals.
Dewey was formed through the 2007 merger of Dewey Ballantine and LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae. The two firms created a 1,300-lawyer behemoth with about 25 offices across the world and revenues of about $1 billion, making it the largest law firm merger in history.
Driving the deal was Mr. Davis, a Yale-educated energy-industry lawyer who had spent his entire career at LeBoeuf and had ascended to its chairmanship. A genial and low-key leader, Mr. Davis had a vision to create a firm with the size and international footprint to compete in an increasingly competitive marketplace.
''You have to be bigger,'' Mr. Davis said in an interview at the time.
They called the new partnership Dewey & LeBoeuf, honoring a commitment that Dewey Ballantine had made to the estate of Thomas E. Dewey, the former New York governor who once ran the firm. When Mr. Dewey died in 1971, his will said that the firm could no longer use his name. The firm struck a deal with the estate to continue to use ''Dewey,'' so long as it always appeared first.
When the combination was struck, the partners had a saying that ''LeBoeuf married up, and Dewey married rich.'' The century-old Dewey, a storied firm with a strong mergers-and-acquisition practice, was hurting financially after numerous partners left after a failed 2006 merger with Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe. LeBoeuf, on the other hand, was financially sound, churning out lucrative work in its leading practices representing utilities and insurers.
Despite the old-school name, Dewey jettisoned traditional notions of a law firm partnership. Instead, Mr. Davis promoted a star system where top-producing partners had guaranteed contracts paying them millions of dollars a year. Some partners, the so-called rainmakers who brought in the business, made more than 10 times Dewey's lowest-ranking ones, the service partners who earned a salary of about $300,000 drafting legal briefs and proofreading merger agreements.
The timing of the merger, struck in August 2007, could not have been worse. Just as the firms were combining, the credit markets seized up. A year later, Lehman Brothers collapsed, setting off the global financial crisis and a precipitous decline in the demand for legal services. Dewey, like other large law firms, struggled through the deep recession.
Yet in 2010, anticipating a business recovery, Mr. Davis began a hiring spree, snaring partners from other firms by luring them with huge multiyear contracts. Last year alone, Dewey brought on 37 lateral partners. On just one day in January 2011, the firm brought on seven partners from three firms. Each was accompanied by a guaranteed pay package and a glowing press release.
The problem was that Dewey could not afford to pay its existing partners, let alone these new ones.
Cash was already running low; partners were already owed tens of millions of dollars in back pay. The firm had fallen so behind on collecting unpaid legal bills that management sent out an e-mail offering partners free iPads and iPhones if their clients paid them on time.
Last October, as it became clear that Dewey was not going to meet its lofty projections for 2011, Mr. Davis held a partners' meeting to discuss the firm's finances. He dropped a bombshell: The firm had extended guarantees to nearly 100 of its lawyers, creating compensation commitments that it could not possibly meet. Partners with large contracts who were already owed millions of dollars would be asked to take additional pay cuts.
By March, Dewey's partners were already in revolt when they crammed into a conference room for another meeting. Jeffrey L. Kessler, a top sports-industry lawyer who represents the National Football League players' union, took the microphone and delivered, according to people present, the law firm equivalent of a locker room pep talk.
''There's a crisis of confidence here but the only thing that can sink the ship is us,'' Mr. Kessler said. ''Instability is creating a problem but give us six months and people will be happy.''
Yet the partners had already lost confidence in management's ability to save the firm. Groups of partners continued to jump ship, and the steep decline in its partnership ranks caused Dewey to breach covenants on its loans.
A dissolution of Dewey would be expected to result in ugly legal battles over money between creditors, bondholders and the partners owed back pay. In a bankruptcy proceeding, Dewey's partners could also be on the hook for millions of dollars in so-called clawback claims brought by creditors seeking to recover money.
Mr. Davis has hired Barry A. Bohrer, a criminal defense lawyer at Morvillo, Abramowitz, Grand, Iason, Anello & Bohrer, to represent him. On Sunday, Mr. Davis e-mailed his partners, defending his tenure as the firm's chairman.
''A dispassionate and disinterested review of the facts will confirm that I have not engaged in any misconduct,'' Mr. Davis wrote. ''I did my best to navigate the firm through challenging and turbulent times, and I deeply regret our current situation.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 3, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about troubles at the law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf erroneously cited, in some editions, one partner as being among those who had presented evidence to the Manhattan district attorney's office of possible financial improprieties by the firm's former chairman. Seth C. Farber, a former federal prosecutor, was not among the group of partners who presented such evidence. The article also misstated, in some editions, the size of a bond issue at the firm that partly matures next year. It is $125 million, not billion.

HEADLINE: May 1, 1992 | Rodney King Asks, 'Can We All Get Along?'

BYLINE: THE LEARNING NETWORK


HIGHLIGHT: On May 1, 1992, Rodney King, a black man who had been beaten by Los Angeles police officers, appeared in public to appeal for calm after the acquittal of the officers led to rioting. 

 BODY:
On May 1, 1992, Rodney King, a black man who had been beaten by Los Angeles police officers, appeared in public to appeal for calm after the acquittal of the officers set off rioting in the city. Mr. King said: "People, I just want to say, you know, can we all get along? Can we get along?"
Mr. King had been beaten more than a year earlier, in the early-morning hours of March 3, 1991, after he had led police officers in a high-speed chase while driving after drinking. He resisted arrest as officers tried to force him to the ground. Two officers began beating him with nightsticks, while a third kicked him in the head. A man living near the arrest site, George Holliday, heard the commotion and filmed the officers beating Mr. King. Mr. Holliday gave the tape to a TV news station, which showed it and set off a firestorm of criticism of the officers and a public debate over police brutality.
The March 14, 1991, New York Times reported on the Justice Department's response to charges of widespread police brutality across the country. The article also noted that many in Los Angeles had "called for the resignation of Police Chief Daryl F. Gates. They accused him of tolerating and even encouraging brutality by police officers against black and Hispanic men."
Four Los Angeles Police Department officers were tried for using excessive force against Mr. King. During the trial, it was revealed that one officer, Laurence Powell, had boasted about beating Mr. King and had used a racial epithet while referring to a black couple. However, the prosecution was hurt by its poor witnesses, its decision not to let Mr. King testify and the showing of the unedited beating video, which included footage of Mr. King resisting arrest that had been edited from many news reports. On April 29, 1992, a primarily white jury found all four officers not guilty.
The verdict outraged many in Los Angeles and ignited riots in the city that began when a group of black men beat a white truck driver and a Guatemalan immigrant nearly to death. The rioters, mostly young black men, set fires, looted stores and committed acts of violence. Authorities managed to get the riots under control on the fourth day, a day after Mr. King's "Can we all get along?" plea.
The next day, The Times examined the cause of the riots: "Many said the acquittal was only a spark put to a tinderbox of anger constructed from years of deep poverty, governmental neglect, racism, charges of police abuse and high unemployment."
In a federal trial in 1993, two of the officers were found guilty and sentenced to 30 months in prison. Mr. King was awarded $3.8 million in a civil case, but his life since the event has been punctuated by struggles with alcoholism and repeated run-ins with the law.

In response to the Trayvon Martin case, in which a black teenager was killed by a white Hispanic man, George Zimmerman, who thought Mr. Martin looked like "a real suspicious guy," Mr. King released a that read, "The horrifying sound of a young black male screaming for his life on a 911 call reminded me of my horrifying scream on a videotape 20 years ago."
The case has ignited racial tensions in Florida and across the country. Mr. Zimmerman has now been charged with second-degree murder and faces a trial that is sure to make national headlines. 
What do you think the Trayvon Martin case has revealed about the current dialogue on race and racism in the United States? How would you compare and contrast the public response to the Trayvon Martin case in 2012 with that of Rodney King? Why?

HEADLINE: A 13-Year-Old Enlists M.B.A. Students to Build Her Start-Up

BYLINE: JESSICA BRUDER


HIGHLIGHT: Mallory Kievman is building a company to market her cure for hiccups. 

 BODY:
To silence her stubborn hiccups during the summer of 2010, Mallory Kievman tried swallowing saltwater, making herself gag, eating a spoonful of sugar, sipping pickle juice and drinking a glass of water upside-down. Nearly two years and 100 attempted folk remedies later, the 13-year-old is preparing to lead a team of M.B.A. students from the University of Connecticut in building a company that can bring her invention -- Hiccupops, or hiccup-stopping lollipops -- to market this summer.
"It's very rare, when you're evaluating businesses, that you can envision a company or product being around 100 years from now," said Danny Briere, a serial entrepreneur and the founder of Startup Connecticut, which nurtures new companies, including Hiccupops, and is a regional affiliate of the Startup America Partnership. "Hiccupops is one of those things. It solves a very simple, basic need."
Mallory met Mr. Briere last spring at the Connecticut Invention Convention, an annual competition for kids. "I went there, and I knew it would either be a hit or a miss project," she said. "People would either like it, or they would think I was crazy."
She had developed the product in her family's Manchester, Conn., kitchen, amalgamating her three favorite cures -- lollipops, apple cider vinegar and sugar -- into a single confection. "It triggers a set of nerves in your throat and mouth that are responsible for the hiccup reflex arc," said Mallory with a matter-of-fact tone. "It basically over-stimulates those nerves and cancels out the message to hiccup."
The judges didn't think she was crazy. Instead, they awarded Hiccupops prizes for innovation and patentability. As part of her winnings,intellectual property lawyers filed for a patent, now pending, on Mallory's behalf.
Soon, she will even have her own team of consultants. The University of Connecticut's Innovation Accelerator plans to dispatch a group of graduate business students this summer to help push Hiccupops out into the world. The students will work from late May through August and get paid for their labor by the Connecticut Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, a university hub that hosts the Innovation Accelerator program. The center's executive director, Christopher Levesque, will be their mentor.
"It's a nifty invention and it has some terrific potential benefits for society," said Mr. Levesque. "It straddles that line between an attractive, go-to product that people might like to savor and a helpful nutraceutical aid. It's innovative, born of some real ingenuity."
So far, Mallory has presented her product at a state economic summit and at the Xcellr8 Innovation Cell, a networking group. In January, she joined a group of Startup America entrepreneurs ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.
"It's funny to see her give a business overview presentation, because she shows the organizational chart and there's her as the C.E.O. and head of R&D," said her father, Adam Kievman, laughing. "Then you get a picture of me, and it says 'adult supervision.' It's been great to see it come together because this was something that she developed on her own. I'm trying to do my best to support it but to also not, you know, drive it."
This is how Mallory explains her father's role: "He's helping me with a lot of the business stuff. And he's also helping me handle stuff like using the stove."
Mallory hopes Hiccupops will become a staple of school nurses' offices and drugstores. She also wants to explore a medical niche, since hiccups are a common and uncomfortable side effect of chemotherapy. "It always has been really appealing to me to be able to sort of have a product out there that can help people," she said. "I want to become a doctor and go into medicine."
So far, her biggest challenge has been working through more than 40 batches to find a formula that hardens well and is stable enough for shelf storage. That part is over now, she said, so she's working on "tweaking the taste" and finding the right contract manufacturer.
For at least one member of Mallory's team, the move to a professional facility can't happen soon enough. "It's been a lot of mess in the kitchen lab," her father said. "So, yeah, Mallory's mom isn't really thrilled with all the development work going on."

HEADLINE: South Asian A Capella Groups Fuse Bollywood and Pop

BYLINE: ANKITA RAO


HIGHLIGHT: Indian American singers at universities across the United States have formed a capella bands. 

 BODY:
Like many first-generation Indian Americans, singers in the a capella group NY Masti were raised on a steady diet of Bollywood music at home and pop music on their car radios. Somewhere between graduating high school and starting their careers, the two genres merged, becoming an all-vocal fusion of music, complete with "filmi" Hindi songs and soulful hip-hop ballads.
The five 20-something women, dolled up in black dresses and nude-colored stilettos, recently performed a mash-up of Adele's "Someone Like You," Amit Trivedi's "Iktara" and Usher's "Without You" for a crowd of college students and families at last month's Pappu Can Sing Buddy event in Manhattan.
Organized by the non-profit performing arts coalition Anamika-Navatman at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the evening showcased three South Asian a capella groups: city-based NY Masti, Stanford University's Raagapella, and Princeton University's Tarana.
As the sun set behind the floor-to-ceiling windows of the dance studio, some of the approximately one hundred audience members were left to a standing room only. Tickets for the concert had proven successful even before the walk-ups, a testament to the steadfast popularity of collegiate South Asian a capella groups.
Penn Masala, an all-male ensemble from the University of Pennsylvania, is credited for pioneering the fusion music trend that largely reflects Indian American tastes in the pairing of Hindi and Western songs.
Founded in 1996 by four Indian-Americans rehashing Bollywood songs in a dorm room, the popular student group now has a revolving door of 14 mostly Indian American men, seven albums and more than 15,000 fans on Facebook.
"I think every year gets better and better," said Bharat Moudgil, a 24-year-old University of Pennsylvania law student and singer who grew up listening almost exclusively to Hindi music. "There are a lot of places in the world with a fairly large Indian diaspora that enjoys our music."
Since joining the group seven years ago during his freshman year at the college, the Florida native has traveled with Penn Masala to London, Los Angeles and Mumbai, where they performed for Reliance chief executive Mukesh Ambani. They also regularly perform on the college circuit, mostly at East Coast schools.
Mr. Moudgil said the group is well received by its largely South Asian audience, even in India, where a capella has yet to garner attention. And with arrangements of Hindi pop, as well as John Legend and Coldplay songs, Penn Masala also has a presence on online music services Spotify, Grooveshark and Pandora.
While the group has capitalized on the ability to match Bollywood film music with the top 40 commercial hits, spinoffs of the South Asian a capella trend have tested the formula.
Stanford's Raagapella, formed in 2002, includes Korean and Chinese students, and has fused Farsi and Tamil songs alongside the Hindi-English standard. They have recently started to match the themes, not just rhythms, of the songs they weave together, like the melancholy Persian love song "Ek Karevan" and Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah."
"Even if a song is in a different language, to an audience they'll be able to relate to the heartache and loss," said 20-year-old Raman Nelakanpi, the group's music director.
While a capella is a strictly vocal tradition, Princeton's co-ed group, Tarana, added an instrumental componentto their ensemble with tabla, guitar and violin. Kishan Shah, 18, who founded the group during his freshman year of college in 2010, said the 20 members perform a variety of Pakistani rock with jazz and Hindustani classical music. 
And NYMasti, one of the few women South Asian a capella groups in the country, feature more soloists and three-song sets than traditional doo-wop harmonizing. Founded in 1999 by a group of NYU students, they channel singers like Leona Lewis and Rihanna, coupling the R&B crooners with Hindi film ballads.
"We want to put it out there that we can beat-box just as good as the guys, that we can do everything," said Priyanka Padode, an NYU student in the group.
At a March event in Hell's Kitchen, the audience was wooed as much by the shock factor of unlikely mash-ups: Tarana's combination of Michael Jackson's "Billy Jean" and "Dil Chahta Hai," for example - as they are by sometimes remarkably powerful voices.
Raagapella's energetic choreography and a slapstick Indian version of R. Kelly's slow jam "Hotel" gets as much supportive applause and hooting at their smooth arrangements of Usher and Bollywood songs. They clearly enjoy putting on a show.
And their varied styles have gained the a capella groups traction beyond their family and friends. 
Last summer, California-based Raagapella was invited to perform the "Slumdog Millionaire" anthem "Jai Ho" with Indian composer A.R. Rahman and the Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestra for an audience of 15,000 people at the Hollywood Bowl.
Eighteen-year-old Amrit Saxena, the group's president, said the performance, and visiting Mr. Rahman's house afterward, motivated the group to dig deeper: "I think Raag is more controlled and deep than other groups that focus on Bollywood and mainstream pop music."
Penn Masala, which continues to grow in its 16th year, serenaded President Obama at the White House in 2009 to mark the signing of a Washington initiative to improve the economic status and quality of life of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
For fledgling groups like Tarana, developing a sound and introducing their music to the South Asian community has just begun to stray from the campus community and into the surrounding New Jersey and New York areas.
Kishan Shah, the founder, said the group has been invited or hired to sing at weddings, Sweet 16 parties and Indian cultural events, as well as concerts like Pappu Can Sing Buddy. As far as the sophomore is concerned, Tarana will make its mark by trying out different styles, concerts and venues.
 "We're willing to try anything," he said before donning tiger-striped orange sunglasses to beat-box on stage.

HEADLINE: Q&A: Greening the City's Zoning Rules

BYLINE: MIREYA NAVARRO


HIGHLIGHT: New York City's sustainability director and a green developer discuss how changes in zoning rules could speed the adoption of green roofs, renewable energy and energy-efficient features. 

 BODY:
On Monday, the New York City Council unanimously approved a package of zoning changes that will make it easier for property owners to undertake energy efficiency upgrades and even produce their own solar and wind power. Developers will also have more freedom to incorporate green elements into their building designs. 
As I reported a few days ago, buildings account for at least three-fourths of New York City's greenhouse gas emissions. Owners can nonetheless reduce their carbon footprints - and lower their electricity bills -- by adding insulation and installing features like solar shades. But how many owners of the city's million or so existing buildings are willing to foot the upfront costs to save energy in the longer term? How will things change for architects and developers once the zoning rules are relaxed?
For answers to these and other questions, we turned to Howard Slatkin, director of sustainability for New York's Department of City Planning, and Paul Freitag, the director of development in New York for the Jonathan Rose Companies, an environmentally minded real estate firm.
Following are excerpts, edited for brevity and clarity:
Q.
A.
Howard Slatkin: We worked closely with architects, engineers, developers and other experts to identify the zoning obstacles to building or retrofitting green buildings. For example, a residential building wanted to add solar panels on its rooftop but couldn't receive a permit to do this because they would exceed the maximum permitted height. As part of an affordable housing rehabilitation project, an architect wanted to add insulation outside the building and keep the tenants in place during the work, but zoning didn't allow this because zoning would have counted insulation toward the building's floor area, bringing it over the allowed maximum. A homeowner wanted to add a green roof on top of the row house he was renovating but was told that this would exceed a height limit.

Zone Green will allow extra "floor area" for building insulation, allow any building to place solar panels on its roof and permit shading devices to project from building facades -- unlocking as much as $800 million in potential energy savings every year. Zone Green will also permit new rooftop greenhouses to exceed height limits, encouraging the cultivation of fresh local food and serving as a great way to educate our children about the environment.
A.
Paul Freitag: One of the simplest examples of an innovation that was being stifled by outdated codes is the relocation of boiler rooms to the roofs of buildings. Boiler rooms have traditionally been located in the basements of buildings because that was where the coal was delivered. Given that coal deliveries haven't been common since the last revision of the zoning code 50 years ago, it make more economic sense to locate natural gas-fired boiler rooms on the roof. 
In doing so, you don't need to build a costly fireproofed chimney through the building which also takes up the equivalent space of a large closet on every floor. A boiler also operates more efficiently on a rooftop because the long chimney needed to exhaust a basement boiler also reduces its efficiency. The Zone Green amendment now allows boiler rooms to be a permitted obstruction on a rooftop, which should help promote the use of higher-efficiency boilers on rooftops across New York City.
Q.
A.
Mr. Slatkin: All types of buildings in the city - residential, commercial, community facility, industrial - could benefit. Some aspects of the changes would affect certain types of buildings more than others. For instance, existing residential buildings are more likely than industrial ones to be built to a maximum height limit and would be more likely to benefit directly from the allowance for rooftop solar panels. 
The external insulation provisions are more likely to be significant for existing detached or semidetached residential buildings, which have more exposed exterior wall, than for attached buildings or for high-rise buildings with glass curtain walls. 
Q.
A.
Mr. Freitag: One of my favorite green innovations is the use of exterior solar shades, which block the heat of the summer sun from entering a building. This is actually an old strategy, and historic photos show window awnings used extensively in New York. Yesterday's awnings have now been reinvented as fin-like elements, mounted above windows, that are angled in such a way to block the high summer sun while letting in the lower winter sun to allow buildings to be naturally warmed by sunlight in the wintertime. 
We used these on the south facade of our buildings prior to the Zone Green amendment; however, approval took 18 months and required review by two different agencies. I am pleased with the prospect of being able to use exterior solar shades without having to go through all that.
Q.
A.
Mr. Freitag: I am hopeful that the next generation of electricity-producing solar panels will be more efficient and less expensive, which will allow buildings across New York to put their roofs to work generating electric power. The Zone Green amendment gives clarity to the allowable placement and position of solar panels on rooftops, which should encourage adoption of this technology. 
One point, though: the city still needs to confirm that the zoning code is aligned with the other city codes like the building code, energy code, etc., to make sure that there are no inconsistencies.
Q.
A.
Mr. Slatkin: We've had great interest from the development and construction industries in making it easier to go green. Already, we've seen in Brooklyn a proposal for the largest rooftop greenhouse farm in the world, at 100,000 square feet, made possible by Zone Green.
Q.
A.
Mr. Freitag: One green element that seems to be growing in popularity is the use of green roofs. Building owners and developers are recognizing that they can get many benefits from the roofs, including improved insulation, reduction of the heat island effect, passive storm water management and even the opportunity for food production. But I believe what is really driving their popularity is the realization that green roofs are essentially gardens with views. By giving access to them and incorporating seating areas, they become a wonderful amenity.
Q.
A.
Mr. Slatkin: The city's solar generation capacity has quadrupled in the past several years and continues to grow. Solar energy achieves peak generation on hot, sunny summer days - exactly when we experience peak demand. So even where it is a relatively small component of the energy mix, solar relieves stress on our electrical grid, making brownouts and blackouts less likely, and reducing the need for dirty generators that operate at times of peak demand.
Q.
A.
Mr. Freitag: One of our recent projects was the green renovation of almost 200 units of existing affordable housing in a row of 100-year-old buildings on West 135th Street in Harlem. These renovations were done with the tenants in place and therefore focused on less invasive strategies including boiler replacements, increasing insulation and a rooftop solar installation. After tracking performance for couple of years now, we are seeing a 36 percent reduction in energy costs.
Q.
A.
Mr. Slatkin: The main incentive for these type of improvements is the value they bring to the building - the energy savings from better insulation, the reduction in electric bills from solar energy, the amenity and cooling value of a green roof. There are also a range of other incentives out there today - tax incentives for solar energy and green roofs, for instance. 
A.
Mr. Freitag: Interestingly, because of the public investment in affordable housing, there have been studies. The results indicate that even in affordable housing, where the budgets are very constrained, a 1 to 2 percent additional investment in construction costs can yield buildings that perform at 20 to 30 percent greater efficiency while also promoting tenants' health and overall quality of life.

HEADLINE: In the Kentucky Derby, Lessons to be Learned

BYLINE: JAMES C. NICHOLSON


HIGHLIGHT: Why have leaders in American racing circles been unable to learn from, and capitalize upon, the success of America's greatest horse race? 

 BODY:
This weekend a quarter-million people will flock to Churchill Downs to witness the 138th Kentucky Derby and Kentucky Oaks, and millions more will watch the run for the roses on television. The remarkable resilience of the Derby's popularity is all the more impressive given the steady decline of the sport of horse racing in America in recent decades.
The majority of Derby fans will not watch another horse race all year and could not distinguish a furlong from a fetlock, yet year after year they come to Louisville on the First Saturday in May. The enduring popularity of the Derby begs the question: Why have leaders in American racing circles been unable to learn from, and capitalize upon, the success of America's greatest horse race?
The problem lies in a lack of understanding of the essence of the appeal of the Derby - in a word, nostalgia. Relatively few Derby fans could correctly identify 1875 as the year that the Derby was first contested. But they know that it was a long time ago. This "timelessness" allows Derby-goers to feel that they are participating in an event with strong ties to a particular place - Kentucky - and a distant and idealized past.
Those ties are strengthened by the Derby's most recognizable traditions and icons, including roses, hats, mint juleps, and, most significantly, its evocative anthem, "My Old Kentucky Home," which has moistened the eyes of Derby crowds since the 1920s. These reminders of bygone days have helped the Derby thrive during some of the darkest periods in recent American history, including the Great Depression and the post-Watergate 1970s, when a record crowd of over 163,000 attended the centennial Run for the Roses, a figure not surpassed until 2011, a year marked by high unemployment and two foreign wars.
Three of the American racetracks that have most consistently attracted large crowds in recent years, Keeneland, Saratoga, and Del Mar, are, not coincidentally, the tracks that have most effectively exploited their own geographical assets and connection to a romanticized past. With a motto of "racing as it was meant to be," Keeneland has had an eye toward the past from its very founding, in the heart of Kentucky's Bluegrass Region. Saratoga Race Course, situated amidst Victorian mansions in a quaint upstate New York town, has carried a nineteenth century ambiance into the twenty-first century. Del Mar's theme song "Where the Turf Meets the Surf" reminds patrons of the days of yesteryear, when the southern California track was a playground for Bing Crosby and his Hollywood friends. Each of these tracks is the beneficiary of competitive advantages not available to all American racetracks. However, those advantages should not obscure the elements of their popular appeal that are available to thoroughbred racing as a whole.
As the days of horse-drawn carriages grow ever smaller in our collective rearview mirror, the sport of horse racing becomes increasingly anachronistic. Many in the thoroughbred industry see this fact as a challenge to be overcome in trying to market the sport to younger generations. But when one looks at what works in thoroughbred racing, with the Kentucky Derby at the top of that list, it that very anachronism that is the sport's most valuable and marketable asset. The variety of spectators at the Kentucky Derby is arguably unmatched by any sporting crowd in America, and it is the anachronism of the Derby that brings people to Churchill Downs, to be a part of an event, a sport, and an atmosphere that is unlike anything that they encounter in their modern lives.
Perhaps this year, as the motley assemblage at Churchill Downs is participating in the ritual singing of Stephen Foster's antebellum ballad, some of thoroughbred racing's varied leadership will wipe the mist from their eyes and see that the Derby could be an example for, rather than an anomaly within, American horse racing.

HEADLINE: Arrests and Clashes Downtown as May Day Protests Spread

BYLINE: COLIN MOYNIHAN, IVAN PEREIRA and ANDY NEWMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The protests, coordinated by Occupy Wall Street, grew more clamorous as the day wore on, and by late afternoon, there were a number of witness reports of arrests. 

 BODY:
Updated, May 2 | About 30 protesters have been arrested on Tuesday around Manhattan in a day of May Day demonstrations organized by Occupy Wall Street, the police said. 
Most of the arrests were on disorderly conduct charges, but some people were charged with assault, the police said. And some demonstrators who tried to avoid being detained on various charges were charged with resisting arrest, the police said. Protesters were arrested near Bryant Park in Midtown, on the Williamsburg Bridge, at a park on the Lower East Side and near Washington Square Park as marchers kept on the move and repeatedly converged and split off.
Around 3 p.m., a crowd surged out of Washington Square Park carrying a banner that read "On Strike." Officers shouted for protesters to remain on the sidewalk, but several protesters holding the banner stepped into the middle of Avenue of the Americas, where several officers -- including one in plain clothes who had appeared to be marching with the crowd -- tackled and arrested them. 
One protester who was led away in cuffs had a bloodied face.
Breaking News Network, which transcribes emergency radio broadcasts, reported six arrests at the clash near Washington Square Park.
Activists and the police had been playing cat-and-mouse across downtown, as the marchers ranged quickly from Chinatown to SoHo to Greenwich Village, taking to the roadways and often moving against traffic apparently in an attempt to thwart pursuit.
At a rally in Union Square, where protesters were gathering around 3:15, the themes were the ones that Occupy Wall Street has sounded from the outset of the movement last fall -- opposition to big banks and the government that bailed them out after they helped cause the recession. 
"I just watched the whole economy becoming devastating, and no one wants to hire me," Kenzia Snyder, 59, a freelance chef from Chelsea, said at Union Square. "There are so many issues that are all coming together. It's shameful how the powers are abusing the 99 percent."
The May Day demonstrations took place across the United States and around the globe. 
In the Bay Area in California, marches and protests snarled traffic and caused road closings. Hundreds marched through Oakland, temporarily closing streets and bank branches and clashing with officers in riot gear, who deployed tear gas on crowds. 
The Golden Gate Ferry service, used by many commuters from Marin County to San Francisco, was shut down after workers in bitter contract negotiations over health insurance coverage went on strike and picketed ferry terminals. 
On Monday night, protesters had marched through San Francisco's Mission District, throwing paint and smashing storefront windows at dozens of businesses, restaurants and the local police station. The group also vandalized parked cars, broke windows and spray painted anarchy symbols on car hoods. 
Update, 1:38 p.m. | In New York on Tuesday, about 1:30 p.m. a few hundred protesters who had assembled on the Lower East Side at Sara D. Roosevelt Park began heading east, crossing Forsyth Street. They were met by a line of police officers who pushed them back, grabbed people out of the crowd, threw them to the ground and arrested at least four of them while trying to wrest a large banner away from the marchers.
Officers then plunged into the crowd that was gathered on the south side of Houston Street, at the north end of the park, pushing protesters and journalists alike and making further arrests. The crowd took off running south through the park and east onto Forsyth Street. 
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority issued an alert in the afternoon that "as a result of today's May Day demonstrations, bus detours may be necessary along several routes traveling through Lower Manhattan" and that subways might be extra crowded. "Customers heading home during the afternoon/evening rush are urged to plan for extra travel time," the agency said.
Update, 12:48 p.m. | As of 12:30 p.m. hundreds of protesters from several converging marches had formed a "picket line" on East 42nd Street and were marching back and forth in front of a Wells Fargo branch and the Capital Grille restaurant, part of a chain that is the subject of a class-action suit alleging wage theft and discrimination. The protesters filled the whole block on the north side of 42nd Street between Lexington and Third Avenues.
Protesters were also gathering downtown at Sara D. Roosevelt Park at Chrystie and Houston Streets.
On a rain-dampened morning, the widespread May Day protests coordinated by Occupy Wall Street got off to a relatively slow and calm start in New York, but by 11 a.m. Tuesday, many hundreds of protesters had massed in Bryant Park under the watchful eye of the police and private security.
Earlier, small bands of protesters spread out around Midtown, often moving quickly from place to place, and forming picket lines in front of buildings connected to certain companies. Shortly before 9 a.m., several dozen people walked back and forth in front of the Bank of America tower at 42nd Street and Avenue of the Americas chanting, "Bank of America, hey hey, who did you foreclose today?" 
"This is one of the most screwed-up companies in America," said one protester, Zeke Dunn, 30, a film and television producer from Greenpoint, Brooklyn. "They got a $41 billion safety net, and the rest of us got nothing."
Another group, with about 20 protesters, marched through the center of Grand Central Terminal blowing bullhorns and chanting, "We are unstoppable, another world is possible."
Protesters carrying placards denouncing corporate greed very briefly blocked Fifth Avenue - for about 15 seconds - and were moved along by officers. At another point, a man was led off in handcuffs after witnesses said he stopped while crossing a street in Midtown and would not move.
Protesters also formed picket lines outside of several buildings housing Chase Manhattan bank offices. Thirty blocks south, in Union Square, protesters numbered in the handful and were far outnumbered by the police.
By 11 a.m., several hundred people who had been assembled on the western edge of Bryant Park were joined by hundreds of others who came streaming in from 42nd Street after participating in various marches. 
They assembled on the western part of the park near a large fountain, where a marching band played and drummers pounded out a beat. Private security guards and city police officers also gathered, standing in small groups nearby and watching the crowd.

HEADLINE: The Mormons Sit Out the Civil War

BYLINE: JOHN G. TURNER


HIGHLIGHT: How Brigham Young and the Mormons navigated their tense relationship with Washington during the Civil War. 

 BODY:
On May 1, 1862, Capt. Lot Smith led a cavalry company of a little more than 100 volunteers from Salt Lake City east into the mountains. Their mission was simple: to help the Union Army guard the overland mail route and telegraph line in northern Utah and what is now southwestern Wyoming against Indian attacks. 
Smith's men, members of Utah's Nauvoo Legion militia, never engaged any Indians in combat, though they helped facilitate the resumption of the mail in June. Still, the mission was an important one - it marked Utah's only significant military contribution to the Civil War, and a brief respite in the Mormons' often-tense relationship with Washington. 
Five years earlier, Smith had led a territorial militia company of mounted men into those same mountains, but on a much more dangerous mission. In response to several reports that Mormons had mistreated federal appointees, in the spring of 1857 President James Buchanan had decided to assert Washington's authority by replacing Brigham Young, Utah's territorial governor and president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with his own, non-Mormon appointee. To ensure that the replacement and his staff made it to Salt Lake City safely, Buchanan dispatched a full fifth of the Union Army as an armed escort.
Smith's cavalry was at the forefront of Mormon efforts to prevent the Union force, led by Col. Albert Sidney Johnston, from reaching its destination. In early October, within a span of 24 hours, Smith and around 45 mounted militiamen captured and burned 76 Army supply wagons containing $1 million worth of food and clothing. Partly because of Smith's efforts, the Utah Expedition wintered in the mountains, marching through Salt Lake City the following June - after Young decided to end his resistance.
Partly as retribution for the Utah Expedition, Young decided that the Mormons would sit out the Civil War. He saw the conflict as God's punishment of the United States for its past mistreatment of his church, especially its failure to protect Joseph Smith, the Mormons' founder who was murdered by an Illinois mob in 1844. In Young's view, the war was a prelude to the "winding-up scene," the end times in which American society would collapse under the weight of divine judgment and Mormons would save the Constitution, welcome the return of Jesus Christ and participate in his millennial reign. 
Young was careful to tread the line between dissent and treason; in October 1861 he declared that Utah was "firm for the Constitution." The church president parsed his language carefully: He was for the United States, not its current government. Privately, he said he "earnestly prayed for the success of both North & South." A long war against the Confederacy, Young hoped, would distract the Union government from meddling in Utah affairs and finally leave the Mormons to govern themselves. In September 1861, Young stated that he "would be glad to hear that General Beauregard had taken the President & Cabinet and confined them in the South." He cautioned, however, that he did not want "Utah mixed up with the secession movement." Neither pro-Union nor pro-Confederacy, Young and his church were simply pro-Mormon. 
While a few Latter-day Saints outside of Utah's borders enlisted and fought on both sides, Young did not want his people marching off to defend a government he loathed. Young offered "to furnish a home guard for the protection of the telegraph and mail lines and overland travel within our boundaries," but he was opposed to Mormons providing either money or manpower for the war. "I will see them in Hell before I will raise an army for them," he declared in late 1861. With the exception of Lot Smith's company, Utah raised no volunteers for the Union Army, and the territory's Mormon population eschewed displays of wartime patriotism. 
Meanwhile, after the Civil War began, the federal troops that had garrisoned Utah since 1858 left. Thus, when the Union Army wanted help protecting the mail and telegraph routes, it had little choice but to ask its former enemy. On April 28, 1862, Adj. Gen. Lorenzo Thomas, by the "express direction of the President of the United States," sent a telegram to Young making the rare request for help from the Army to a private citizen and the head of a church. If the army wanted Mormons in Utah to volunteer their services, Brigham Young was the only man who could make it happen.
Young was only too happy to oblige, relishing the fact that the Army needed his assistance. Although Lot Smith's company was to go beyond the boundaries of Utah into what is now Wyoming, Young was comfortable stretching his definition of a "home guard" - after all, the Mormon cavalry didn't even have to serve under "Gentile" (i.e., non-Mormon) officers. 
Within a few months, however, it was clear that the Civil War would not produce a Mormon reconciliation with the federal government. In August 1862, the Army asked Young to permit the re-enlistment of Lot Smith's men, evidently for further service outside the territory. Young tersely refused, and Utah's only military contribution to the Civil War came to an abrupt end.
Young had good reason to refuse: By the time of the Army's re-enlistment request, Congress had rejected another of Utah's regular and futile appeals for statehood. Congress had also carved an enormous chunk of territory out of western Utah to form the new Nevada Territory. It was also clear that despite wartime setbacks, Washington was not entirely neglecting its involvement in Utah affairs. Earlier that summer, Congress passed the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act, enabling the federal prosecution of Mormon polygamists. 
More immediately, Young refused to countenance the continued service of Lot Smith's men because he had learned that the Army had dispatched a brigade of California volunteers to garrison Utah for the remainder of the war. Col. Patrick Edward Connor, the unit's commander, made no secret of his anti-Mormon animosity. Even before reaching his new post, Connor accused its Mormon population of disloyalty and warned that those who uttered "treasonable sentiments in this district ... must seek a more genial soil, or receive the punishment they so richly merit." He bivouacked his men on a plateau overlooking Salt Lake City from the east, only three miles from Young's principal residence.
Disappointed at not joining the fighting in the East, Connor gladly would have brought about a military resolution to the "Mormon question." Instead, restrained by the cooler heads of his superiors, he had to content himself with several noteworthy acts of brutality against Indians in northern Utah and on the Western Plains, campaigns that brought him two promotions to major general. 
Young, meanwhile, seethed at the presence of Connor's troops. "If General Connor crosses my path," he warned in January 1865, "I will kill him." Despite their heated rhetoric, Young and Connor avoided sparking a military confrontation. 
Shifting gears with the Union's imminent victory, they organized a large celebration of Lincoln's second inauguration in March 1865. Though neither Young nor Connor made an appearance, a troop of Union soldiers and a group of Nauvoo Legion militiamen paraded through the streets of Salt Lake City. A month later, following Lincoln's assassination, Young lowered the flags over his mansion to half staff and had his gates draped in crepe.
The expressions of patriotism were too late to improve Utah's standing in the eyes of Washington. By 1865, the Republican Party had abolished one "twin relic of barbarism," and many within the party now contemplated the eradication of Mormon polygamy. Before the Civil War, westward expansion had produced bitter sectional divisions over slavery, divisions which impeded the assertion of federal power over those territories. Now, Washington was freer to devote its attention to the conquest, settlement and economic exploitation and integration of the West. It would be only a matter of time before the federal government took more decisive action against both polygamy and the church's political and economic control of Utah.

DUBAI - On a recent sunny day, Eric Swats, a fund manager at Rasmala Investments, sat under a parasol at a restaurant on the terrace of the Dubai International Finance Center, talking up his new $25 million Rasmala Global Sukuk Fund.
Mr. Swats hopes it will tap into fast-growing demand from Middle Eastern and Asian investors for sukuk, securities that comply with Islamic law. "The market for conservative and well-managed" Islamic finance products is "underserved and underdeveloped," he said over a lunch of salad and fruit juice.
The Middle East has proved a far tougher environment for financiers than the El Dorado it was imagined to be a few years ago. Bankers learned the hard way during the credit crunch that they could win business only by tailoring their offerings to the region's specific needs.
"We saw in the Golden Age of the mid-2000s a lot of firms coming to the region pushing high-margin investment banking," said Mathieu Vasseux, a partner in Dubai for the financial consultants Oliver Wyman. "Then it died out in 2007, 2008. A lot of firms had to reinvent themselves. For some it was rough. "
In the aftermath of the global credit market freeze, Dubai's financial center, which aspires to be the hub of the region, went deathly quiet. Now business is creeping back: Restaurants like Caf Bateel, where Mr. Swats was eating, are jammed with bankers in expensive suits.
But affiliations are shifting and the business is different. Mr. Swats, an American and a former Citigroup veteran, now works for a regional firm.
"U.S. and European banks are being forced to retrench" because of problems at home, said Nasser H. Saidi, chief economist of the Dubai International Financial Center. "Taking their place are banks from China, India and Turkey "that don't face these types of issues." Times have been tough for local banks, too, with Arcapita in Bahrain filing for bankruptcy in March and Shuaa Capital in Dubai going through a reorganization.
Mr. Vasseux estimates that employment in the region's investment banking industry is down about 20 percent from the precrisis peak. The overall drop would have been greater if banks had not been hiring asset managers and other specialists to focus on new business areas. "The landscape is slowly changing," said Mustafa Abdel-Wadood, a partner at the private equity firm Abraaj Capital, in Dubai.
Many bankers say that despite its vast wealth, the region has not developed as they expected. A few years ago Western banks were piling into Dubai, expecting it to become a hive of merger, acquisition and stock issue activity, like Hong Kong.
Although there was a modest boom, investment banking in the style of New York or London never really took off in the Middle East. Fees from activities like mergers and acquisitions and equity offerings fell to about $450 million in 2011 from a peak of about $1.4 billion in 2007, according to Thomson Reuters. One reason: Much regional business remains in government or family hands. Such owners tend to engage in fewer corporate transactions.
With juicy merger and acquisition gambits relatively rare, plain bond issuance has become a mainstay of Gulf investment banking. Other strong businesses include financing the hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of construction projects under way, from new industrial cities in Saudi Arabia and to a rail network in Qatar.
Helping to manage the region's wealth can be another profitable line, providing special access to deals in the West or, increasingly, Asia, for the region's huge government funds like those of Abu Dhabi, which has at least $600 billion set aside. In recent years, for instance, the sovereign wealth funds of Kuwait and Qatar have committed about $9 billion as anchor investors in the initial public offerings of Chinese banks while Mubadala, an Abu Dhabi fund, has an $8 billion joint venture with a Malaysian state company.
A look at the region's gross domestic product suggests "the M.&A. market doesn't do it justice," said Klaus Froehlich, co-head of Middle East investment banking in Dubai for Morgan Stanley. The sovereign wealth funds, he said, "have looked to generally invest in blue-chip companies and businesses outside of the region."
Instead, the lower-profit-margin business of underwriting bonds has become a more reliable area. So far this year, HSBC and Deutsche Bank, long active in the Gulf, are the region's top arrangers of debt.
They are also leaders in sukuks, securities designed to attract Middle Eastern and Asian investors who might refuse ordinary bond offerings because the interest they pay violates Islamic law. About $6 billion in sukuks - where the revenue is produced by real assets like property - were issued in the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council in the first quarter of this year, according to Emirates NBD bank in Dubai.
In another offering aimed at Asian investors, HSBC recently issued a $158 million bond denominated in Chinese renminbi for Emirates NBD. Such bonds "help establish the U.A.E. as a financing center for Asian investors," the bank says.
While debt underwriting has become a steady business for banks, Gulf stock markets remain volatile, even scary. In December the MSCI index gave a discouraging signal when it decided not to promote the U.A.E. and Qatar to the status of emerging markets, leaving them in the riskier frontier category. The reasons: Concerns about investor protection in the U.A.E. and about foreign ownership restrictions in Qatar.
After a dismal 2011 the Gulf markets are up this year, with most of the gains going to Saudi Arabia, which at more than $400 billion counts for about half of the region's market value. Majdi Gharzeddine, head of research at Kamco in Kuwait, credits much of the Saudi rise to new laws designed to open up the long-closed market for outside investors.
But the Gulf has no main financial hub that could concentrate the region's capital and provide one set of uniform regulations for investors. Instead, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates all continue to fight to attract funds and high-end jobs. The U.A.E. has no fewer than three stock exchanges.
"The Gulf's problem is that it is not a financial center; it is five or six financial clusters," said Rachel Ziemba, a senior Middle East analyst at Roubini Global Economics in London.
Dubai has the greatest ambitions to be the regional hub, and it is the only really congenial base for international financial professionals, but it has fallen short in its ambitions to be host to a global financial exchange. Ms. Ziemba said not having one big financial center left the Gulf vulnerable at times of financial crisis. It also may contribute to the light trading and volatility that scare away investors.
Exchanges are "one of the areas that need much more consolidation, starting with the U.A.E.," said Mr. Saidi, the economist. "We need much more consolidation across the region."

HEADLINE: The Dilemma of the Pregnant Addict

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: Protecting infants from opiate exposure scarcely needs argument. It's how to protect a child from exposure when the source is the child's mother that's proved more difficult to resolve. 

 BODY:
Compare and contrast: in the Science section on Tuesday morning, Pam Belluck reports on a study showing that the rates of pregnant women addicted to opiate drugs, and the number of babies born with withdrawal, have risen dramatically over the last decade.
The study estimated that every hour a baby is born in the United States with symptoms of withdrawal from opiates - roughly 13,500 babies a year. The condition, known as neonatal abstinence syndrome, can cause seizures, breathing problems, dehydration, difficulty feeding, tremors and irritability. Many infants are hospitalized for several weeks while doctors treat them with methadone or morphine to gradually wean them from their dependence on the drugs that their mothers used.
It's those same addictions that led to Ada Calhoun's piece The Criminalization of Bad Mothers in The New York Times Magazine. Ms. Calhoun profiled several mothers arrested for chemical endangerment of a child in Alabama, the "national capital for prosecuting women on behalf of their newborn children." As she described, that criminalization provokes multiple concerns among many: arguably, it sets aside pregnant women as a special class of citizen with different rights, creates a dangerous precedent by opening a "back door" into the "fetal personhood" argument against the availability of legal abortion, and produces unintended consequences by encouraging pregnant women with addiction problems to further avoid seeking medical care.
But if more and more pregnant women have untreated addictions, resulting in more babies who have been exposed to opiates in utero, it's hard to avoid a sense that something needs to be done. Although, as Ms. Belluck writes, studies of children born to cocaine-addicted mothers show that the long-term consequences of in utero exposure to opiates "are far from certain and much more likely if the child had to contend with economic hardship, family instability, poor education and other factors," maternal opiate addiction is already associated with additional hardships, and other research links in utero exposure to opiates with neurodevelopment impairment in toddlers. 
Protecting infants from opiate exposure scarcely needs argument. It's how to protect a child from exposure when the source is the child's mother that's proved more difficult to resolve, in no small part because successful treatment of the addicted mothers has also eluded us. Alabama's approach falls short there. The addicted mother trying to protect her unborn child from the impact of her withdrawal has no clear option, as Ms. Calhoun made clear:
The recommended treatment for opiate addiction during pregnancy is a controlled dosage of methadone, says Dr. Robert Newman, of the International Center for Advancement of Addiction Treatment at Beth Israel, who says a prognosis for both mother and baby is good with long-term outpatient treatment. ... Prosecutors I spoke with said they would not charge a woman taking prescribed methadone. But the law does not prohibit such a charge, and critics argue that the threat of prosecution discourages women from seeking addiction treatment. 
If Alabama's long-armed chemical endangerment prosecutions don't promote positive change (and I can find no evidence that opiate addiction rates among pregnant women, or rates of exposure among their infants, have decreased there since the chemical endangerment law was enacted in 2006), then what will? Addiction is a complex problem, and most of the people trying to offer help or solutions have only an intellectual understanding of its power. 
One woman Ms. Calhoun profiled in Alabama was offered drug treatment at an in-patient center, but refused it, in part because of the need to care for her two young children - children she can now see only once a week, on Sundays, after she gave birth to a healthy baby boy who tested positive for Oxycodone. In retrospect, hers is a frustrating failure to reach for a better outcome - and not unique. Can we twist out the impact of apparent bad choices from that of the addiction that influences everything about an addict's life? Failing that, can we find a way to prevent children from bearing the brunt of either? How can we help the pregnant addict and her unborn child?

HEADLINE: Climate Change and the Body Politic

BYLINE: JUSTIN GILLIS


HIGHLIGHT: History is short on examples of a society's taking action on behalf of beneficiaries who are two or more generations into the future if it involves sacrifice, a scientist suggests. 

 BODY:
The latest installment in our Temperature Rising series,just published, is about an argument between mainstream climate researchers and contrarians over how clouds will change on a warming planet. As their many other objections to climate science have been undermined by the growing evidence, the contrarians have settled on clouds as a kind of last-resort reason that the scientific majority just has to be wrong.
In the course of reporting the article, I had some intriguing conversations with scientists who had thought hard about how to frame the problem of climate change in the public mind.
Among the most thoughtful insights came from Kerry A. Emanuel, an atmospheric scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We sat in his office and talked for hours about clouds and their role in the climate, moving from that to larger topics as we looked out his window at a dazzling cloud display in the skies over Cambridge.
Part of our discussion centered on rhetoric. A favored tactic of contrarians, and especially skeptic bloggers, is to set up what scientists like Dr. Emanuel consider to be straw-man arguments that they can then knock down.
We routinely read, for instance, that climate scientists are predicting imminent catastrophe, the deaths of millions, mass starvation, galloping sea-level rise and so on. The goal seems to be to paint the scientists as alarmist so that when a catastrophe does not materialize right away, they are made to seem foolish.

But Dr. Emanuel and some of his colleagues argue that the case scientists are making to society is a lot sturdier than that. Not only do most scientists not predict imminent catastrophe as a result of the warming of the planet, they formally acknowledge a wide range of uncertainty in the potential outcomes. Catastrophes of all sorts are among those possible outcomes, but few scientists claim these are certain, much less imminent.
What they say they are quite certain of is this: Society is running a risk. 
"I can say that my field is almost unanimous in saying that we are facing serious risk," is the way Dr. Emanuel put it to me. "Things could turn out to be fine - I hope they do. But there's no evidence at all that would support an assertion that we're not facing serious risk at this point."
Scientists like Dr. Emanuel argue that the exact magnitude of the risk cannot and will not be quantified until it is too late to head off the potential ill consequences. Until society learns to think of the problem that way, the political discussion about climate change is likely to remain paralyzed.
Oddly enough, people do manage to think this way every day, and act accordingly. The chance of any given house burning down is far less than 1 percent a year, yet people routinely cough up hundreds of dollars a year to protect themselves against that possibility - by buying insurance.
Yet, as a society, we do not seem to be able to manage the same trick. We formally committed ourselves 20 years ago to take out some insurance against climate change by lowering our greenhouse emissions, but we have yet to close the deal, to adopt a comprehensive set of limits.
It would seem that our national policy, in effect, is to cross our fingers and hope that the majority of scientists, that is, 97 percent of them, turn out to be wrong, and the small band of contrarian climate scientists turns out to be right. Perhaps, as the contrarians claim to know for certain, clouds on a warming planet will indeed shift in such a way as to offset most of the warming.
And if that proves to be a vain hope, where will we be? We will have been warned, at least. 
As he contemplates the seeming inability of the body politic to heed that warning, Dr. Emanuel has been repairing lately to a study of history. He has been reading, for instance, about the mass delusion that settled over Germany in the 1930s. Without drawing any moral comparison between the issues posed then and now, he points out the willingness of many people today to believe that climate scientists are engaged in some sort of hoax, and wonders if we are seeing another instance of mass delusion at work.
"You know, it's a crazy idea, that of scientists are corrupt," Dr. Emanuel said. "But some people believe that."
Perhaps it is simply easier and less mentally taxing to conjure up conspiracy theories than it would be to accept the findings of climate science, with all that would entail about the changes needed in our economy and energy system.
"People only believe crazy ideas, in the end, if they get something out of believing crazy ideas," Dr. Emanuel said. "The 'get,' in this case, is that they don't have to worry so much."
Like many other scientists, he acknowledges that asking people to sacrifice something today for the sake of generations yet unborn is asking a lot. He wishes that society would focus on that issue specifically - how much sacrifice, if any, is the right amount for the present generation to make - but in this country, the discussion has simply not matured to that point. And in the meantime, a clock is ticking as greenhouse gases continue to rise.
"Is there an example from human history of a culture taking action with the intended beneficiaries being two or more generations downstream, when there's no benefit or maybe even sacrifice to the current generation?" Dr. Emanuel said in the interview. 
"I haven't been able to come up with one, and I suspect we're just not genetically programmed to worry about two generations downstream," he said. "That may be the heart of the problem."

HEADLINE: A Right to Sing the Blues

BYLINE: WHITNEY BOYD


HIGHLIGHT: Jimmy Williams has been photographing elderly blues musicians. He portrays these masters of the blues - and life - in a way that elevates them to their rightful place in American music. 

 BODY:
Maybe it was the form that John Dee Holeman's frail fingers took when wrapped around his guitar. Perhaps it was the passion in his soft voice as he recounted growing up in North Carolina, learning to play the blues while tending to the family tobacco farm.
Jimmy Williams is not certain what captivated him first, but after speaking to Mr. Holeman about his love for his guitar and his daily struggles to survive, Mr. Williams knew he wanted to tell the guitarist's story. 
It was 2006 when Mr. Williams, 58, was first introduced to Mr. Holeman and more than 20 other blues musicians through the Music Maker Relief Foundation, an organization dedicated to preserving blues music by financially supporting older musicians. Partnering with the foundation, Mr. Williams had access to hundreds of blues musicians, most in their 70s and 80s, who had never been photographed professionally.
"I try to photograph them in a way that elevates them on a level that I think of them," Mr. Williams said. "These blues musicians are the very threads of American music."
In exchange for their time, Mr. Williams granted the foundation and the musicians unlimited use of the photos, while also sharing a percentage of his print sales with the foundation.
He has traveled throughout the South and met artists like Boo Hanks, 84, a singer and guitar player, who, with the help of the foundation, recorded his first album at 79. In Carrboro, N.C., he met James "Bubba" Norwood, 70, a drummer who played with Ike and Tina Turner. He even went to an assisted living home to visit Whistlin' Britches, the blues singer known for clicking his tongue.
What struck Mr. Williams the most while visiting his subjects was the pride that they had in their music, despite their economic hardships. Without the assistance of the foundation, many of these artists would find it difficult to pay for basic living expenses, like groceries and bus fare.
But Mr. Williams had no intention of focusing on their difficulties.
"A lot of the musicians that I have photographed - life has not been kind to them," Mr. Williams said. "It would be very easy to take a photograph of them in their hardship times, and it would be easy to understand their story. But you would walk away thinking that the person deserves to be singing the blues."
When Mr. Williams began the project, with Mr. Holeman as his first subject, his direction was not clearly defined.
"I just kept thinking, let's just see how this first one goes," Mr. Williams said. "If the foundation likes it, we'll just go from there." After capturing the image of Mr. Holeman holding his guitar and with a cigarette perched on his lips, he said he knew people would want to know more about him.
"The expression on his face, his posture, the intensity of his gaze," Mr. Williams said. "He appears to be so proud."
To establish trust before a shoot, Mr. Williams would speak to his subjects for almost three hours to learn about their personal lives. After taking hundreds, sometimes thousands of photos of each musician, Mr. Williams said he would then go back to his studio and choose the photos that moved him.
Mr. Williams then frames several large prints of his chosen image and sends copies to the musician and the relief foundation.
Timothy Duffy, founder of the Music Maker Relief Foundation, said that when the musicians received their photograph, they were overwhelmed with excitement.
"One day, John Dee came by the office with his girlfriend," Mr. Duffy recalled. "He pointed straight to his photograph hanging on my wall. You could see the smile creep on his face."
Mr. Williams said his only request for each musician was that they dress the way they normally would when performing on stage. When he met Bishop Dready Manning and his wife, Marie, at their church in Roanoke Rapids, N.C., they were wearing matching salamander pink suits.
"Can you imagine what I was thinking when they walked in the door?" Mr. Williams asked. "I just thought, 'Oh wow, this is such a wonderful and beautiful surprise. I couldn't make this up even if I tried.' "

HEADLINE: Cuba May Be the Most Feminist Country in Latin America

BYLINE: LUISITA LOPEZ TORREGROSA


HIGHLIGHT: Cuba, although poorer, has a better record on women's status and advancement than the economic behemoth of Brazil, not to mention the rest of Latin America. But will the economic liberalization on the island reverse women's progress there? 

 BODY:
NEW YORK - Cuba may just be the most feminist country in Latin America.
It ranks No. 3 in the world when it comes to the political participation of women in Parliament, according to a United Nations survey on women in politics. And it's the only nation in Latin America to rank in the top 20 in the World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap Report 2011.
In sheer numbers and percentages, Cuban women's advance is notable. Cuba has a high number of female professional and technical workers (60 percent of the total work force in those areas) and in Parliament (43 percent), as well as high levels of primary, secondary and tertiary education enrollment, according to the Gender Gap report. 
In contrast, Brazil, the region's economic behemoth, ranks 82nd overall in the world, according to the report, though it moved up three places last year with improvements in women's wages, estimated earned income and the election of a female head of state, President Dilma Rousseff.
What explains Cuba's record?
Sarah Stephens, the director of the Center for Democracy in the Americas, a Washington-based advocacy and research organization that focuses on Cuba and U.S.-Cuba relations and opposes the U.S. embargo, is working on a report on the status of women in Cuba. "Cuban women tell us that they feel lucky to have come of age since 1959," she says. "Before 1959, women comprised only 5 percent of university graduates and only 12 percent of the work force, often holding menial jobs." 
Today, she says, women make up 41 percent of the Communist Party, half of the island's work force, the majority of students in high schools and universities, 60 percent of university faculties and the majority of provosts and department heads (but not presidents). And women hold top portfolios in ministries and in key provincial positions.
"Fidel Castro called for women's rights as a 'revolution within a revolution' and this commitment became tangible through changes in legislation and policy," Ms. Stephens says.
But, that said, "women within the system argue strongly for what remains to be done, and they criticize the gaps between rhetoric and practice," Ms. Stephens says. "Women speak to us about a 'gender paradox' in Cuba - a nation legally committed to equality but harnessed to a historic structure of patriarchy."
Going forward, in the more market-oriented economic restructuring that will lay off thousands of state workers, women fear they will lose their jobs and will not find non-state employment in jobs traditionally held by men, Ms. Stephens says. 
"Women also worry that the aging of Cuba's population will increase family burdens, and hence women's burdens," she says. "As the reforms to the economic model take place, and Cuba stops, for example, lunch programs at work, more food will need to be prepared at home, and that will land on women."
Politically, there's a glass ceiling, Ms. Stephens says. "It's evident by looking at Cuba's most senior leadership around President Ral Castro." 
My Page Two column shows how women's advances across Latin America are surpassing the United States and matching Europe. 
A previous version of this post misspelled Dilma Rousseff's name.

HEADLINE: Romney Quietly Meets With Bloomberg

BYLINE: MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: Pursuing an endorsement, Mitt Romney has breakfast with the New York City mayor. 

 BODY:
The pursuit of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's presidential endorsement is headed into overdrive. 
On Tuesday, Mitt Romney had a private breakfast with Mr. Bloomberg at the headquarters of the mayor's philanthropic foundation on Manhattan's Upper East Side, according to two people briefed on the meeting.
It was the first meeting between Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire media mogul, and Mr. Romney, the former chief executive of a private equity firm.
Over coffee and juice, the two discussed several staples of Mr. Bloomberg's agenda in Washington over the last decade: the economy, immigration, education and even gun control (a topic on which the two man are not entirely on the same page).
The meeting came just a few days after Mr. Bloomberg spent the afternoon with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., according to people close to the mayor.
The men played golf on Friday in the Washington, D.C. area, according to a person told of their outing. 
Mr. Bloomberg, an independent who founded one of the world's largest media companies and is known as a generous political donor, did not endorse in the last presidential race but is said to be open to doing so this time around.
His imprimatur could be useful to either candidates, conveying the approval of a businessman known for his common-sense and nonpartisan governing style.
So far, though, it is the White House that has lavished the most attention on Mr. Bloomberg, despite his sometimes fraught relationship with Mr. Obama. (Among other things, the mayor has complained that under Mr. Obama, his friends on Wall Street feel "vilified").
The president hosted the mayor for lunch at the White House a few weeks ago, during which Mr. Obama asked the mayor what he wanted to do after leaving City Hall. And Mr. Obama himself played golf with the mayor in the summer of 2010.

HEADLINE: Eight Things I Learned From Reading Every Last Word of Bloomberg BusinessWeek

BYLINE: LAUREN KERN


HIGHLIGHT: From "spring cleaning" in private-equity firms to how to write about a drug war, the eight things I learned from reading every last word of Bloomberg Businessweek. 

 BODY:
I'm slightly embarrassed to admit that my baseline understanding of private equity comes mainly from movies ("Wall Street," "Pretty Woman," "Other People's Money") in which the profession is used as shorthand to tell audiences that a character is really, really, really bad. Despite the chainsaw-wielding corporate evildoer on the cover of this week's Bloomberg BusinessWeek, the magazine presents a much kinder, gentler version of private equity. The corporate restructuring artists here are like fairy godmothers who show up to organize your closet and teach you a few time-saving life hacks. They turn inefficient manufacturing companies into hyperefficient economic engines, improving people's work environments and maybe even saving the whole idea of North American manufacturing in the process. They're not out to fire people, just to eliminate waste (though sometimes that waste turns out to be people). But let's not get distracted by that. The real trouble, according to the article by Brendan Greeley, is that closets don't stay reorganized for long. "Private equity," he writes, "is a castle in the sand, a brief victory for order in the constant slide toward entropy." But by the time you've stopped putting your shoes back into their clearly labeled transparent plastic containers, your company has been sold to its next owner.
Other things I learned from Bloomberg BusinessWeek:

        
The private-equity firm in the story uses the "Toyota Production System" to improve operations in its manufacturing companies. It's a very Japanese philosophy that begins with, essentially, a spring cleaning: seri, seiton, seiso, sieketsu, shitsuke. Or, in English: sort, straighten, sweep, standardize, sustain.

        
"For $1,299, anyone can now buy a 3-D printer, hook it up to a Wi-Fi network, and begin downloading files that will turn into real objects." That and a $50 spool of plastic thread will produce 15 bracelets for holding an iPod Nano, each of which takes 90 minutes to print. Or, you could just go on Amazon and order a similar bracelet for $2.09 in about 15 seconds.

        
How to cover a drug war if you don't want to wind up dead: the newsweekly Riodoce in the Mexican city of Culiacn "doesn't write about the narcos, nor does it write about the legitimate businesses that the cartels run or contract with unless that information is already public. And it does not publish details about the drug-trafficking infrastructure - the routes used to transport drugs or the locations of safe houses, airstrips or training camps." Evidently, there is still plenty to write about.

 

        
In the United States, "$12 billion worth of goods and services are traded every year without any currency changing hands." You can even barter your way to a breast enhancement.

        
The French aren't into breast-feeding, and a Frenchwoman named Elisabeth Badinter has written a book about how breast-feeding, along with the other obligations of modern motherhood, has set women back. That might be news to the Facebook chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, who says she pumped breast milk during conference calls when she worked at Google.

        
To justify sky-high chief executive pay, corporate boards often compare themselves to companies that are much larger and not even in the same industry (therefore not competing for the same talent). "CBS compares its C.E.O.'s pay to packages at companies up to 15 times its size," which helped get Leslie Moonves $69.9 million in compensation last year.

        
There are 173 different burgers to order in the West Village in New York and 363 burgers in the East Village. Not surprisingly, the East Village burgers are cheaper.

        
Dot-com office culture is alive and well at the Nokia headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif., where you can play Galaga in the third-floor arcade. I wonder what the efficiency experts would think about that.

HEADLINE: A Grim Portrait of Palm Oil Emissions

BYLINE: JOANNA M. FOSTER


HIGHLIGHT: A new study suggests that, if anything, a recent E.P.A. finding underestimated the greenhouse gas emissions related to palm oil production in Asia. 

 BODY:
Indonesia ranks right behind the United States and China in the lineup of the world's top 10 greenhouse gas emitters. It's not because of smokestacks or freeways, but massive deforestation starting in the 1990s -- driven In large part by the expansion of plantations for palm oil, an edible vegetable oil used in cookies, crackers, soap and European diesel fuel. 
In January, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a proposed finding that biofuels derived from palm oil feedstocks failed to meet the standards set by the agency's 2007 renewable fuels mandate. While they were found to have lower life-cycle emissions than conventional gasoline and diesel, palm oil came up short of the 20 percent reduction in related emissions that is required for inclusion in the new biofuel blends. 
A public comment period on the finding ended last week after being extended by two months to accommodate the deluge of feedback. Many of the comments submitted came from the palm oil industry, which asserts that the E.P.A.'s estimates of palm oil-related emissions are seriously exaggerated. 
Yet there is growing evidence that, if anything, the E.P.A.'s life-cycle emissions calculations for palm oil. were too conservative. A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences used socioeconomic surveys, high-resolution satellite imagery and carbon mapping to plot past and future patterns of land conversion for a representative region in Indonesia, the Ketapang district of West Kalimantan Province in Borneo.
The researchers found that about two-thirds of the land outside protected areas in the study region are now leased to oil palm companies. If these conceded lands are converted to palm-fruit plantations at current expansion rates, one-third of the land in the area will be growing palms and intact forests will shrink to less than 4 percent of land cover by 2020.
One of the most striking trends, in terms of emissions, was a shift toward the development of carbon-dense peatlands for palm oil production, the researchers found. Peatland soils store significant amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
 Their study said that by 2008, 70 percent of new plantations were being developed on peatlands; it predicted that up to 90 percent of emissions from palm oil plantations will come from peatlands by 2020. 
Recognizing the climate dangers posed by the draining of peatlands for cultivation, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono issued a moratorium on the granting of new palm oil concessions in peatlands last year. This does nothing, however, to prevent development on previously allocated leases on peatlands, which make up an estimated 61 percent of all as-yet undeveloped concessions. 
Currently, half of all palm oil in the study area is being grown on peatlands, according to the study, a number that sharply contrasts with the E.P.A.'s estimate of only 13 percent for all of Indonesia.
Kimberly Carlson, a doctoral candidate at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and a co-author of the study, suggested that the outlook was pretty bleak. She said that while she hoped that more palm oil producers would become certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil -- certified Kalimantan palm oil comprises less than 5 percent of Indonesian palm oil production -- it was important that laws already on the books be enforced.
"We could talk about new protections and conservation schemes, but there are already laws on the books protecting against the development of peatlands that are more than three meters deep and laws against burning to clear land for palm oil," she said. "But they are not enforced. We do need more protections, but a good place to start would be enforcing the rules that already exist." 
Ms. Carlson also drew attention to the impact of palm oil production on local communities. 
"This isn't just a story of carbon and forests," she said. "There are people who live here and are trying to make a living who are seriously affected by the palm oil industries' land grabs."

HEADLINE: Most Workers Lack Disability Insurance, Survey Finds

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Most workers aren't covered by disability insurance, a new survey finds. 

 BODY:
Two-thirds of Americans who work in the private sector lack disability insurance, even though most workers say missing work for three months or more because of sickness or injury would cause "financial hardship," a new survey finds.
The survey was conducted for the Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit coalition of consumer groups that supports expansion of employer-provided disability insurance, and Unum, which sells disability and other types of employer-provided insurance.
The Opinion Research Corporation polled nearly 1,200 adult workers by telephone in late March and early April. The survey's margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.
Stephen Brobeck, the federation's executive director, said consumers would be well served if all employers offered workers the chance to buy disability insurance, as a way to provide a financial safety net for working Americans. Disability insurance "complements and supplements" other programs, like workers' compensation and Social Security disability insurance, which are insufficient by themselves, he said.
"Workers need better protection," he said during a conference call with reporters about the survey.
Workers' compensation coverage is important, he said, but it is available only for workers who become ill or injured on the job - and most illnesses or injuries causing work loss occur outside the workplace. And Social Security disability benefits are typically minimal - about $1,100 a month on average.
Disability insurance, meanwhile, pays for lost income caused by injury or illness suffered away from work. (Short-term disability insurance generally covers periods of about three months up to a year, while long-term disability insurance covers more extended absences, according to Unum's Web site).
Depending on the details of the disability plan, payments can begin as soon as one week after the employee stops working and cover about 60 percent of his or her wages or salary.
According to statistics from the Council of Disability Awareness cited by the report, 90 percent of all disability claims are for common illnesses and health conditions, rather than from injuries. And, according to the Society of Actuaries, once someone is disabled for 90 days, the average length of disability is two years. My colleague Ron Lieber looked at the odds of needing disability insurance a few years ago.
Do you have disability insurance through your employer? Have you ever had to use it?

HEADLINE: Buyout Kings Size Up Their Sector, the Elections and Europe

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: The big private equity titans discuss the lack of big buyouts and the perception of the industry in the United States and abroad. And one predicts boom years for the sector if Mitt Romney is elected. 

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- The Milken Institute Global Conference happened to coincide with May 1, the day Occupy Wall Street picked to reinvigorate its ranks with a series of marches and protests across the country. Inside the financier-filled Beverly Hilton here, though, the Occupy movement seemed a world away.
As attendees filed into the hotel ballroom for a panel on private equity, in the background played capitalism-themed songs - "You Never Give Me Your Money" and "If I Had a Million Dollars" among them.
The private equity panel, one of the most anticipated events of the conference, brought together Apollo Management's Leon D. Black, TPG Capital's David Bonderman, Providence Equity Partners' Jonathan Nelson, Leonard Green's Jonathan Sokoloff and Thomas H. Lee Partners' Scott Sperling to discuss the state of the buyout business. 
The abbreviated version of the 90-minute panel: Europe is a mess, Asia is exciting, emerging markets can be dangerous, the Obama administration has created uncertainty around regulation and taxes, and even though the debt markets are wide open and companies are flush with cash, few big buyouts are likely to happen until after the presidential election.
"I would think, if Romney gets elected, there will be a boom in the markets," Mr. Black said. "But right now, it's a tossup. If Obama is elected, I think there'll be a continuation of the regulatory and tax pressures. A lot of that cash on the sidelines is waiting to see what happens."
Mr. Bonderman spoke about Europe, saying that the Continent is "going nowhere forever." 
Europe's disarray would typically give private equity firms an opportunity to swoop in and pick up distressed assets, he said. But European regulators are not likely to force firms to sell assets, as American regulators did during the financial crisis. He added that TPG's investment strategy was to "stay away from impossible governments and impossible tax regimes," citing India as a difficult country in which to pull off big deals.
Most of the panel agreed that the appetite for huge, multibillion-dollar leveraged buyouts still had not recovered since the financial crisis. 
"The largest deals are out," Mr. Nelson said. "They're off the table. But most firms have experienced a pretty steady flow in small-cap deals."
"Three years ago was the time to back up the trucks," Mr. Black added. "There are still some opportunities here, but it's not like shooting fish in a barrel like it was three years ago."
The discussion's tone soured when talk turned to the Obama administration and the current state of regulation. Participants in the panel spoke about Dodd-Frank Act and the JOBS Act, characterizing both as generally misguided or poorly executed. And they expressed concern that America seemed to respect big business less than some other countries do. 
"The difference in view outside the U.S. generally is so much different than in the U.S.," Mr. Nelson said. Elsewhere in the world, he added, "we are welcomed. We hear, 'How can we help you?'"
Of a recent business trip to Asia, Mr. Nelson said, "I actually feel respected when I'm making those visits."
Mr. Sokoloff said that in a recently closed financing round, 40 percent of the money the firm raised was based outside the United States.
Absent from the panel were executives from Carlyle Group, the giant private equity firm that is said to be headed for an initial public offering. Asked whether he thought Carlyle's choice to go public was a good thing, Mr. Black said, "I think it's great. I think the more the merrier."
Given the chance to make a few final remarks, Mr. Black, whose 60th birthday bash was covered by DealBook, echoed the sentiments of many at the conference. 
"Isn't capitalism great?" he asked.

HEADLINE: Furor Over Executive Pay Is Not the Revolt It Appears to Be

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: While protests over pay might make corporate governance activists happier to think they are a sign of change, they are more likely to dissipate once the media attention surrounding them dies down. 

 BODY:
Shareholder protests over excessive executive pay have erupted at Barclays, Citigroup and Chesapeake Energy. Could this be the beginning of a corporate Arab Spring?
Don't bet on it. Each of these cases reflects a particular outrage against poor compensation practices. While it might make corporate governance activists and the Occupy Wall Street movement happier to think these events are a sign of change, these protests are more likely to dissipate once the media attention surrounding them dies down.
In Citigroup's case, about 55 percent of shareholders voted against Citigroup's executive compensation package. The flash point was last year's pay of the bank's chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit, which the influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services calculates could be as much as $49 million.
The only surprise about this vote was that so many shareholders still voted in favor. Citigroup's stock has declined more than 90 percent in the last five years, and the company has been a prime example of mismanagement in the years leading up to the financial crisis. Mr. Pandit stabilized the ship, and Citigroup argued that he had been underpaid in previous years, with a salary of only a $1 a year.
But Citigroup conveniently ignored the fact that I.S.S. concluded his pay last year was above the median for comparable finance chief executives. Citigroup had also paid Mr. Pandit hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire his firm, Old Lane Partners, an investment it has written off completely. Shareholders simply had enough.
In Barclays' case, shareholders actually heckled management at the annual meeting. When people yell in Britain, it is serious business and a sign that resentment of financial firms is even greater there than it is in the United States. More notably, despite this furor, only 26.9 percent of Barclays shareholders voted against the $10 million pay package of the chief executive, Robert E. Diamond Jr.
Then there is Chesapeake. The company had previously granted its chief executive, Aubrey K. McClendon, the right to buy up to a 2.5 percent interest in every well it drilled. Reuters reported that Mr. McClendon had borrowed $1.1 billion to purchase these interests. In the wake of the subsequent outcry, one analyst called for the Chesapeake board to be removed because of its "unwillingness" to stop these practices. I would argue that the board should be removed for simple lack of common sense.
All three companies now appear contrite. Richard D. Parsons, the retiring chairman of the Citigroup board, has said, "We're going to have some more conversation with our shareholders ... and then fix it. "Barclays' chairman, Marcus Agius, has apologized to shareholders for not considering their views, and Barclays executives have revised the components of their compensation. And Chesapeake's board has announced that it will end the well-repurchase program 18 months early and is reviewing the exact nature of Mr. McClendon's financing arrangements. On Tuesday, Mr. McClendon announced he would resign as Chesapeake's board chairman, but not as chief executive.
These instances drew shareholder attention, but a majority of companies escape scrutiny. Median pay for executives at 200 major companies was $9.6 million in 2010 according to a studyconducted for The New York Times by Equilar, a compensation consultant. This figure was a 12 percent rise over 2009 figures, and the majority of these executives are now being paid above prerecession levels.
Say-on-pay provisions have given shareholders an outlet to express their opinions on this unchecked growth, but most of them don't seem to care enough to express that opinion strongly. According to the I.S.S., only eight companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index failed their say-on-pay votes last year. Only 30 companies in the Russell 3,000 received negative votes because of say-on-pay rules. Recommendations by I.S.S. to vote no on pay were ignored about nine out of 10 times.
There is no reason to think that the "no" votes are going to be any higher this year. Even I.S.S. does not make its recommendation on the size of the pay package, but rather how it is tied to performance.
In Britain, where the outrage over executive compensations seems to be louder, little is being done to rein in pay. Say-on-pay provisions have been around in Britain for about a decade, but pay of chief executives has continued to increase. One study foundthat there were fewer than a dozen negative votes in the first six years that say-on-pay was introduced.
The fact is that shareholders - except for activist hedge funds who specialize in agitating for change - have little incentive to act. If they don't like a company's practices, they can simply sell and invest in another company. Compare this with shareholder activism, which is not only costly but risky, with benefits accruing to all other shareholders.
Moreover, pay is often a small part of a company's expenses. Citigroup has a balance sheet of almost $2 trillion, so who really wants to spend time scrutinizing $50 million in light of the larger issues the company faces? Directors, too, would prefer to devote their scrutiny on the operation of the company and might not want to challenge the chief executive over pay.
These are all old reasons that pay continues to spiral upward, but recent events don't change anything. The best we are going to get, even in egregious cases, is a few apologies and tweaks. Let's see what these companies do once the rage fades in a few years. Citigroup's board has yet to announce any compensation changes.
Expect to see a few headlines this proxy season about financial companies and perhaps a handful of no votes because of say-on-pay provisions. Companies may even adjust their pay packages to conform more with I.S.S. recommendations on tying pay to performance.
But this is just tinkering at the edges at best. Thousands of other companies will go on as before, safe in knowing that the dynamics of the corporation and say-on-pay will not touch them unless they have an eye-popping example like the Chesapeake chief executive's deal.
If anything, say-on-pay provisions are likely to have the opposite effect from what was intended, as shareholders validate pay proposals in Soviet-style fashion. The fact that executive compensation increased more than 12 percent in the first year after say-on-pay was introduced doesn't give much comfort.

HEADLINE: Once an Ambitious Law Firm, Reduced to Grim Dispatches

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The slow economy and cost-cutting at companies have hurt many of the nation's law firms, including Dewey &#038; LeBoeuf. 

 BODY:
A few dozen students from some of the nation's top law schools received a distressing e-mail last Friday from Dewey & LeBoeuf. The law firm's 2012 summer internship program, which would have paid the students more than $3,000 a week, was being canceled.
On Monday, about 50 former Dewey partners opened their in-boxes to find a poignant note. A fellow former partner said he was starting an assistance fund for Dewey staff and junior lawyers who might find themselves unemployed.
The same day, Dewey's remaining partners received a grim dispatch from the firm's leadership. Given Dewey's state, management encouraged them to look for new jobs.
These are dark days for Dewey & LeBoeuf, the New York law firm on the brink of collapse amid a partner exodus. Forged by a 2007 merger, it had set its sights on quickly becoming a global powerhouse in corporate law, employing more than 1,300 lawyers in 26 offices across the globe at its peak. Now the firm is teetering under the weight of too much debt and outsize pay guarantees made to its star lawyers.
 Lawyers and staff, unable to focus on their client matters, milled about Dewey's office "shellshocked" on Tuesday, according to an employee. At one point, there was confusion over whether the firm's health care provider had suspended medical coverage, leading the firm to send an officewide e-mail blaming an "administrative issue" for the apparent suspension and explaining that coverage would soon be fully restored.
"Law firms aren't very joyful places even when things are going well," said the Dewey employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "How would I describe the atmosphere now? The first word that comes to mind is funereal."
Dewey's woes reflect in large part the challenges faced by other big law firms throughout the country that are trying to grow in a slow economy populated by cost-conscious companies. While it may not be as extreme as in the case of Dewey, a widening divide in pay between senior lawyers and the junior ones who are responsible for much of the work is creating tensions at some firms. For many in the legal industry, Dewey's turmoil is a sobering lesson on unchecked ambitions.
Tuesday brought more setbacks for Dewey, whose roots go back to 1909. The firm's partners in London are exploring a possible wind-down of the firm's British arm, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation. Dewey's British operation, which also encompasses its Paris office and is a separate legal entity from the United States partnership, has more than 200 lawyers and support staff.
At least four partners in the United States walked out the door on Tuesday. Stuart M. Saft, the global head of the real estate practice, decamped to the law firm Holland & Knight.
Mr. Saft, whose clients include the developers Harry Macklowe and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, said on Tuesday that he was deeply saddened by Dewey's woes, but had no choice but to leave given the firm's uncertain fate. He said 43 firms had recruited him since problems surfaced in March.
"I postponed leaving the firm as long as I possibly could because I felt that leaving would only further destabilize the situation," said Mr. Saft, who said that all of his clients were moving with him to his new firm.
Nearly 90 of the firm's 300 partners have departed since January. Also on Tuesday, a pair of private equity partners, Ilan S. Nissan and Christian C. Nugent, left for Goodwin Procter. Lyle Roberts, a securities litigator in Washington, joined Cooley.
The steep, persistent decline in its partnership rolls has jeopardized the firm. Like Mr. Saft, many departing partners are taking their clients with them. And the firm has breached covenants in lending agreements with its banks, which require a law firm to maintain a minimum number of partners.
Yet even as it lost talent over the last several months, Dewey continued to handle prominent assignments. Its lawyers represented the Los Angeles Dodgers in the baseball team's bankruptcy and eventual sale. A team of merger and acquisition lawyers in Silicon Valley recently advised the computer company Dell on two takeovers. And the firm is defending the gene sequencing firm Illumina from a hostile bid by the drug giant Roche.
Dewey's leadership is working around the clock to save the firm. Martin J. Bienenstock, the head of its restructuring practice, said this week that the firm had no plans to file for bankruptcy.
In recent weeks, Mr. Bienenstock, joined by three other partners in Dewey's "office of the chairman," has been trying to structure a complex transaction in which they would file a prearranged bankruptcy and strike a merger deal with another law firm. Such a deal could help Dewey's partners avoid a painful dissolution and protect them from claims by the firm's creditors.
One possible asset that has been largely overlooked as Dewey seeks a merger partner is the firm's prime real estate in Midtown Manhattan, according to people with knowledge of the firm's finances.
Dewey operates out of 10 floors at 1301 Avenue of the Americas, a luxury office building, with a below-market, long-term lease that could be valuable to a potential acquirer or for a sublease. The elegant, wood-paneled offices were used for scenes in the George Clooney legal thriller "Michael Clayton."
Standing on the sidelines as Dewey tries to save itself is Steven H. Davis, the firm's former chairman, who was ousted from his leadership posts last weekend. The Manhattan district attorney's office is investigating whether Mr. Davis committed any crimes in his management of the firm.
Barry A. Bohrer, a lawyer for Mr. Davis, says his client is confident that the investigation will conclude that he did nothing wrong. "Every action of Mr. Davis as chair of the firm was taken in good faith and in the best interests of the firm," Mr. Bohrer said.
Yet the turmoil at Dewey & LeBoeuf has its origins in a boom-era law firm merger pushed by Mr. Davis. The firm was the product of a combination between the New York firms Dewey Ballantine and LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae in 2007. At the time, Dewey was having some financial difficulties, but Mr. Davis broached Dewey on the idea of the merger, arguing that law firms needed to get bigger to compete in a global economy. Mr. Davis was also said to be enamored with the Dewey name and its "white shoe" aura.
Legal industry experts are also questioning whether Mr. Davis's rabid growth strategy was in the best interests of the firm. Mr. Davis extended dozens of lucrative long-term contracts to Dewey's lawyers to keep the existing partners happy and poach star lawyers from other firms. While large corporate law firms have increasingly used guarantees to attract talent, the scope and scale of Dewey's pay packages was an outlier.
Several Dewey partners had pay packages worth more than $5 million a year. These so-called rainmakers include Morton A. Pierce, a mergers and acquisitions deal maker; Michael L. Fitzgerald, a corporate lawyer specializing in Latin America; and Berge Setrakian, a partner with a large international practice. All three have remained at the firm.
Last fall, after it became evident that the firm's profits would disappoint, Mr. Davis disclosed that about 100 lawyers had guarantees of some kind, putting the firm in financial straits. Salaries were slashed for several partners who had multimillion-dollar annual pay packages, including Henry C. Bunsow, a patent litigator in San Francisco, and Alan Salpeter, a Chicago trial lawyer. Neither has left Dewey.
Multimillion-dollar payouts were never a concern for the roughly 1,000 employees who make up Dewey's support staff. John J. Altorelli, a former Dewey partner now at DLA Piper, e-mailed his former partners on Monday to start an assistance fund if they find themselves out of a job. He said he was making an initial donation of $10,000 and urged others to chip in.
"I hope you are all doing well under the circumstances," Mr. Altorelli wrote.

HEADLINE: Boasting About Bin Laden

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: How can we not politicize national security, given how central it is to the work of the modern presidency? 

 BODY:
Savvy politicians know that it's usually a good sign when a political advertisement provokes cries of outrage from the opposition. The picture gets murkier, though, when that same advertisement prompts high-minded expressions of disappointment from the politician's own supporters. Sometimes that's a signal that the ad in question has overreached and risks a backlash. But sometimes it's just a sign that those high-minded supporters don't recognize the weakness that the ad is trying to exploit, or just don't have the stomach for a necessary fight.
This is the dilemma the Obama re-election campaign faces with the ad it released recently suggesting that Mitt Romney might not have given the order to send Navy SEALS to kill Osama Bin Laden. The attack clearly touched a nerve with Republicans, but it also earned the White House a rebuke from several liberals, including no less a left-wing eminence than Arianna Huffington. 
On the Early Show on CBS, Huffington called the ad "despicable," suggested that questioning an opponent's ability to serve as commander-in-chief is "not the way to run campaigns on either side," and compared the attack to the "3 A.M. phone call" ad Hillary Clinton's campaign released in 2008, which made a similar case against then-candidate Obama's ability to make the toughest national security decisions.
When even Huffington thinks a Democratic attack goes too far, it usually has. And yet a moment's scrutiny reveals that her argument doesn't make much sense. Why do we have election seasons, after all, if not to argue about which candidate would be better-suited to making decisions that put Americans in harm's way overseas? How can we politicize national security, given how central it is to the work of the modern presidency, and how unconstrained the executive branch's national security powers have become no matter which party holds the White House?
These are the arguments that Hillary Clinton partisans mounted in defense of that "3 A.M. ad," and that George W. Bush's partisans mounted in defense of his 9/11-centric 2004 re-election campaign. And those arguments were right! It's one thing to say that candidates shouldn't impugn one another's patriotism. But impugning a rival's judgment, as the Obama camp's Bin Laden advertisement just did, is precisely what a presidential campaign is for.
Strategically, too, the White House has every reason to press these kind of arguments to the hilt. As I've noted in this space before, most of President Obama's record is unpopular - sometimes deeply so - with the voting public. But the big exception is national security, where polls often show that Obama has built up a fair amount of credibility with voters. Foreign policy thus offers the White House its best (and perhaps only) opportunity to draw contrasts with Romney by highlighting the president's actual accomplishments.
Whereas on domestic issues the Romney camp can answer almost every Obama attack by changing the subject to the unemployment rate, on foreign policy the Republican message is much more muddled and uncertain. In the usual order of things, Romney would be simply try to out-hawk the president, but this is not a hawkish moment in American politics. Outside of the most Republican portions of the electorate, the Iraq War is still widely regarded as a bad blunder, and even conservatives are increasingly supportive of a speedy exit from Afghanistan. Public opinion on Iran is unsettled, but there is next to no support for the kind of stepped-up American intervention in Syria that some Republicans have championed.
Meanwhile, by keeping much of the Bush-era anti-terror architecture in place and stepping up covert warfare from Waziristan to the Horn of Africa, the president has effectively undercut the soft-on-terror arguments that Republicans used so effectively against John Kerry in 2004. Indeed, the most compelling criticisms of this White House have come from libertarians and anti-interventionists on both the left and right, on issues ranging from the dubiously-legal "kinetic military action" in Libya to the White House's willingness to order the assassination of an American citizen abroad.
This explains why the Republican Party's foreign policy rhetoric can seem so opportunistic and confused. The Rand Paul-led, anti-interventionist wing of the party arguably has a more coherent case against the president than the more hawkish wing, which often finds itself emphasizing what it has in common with the president - as Florida Senator Marco Rubio did in a widely-touted foreign policy address defending interventionism last week. (Tellingly, the word "Iraq" did not appear in his remarks.) Yet the hawkish line of attack is still the Republican default, and Mitt Romney's case -- to date, at least -- against the president has generally circled back to its tropes and premises.
The result is an incoherence that James Poulos described well in a recent column in Forbes:
With Obama, the GOP has become like Woody Allen's neurotic diner: the food is horrible, and such small portions! The president is condemned for leading and for leading from behind; for relying too much on talk and too much on drones; for slavishly kowtowing to foreign leaders and for arrogantly refusing to stroke foreign leaders. Obama's foreign policy has paralyzed the GOP by laying bare just how much Republicans collectively refuse to fully commit to one grand, unifying possibility in international affairs - including the possibility of stepping away from sweeping principles and playing it by ear for a while.
Arianna Huffington's qualms notwithstanding, it would be political malpractice for the president not to exploit this kind of confusion with national security attacks on his opponent. Indeed, Republicans who care about these issues should welcome them. Advertisements like the Bin Laden spot and political stunts like last night's almost-victory speech in Afghanistan present a challenge to the right, but also an opportunity. 
The rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign affords conservatives their best chance yet to come to terms with the Bush era in foreign policy and its aftermath - to figure out what they think about the recent past, where they stand at present and where they would have the country go from here.

        
To Stop Iran, the G.O.P. Should Back Obama
        
Did Obama Overstay?
        
Economy or Personality?
        
It's Mitt! Oh No.

HEADLINE: Toyota Back in the Game, Auto Sales Are the Best in 4 Years

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Toyota made a big comeback last month after two years of struggles in the United States, helping the auto industry post its best April results in four years, new figures showed on Tuesday.
Toyota's sales in the American market increased 12 percent in April, and its market share climbed to 15 percent, the highest point in 17 months.
Over all, industry sales rose 2 percent. 
Toyota more than doubled sales of its Prius hybrid from a year ago, when prices surged and availability plunged after the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan. It came within about 1,600 units of outselling the Ford Motor Company, whose sales fell 5 percent.
General Motors had a down month as well, with sales falling 8 percent and its market share dipping to 18 percent from 20.1 percent in April 2011. Having spent the last two years stealing customers from Toyota -- first as the Japanese automaker dealt with huge recalls and then after last year's disasters knocked out much of its production -- Detroit will clearly have its hands full again this year, analysts said.
''Toyota's recovery is 'mission accomplished,' much earlier than we thought,'' said Jesse Toprak, vice president for industry trends and insight at the automotive research Web site TrueCar.com. ''Their buyers are evidently more loyal than we thought.''
Sales increased 20 percent for Chrysler, a slowdown from its recent pace of growth.
Nissan's sales were flat, and Honda's fell 2 percent.
Volkswagen reported a 27 percent increase.
Hyundai, Subaru and Mercedes each set company records for April.
G.M. and Ford attributed their declines to fewer selling days this April and reductions in deliveries to car rental companies. But they are also suddenly up against tougher competition from Toyota, which has recently introduced two additional versions of the Prius and a redesigned Camry -- the country's top-selling midsize sedan.
Robert S. Carter, a Toyota group vice president, said those two nameplates were increasingly drawing in buyers new to the brand. But, Mr. Carter said, Toyota is still ramping up production of the Camry and Prius, causing dealers to lose out on some sales.
''Frankly, if we had more Priuses and more Camrys, there's a bit more volume out there for us,'' Mr. Carter said in a conference call with reporters. ''We're having the largest year that we've ever had in our history with new product launches.''
Toyota's performance has surprised many analysts in that it has regained its lost market share without offering big discounts, as carmakers traditionally have done when recovering from a tough period. In fact, Toyota spent less on incentives last month than it did a year ago.
Honda, which also is working to rebound from a bad 2011, increased its discounts significantly with little to show for it. Honda's incentives as a percentage of vehicle prices reached a record in April, according to TrueCar.
Toyota ''did this by the virtue of their products,'' Mr. Toprak said. ''They're spending significantly less on incentives than Honda, and Honda hasn't been able to recover as well.''
Despite its sales decline, G.M. said it was raising its forecast for total industry sales in 2012 by 500,000 vehicles, to a range of 14 million to 14.5 million. Auto sales last surpassed 14 million in 2007.
''We expect gradual improvement in the economy going forward,'' Don Johnson, G.M.'s vice president for United States sales operations, said in a statement. ''Over time, strength in the manufacturing sector and strong retail sales will lead to more job creation. That will help more consumers put the recession behind them, gain even more confidence and drive vehicle sales higher for both the industry and G.M.''
For the first time this year, gasoline prices ended the month lower than they started it. On Tuesday, the national average price of regular gas was $3.809 a gallon, down from $3.925 a month ago and $3.943 a year ago, according to the AAA motor club.
Gas prices near $4 a gallon have prompted some consumers to buy smaller vehicles, but are not causing overall sales to decline, as happened when prices rose sharply in 2008. Analysts said consumers were increasingly viewing high gas prices as a reason to trade in their current vehicle for a more efficient one.
''Rising gas prices are actually accelerating rather than discouraging new car purchases, as new vehicles have significantly better fuel economy,'' Peter Nesvold, an analyst with Jefferies & Company, wrote in a research note.
April had three fewer selling days, excluding Sundays and holidays, than it did a year ago. That much disparity has happened only twice in the last decade, and fewer selling days make it more difficult for automakers to match or exceed their year-ago results.

HEADLINE: Tanks, Jets or Scholarships?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Amman, Jordan
And so it came to pass that in 2012 -- a year after the Arab awakening erupted -- the United States made two financial commitments to the Arab world that each began with the numbers 1 and 3.
It gave Egypt's military $1.3 billion worth of tanks and fighter jets, and it gave Lebanese public-school students a $13.5 million merit-based college scholarship program that is currently putting 117 Lebanese kids through local American-style colleges that promote tolerance, gender and social equality, and critical thinking. I've recently been to Egypt, and I've just been to Lebanon, and I can safely report this: The $13.5 million in full scholarships has already bought America so much more friendship and stability than the $1.3 billion in tanks and fighter jets ever will. 
So how about we stop being stupid? How about we stop sending planes and tanks to a country where half the women and a quarter of the men can't read, and start sending scholarships instead?
I am on a swing through the Arab world right now, and I am spending as much time as I can with public schoolteachers and students -- and young Arabs doing technology start-ups -- and as little time as possible with officials. It derives from my conviction about what really propelled the Tunis and Tahrir Square revolutions: Arab youths -- 70 percent of this region is under 30 -- who were humiliated and frustrated that they were being left behind. This Arab awakening was their way of saying: We want the freedom, the voice, the educational tools, the jobs and the uncorrupted government to realize our full potential. That's what sparked this revolution.
Yes, the various Muslim Brotherhoods have exploited the opening created by these uprisings because they were the most organized parties. But if the Islamists don't respond to the real drivers of this revolution -- that yearning for education and jobs and the dignity they bring -- they, too, will eventually face a rebellion.
If America wants to connect with the real aspirations of these revolutions, it will expand to other Arab awakening countries the $13.5 million U.S. Agency for International Development scholarship program begun in Lebanon. And, by the way, hats off to President Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah and the members of Congress who got this program going.
Iran is building dams and roads around Lebanon, decorated with ''Thank You, Iran'' signs. But no one is standing in line here to go to Tehran University. They still line up for American scholarships, though -- one requirement of which is that winners have to do community service, so we are also helping to build better citizens.
The American Embassy in Beirut introduced me to four of this year's Lebanese scholarship students -- who attend either the Lebanese Arab University or Haigazian University, which offer modern U.S.-style bachelor's degrees.
Israa Yassin, 18, from the village of Qab Elias, who is studying computer science, told me: ''This whole program is helping to make the youth capable of transforming this country into what it should be and can be. We are good, and we have the capabilities and we can do a lot, but we don't get the chance. My brother just finished high school, and he could not afford [university]. His future is really stopped. The U.S. is giving us a chance to make a difference. I do believe if we are given the chance, we can excel. ... We will not be underestimated anymore. It is really sad when you see a whole generation in Lebanese villages -- hundreds of guys doing nothing -- no work, not going to college.''
After getting the U.S. scholarship, said Yassin, ''my family and my community feel differently about America. Why would they hate someone who is helping them?''
Word of the American scholarships has spread quickly; the program is now being swamped with applications for next year, a majority from young women. Wissal Chaaban, 18, from Tripoli, also attending the Lebanese Arab University and studying marketing, told me: ''We have a lot of talent in the Middle East, and young people do not feel appreciated. They feel their voice is shut down and not heard enough.''
This program is in America's interest, she said, because it sends young people to colleges that ''encourage openness, to accept the other, no matter how different, even if he was from another religion.''
I wish my government was giving more scholarships to Americans, but since we budget this money specifically for foreign aid, let's use it intelligently. We can still give military aid -- but in the right proportion.
While in Amman, I interviewed some public schoolteachers at Jordan's impressive Queen Rania Teacher Academy, which works with a team from Columbia University to upgrade teaching skills. We talked about the contrast between the $13.5 million in U.S. scholarships and the $1.3 billion in military aid, and Jumana Jabr, an English teacher in an Amman public school, summed it up better than I ever could:
One is ''for making people,'' she said, ''and the other is for killing people.'' If America wants to spend money on training soldiers, she added, well, ''teachers are also soldiers, so why don't you spend the money training us? We're the ones training the soldiers you're spending the $1.3 billion on.''

HEADLINE: Top Judge Makes Free Legal Work Mandatory for Joining State Bar

BYLINE: By ANNE BARNARD

 BODY:
Starting next year, New York will become the first state to require lawyers to perform unpaid work before being licensed to practice, the state's chief judge announced on Tuesday, describing the rule as a way to help the growing number of people who cannot afford legal services.
The approximately 10,000 lawyers who apply to the New York State Bar each year will have to demonstrate that they have performed 50 hours of pro bono work to be admitted, Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman said. He said the move was intended to provide about a half-million hours of badly needed legal services to those with urgent problems, like foreclosure and domestic violence. 
The need has exploded in recent years as the economic crisis delivered what advocates for the poor call a triple whammy: more people are struggling financially; more people need legal services to cope with foreclosures, evictions and credit and employment problems that could push them into long-term poverty; and state and federal financing for legal services has plunged.
The Legal Aid Society, the nation's largest provider of free legal services, turns away eight of every nine people seeking help with civil legal matters, said Steven Banks, the New York group's attorney in chief. Since the economic downturn began in 2008, Mr. Banks said, requests for assistance have jumped 40 percent for health care issues, 54 percent for unemployment insurance and work-related problems, 16 percent for domestic violence and ''a stunning 800 percent'' for foreclosures.
While criminal defendants have a constitutional right to free legal representation, defendants in civil cases -- as well as people who need legal help for essential needs like applying for disability benefits -- do not.
In his three years at the helm of the state's court system, Judge Lippman has made New York a national model and has been praised in the legal profession by addressing what he calls the justice gap, allocating millions of dollars from the courts' administrative budget for free legal services and making it easier for retired lawyers to take pro bono cases.
But his latest measure may prove more controversial, some of his admirers said, because it wades into a fierce debate among lawyers over whether mandatory pro bono service is the right solution -- and because it could hit the pocketbooks of young lawyers at a time when they are struggling to find jobs. Judge Lippman and the court administrative board have the power to do so because, unlike in many other states, the New York court system, and not the bar association, sets the requirements.
''Lawyers do not like to be told what to do,'' said Esther Lardent, president of the Pro Bono Institute, a nonprofit group that works with law firms to improve their pro bono services. ''I worry about poor people with lawyers who don't want to be there.''
In New Jersey, lawyers have long complained about a 20-year-old court order that allows judges to assign private lawyers in their counties to certain cases that are not covered by its public defenders. Some lawyers can win exceptions, but many argue that the burden is unevenly spread, falling more heavily in counties that have fewer available lawyers.
Supporters of the plan acknowledge that it will require more training and supervision for law students and recent graduates, who can file legal papers and appear in court if they are supervised. But they said they hoped it would dovetail with an increasing focus in many law schools on clinics that provide practical experience.
Because New York is a magnet for top law schools across the country, its bar requirements could help prompt the expansion of pro bono work elsewhere, said Don Saunders, a vice president at the National Legal Aid and Defender Association in Washington, who called Judge Lippman's work to increase the amount of money for legal services ''groundbreaking.''
Ms. Lardent, who supports pro bono requirements for law students, said she liked a ''big audacious idea'' if it did not place undue burdens on young lawyers who face a difficult job market and, if they are new to New York, may need help finding appropriate pro bono work.
For his part, Judge Lippman made clear that he believed the requirement would be a source of satisfaction to most lawyers and would not be onerous -- it could be completed in a weeklong summer internship, members of his staff noted.
Pro bono work would be defined to include steps like representing poor people in civil court and legal work for a nonprofit group or government agency.
''The legal profession should not be seen as argumentative, narrow or avaricious,'' Judge Lippman said in Albany at one of the many Law Day ceremonies held around the country on Tuesday to celebrate the rule of law, ''but rather one that is defined by the pursuit of justice and the desire to assist our fellow man.''
Because detailed regulations have yet to be drafted, it is unclear whether lawyers moving to New York in the middle of their careers would be affected, or whether the work would have to be completed in the state. The graduates of New York law schools in 2010 made up less than half of the new lawyers admitted to the bar.
Judge Lippman said that while the preference was for work in New York, there would probably be provisions to allow recent law graduates to count work done while in law school elsewhere.

HEADLINE: Blue Chips Lead the Way As Major Indexes Close Higher

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at its highest level in more than four years on Tuesday after an index of the nation's manufacturing level expanded at a faster rate than expected in April, easing anxiety about a slowdown in the economic recovery.
The Dow closed at its highest level since December 2007. The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended within about 16 points of a high reached in May 2008. A convincing break above that level could set the market up for more gains, traders said. 
''That's where a lot of traders' eyes are right now,'' said Michael James, a senior trader at Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles. ''It might be tough to get through there the first time.''
But the Nasdaq sold off sharply near the close on weakness in Apple and the BlackBerry maker Research in Motion in a sign that the market could struggle to make further headway in the short term.
The Institute for Supply Management said manufacturing growth reached its strongest rate in 10 months in April. That reading suggested the economy remains resilient after indications it lost momentum at the start of the second quarter.
Early gains this year have been held in check in recent weeks on worries about economic growth.
Shares of Intel, long touted by many investors as undervalued, hit a 52-week high at $29.05. The company closed at $28.95, up 2 percent, in a sign that money is still flowing into large-cap technology stocks as the market grinds higher.
Financial, transportation and energy shares, all of which are linked to economic growth, were strong performers. The S.& P. financial sector index rose 1.1 percent, helped by a 2.5 percent gain in Bank of America, which closed at $8.31. Chesapeake Energy rose 6.3 percent to $19.60 ahead of the natural gas producer's earnings after the bell.
Tuesday's move higher, which came in a relatively quiet market with European exchanges closed for May Day holidays, drove the S.& P. 500 within striking distance of its recent high at 1,422.38.
''If we get up there, fail and don't retrace too much before the weekend, I would not be surprised to see it move through,'' Mr. James said.
The Dow gained 65.69 points, or 0.50 percent, to 13,279.32. The Standard & Poor's index rose 7.91 points, or 0.57 percent, to 1,405.82. The Nasdaq composite index added 4.08 points, or 0.13 percent, to 3,050.44.
The Dow earlier rose as high as 13,338.66 points, its highest since December 2007.
In April, the S.& P. 500 posted its first monthly decline since November as economic data pointed to a slowing domestic economy and continued flare-ups in the euro zone highlighted the risks of the region's debt crisis.
Of the 321 S.& P. 500 companies that have reported quarterly results so far, 71.3 percent have topped analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data through Tuesday morning,
Chesapeake, the nation's No. 2 natural gas producer, was also helped after it said it would name an independent, nonexecutive chairman to replace Aubrey K. McClendon. The company will also end a program that has granted Mr. McClendon minority stakes in Chesapeake's wells.
BP's profit dropped on a decline in production prompted by the sale of oil fields to pay for the Gulf of Mexico disaster. Shares of BP listed in the United States fell 1.6 percent to $42.70.
Huntsman rose 8.9 percent to $15.42 after profit nearly tripled on higher prices for its chemicals.
Health care stocks rose, led by Molina Healthcare, which advanced 3.5 percent to $26.54 after the company's earnings topped estimates. The Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payer index gained 1.7 percent.
PF Chang's China Bistro surged nearly 30 percent to $51.48 after the restaurant chain agreed to be bought by a private equity firm.
Interest rates were slightly higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 7/32, to 100 16/32, and the yield rose to 1.95 percent from 1.92 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: Illusions Shatter With a Left To a Fire Extinguisher Case

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
Amar'e Stoudemire is not the most loquacious of N.B.A. stars, but he can convey a powerful message with an economy of words and gestures.
Two summers ago, he put on a blue ''NYK'' cap and boldly declared, ''The Knicks are back.'' A depressed fan base perked up and dared to believe again. The Knicks were back because he said so.
Late Monday night, Stoudemire affirmed the Knicks' return to dysfunction, without saying a word. His impulsive punch through a plate-glass fire extinguisher door probably ended his season and surely hastened his team's exit from the playoffs. The Knicks trail the Miami Heat, 2-0. 
Stoudemire had surgery Tuesday to repair a small muscle in his left hand. He is out for Game 3, doubtful for Game 4 and then will be reassessed -- though the Knicks may be gone by then.
The Knicks were unlikely to beat Miami -- a more talented, more polished and more logically constructed team -- four times, even with a complete lineup. They have no chance without Stoudemire, their most skilled big man, or with the skeleton rotation that remains, given the losses of Iman Shumpert and Jeremy Lin to injury and the physical limitations of Baron Davis and Jared Jeffries.
When the Knicks are eliminated, possibly as soon as Sunday, it will mark their 12th straight year without winning a playoff series, the longest current drought in the N.B.A. A loss Thursday night would be the Knicks' 13th straight in the postseason, an N.B.A. record.
How much, if any of this, weighed on Stoudemire's psyche when he started looking for inanimate objects to punish is unclear. He has not spoken publicly since the incident, and his Twitter apology, while heartfelt, did not address motives.
In his brief time in New York, Stoudemire has been a model citizen, staying coolheaded through the losing streaks and the abrupt departure of Coach Mike D'Antoni, a trusted mentor.
His outburst was too rash, too extreme to be the product of a single defeat, or even two. It was as if he were raging against a greater realization: that the Knicks' trumpeted revival was nothing but a mirage, a delusion born of desperation, binge spending and a simplistic belief that collecting superstars guarantees title contention.
Stoudemire and Carmelo Anthony have been together for 14 months, and they still do not function as a cohesive tag team. The Knicks are 50-50 since Anthony arrived (counting playoffs) and are 28-39 when Anthony and Stoudemire both play. Their longest winning streak this season came mostly without Anthony. Their April resurgence came mostly without Stoudemire.
Every advanced metric imaginable indicates that the Anthony-Stoudemire tandem is unworkable, with the Knicks scoring less efficiently and defending less effectively when they share the court.
As Tom Haberstroh -- who mines statistics for ESPN.com -- wrote Tuesday, ''Playing ToolsMeasureOptionsStoudemire together was a lost cause.''
Zach Lowe -- writing for Sports Illustrated's Web site -- echoed the sentiment, writing ''the Anthony/Stoudemire combination has been a disaster.''
The shared conclusion is that the Knicks may be better off in this series without Stoudemire. Yet in the short term, no matter how badly their stars mesh, the Knicks have too little talent to withstand the loss.
If this pairing is indeed a disaster, it is one the Knicks may be stuck with. Anthony, acquired at the 2011 trading deadline, is now the face of the franchise, for better or worse. He is here to stay. Stoudemire -- who held face-of-the-franchise status for a mere seven months, before Anthony arrived -- is probably not going anywhere, either.
He is owed $65 million over the next three seasons, with a contract that is uninsured against knee injuries, making him a risk for all but the richest of franchises.
Stoudemire's recent back injury and a growing impression (real or perceived) that he has lost some explosiveness further diminish his value. Any chance of reversing those impressions was lost in a hailstorm of glass Monday night.
The fact is, Stoudemire was playing well just before the back injury in March and looked strong these past two weeks after returning to the lineup. He was the Knicks' most efficient player for much of Game 2, scoring 18 points while taking only nine shots from the field. Anthony had 30 points, but with a ghastly 12-for-26 shooting line. For the series, Anthony is shooting .366 -- the worst among the Knicks' starters -- and yet he has taken as many shots as Stoudemire, Davis and Tyson Chandler combined.
It is understood that Anthony is the Knicks' most gifted player and the engine of their offense. But one-dimensional teams rarely go far in the playoffs, particularly when their franchise star is shooting below 40 percent and doing little to set up his teammates. Anthony has four assists in two games, while his Heat counterparts, LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, have combined for 19.
Perhaps Stoudemire, who cannot create his own offense but needs a timely pass, is simply tired of waiting for the ball.
To his credit, Stoudemire has never complained about his diminished status, or his complementary role or Anthony's ball-dominating habits. He has persevered through injuries and the death of his older brother and has attempted at every turn to make the partnership work. It hasn't.
If the frustration ultimately coalesced in a split-second of uncontrolled fury, it would be almost understandable. Stoudemire picked the wrong gesture, the wrong time and the wrong target, but the shattered glass and the spilled blood is still the least of the Knicks' concerns.

HEADLINE: At May Day Demonstrations, Traffic Jams and Arrests

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN and COLIN MOYNIHAN; Reporting was contributed by Daniel Krieger, Ivan Pereira and Jennifer Preston from New York, and Malia Wollan from Oakland, Calif.

 BODY:
Thousands of protesters converged on Lower Manhattan on Tuesday afternoon in the culmination of May Day demonstrations organized by the Occupy Wall Street movement, resulting in occasionally bloody clashes and the arrests of more than 30 demonstrators. 
All the arrests were on disorderly conduct charges, and most were of people who were blocking traffic or resisting arrest, said Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department. Protesters were arrested near Bryant Park in Midtown, on the Williamsburg Bridge, at a park on the Lower East Side and near Washington Square Park.
In other cities, including Los Angeles and Seattle, demonstrators snarled traffic and smashed windows. Protesters in Oakland, Calif., clashed with officers in riot gear, who fired tear gas. May Day protests were also held around the world, with large crowds marching in Manila and Tunis.
The number of arrests in New York was the most since the weekend of March 17, when 73 protesters were held.
The themes on May Day were the ones that Occupy Wall Street has sounded from the outset of the movement last fall -- opposition to big banks and the government that bailed them out after they helped cause the recession.
''I just watched the whole economy becoming devastating, and no one wants to hire me,'' Kezia Snyder, 59, a freelance chef who lives in Chelsea, said at a rally in Union Square.
Protesters began the morning in the rain in Midtown, picketing and chanting in front of banks, corporate headquarters and a restaurant that is the subject of a class-action lawsuit. About four people were arrested near Bryant Park, Mr. Browne said.
Then the protests moved downtown. Outside Sara D. Roosevelt Park on the Lower East Side, officers pushed back a throng of protesters as they tried to cross a street.
Near Washington Square Park, demonstrators carrying a banner that read ''On Strike'' disregarded police warnings to stay on the sidewalk and stepped onto Avenue of the Americas. Several officers tackled and arrested them.
One man who was led away in cuffs had a bloody face.
As the sun began to set, thousands of people left Union Square and began slowly marching south toward the financial district. At one point, the marchers filled most of Broadway between Houston and Worth Streets. About 9 p.m., a large crowd gathered near the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Plaza, and later moved toward Hanover Square.

HEADLINE: A Sharp Debate in London Seeks to Address the State Of an Overworked Airport

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
LONDON -- As any pilot will tell you, landing an aircraft in a crosswind is a challenge. So, too, is deciding on where -- or whether -- to build a new airport runway.
The political winds in Britain have shifted countless times over the decades on the question of expanding aviation capacity in and around London, which is already served by six commercial airports. No fewer than 10 government studies on the subject have been commissioned since 1946.
Conditions have grown particularly gusty lately as the government attempts to grapple with the airports question yet again amid ballooning budget deficits and an economy that has slid into a double-dip recession. The debate pits London's business leaders, who argue that new runway capacity is vital for Britain's global competitiveness, against environmentalists warning of the implications for the country's carbon-emissions targets, and local residents who are already among the Europeans most affected by airport noise.
It also appears to have thrown a wedge into the fragile governing coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, who came to power in 2010 with a joint promise to reverse the course of the previous Labour government and block any expansion at London's three-largest airports: Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. 
Meanwhile, stark economic reality has begun to shake the support of the Conservative mayor of London, Boris Johnson -- who is campaigning to be re-elected during a vote this week -- for a bold, $:50 billion, or $81 billion, project to replace Heathrow with a new airport hub.
''What has happened is we have now got the worst economic crisis in the postwar era,'' said Simon Buck, chief executive of the British Air Transport Association, a trade group. ''The government recognizes that it is vital for the economic recovery that we rebuild our international trade links.''
At the crux of the airport debate is Heathrow, Britain's main international air hub, located to the west of the capital and, with more than 69 million passengers a year, the third-largest airport in the world, after Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta and Beijing Capital International.
While it still serves significantly more passengers than any other airport in Europe, Heathrow, which has just two runways, has been operating at almost 100 percent capacity for a decade and been constrained from growing further by government indecision over whether to build a third runway.
Other major European airports, meanwhile, are catching up in terms of traffic: Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris and Frankfurt International Airport, which each have four runways, last year had their passenger numbers rise 5 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively, while traffic at Amsterdam Schiphol, which has six runways, jumped more than 10 percent.
Those same airports are also expanding their connections to cities in the largest emerging markets in the world -- including Brazil, Russia, India and China -- where the International Monetary Fund predicts half of the global economic growth will take place over the next decade.
The absence of spare capacity at Heathrow means that it already has fewer weekly flights to those emerging countries. In 2011, for example, Heathrow offered 31 weekly nonstop flights to mainland China, while Amsterdam had 39, Frankfurt 56 and Paris 64.
Reports commissioned last year by Heathrow's owner, BAA, estimate that Britain could miss out on roughly $:14 billion in international trade over the next 10 years, while 141,000 jobs would be lost, if the airport continued with two runways.
''I am really worried this is another industry that Britain risks slipping from a position of great strength to one of mediocrity,'' said Kwasi Kwarteng, a Conservative legislator and a transport committee member who supports building a third runway at Heathrow as the most economical near-term solution to the capacity problem. ''In the face of a growing market, to say that we are not going to build anymore seems absolutely crazy.''
As Britain's economic crisis deepens, political leaders who had fiercely opposed any new runways at London's existing airports may now be softening their stance. An aviation strategy paper that Justine Greening, the Conservative transport minister, had been expected to publish at the end of March was abruptly postponed until the summer.
According to media reports, George Osborne, the Conservative chancellor of the Exchequer, said at a cabinet meeting in March that the government intended to include new runway construction among the options to be considered -- to the fury of Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, who opposes any further airport expansion on environmental grounds. Britain has said the aviation sector's carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 must not exceed 2005 levels of 37.5 million tons a year.
Representatives for Mr. Osborne and Mr. Clegg declined to comment on those reports and Ms. Greening, in a statement, said the government's position against expansion at Heathrow ''has not changed.''
That probably means the government will take a closer look at the case for expanding London's other main airports -- Gatwick, Stansted, or possibly Luton -- with an eye to migrating some of Heathrow's domestic and European flights there, analysts say. London City airport has not been considered an option for adding capacity because its urban location makes any significant expansion impractical. London Southend, a former military airport that re-opened for scheduled passenger flights in April, can be expected to accommodate no more than two million passengers a year by 2020, a tiny fraction of the nearly 134 million passengers who pass through all London area airports today.
But apart from such incremental solutions is a far more ambitious proposition by Norman Foster -- the British architect whose firm, Foster + Partners, designed the new airports in Beijing and Hong Kong -- to replace Heathrow with a new air and rail hub in the Thames River estuary, around 40 miles, or 25 kilometers, to the east of the capital.
Mr. Foster's proposal is breathtaking in scale: A four-runway airport, to be built on reclaimed marshland, connected to London via high-speed rail, whose access tunnel would double as a flood protection barrier and hydropower generation plant.
A few years ago, the idea captured the imagination of at least one very influential advocate: Mr. Johnson, the London mayor, who lobbied hard to persuade aides to Prime Minister David Cameron to support the project.
''We should not be so short-sighted as to aim at catching up'' with other European airports, said Hew Thomas, a partner in Mr. Foster's firm. ''What we should do is leapfrog.''
He added, ''New jobs in intellectual services and other 21st-century sectors will not rely on Victorian-era steam engine infrastructure.''
Yet critics of the project, which some have mockingly dubbed ''Boris Island,'' abound. London First, an influential lobby representing 200 of the city's largest employers, says that London cannot afford to wait the 20 to 30 years that a new hub would take to build.
While Mr. Foster argues that most of the $:50 billion cost can be borne by private investors, including foreign sovereign wealth funds, many politicians on the left and the right expect that taxpayers would end up footing a sizable part of the bill.
Meanwhile, environmental campaigners, including Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, oppose the destruction of protected estuary habitat for up to 500,000 migratory birds, many of them endangered.
Even the biggest player in British aviation remains unconvinced of the feasibility of an all-new hub to replace Heathrow.
''I give credit to the mayor of London,'' said Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group, the parent company of British Airways, which is based at Heathrow. ''At least he's thinking big. At least he's getting the question discussed. But this is an idea whose time never seems to come.''
Among the questions that Mr. Walsh and others say remain unanswered is how the economy of west London, an influential political constituency, would cope with the closure of Heathrow and the loss of up to 200,000 jobs.
''If a Thames airport were built, it would have a significant and devastating impact on the west London economy,'' acknowledged John Stewart, chairman of Hacan ClearSkies, a group representing west London residents opposed to an expansion of Heathrow.
''Heathrow is almost too big to fail,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''I can't foresee any government actually closing it down. You can argue that it's in the wrong place, that it causes tremendous noise problems, which are all true. But equally, in the real world, we are stuck with it.''
Mr. Johnson, having perhaps seen the political writing on the wall, has grown noticeably less vocal on the airports issue in the run-up to London's elections. Neither the mayor nor his aides agreed to be interviewed for this article. But in a telling quip to The Independent on Sunday recently, he said: ''Contrary to popular belief, I am not the slightest bit wedded to some remote archipelago in the Thames estuary.''
By ruling out expansion at Heathrow in 2010 and failing to back Mr. Johnson's Thames project, some observers said the coalition government had backed itself into a corner.
''It was very much a political decision to rule out the new runways,'' said Mr. Buck of the British Air Transport Association. ''Now they are under intense pressure from a number of their own supporters and an increasing number of business people to do something to ensure we maintain good trading routes so that future economic growth doesn't end up going elsewhere in Europe.''
The government has set itself a deadline of next year to agree on a way forward. But given the extent of the current political paralysis, analysts said they were keeping their expectations low until at least the next general election in 2015.
''There is no reason to think any clear definitive solution will be happening anytime within the current government and probably next five years,'' said David Feldman, managing partner at Exambela, an aviation consulting firm based in Paris. ''This is not a decision for the current government, but probably for three governments from now.''
By that time, according to Mr. Feldman, London may well be on its way to becoming a second-tier hub for air travel.

HEADLINE: Stephen G. Kliegerman

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Kliegerman, 44, is the president of Terra Development Marketing, overseeing sales and marketing of new developments for Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens, both owned by Terra Holdings. The New York developments include the condominiums One48 in Gramercy Park and Richard Meier On Prospect Park in Brooklyn, and the Chelsea rental 537 West 27th Street.
Interview conducted and condensed by
VIVIAN MARINO 
Q. You wear two hats. How do you divide up your time between Halstead and Brown Harris?
A. You have to prioritize -- you have to decide which jobs you can send somebody in your place and which sites need your immediate attention. It's usually during the initial stages when really important decisions are being made that can affect the economics or the aesthetic of the job. So if we're doing final floor plans or trying to finalize what that brand will be, I make it to all of those meetings.
Q. Brokers seem to be more involved in the planning stages of developments.
A. In the beginning of the condo development boom, developers sought out the brokerage community to guide them in the predevelopment phase. I guess the best example of that is Louise Sunshine. When the boom really hit full force, developers thought they could do everything on their own. Then when Lehman fell in 2008, a lot of developments that were not properly conceived failed.
So now that we're in a new boom of development, both rental and condo, developers are calling us in to talk about who the right demographical buyer is for the neighborhood, the right unit mix and size of the units, amenities.
Q. Can you provide some examples of developments where you left your mark?
A. One example is 148 East 24th Street, which we are just completing sales on. We were able to work with the developer to overcome some of what we saw as some minor but important design flaws, like closet doors that open too far into the room. In one unit in particular there was a big outdoor space and a bedroom that was small. They completely redesigned the unit to make it more desirable.
Another example is 540 West 28th Street, Plus Art. When we saw the original floor plans, we felt that they could be enhanced and we also felt that the building needed to have a little more stature. We worked with them and their architectural team to bring in an interior design team that really made their finishes a little bit more upscale. We went with a wide-plank wood floor. And we worked with them to do little things like getting more bike storage in the buildings and we worked with them on their roof deck.
Q. How are sales going at Plus Art?
A. There are 91 units, and we have six or seven units left.
Q. Are there any prevailing trends in amenities or layouts?
A. When you're talking about the middle of the market, buyers want amenities that they actually are going to use but won't add a lot of ongoing monthly expenses. They like to see a gym in the building, even one that functions as a second gym if you can't get to your full-service gym. Community rooms, parking. Outdoor space is very important and so is storage. At 505 West 47th Street we actually doubled the amount of bike storage.
When you get to the very high-end developments, those buyers want top-of-the line service and amenities, so those buildings will have everything.
Q. How many developments are you representing right now?
A. In Manhattan and Brooklyn, we have about 30 active developments on the market on the Halstead side, and on the Brown Harris Stevens side -- we really just started getting going -- there are 10. Then in our pipeline we've got another 25 or so that will come to market from mid- to late-2012 all the way to 2014.
Q. You mentioned a development boom earlier.
A. I do think we're starting to see a bit of a development boom -- not like in the '90s and 2000, but it's the ''new economy'' boom. Developers, and the banks, are seeing that there is an imbalance between supply and demand. In addition, there's a lot of private equity money that has been sitting on the sidelines. Billions upon billions of dollars.
So over the next three or so years there will be a significant amount of inventory coming to the market. But it's less than half of what we saw in the prior 15 years: where we were adding 5,000 to 10,000 units a year citywide, I think now you're looking at 1,000 to 2,000 a year.
Q. Let's talk about sales prices.
A. It depends on the neighborhood. If you're looking at Harlem, prices range from $600 to $800 a square foot, on average, for quality development. If you're talking south of 96th Street, in the middle range of the marketplace $1,100 to $1,400 a square foot is becoming more the norm. In the high end of the market, anything from $2,500 to, I think we'll see, $10,000.
There's an incredible appetite for the high end both locally and internationally. New York City is really a safe haven.
Q. What percent of your buyers are foreigners?
A. A couple of years ago it was a little less than 10 percent. Today it's probably closer to 20 percent.
Q. Sounds like business is good.
A. Business is good. Last year we closed between 500 and 600 units; this year we will probably close about 400 to 500 units, but only because our inventory had dwindled. In 2013 and 2014, the number of closings are predicted to reach 800 to 1,000 units.
Q. Is it a buyer's or seller's market?
A. For the most part, we are back into a seller's marketplace. That switch happened about the middle of last year. Over all, if you look at Manhattan and Brooklyn, the average price is up about 5 percent from last year. For rentals, over the last 12 months, we have seen rents increase 12 to 20 percent. There is such a small supply; and the city, unlike the rest of the nation, has added jobs.
Q. Do you remember your first deal?
A. I do. My first deal ever was a really hard sell, actually. It was a unit on 140 East 28th Street, a two-bedroom apartment in a beautiful Bing & Bing classic prewar building. Back in 1990 the area was filled with drug addicts and prostitutes. They were asking $696,000 and interest rates were high. They ended up buying for the low 600s, and it's probably worth two and a half times as much today.

HEADLINE: Sex Trafficking in the Americas

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Prostitutes Perplexed as Global Glare Falls on City's Brothels'' (Cartagena Journal, April 26) doesn't capture the complex realities of women's lives amid armed violence and international criminal networks that profit from the economic plight and abuse of women. 
Colombia is a major source country for women and girls subjected to sex trafficking in the Americas. The State Department has identified Cartagena and other coastal towns as a haven for sex trafficking and a popular sex tourism destination for United States nationals.
Most of the women, as you note, ''came from other parts of the country, like Medellin or Cali,'' because the continued armed violence there has resulted in population displacement and criminal networks, including pimps and traffickers, forcing women and children into sex trafficking to meet the demand from sex tourists.
The only thing ''perplexing'' about that is the lack of coverage and action to end demand-driven commercial sexual exploitation.

HEADLINE: Fate of Postal Service Awaits Action in House

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Despite Senate approval of a bill to help the debt-ridden Postal Service, thousands of post offices across the country still face closings beginning in two weeks if the House has not completed work on its version of the legislation.
The Senate passed a bill to overhaul the Postal Service last week. But legislation has yet to come up for a vote in the House, and lawmakers there do not appear to be in a hurry to proceed despite a May 15 deadline set by the Postal Service before it begins closing post offices. 
''The May 15 moratorium deadline was manufactured by senators opposed to legitimate postal reform,'' said Ali M. Ahmad, a spokesman for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Postal Service. ''It has never had a meaningful purpose in advancing efforts to help the Postal Service.''
Facing billions of dollars in debt and losing an average of $36 million a day this year, the Postal Service plans to close 3,700 post offices, or 12 percent of them. It would also close 250 mail processing centers, or about half of them, and reduce its work force by nearly 20 percent, or 100,000 people.
The Postal Service said it would delay the planned consolidation of mail processing centers during the election season.
Patrick R. Donahoe, the postmaster general, agreed to hold off on closings until mid-May to give Congress time to work on legislation to address the agency's growing debt. The agency has the authority to close facilities without the approval of Congress.
''We are continuing to explore options,'' said Sue Brennan, a Postal Service spokeswoman.
On Tuesday, a group of senators who co-sponsored the Senate legislation called on House leaders to bring the postal overhaul bill to the floor for a vote. The co-sponsors include Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut; Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts, both Republicans; and Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware.
''The Postal Service's financial crisis will likely come to a head in the next few months,'' the senators said in a letter. ''Without legislation, the Postal Service will not be able to make payments that are due and will likely be forced to slash services. We fear that the resulting degradation of mail service will further drive away postal customers, only hastening the loss of postal revenue, the accelerating contraction of mail processing and mail-related industry, and further loss of associated jobs.''
The senators also sent a letter on Tuesday to the postmaster general, asking that the Postal Service delay closing post offices until legislation is completed. The Postal Service did not respond to the letter, but Representative Darrell Issa, a California Republican and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, denounced it, saying the senators were seeking to protect post offices in their states.
''Rather than letting an objective and independent process continue on, senators would inject parochial politics into the postmaster general's decision making,'' Mr. Issa said.
The bill passed by the Senate would provide retirement incentives for nearly 100,000 of the service's 547,000 workers. It also would allow the agency to study the elimination of Saturday deliveries if it could not cut costs in the next two years. It would also allow the agency to offer a broader range of services to raise new revenue, including delivering beer and wine for retailers. The agency would also recoup more than $11 billion that it had overpaid into one of its pension funds.
Perhaps most significant, the bill would restructure the payments the agency makes into a health benefits fund for future retirees. Under a 2006 law, the agency has to pay $5.5 billion annually into the fund, which the Postal Service said had added $20 billion in debt to its balance sheet since 2007.
The House bill differs substantially from the Senate version. It would create a commission much like the one that recommended military base closings to oversee the shutting down of post offices and processing centers. It would also allow the Postal Service to end Saturday deliveries.
The bill would also establish a panel to cut costs and change the structure of the Postal Service if the agency defaults on any of its obligations to the federal government for more than 30 days.

HEADLINE: A Once-Ambitious Law Firm, Reduced to Grim Dispatches

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
On Monday, about 50 former Dewey partners opened their in-boxes to find a poignant note. A fellow former partner said he was starting an assistance fund for Dewey staff and junior lawyers who might find themselves unemployed.
The same day, Dewey's remaining partners received a grim dispatch from the firm's leadership. Given Dewey's state, management encouraged them to look for new jobs.
These are dark days for Dewey & LeBoeuf, the New York law firm on the brink of collapse amid a partner exodus. Forged by a 2007 merger, it had set its sights on quickly becoming a global powerhouse in corporate law, employing more than 1,300 lawyers in 26 offices across the globe at its peak. Now the firm is teetering under the weight of too much debt and outsize pay guarantees made to its star lawyers.
Lawyers and staff, unable to focus on their client matters, milled about Dewey's office ''shellshocked'' on Tuesday, according to an employee. At one point, there was confusion over whether the firm's health care provider had suspended medical coverage, leading the firm to send an officewide e-mail blaming an ''administrative issue'' for the apparent suspension and explaining that coverage would soon be fully restored. 
''Law firms aren't very joyful places even when things are going well,'' said the Dewey employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''How would I describe the atmosphere now? The first word that comes to mind is funereal.''
Dewey's woes reflect in large part the challenges faced by other big law firms throughout the country that are trying to grow in a slow economy populated by cost-conscious companies. While it may not be as extreme as in the case of Dewey, a widening divide in pay between senior lawyers and the junior ones who are responsible for much of the work is creating tensions at some firms. For many in the legal industry, Dewey's turmoil is a sobering lesson on unchecked ambitions.
Tuesday brought more setbacks for Dewey, whose roots go back to 1909. The firm's partners in London are exploring a possible wind-down of the firm's British arm, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation. Dewey's British operation, which also encompasses its Paris office and is a separate legal entity from the United States partnership, has more than 200 lawyers and support staff.
At least four partners in the United States walked out the door on Tuesday. Stuart M. Saft, the global head of the real estate practice, decamped to the law firm Holland & Knight.
Mr. Saft, whose clients include the developers Harry Macklowe and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, said on Tuesday that he was deeply saddened by Dewey's woes, but had no choice but to leave given the firm's uncertain fate. He said 43 firms had recruited him since problems surfaced in March.
''I postponed leaving the firm as long as I possibly could because I felt that leaving would only further destabilize the situation,'' said Mr. Saft, who said that all of his clients were moving with him to his new firm.
Nearly 90 of the firm's 300 partners have departed since January. Also on Tuesday, a pair of private equity partners, Ilan S. Nissan and Christian C. Nugent, left for Goodwin Procter. Lyle Roberts, a securities litigator in Washington, joined Cooley.
The steep, persistent decline in its partnership rolls has jeopardized the firm. Like Mr. Saft, many departing partners are taking their clients with them. And the firm has breached covenants in lending agreements with its banks, which require a law firm to maintain a minimum number of partners.
Yet even as it lost talent over the last several months, Dewey continued to handle prominent assignments. Its lawyers represented the Los Angeles Dodgers in the baseball team's bankruptcy and eventual sale. A team of merger and acquisition lawyers in Silicon Valley recently advised the computer company Dell on two takeovers. And the firm is defending the gene sequencing firm Illumina from a hostile bid by the drug giant Roche.
Dewey's leadership is working around the clock to save the firm. Martin J. Bienenstock, the head of its restructuring practice, said this week that the firm had no plans to file for bankruptcy.
In recent weeks, Mr. Bienenstock, joined by three other partners in Dewey's ''office of the chairman,'' has been trying to structure a complex transaction in which they would file a prearranged bankruptcy and strike a merger deal with another law firm. Such a deal could help Dewey's partners avoid a painful dissolution and protect them from claims by the firm's creditors.
One possible asset that has been largely overlooked as Dewey seeks a merger partner is the firm's prime real estate in Midtown Manhattan, according to people with knowledge of the firm's finances.
Dewey operates out of 10 floors at 1301 Avenue of the Americas, a luxury office building, with a below-market, long-term lease that could be valuable to a potential acquirer or for a sublease. The elegant, wood-paneled offices were used for scenes in the George Clooney legal thriller ''Michael Clayton.''
Standing on the sidelines as Dewey tries to save itself is Steven H. Davis, the firm's former chairman, who was ousted from his leadership posts last weekend. The Manhattan district attorney's office is investigating whether Mr. Davis committed any crimes in his management of the firm.
Barry A. Bohrer, a lawyer for Mr. Davis, says his client is confident that the investigation will conclude that he did nothing wrong. ''Every action of Mr. Davis as chair of the firm was taken in good faith and in the best interests of the firm,'' Mr. Bohrer said.
Yet the turmoil at Dewey & LeBoeuf has its origins in a boom-era law firm merger pushed by Mr. Davis. The firm was the product of a combination between the New York firms Dewey Ballantine and LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae in 2007. At the time, Dewey was having some financial difficulties, but Mr. Davis broached Dewey on the idea of the merger, arguing that law firms needed to get bigger to compete in a global economy. Mr. Davis was also said to be enamored with the Dewey name and its ''white shoe'' aura.
Legal industry experts are questioning whether Mr. Davis's aggressive growth strategy was in the best interests of the firm. Mr. Davis extended dozens of lucrative long-term contracts to Dewey's lawyers to keep the existing partners happy and poach star lawyers from other firms. While large corporate law firms have increasingly used guarantees to attract talent, the scope and scale of Dewey's pay packages was an outlier.
Several Dewey partners had pay packages worth more than $5 million a year. These so-called rainmakers include Morton A. Pierce, a mergers and acquisitions deal maker; Michael L. Fitzgerald, a corporate lawyer specializing in Latin America; and Berge Setrakian, a partner with a large international practice. All three have remained at the firm.
Last fall, after it became evident that the firm's profits would disappoint, Mr. Davis disclosed that about 100 lawyers had guarantees of some kind, putting the firm in financial straits. Salaries were slashed for several partners who had multimillion-dollar annual pay packages, including Henry C. Bunsow, a patent litigator in San Francisco, and Alan Salpeter, a Chicago trial lawyer. Neither has left Dewey.
Multimillion-dollar payouts were never a concern for the roughly 1,000 employees who make up Dewey's support staff. John J. Altorelli, a former Dewey partner now at DLA Piper, e-mailed his former partners on Monday to start an assistance fund if they find themselves out of a job. He said he was making an initial donation of $10,000 and urged others to chip in.
''I hope you are all doing well under the circumstances,'' Mr. Altorelli wrote.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Growth in Manufacturing Is Highest in Almost a Year

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Manufacturing grew last month at the fastest rate in 10 months, suggesting that the economy is healthier than recent data had indicated.
New orders, production and a measure of hiring all rose. The April survey from the Institute for Supply Management was a hopeful sign ahead of Friday's monthly jobs report and helped the Dow Jones industrial average end the day at its highest level in more than four years. 
The institute, a trade group of purchasing managers, said Tuesday that its index of manufacturing activity reached 54.8 in April, the highest level since June. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.
The increase surprised analysts, who had predicted a decline after several regional reports showed manufacturing growth weakened last month. The gain led investors to shift money out of bonds and into stocks.
The manufacturing index is closely watched in part because it is the first major economic report for each month. April's big gain followed a series of weaker reports in recent weeks that showed hiring slowed, applications for unemployment benefits rose and factory output dropped.
''This survey will ease concerns that the softer tone of the incoming news in recent months marked the start of a renewed slowdown in growth,'' Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients. ''We think the latest recovery is made of sterner stuff, although we doubt it will set the world alight.''
The latest reading is well above the recession low of 33.1 and above the long-run average of 52.8. But it is still below the prerecession high of 61.4.
Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist at the Manufacturers' Alliance, noted that in the past 20 years, the index has been at or above 54.8 only one-third of the time.
A measure of employment in the institute's survey rose to a 10-month high. That indicates that factories are hiring steadily.
A gauge of new orders jumped to its highest level in a year. That could signal faster production in the coming months. Export orders also rose, offsetting worries that weaker economies in Europe and China could slow American exports.
A separate report showed China's factory sector is still growing. A survey of purchasing managers in that country found that the manufacturing sector expanded for the fifth straight month in April.
Rich Bergmann, managing director of Accenture's global manufacturing practice, said large manufacturers were driving the nation's growth. They are pushing their suppliers to increase output, which has led many to hire more workers.
Large companies are also helping smaller companies in their supply chain, Mr. Bergmann said, by guaranteeing a certain level of orders or helping smaller companies obtain financing to expand.
''There's just a tremendous trickle-down effect in these industries,'' Mr. Bergmann said. ''That's a very positive trend that we think will continue.''
Boeing reported a 58 percent jump in profit in the January-March quarter. Orders for its more-fuel-efficient 737 jetliner soared. The company added 11,000 employees last year.

HEADLINE: Mixed in Paris, Poured in New York

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
ROMEE de GORIAINOFF, one of the French partners in the Experimental Cocktail Club Lower East Side, which opened last week, has more in common with the stars of New York's cocktail culture than just a taste for well-made drinks. Like some of his new peers, he is also a fugitive from the banking business. 
But it was American-style cocktails that inspired the group (which includes Pierre-Charles Cros, who studied economics, and Olivier Bon, who studied fashion) to open their first bar and lounge in Paris five years ago under the same name.
''We saw so much diversity in drinking in New York, it was fascinating,'' Mr. de Goriainoff said. ''There was no cocktail culture in France, and what people were drinking was bad quality. None of us had real professional experience before we started the E.C.C. We did our first professional experience by creating our own jobs, and in that respect we are very American-spirited.''
The Parisian original, furnished with vintage odds and ends, has no more than 25 seats, and bartenders who would look at home in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with their caps and suspenders. They mix drinks like the Memphis sour, made with Rittenhouse rye, red wine, lemon, bitters and paprika. The group owns three cocktail lounges and a wine bar in Paris -- all with different names because ''the French don't like chains,'' as Mr. de Goriainoff put it. There is also an Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown, in London.
For New York, the partners have decorated a larger space in a mix of retro styles, with a pressed tin ceiling. ''We thought this look would reflect the history of this neighborhood,'' Mr. Cros said.
The menu lists 14 cocktails made by Nicolas de Soto, most of which are extremely complex, like the Curious Prescription, made with reposado tequila, pear eau de vie, manzanilla sherry, lime juice, habanero bitters and homemade salted caramel mezcal syrup. But the partners do not want the cocktail menu published. ''It should be a surprise to the customers who come in,'' Mr. de Goriainoff said.
There are several Champagnes by the bottle and one beer. Some tidbits, like Scotch eggs and plates of cured meats and cheeses, are provided by the nearby Fat Radish restaurant, which has an English bent.
Still, the partners are so focused on this side of the Atlantic that they have opened an American-style steakhouse, the Beef Club, in a former butcher shop in central Paris. Mac and cheese, a burger and Caesar salad share the menu with cote de boeuf and rump steak.
Experimental Cocktail Club Lower East Side, 191 Chrystie Street (Rivington Street). No phone. For reservations: madameandmonsieur@experimentalcocktailclubny.com The bar is open daily from 7 p.m. to 4 a.m.

DALLAS -- Two things were supposed to happen when the Nasher Sculpture Center opened here in 2003. Famous works like Rodin's ''Age of Bronze'' and Matisse's ''Madeleine I'' were to be bathed in copious sunlight streaming through a glass roof. And new vigor was to come to the surrounding neighborhood.
The results exceeded expectations. And Dallas has a mess on its hands.
The center, designed by Renzo Piano and Peter Walker, was considered so appealing that a 42-story condominium called Museum Tower sprouted across the street. But the glass skin of the condo tower, still under construction, now reflects so much light that it is threatening artworks in the galleries, burning the plants in the center's garden and blinding visitors with its glare. 
No one quite knows what to do. The condo developer and museum officials are at loggerheads. Fingers are being pointed. Mr. Piano is furious. The developer's architect is aggrieved. The mayor is involved. A former official in the George W. Bush administration has been asked to mediate.
The situation has been characterized by some here as a David-and-Goliath battle between a beloved nonprofit and commercial interests. But the dispute has also raised the broader question of what can happen when, as is currently the rage, cultural institutions are cast as engines of economic development.
The Nasher was seen as an important spur to the renaissance of downtown Dallas, much the way Lincoln Center was viewed as something of a cure for urban blight on the West Side of Manhattan. But the forces unleashed in these situations can prompt a distinctly uneasy relationship between cultural organizations and the neighborhood changes they attract.
''These things start to bump into each other,'' said the mayor of Dallas, Mike Rawlings. ''How we as a civic society power through this is an important moment for us. You've got a high-growth engine that is trying to do right by Giacometti.''
Dallas's interest in raising its cultural profile is palpable here: the city has been building its arts district over the last 20 years; Saturday Cowboys Stadium hosted a simulcast of Mozart's ''Magic Flute'' by the Dallas Opera. The Nasher problem has the whole city concerned and watching.
''Typically, neighborhood disputes are not this dramatic -- an offending sign or a barking dog,'' said Veletta Forsythe Lill, the executive director of the Dallas Arts District. ''This is a cultural, civic and commercial tragedy. The Nasher is a kind of a masterpiece, and the building and the garden were perfectly designed.''
Mr. Piano said he designed the Nasher with natural light in mind. The museum has an arched glass roof with a perforated aluminum screen in an egg-crate pattern that directs the sun into the galleries, which were laid out in anticipation of the sun's daily arc from southeast to southwest.
Now, sun, magnified by reflection, shines into the galleries from the north and raises the temperature in the sculpture garden -- designed by Mr. Walker -- to levels that jeopardize the specially planted live oak trees and grass.
''By doing this, they destroy completely the logic of the building,'' Mr. Piano said in an interview.
For the museumgoer, the sculptures in the galleries and the garden can be obscured or distorted by distracting light patterns or glare. The museum was forced to install light-blocking panels inside the roof for a recent exhibition of works by Elliott Hundley because the reflections from the tower exceeded the acceptable light levels for the art.
Scott Johnson, the Los Angeles architect who designed Museum Tower, said he was willing to consider remedies but that the Nasher also had to be open-minded. ''My responsibility is to fully vet solutions vis-a-vis Museum Tower -- that's my building,'' he said. ''But I can't say sitting here now that the Nasher may not need to do something on their end.''
Museum Tower's owners said in a statement, ''All parties desire resolution to these issues as quickly as possible.''
Glare problems, of course, can cut both ways. In Los Angeles a few years ago, the architect Frank Gehry had to sandblast portions of his stainless-steel-clad Disney Concert Hall because the reflected sunlight was creating problems for residents in a nearby apartment building.
Mr. Piano, for his part, said it would be ''impossible'' for the museum building to make adjustments to offset the glare.
''What do you do -- put a roof on the garden? You destroy everything,'' he said. ''They must solve the problem because they created the problem.''
Architecture experts say the owners of Museum Tower could cover its glass facade with a solar shading system that cuts the glare, at potentially considerable expense.
A regulation that set a strict limit on the reflectivity of buildings on the site expired in 2008 and was revised with more lenient restrictions, though the tower's opponents say the building still exceeds them. Mr. Johnson said that he learned of such rules only recently through the local news media and that he hoped the conflict ''ignites a larger conversation about urban communities and neighbors.''
Not everyone here, of course, views the dispute as a cataclysm. Writing in The Dallas Observer last month, the columnist Jim Schutze made light of it.
''Nothing takes our minds off this misery we call middle-class survival in America like a rich kids art fight,'' he wrote. ''It's like our own little hometown Brangelina.''
Since the building that overlooks the sculpture center and its garden is using the Nasher as a selling point -- prices stretch into the millions -- those involved say its owners should want to keep the Nasher healthy.
''By doing this, they kill what they use to sell it,'' Mr. Piano said.
The Dallas Arts District -- which now includes the AT&T , Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center and the Dallas Museum of Art -- always also hoped to attract commercial projects.
''I want Museum Tower to be very successful -- I want people living in that building and loving to live in that building,'' said Deedie Rose, a Dallas arts philanthropist who was active in establishing the arts district. ''But the Nasher has to be protected.''
The sculpture center was created by Raymond D. Nasher, a real estate developer and banker who, along with his wife, Patsy, amassed one of the world's leading collections of Modern and contemporary sculpture. Although several cities courted the collection, Mr. Nasher, who died in 2007, decided to build and personally finance the $70 million center in Dallas, where he made his fortune.
''He gave a tremendous gift to the city,'' Mayor Rawlings said, ''a gift we've got to be good stewards of.''
Complicating matters is that the $200 million Museum Tower is owned by the Dallas Police & Fire Pension System, on whose board sit four members of the City Council.
Mayor Rawlings stepped in after the two sides failed to come to terms on their own. He appointed a ''facilitator,'' Tom Luce, a prominent local lawyer who served under President George W. Bush as an assistant secretary of education. The first meeting with Mr. Luce is this month.
Construction of the tower continues. And the Nasher had to remove Picasso's ''Nude Man and Woman,'' an oil on canvas, to get it out of dangerous direct sunlight. (The artist James Turrell also insisted that the Nasher shut down his installation ''Tending, (Blue)'' because its roof aperture was meant to reveal open sky, not a skyscraper.)
Vel Hawes, a Dallas architect who served as Mr. Nasher's representative for the design and construction of the museum, said the founder would not be happy. ''I assure you,'' Mr. Hawes said, ''he's not resting easy in his grave right now.''

HEADLINE: Baseball in Their Veins, but a New Ball at Their Feet

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD; Jose Goitia contributed reporting.

 BODY:
HAVANA -- At dusk one recent night, under the amber glow of streetlights in a gritty neighborhood, a ball took flight amid a gaggle of young boys. It was not hit by a bat. It did not fit comfortably in the palm of a hand. It was not, strikingly in a country that embraces ''America's pastime'' as its own, a baseball.
This ball was kicked around in an impromptu game -- a pair of old desks marked the goals -- by Cuban youths who consider soccer their favorite sport. 
''We play after school, all day if we can,'' said Emanuel Fernandez, 10, who minutes earlier had toasted a hard-earned goal with a cartwheel. ''It's our game, fun and fast.''
Such a declaration would have once been heresy here. Baseball has long been considered as Cuban as hand-rolled cigars, regardless of the game's origin in a country that the government derisively calls ''the empire.'' Fidel Castro is a known devotee of the sport and dabbled in it in his younger years. The Cuban national baseball team has won gold or silver in the past five Olympic Games, and several players have defected to play in the major leagues.
Soccer has a less storied past. Cuba's lone World Cup appearance, in 1938, ended in a humiliating 8-0 loss to Sweden in the quarterfinals. Except for occasional flashes of strength regionally, Cuba's national team has dwelt in the cellar in world competition ever since.
But in the past few years, soccer has made inroads here. After Cuban television broadcast the World Cup in 2010 and began showing more European matches, pickup games started sprouting across the island. Children are walking around with Messi jerseys (for Lionel Messi, the Argentine star) and those of other stars, and chanting allegiance to Real Madrid or Barcelona, whose rivalry is closely followed. Roars erupt from bars and apartments over a voice bellowing from the TV: Gooooool!
The soccer frenzy has reached the point that a recent report on state television asked whether the passion for baseball was declining. And on Cubadebate, a government-controlled news site, a column by the sportswriter Michel Contreras this month declared the notion that Cuban baseball was on its deathbed ''absurd.''
He suggested that the quality of Cuban baseball might have slipped somewhat, fueling interest in soccer, but he said there was room for both.
''Those who try to dam back the most universal of games are wasting their time,'' he wrote, while ''those who think Cuba will renounce baseball, the white globule with seams flowing through our veins, are seeing crocodiles in their soup.''
He added, ''Nothing in the world, not even the voracious shark called soccer, is capable of eating our essence.''
Soccer, however, does have a few things going for it here.
It is largely youths who are embracing it, giving it good odds for the future.
And parents find it more economical, since it requires just a ball, as opposed to the glove, ball and bat needed for baseball. And even tight spaces can double as a field; in one park, a group of young players climbed onto the roof of a bathroom building when all the proper fields were full and began kicking a ball around.
Nancy Gomez, watching her 9-year-old grandson practice with a team at a park, said: ''Soccer is a good game because it's just a ball, nothing else. With one ball the children play all they want.''
She added, ''With four or five children, they play, kicking the ball around.''
Her grandson, Fabio Zayas, said he favored the game because it was ''very active and dynamic.''
More than a few fans, in fact, pointed out the speed of the game and the passing action, compared with the long innings of baseball, during which there can be more waiting around than actual action.
Bars and restaurants showing games quickly fill up, as was the case on when Real Madrid defeated Barcelona, 2-1, on April 21, in one of the most-watched games worldwide.
''It's the contrast between two big teams,'' said Carlos Menendez, a server at El Aljibe, a popular state restaurant that regularly shows soccer. ''That is very attractive to Cubans. We love competition.''
Naturally, there are some political overtones.
Cuba's interest has coincided with a burst of soccer mania in Venezuela. The countries have close ties, and last summer President Hugo Chavez, while visiting Mr. Castro, watched the Copa America tournament with him and sent a Twitter message after a goal that said: ''Watching the game here with Fidel. We will live! We will conquer!'' (Venezuela defeated Chile, 2-1, in that match and eventually placed fourth.)
With no professional sports in Cuba, the same yearning among athletes to defect and win big paychecks abroad tugs at the few soccer stars here. In March, Yosmel de Armas, a member of the Cuban national soccer team, disappeared before a game in Nashville and later surfaced in Miami asking for asylum. In 2008, several members of the squad defected in Tampa, Fla., during an Olympic qualifying tournament.
Some people who were asked which sport truly represented Cuba emphatically declared baseball the ''national sport'' and left it at that, while others wondered if the government would tolerate any fading of baseball.
''Among Cuban youths, devotion to soccer grows as enthusiasm for baseball decays. I wonder, what will happen?'' the blogger Yoani Sanchez said on her Twitter account recently as she listened to cheers ring out from people watching the Spanish league match.
But there is general agreement that while FIFA, soccer's world governing body, is working to improve fields and the quality of play here, Cuba is a long way from becoming a threat to the world soccer order.
''Everyone who works also has to have dreams,'' said Antonio Garces Segura, vice president of the Cuba soccer federation. ''We can dream that one day we could get to the World Cup, and why not win it?''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, the Havana Journal article on Wednesday, about the inroads that soccer is making in Cuba, misstated the date of Real Madrid's 2-1 victory over Barcelona, a game that filled Havana's bars and restaurants where it was broadcast. The game was on April 21, not this past weekend.

HEADLINE: Furor Over Executive Pay Is Not the Revolt It Appears to Be

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff, a former corporate lawyer, is a professor of law and finance at Ohio State University. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @StevenDavidoff on Twitter.

 BODY:
Shareholder protests over excessive executive pay have erupted at Barclays, Citigroup and Chesapeake Energy. Could this be the beginning of a corporate Arab Spring?
Don't bet on it. Each of these cases reflects a particular outrage against poor compensation practices. While it might make corporate governance activists and the Occupy Wall Street movement happier to think these events are a sign of change, these protests are more likely to dissipate once the media attention surrounding them dies down.
In Citigroup's case, about 55 percent of shareholders voted against Citigroup's executive compensation package. The flash point was last year's pay of the bank's chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit, which the influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services calculates could be as much as $49 million. 
The only surprise about this vote was that so many shareholders still voted in favor. Citigroup's stock has declined more than 90 percent in the last five years, and the company has been a prime example of mismanagement in the years leading up to the financial crisis. Mr. Pandit stabilized the ship, and Citigroup argued that he had been underpaid in previous years, with a salary of only a $1 a year.
But Citigroup conveniently ignored the fact that I.S.S. concluded his pay last year was above the median for comparable finance chief executives. Citigroup had also paid Mr. Pandit hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire his firm, Old Lane Partners, an investment it has written off completely. Shareholders simply had enough.
In Barclays' case, shareholders actually heckled management at the annual meeting. When people yell in Britain, it is serious business and a sign that resentment of financial firms is even greater there than it is in the United States. More notably, despite this furor, only 26.9 percent of Barclays shareholders voted against the $10 million pay package of the chief executive, Robert E. Diamond Jr.
Then there is Chesapeake. The company had previously granted its chief executive, Aubrey K. McClendon, the right to buy up to a 2.5 percent interest in every well it drilled. Reuters reported that Mr. McClendon had borrowed $1.1 billion to purchase these interests. In the wake of the subsequent outcry, one analyst called for the Chesapeake board to be removed because of its ''unwillingness'' to stop these practices. I would argue that the board should be removed for simple lack of common sense.
All three companies now appear contrite. Richard D. Parsons, the retiring chairman of the Citigroup board, has said, ''We're going to have some more conversation with our shareholders ... and then fix it. ''Barclays' chairman, Marcus Agius, has apologized to shareholders for not considering their views, and Barclays executives have revised the components of their compensation. And Chesapeake's board has announced that it will end the well-repurchase program 18 months early and is reviewing the exact nature of Mr. McClendon's financing arrangements. On Tuesday, Mr. McClendon announced he would resign as Chesapeake's board chairman, but not as chief executive.
These instances drew shareholder attention, but a majority of companies escape scrutiny. Median pay for executives at 200 major companies was $9.6 million in 2010 according to a study conducted for The New York Times by Equilar, a compensation consultant. This figure was a 12 percent rise over 2009 figures, and the majority of these executives are now being paid above prerecession levels.
Say-on-pay provisions have given shareholders an outlet to express their opinions on this unchecked growth, but most of them don't seem to care enough to express that opinion strongly. According to the I.S.S., only eight companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index failed their say-on-pay votes last year. Only 30 companies in the Russell 3,000 received negative votes because of say-on-pay rules. Recommendations by I.S.S. to vote no on pay were ignored about nine out of 10 times.
There is no reason to think that the ''no'' votes are going to be any higher this year. Even I.S.S. does not make its recommendation on the size of the pay package, but rather how it is tied to performance.
In Britain, where the outrage over executive compensations seems to be louder, little is being done to rein in pay. Say-on-pay provisions have been around in Britain for about a decade, but pay of chief executives has continued to increase. One study found that there were fewer than a dozen negative votes in the first six years that say-on-pay was introduced.
The fact is that shareholders - except for activist hedge funds who specialize in agitating for change - have little incentive to act. If they don't like a company's practices, they can simply sell and invest in another company. Compare this with shareholder activism, which is not only costly but risky, with benefits accruing to all other shareholders.
Moreover, pay is often a small part of a company's expenses. Citigroup has a balance sheet of almost $2 trillion, so who really wants to spend time scrutinizing $50 million in light of the larger issues the company faces? Directors, too, would prefer to devote their scrutiny on the operation of the company and might not want to challenge the chief executive over pay.
These are all old reasons that pay continues to spiral upward, but recent events don't change anything. The best we are going to get, even in egregious cases, is a few apologies and tweaks. Let's see what these companies do once the rage fades in a few years. Citigroup's board has yet to announce any compensation changes.
Expect to see a few headlines this proxy season about financial companies and perhaps a handful of no votes because of say-on-pay provisions. Companies may even adjust their pay packages to conform more with I.S.S. recommendations on tying pay to performance.
But this is just tinkering at the edges at best. Thousands of other companies will go on as before, safe in knowing that the dynamics of the corporation and say-on-pay will not touch them unless they have an eye-popping example like the Chesapeake chief executive's deal.
If anything, say-on-pay provisions are likely to have the opposite effect from what was intended, as shareholders validate pay proposals in Soviet-style fashion. The fact that executive compensation increased more than 12 percent in the first year after say-on-pay was introduced doesn't give much comfort.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Visit Well Timed to Future Uncertainties in Afghanistan

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN; Sangar Rahimi contributed reporting.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- The moment that President Obama chose to visit Afghanistan for the first time in 17 months was a rare chance for him to make the most of a brief window when relations between the two governments are improving after months of crisis, and when the likely fallout of the coming NATO withdrawal is still months away.
In the background, however, lurk a host of concerns about how things could go once the bulk of American troops leave and the pipeline of foreign aid slows to a trickle, which is expected to happen by the end of 2014. Both will increase the country's already deep sense of precariousness. And there is concern, too, about whether what once were cornerstone American goals in Afghanistan -- establishing reliable security forces, hobbling the insurgency, curbing endemic corruption, securing enduring rights for women and minorities -- are now unrealistic given the looming deadline. 
''None of the tensions between the United States and the Karzai government have gone away,'' said Anthony H. Cordesman, a strategic analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, in an essay published Tuesday on the center's Web site. ''The broader problems with Afghan governance and corruption are not diminishing. Progress in creating effective Afghan forces is increasingly questionable, the insurgents are clearly committed to going on with the fight, and relations with Pakistan seem to take two steps backward for every apparent step forward.''
Mr. Cordesman continued, ''As for American domestic politics, there seems to be growing, tacit, bipartisan agreement to drift toward an exit strategy without really admitting it.''
Even now, months before any substantial drawdown, there are growing concerns about whether the Haqqani militant network, fresh off a blitz of attacks that paralyzed the capital for a day last month, poses a growing long-term threat. And mainstream Taliban leaders have yet to embrace talks, seemingly willing to bet that they can secure both influence and territory on their own terms.
The American military drawdown is scheduled to come as Afghanistan turns to electing a new president, compounding fears that there will not be a peaceful transition of power. In its absence, there could be ''a political meltdown,'' wrote Haroun Mir, the director of Afghanistan's Center for Research and Policy Studies, in a recent Op-Ed article in The New York Times.
On at least one front, however, the trip communicated something of vital importance to the Afghans: reassurance that the United States is not in an all-out scramble to get away.
Trust has been in short supply between the countries this year, reeling from crises including the burning of Korans at Bagram Air Base in February and the murder of 16 men, women and children purportedly by an American sergeant in southern Afghanistan in March. Meanwhile, the number of killings of Westerners by rogue Afghan security forces and Taliban infiltrators is rising sharply, now accounting for 20 percent of all NATO casualties this year.
So it was not a minor point for the Afghans that Mr. Obama came here to celebrate the completion of a 10-year Strategic Partnership Agreement between the two countries, which guaranteed America's continued economic and development aid as well as the promise of a future security arrangement.
''His trip shows that the United States will stay in the region and will not repeat the mistake that the Americans made after communist regime was toppled in Afghanistan,'' said Mirdad Nejrab, the chairman of the Afghan Parliament's Internal Security Committee. ''It is a good answer to our neighbors and regional countries, which thought that the Americans were leaving the region.''
The moment was one when President Hamid Karzai, often a harsh critic of the United States, was feeling generous, having reached three agreements with the Americans that he could present to his country as the re-emergence of a sovereign Afghanistan.
The two other deals recently signed by the countries gave the Afghan government authority over detentions and transferred primary authority over special operations raids, including the night raids that have outraged both Mr. Karzai and the Afghan public.
''It's a very good time for him to come here, there's not too much controversial news right now and he can project some level of stability and smoothness in the relations,'' said Waheed Omar, a former spokesman for Mr. Karzai, adding that the visit allows Mr. Obama to go to the May 20 NATO meeting in Chicago on Afghanistan in a strong position.
That narrative could be far harder to sustain six months from now as 23,000 American troops withdraw. The jury is out on whether Afghan forces will be able stave off the Taliban, keep warlords and their militias under control and play a neutral role as political forces struggle for power in the next election.

HEADLINE: Obama Approach to Diplomacy Faces Test in China

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When Hillary Rodham Clinton made her first trip to China in 2009, barely a month into her tenure as secretary of state, she said that American concerns about human rights should not interfere with other pressing global issues on which the United States and China could find common ground. Human rights advocates were appalled, and under orders from the White House, Mrs. Clinton softened her remarks the next day.
But her candid admission reflected the cold calculation that continues to shape President Obama's foreign policy when it comes to championing rights and freedoms abroad. Quiet diplomacy and compromise, administration officials argue, are sometimes more effective, if less satisfying morally, than thunderous public condemnation. 
The administration's strategy, already under fire from critics on the left and the right, now faces its most public test as Mrs. Clinton arrives again in Beijing for talks that are certain to receive far less attention than the uncertain fate of a Chinese lawyer, Chen Guangcheng, who escaped a brutalizing, illegal house arrest and has sought protection from American diplomats in the Chinese capital.
''This is a remarkable and possibly unprecedented opportunity for the United States to express sympathy and support for someone who is a folk hero now in China,'' said Sophie Richardson, the China director for Human Rights Watch.
She noted the administration's refrain, repeated Monday by Mr. Obama, that the United States welcomed China's growing prosperity and global influence, and added, ''This is the moment to stand up and say we welcome the rise of China and the work of people like Chen Guangcheng.''
Administration officials have so far opted for a different approach, refusing even to acknowledge Mr. Chen's case or the fact that he appears to be in the protective safety of American diplomats, though Mrs. Clinton has raised his mistreatment in the past. That has renewed criticism that the White House has soft-pedaled the question of human rights when it comes to China or other repressive countries whenever expedience dictates it.
Mr. Obama's aides dispute that, pointing to numerous statements by the president and Mrs. Clinton and, most recently, to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s toast at a State Department luncheon in February with China's vice president and presumed leader-to-be, Xi Jinping.
''We have been clear about our concern over the areas in which from our perspective conditions in China have deteriorated and about the plight of several very prominent individuals,'' Mr. Biden said as a chill permeated an otherwise sociable event.
For Mr. Obama, though, it is a question of tone and emphasis. Every president, to some degree, has championed human rights around the world. For the last 35 years the United States has produced an annual report on individual nations that have adhered to basic freedoms; the 36th is to be released this month. And yet each president during that time has also been reproached for ignoring abuses committed by countries whose security or economic importance mattered more to American national interest.
Ronald Reagan promoted political freedom behind the Iron Curtain but did so far less vigorously in Latin America. (He also negotiated treaties with the Soviet Union, whose abuses he denounced relentlessly.)
George W. Bush advocated a ''Freedom Agenda'' but faced the same accusations as Mr. Obama when it came to pushing Egypt, Russia or China -- and endured accusations of hypocrisy for America's own actions in Iraq and on Guantanamo. No president has ever really taken Saudi Arabia to task as one of the world's most repressive societies, where religions other than Islam are banned, women cannot drive and no one can vote.
A senior official argued that the Obama administration had advanced the argument beyond the bully pulpit by, for example, rejoining the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, once derided as a den of hypocrisy because some of the worst violators sat on it. With the United States at the table, and Iran being voted out, the council has issued condemnations of abuses in Syria and Iran, and ejected Libya when Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi cracked down on protests.
''It would be a mistake to judge any administration's record on what the slogan is,'' the official said, arguing that the White House and State Department promote human rights in many forums and aspects beyond public statements. Mr. Obama, the official said, ''is looking for the tools that are going to work.''
Using human rights as a pillar of foreign policy inevitably exposes the chasm between the high ideal of American values (''It comports with our principles,'' Mr. Obama said on Monday) and the hardheaded pragmatism of advancing American business and security interests.
In the case of Bahrain, to cite another example, the administration has spoken out far less forcefully about the harsh crackdown on popular unrest than about similar activity in other countries, in part because of its strategic importance as host to the Navy's Fifth Fleet. Tom Malinowski, Human Rights Watch's Washington director, recently returned from Bahrain and praised the administration's quiet efforts to force the government there to seek a peaceful solution.
''The problem is that few people in Bahrain and the broader region know this, because administration officials have not spoken publicly about Bahrain with consistent passion and clarity,'' he wrote in an e-mail.
No country is more vexing on human rights than China, whose economic transformation has made it an essential partner of the United States but which remains profoundly repressive.
''Every administration since Nixon has had the same balance between security and human rights in China,'' said Jeffrey A. Bader of the Brookings Institution, who was Mr. Obama's senior adviser on Asia until April 2011. ''We have to stand for the rights of dissidents who are pursuing their goals peacefully, but that doesn't mean that that's what's at the core of America's objectives in this relationship.''
Despite her rough start in China, Mrs. Clinton has received accolades for making the case that respect for basic rights is essential for any country to develop and prosper since they demand rule of law and civil society. In February 2011, she delivered a scathing critique of China's abuses that mentioned Mr. Chen.
Another time, she argued that ''we must be pragmatic and agile'' in dealing with China on human rights. ''In every instance,'' she said, ''our aim will be to make a difference, not prove a point.''
The resolution of Mr. Chen's fate, whether during her visit or later, will now test that strategy.

HEADLINE: U.S. Reaffirms Defense of Philippines in Standoff With China

BYLINE: By FLOYD WHALEY

 BODY:
MANILA -- With a standoff between Philippine and Chinese ships under way in a disputed corner of the South China Sea, senior leaders from the United States and the Philippines have reaffirmed their longstanding commitment to mutual defense.
''We oppose the threat or use of force by any party to advance its claim,'' Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said after the meeting Monday in Washington. ''And we will remain in close contact with our ally, the Philippines.''
Mrs. Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta met with their Philippine counterparts, Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario and Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin. They discussed broadening their military alliance as well as expanding economic and cultural ties, though no specific new initiatives were announced. 
The meeting took place as the standoff in the South China Sea entered its fourth week. Since April 8, maritime vessels from China and the Philippines have been stationed at Scarborough Shoal, a disputed string of rock outcroppings about 200 kilometers, or 125 miles, west of Luzon Island in the northern Philippines. Both countries claim the area and have demanded that the other leave.
Diplomatic negotiations are under way to resolve the standoff at the shoal, and both sides say they are trying to calm the situation. Still, belligerent rhetoric has continued in both Manila and Beijing.
The Philippine government has accused China of ''bullying'' its vessels in the disputed area by making aggressive maneuvers, and Manila lawmakers have called on the country to stand its ground. Late last week, a Chinese general wrote in an online commentary that his government should be open to taking military action. ''Considering the relative military strengths of China and the Philippines, the Filipino people can judge for themselves the wisdom or otherwise of their government's decision to take this stand against China,'' Maj. Gen. Luo Yuan wrote.
At the meeting in Washington, Mr. del Rosario said his country was seeking the help of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to resolve the standoff. The association has been largely silent on the issue. The Philippines is also seeking United Nations mediation in the dispute, but China opposes that option.
When asked whether the United States would come to the aid of the Philippines if it were attacked at Scarborough Shoal, Mr. del Rosario responded: ''They have expressed that they will honor their obligations under the mutual defense treaty.''
The treaty obligates the two nations to defend each another in the case of attack, although it is not clear how that might be applied in a disputed area.
Discussions of broader military cooperation have been under way since last year, when the administration of President Barack Obama announced a strategic ''pivot'' toward the Asia-Pacific region. In November, Mrs. Clinton visited Manila and proclaimed continued American military support from the deck of a warship.
The discussions on Monday were the highest-level talks between the two countries since those developments.
Any expansion of the American military presence in the Philippines, a former American colony, would be controversial. The Philippine government forced the United States to close its military bases in the country in 1992, and any suggestion that the return of permanent American facilities is being considered remains highly sensitive.
Mr. Gazmin appeared to acknowledge this after the meeting Monday. ''We are also mindful that our efforts to further our alliance need to be in full consideration of our respective national laws and political context,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Shot Sunk, And Taken, In Campaign

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
BOSTON -- The half-court basketball shot that Senator Scott P. Brown sank on Friday during a visit to a youth center -- recorded by his staff and widely circulated on the Web -- was just the beginning.
So far this week, Mr. Brown, a Republican, has won endorsements by Democratic former mayors of Boston and Worcester, given a speech emphasizing his votes across party lines and released a radio ad calling on Americans to ''work together now'' despite partisan differences. 
By contrast, Elizabeth Warren, his main Democratic challenger for the United States Senate seat once held by Edward M. Kennedy, has been engulfed in controversy stemming from accusations by the Brown camp that she sought an unfair advantage in her academic career by claiming American Indian ancestry. For the last two days, she has kept a low profile in Massachusetts, though she spoke at a union convention in Washington on Tuesday.
The Warren campaign says this political moment is of little consequence compared with those involving health care and student loans that middle-class voters face every day. ''These are the moments that Elizabeth Warren cares about -- they are why she is running for Senate -- not manufactured moments in a long political campaign,'' said Kyle Sullivan, a spokesman for Ms. Warren.
Political analysts are divided about the importance of the ancestry issue and whether it represents a turning point in a race in which the polls have shown the candidates running neck and neck. But as Ms. Warren, a first-time candidate, faces a test in how she deals with a potential crisis, Mr. Brown has seized the momentum.
''He's touring the state touting his bipartisanship while she's on the defensive with a diversity issue,'' said Peter Ubertaccio, a professor of political science at Stonehill College in Easton, Mass. ''The juxtaposition is not good for her.''
The trouble started Friday, when The Boston Herald reported that Harvard Law School, where Ms. Warren teaches, had cited her as a member of a minority group in an effort to counteract criticism that its faculty was too white and too male. Then over the weekend, it was revealed that Ms. Warren had in the past listed herself as a minority member in a national legal directory.
The Brown campaign pounced, saying that by representing herself as a minority member, Ms. Warren had unfairly exploited the goals of affirmative action programs and raised questions about her credibility. ''Professor Warren needs to come clean about her motivations for making these claims,'' said Jim Barnett, Mr. Brown's campaign manager.
The Warren campaign responded that she had done nothing wrong. Aides said she had listed herself as a minority member in the legal directory because she was proud of her heritage. (The listing covered the period from 1986, when she was teaching at the University of Texas, through 1995, when she moved from the University of Pennsylvania to Harvard.)
At the union event in Washington on Tuesday, Ms. Warren took Mr. Brown to task for opposing the federal health care law while using it to his family's benefit. Mr. Brown acknowledged in a Boston Globe article that he has used a provision of President Obama's health care law to cover his 23-year-old daughter, even though he voted against the bill shortly after winning the 2010 special election for the Senate.
Some analysts said the ancestry issue would not hurt Ms. Warren, who has raised a staggering amount of money since entering the race last September. Maurice Cunningham, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, described the accusations as ''trivial.''
''The number of Massachusetts citizens who are going to be worrying about her heritage, with the economy still slowly recovering, is probably pretty minuscule,'' he said.
But David Paleologos, a pollster at Suffolk University in Boston, said it seemed unlikely that Ms. Warren could move past the issue unless she addressed it head on. ''Now, it's like every day there's some new discovery or some new twist,'' he said. ''It's not even about ancestry anymore; it's about gaming the system and why did you do this?''
Mr. Ubertaccio said that on the one hand, he believed Ms. Warren should provide a fuller explanation of why she listed herself as a minority member in the legal directory. But on the other, he said that if he were advising her campaign, ''I'd also be thinking to myself, 'We don't want to be overreacting to these kind of one-off events.' I do think this issue isn't going to last.''

HEADLINE: In Pursuit of Bloomberg, the Reluctant Endorser

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO; Trip Gabriel, Kate Taylor and Peter Baker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
They court him over coffee and drop by when they are in town. They dangle invitations for golf and enlist friends to put in a good word.
In an election year when partisanship has burned white hot and the economy has sputtered, two presidential candidates who agree on very little, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, have reached a rare consensus: they are both determined to score the endorsement of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, whose name is all but synonymous with Wall Street clout and nonpartisan politics.
Now, their pursuit of the billionaire mayor is headed into overdrive, with both campaigns making the kind of conspicuous ring-kissing gestures that are reserved for their most sought-after political allies, even though the candidates publicly disagree with the mayor on a range of issues. 
On Tuesday, Mr. Romney showed up at the mayor's philanthropic foundation on the Upper East Side of Manhattan for a secret breakfast meeting. Over coffee and juice, Mr. Romney made clear that he was there to pick the mayor's brain. ''Tell me what's on your mind,'' he said, according to aides who were briefed on the 30-minute discussion, which touched on immigration, gun control and education policy.
In its own public display of affection, the White House invited Mr. Bloomberg for a round of golf with two members of the Obama administration. He played with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter at a private club in suburban Maryland on Friday and with Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta at a military base in Northern Virginia on Saturday, according to people informed of the outings.
The aggressive wooing of Mr. Bloomberg, an independent who did not take sides in the last presidential race, highlights the outsize role that Wall Street is likely to play in this year's election, as both a symbol and a purveyor of campaign contributions.
For all of his achievements, Mr. Bloomberg is, first and foremost, a business mogul, whose deep knowledge of and close relationships within the world of high finance could carry significant weight at a time when many in industry feel under siege.
''If you want to have friends in the financial sector and you want to shape public opinion in the business capital of the world, then the guy you turn to, the imprimatur you want, is that of Michael R. Bloomberg,'' said Hank Sheinkopf, a longtime New York political operative who is close to the mayor.
During their meeting, Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Romney discussed Wall Street's frustrations with President Obama, who has chided bankers for their practices and called for tighter regulation of their industry, according to a person with knowledge of the conversation, who like many interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of upsetting the high-powered leaders.
Mr. Bloomberg, who has lent his reputation for common-sense government and his prowess for fund-raising to dozens of candidates from both parties over the past decade, feared that an endorsement in the 2008 race might have negative repercussions for the city he oversees.
But as his mayoral term winds down, he has told advisers that he is willing to back a candidate this time around, touching off an intense competition for his support in the general election.
''I'll see down the road,'' the mayor said coyly on Tuesday when asked about an endorsement. Describing his impressions of Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama, he made clear that he sees a wide gap between them. ''They're very different, and they give the public a real choice,'' he said. ''It's hard to argue that you can't tell the difference, if you will. They run the spectrum on lots of different issues.''
Mr. Bloomberg appears to relish the attention from the campaigns, which had crammed his calendar with boldface names. There was a lunch with Mr. Obama at the White House in February, not to mention a golf game with the commander in chief not long ago.
Neither candidate, however, is relying on his own charms to win over Mr. Bloomberg. In late April, a high-profile supporter of Mr. Romney, Senator John McCain of Arizona, talked up the presumptive Republican nominee to the mayor during a visit to City Hall, according to aides.
At the same time, aides to the president periodically reach out to the mayor's office to take Mr. Bloomberg's political temperature. Mr. Biden stopped by for coffee at Gracie Mansion, the mayor's official residence, in 2010.
To commit to either candidate, Mr. Bloomberg will have to make peace with, or at least overlook, a raft of major policy disagreements, several of them on issues for which the mayor has deep-seated and passionately held views.
Mr. Romney, for instance, vigorously opposes legalized abortion and has called for the elimination of federal financing for Planned Parenthood. Mr. Bloomberg is an avid defender of those rights, and this year alone he donated $250,000 to Planned Parenthood when the organization came under fire from conservatives.
Mr. Obama pushed for the extension of the middle-class tax cuts created under President George W. Bush, which Mr. Bloomberg has called fiscally irresponsible. And Mr. Obama has used language to describe Wall Street that has offended the mayor, who has scolded the president's political party for ''pitting Americans against each other in a game of class warfare for their own political purposes.''
Mr. Bloomberg, never known for suppressing his opinions, is hardly shying from these disputes with the candidates. During his meeting with Mr. Romney, he acknowledged their policy differences, especially over the issue of gun control, according to people told of the discussion. Mr. Bloomberg has financed a coalition to push for stricter requirements on background checks for gun buyers and the concealment of firearms. Mr. Romney has railed against the creation of rules that he said ''burden lawful gun owners.''
Mr. Romney was careful neither to ask for Mr. Bloomberg's support, nor to discuss the possibility of choosing Mr. Bloomberg as his running mate, a prospect regarded as highly unlikely. ''It was a first date,'' said an adviser to one of the men.
And as with any debut, Mr. Romney was intent on leaving the best possible impression. When pressed about the meeting on Tuesday, he was effusive in his praise for New York City's revitalization and Mr. Bloomberg's role in it. ''It's quite an extraordinary story,'' Mr. Romney said.

HEADLINE: Missed Chance

 BODY:
President Obama gave his first speech on Afghanistan in nearly a year, speaking from Bagram Air Base on the anniversary of Osama bin Laden's killing. The White House set it up as a big moment, but the president squandered the chance to fully explain his exit strategy from a war Americans are desperate to see brought to an end.
Mr. Obama repeated his commitment that American combat troops would be withdrawn by the end of 2014 and that Afghan troops would be ready long before that to take over prime responsibility for the fight against the Taliban. 
But the speech was frustratingly short on specifics. Mr. Obama didn't explain what the United States and its allies planned to do to improve the training of Afghan forces so they can hold off the Taliban. Nor did he explain what President Hamid Karzai plans to do to rein in the corruption and incompetence that are the hallmark of his leadership and that have alienated so many of his own people, playing into the hands of the Taliban.
We have long supported the war in Afghanistan as a painful but necessary fight to ensure that Al Qaeda does not again have a major launching pad for attacking the United States. But we are increasingly concerned that Mr. Obama does not have a clear policy to ensure that the country does not implode once the Americans are gone.
The president's brief, unannounced trip did accomplish one thing. He signed a long-delayed strategic partnership agreement with Mr. Karzai that is intended to signal that the United States will not cut and run, even after the 2014 withdrawal. That agreement is also short on specifics, but American officials say that Washington -- and, they hope, the NATO allies -- will provide some number of troops for years to come and billions in military and economic aid.
That may be a disappointment to Americans. But the United States will need some presence there to keep pummeling Al Qaeda and the Taliban on either side of the Pakistan-Afghan border.
That longer-term commitment also sends an important message to Afghans that Washington will not abandon them as it did after the Soviets were driven out, and that it is worth taking a chance on their government despite its deficiencies. It also tells the Taliban that they can't just wait out the West -- and need to seriously consider Mr. Obama's offer of negotiations. Pakistan has long believed that it has to hedge its bets by cutting side deals with the extremists. We don't know if this will change minds in Pakistan, but it takes away a rhetorical excuse.
Although the timing of Mr. Obama's visit on the anniversary of the Bin Laden kill was contrived, his speech, wisely, had only a tinge of triumphalism. He said Washington has ''devastated Al Qaeda's leadership,'' and insisted ''the goal that I set -- to defeat Al Qaeda, and deny it a chance to rebuild -- is now within our reach.''
Mr. Obama's political message, and motivation, for this trip was undeniable. Still, he deserves enormous credit for going after Bin Laden and for the relentless pursuit of Al Qaeda's leaders in Pakistan. He has made far more progress, with far less posturing, than his predecessor, President George W. Bush.
Mr. Obama's strongest argument for staying in Afghanistan for another two years is that it is the main base for continuing that fight and that, by 2014, the United States will be able to withdraw without seeing it turn once again into a haven for Al Qaeda. He didn't make the case Tuesday night.

HEADLINE: Obama Signs Pact in Kabul, Turning Page in Long War

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Elisabeth Bumiller contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- President Obama, speaking to an American television audience on Tuesday night from Bagram Air Base, declared that he had traveled here to herald a new era in the relationship between the United States and Afghanistan, ''a future in which war ends, and a new chapter begins.''
Mr. Obama's address, during an unannounced visit to sign a strategic partnership agreement with President Hamid Karzai that sets the terms for relations after the departure of American troops in 2014, was a chance for him to make an election-year case that he is winding down a costly and increasingly unpopular war.
''My fellow Americans,'' he said, speaking against a backdrop of armored military vehicles and an American flag, ''we've traveled through more than a decade under the dark cloud of war. Yet here, in the pre-dawn darkness of Afghanistan, we can see the light of new day on the horizon.'' 
His speech came as an already difficult relationship with Mr. Karzai has been strained by recent events, including the release of photos showing American soldiers posing with the remains of Taliban insurgents and an American staff sergeant who has been charged in the killing of 16 Afghan civilians. Mr. Obama sought to portray the withdrawal as an unalloyed achievement, though it remains far from certain that the Afghan government can hold its own against the Taliban with reduced American support, or that what were once considered critical American goals here can still be met.
Hours after Mr. Obama left Afghanistan, at least two explosions shook Kabul on Wednesday morning, near a compound used by United Nations workers and other foreigners, local reports said. According to an interior minister, at least six people, including five civilians and a security guard, were killed. The Taliban has claimed responsibility.
The president's dramatic six-hour visit, ending a year to the day after Osama bin Laden was killed in a raid in neighboring Pakistan, was laden with symbolism, historic and political. Speaking from the country where the 9/11 terrorist attacks were incubated, Mr. Obama suggested that America had come full circle.
''One year ago, from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Osama bin Laden,'' the president said. ''The goal I set -- to defeat Al Qaeda, and deny it a chance to rebuild -- is now within our reach.''
Asserting that the United States had largely achieved its military goals, Mr. Obama said that Afghans were ready to take responsibility for their own security, a transition that will start in earnest next year when American and NATO troops step back from a combat role to training and counterterrorism operations.
But Mr. Obama also spoke of an ''enduring partnership'' with Afghanistan, invoking the agreement, which pledges American help for a decade in developing the Afghan economy and public institutions, though it makes no concrete financial commitments, which Congress would have to authorize each year.
The agreement, Mr. Karzai said during a midnight signing ceremony at his presidential palace, opened ''a new chapter in the relationship between the United States and Afghanistan,'' one marked by ''mutual respect.''
Mr. Obama, who arrived after nightfall at Bagram Air Base north of Kabul under a veil of secrecy, flew by helicopter to the palace, passing low over the inky silhouette of the Hindu Kush Mountain range. Once there, he met briefly with Mr. Karzai before they emerged to sign the pact.
''With this agreement the Afghan people, and the world, should know that Afghanistan has a friend and a partner in the United States,'' Mr. Obama said as Mr. Karzai looked on, along with an audience of Afghan and American officials, including two Democratic senators, Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Carl Levin of Michigan.
As part of its effort to broker a political settlement between the Afghan government and insurgents, Mr. Obama said, ''my administration has been in direct discussion with the Taliban.'' It was his most candid acknowledgment of the often-shadowy talks between American diplomats and the Taliban.
If Mr. Obama was emphasizing American constancy at the palace, his speech to his audience back home put greater emphasis on turning the page. The United States, he said, needed to turn its energies from war to rebuilding, a resilience that was on display on the site of the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York City, where ''sunlight glistens off soaring new towers in downtown Manhattan.''
The president also answered critics, notably his likely Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, who said the administration erred by setting a deadline for withdrawing troops, since the Taliban could simply wait out the Americans.
''Our goal is not to build a country in American's image, or to eradicate every vestige of the Taliban,'' Mr. Obama said. ''These objectives would require many more years, many more dollars and many more American lives.''
The surprise trip came even as his re-election campaign set off a debate about the propriety of using Bin Laden's killing to make a political argument in the battle with Mr. Romney. But Republicans largely held their rhetorical fire in the hours after Mr. Obama's arrival in Afghanistan was made public.
In a statement issued after Mr. Obama left to return to Washington, Mr. Romney said he was ''pleased'' by the president trip. ''It would be a tragedy for Afghanistan and a strategic setback for America if the Taliban returned to power and once again created a sanctuary for terrorists,'' the statement said.
For the president, the visit showcased what his aides said was his determination to end the war responsibly, even as they conceded that the country American troops will leave behind will be a messy, violent place.
The president's view was reflected in the remarks of another senior official, who told reporters that the agreement will give the United States ''the capacity to carry out the counterterrorism operations that are necessary for Al Qaeda not to resettle.'' It will help ensure ''a regional equilibrium that serves our national security interest. And that's ultimately why we went in there in the first place.''
Mr. Obama devoted much of his visit to the troops, visiting wounded soldiers at a hospital on Bagram Air Base, where he awarded 10 Purple Heart decorations, and speaking by radio to military personnel in other parts of the country who were involved in arranging his trip.
''The reason the Afghans have a new tomorrow is because of you,'' Mr. Obama said to 3,200 cheering troops assembled before dawn on Wednesday in a cavernous hangar, against a backdrop of an American flag and several armored vehicles.
The timing of the trip, administration officials said, was dictated by the desire of both presidents to sign the agreement before a NATO summit meeting in Chicago later this month. But it also came just four days before two big campaign rallies that serve as the symbolic kickoff of Mr. Obama's re-election bid, which will emphasize his success in ending the war in Iraq and winding down the conflict in Afghanistan.
With polls showing a large majority of Americans weary with the war, the president's aides have discussed whether to accelerate current plans, which call for withdrawing 23,000 troops by September. In Chicago, the United States and NATO allies will ratify a shift in the mission in 2013 from a combat role to one focused on counterterrorism and training of Afghan security forces.
For Mr. Obama, the visit was a chance to meet again with Mr. Karzai, with whom the United States has had a sometimes difficult relationship. On a stop here in March 2010, Mr. Obama delivered pointed criticism of Mr. Karzai for the rampant graft in the Afghan government. Ten months later, he made a return trip, only to be grounded at Bagram by swirling winds, forcing him to speak to Mr. Karzai by phone.
Though Mr. Karzai appeared elated at the ceremony, he has frequently expressed frustration with the American presence, bitterly criticizing the United States on issues like night raids conducted by Special Operations troops and civilian casualties.
The United States turned over authority for those raids to Afghan forces last month, opening the door to the broader agreement. The pact signed early Wednesday, negotiated by the American ambassador to Afghanistan, Ryan C. Crocker, and Afghanistan's national security adviser, Rangin Dadfar Spanta, addresses a broad range of issues, from security to social and economic development.
But it does not contain specific dollar commitments by the United States, which has led some critics to dismiss it as less a blueprint than a symbolic gesture.
To keep a wrap on Mr. Obama's travels, the White House resorted to some legerdemain, putting out a schedule for Tuesday that said the president would take part in an Oval Office meeting with advisers in the morning, then meet there with Mr. Biden and Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta on Tuesday afternoon.
Instead, late on Monday, Mr. Obama slipped out of the White House and traveled to Joint Base Andrews. At midnight, Air Force One, its lights switched off and window shades drawn, rolled out from behind a hangar.

HEADLINE: China's Trade Imbalance Is Vanishing

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
America's economic imbalance with China has been a singular concern of policy makers for more than half a decade. Senators Charles E. Schumer and Lindsey Graham wanted to punish China for pegging the exchange rate to the dollar in 2005 -- arguing that its policy of cheapening the currency to subsidize exports was fueling a huge trade surplus that cost America jobs.
Their bill never passed. But reducing China's surpluses has remained at the top of the bilateral agenda ever since.
Something unexpected has happened to China's economy, however. Its surplus with the rest of the world has largely disappeared. 
China's imbalance with the United States is still likely to take center stage when Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner sits down to the fourth round of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue this week. But he will have a harder time making the case that America's trade deficit is somehow China's fault.
China's current-account surplus -- the broadest measure of its trade relations, which tracks how much more China exports in goods and services than it imports -- has plummeted. In 2007 it amounted to more than 10 percent of the entire Chinese economy.
By last year it had shrunk to about 2.8 percent. And the International Monetary Fund estimates it will decline to 2.3 percent of the nation's output in 2012, the smallest since 2001.
The United States' current-account deficit has shrunk, too, to 3.1 percent from 5.1 of American gross domestic product. Senator Schumer and colleagues nonetheless continue to attack China for its cheap currency. Last October the Senate passed a bill, which has yet to pass the House, to let American companies seek duties on Chinese imports to compensate for what is said to be an undervaluation.
Mitt Romney has promised that if he becomes president he will declare China guilty of currency manipulation, something which the Obama administration has declined to do and which would pave the way to slapping duties on Chinese exports.
But to hear leaders in Beijing, the problem is solved. In March, China's premier, Wen Jiabao, said the Chinese currency may ''have reached its equilibrium level.'' China's currency manipulation is undisputed. The government tightly controls the exchange rate to preserve the competitiveness of Chinese exports. The manipulation has been at the core of a strategy that led China's merchandise exports to quintuple from 2000 to 2010, increasing its share of world exports by about 0.75 of a percentage point a year, according to the I.M.F.
Still, there is reason to think that China's economic strategy may be turning a corner. While its current-account surplus with the United States, $318 billion last year, was somewhat bigger than it was in 2007, China actually ran a big deficit with the rest of the world. China's vast takeover of world markets may be running out of steam.
''The rapid growth of China's export market share during the past decade was the result of a variety of factors that have largely run their course,'' noted the I.M.F.'s World Economic Outlook, published in April. These include cheap labor, multinationals' outsourcing of production to China, a huge jump in productivity and China's 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization, which limited the ability of other countries to stop its exports.
There is scattered evidence. China's wages have been rising over the last decade -- about 10 percent a year in real terms, according to Nicholas R. Lardy of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The combination of climbing Chinese wages and transportation costs has led American companies, including General Electric and Master Lock, to reassess their global production lines and move some production back to the United States.
Though China has only slowly loosened its grip on the exchange rate, the appreciation is greater than it might appear at first sight. Nominally, China's renminbi has risen 8 percent against the dollar since June of 2010. But factoring in China's higher inflation, it has gained about 13 percent. And it has appreciated about 40 percent in real terms since 2005.
This is making a difference. The I.M.F. forecasts that China's surplus will rebound gradually to 4.25 percent of the country's output by 2017. But it noted that if the renminbi continues to gain -- either through faster appreciation or sustained higher inflation -- the surplus will be smaller.
Skepticism is warranted, of course. It is too soon to know whether these changes really mean China is turning a page in its development strategy. The I.M.F.'s central forecast is that China's share of world markets will keep growing at the same rate as in recent years.
An important reason the surplus shrank in China is that the global recession clipped consumer spending in its main export markets in the United States and Europe. China's own reaction to the global contraction -- a huge buildup of roads, rail and other public infrastructure alongside a wave of cheap lending for private investment in construction and other projects -- sucked in imports rapidly.
These factors are unwinding. What is more, the investment boom could help Chinese companies gain share in new, high-tech markets where they did not compete before. In the wind energy industry, for example, China now has about 6 percent of world exports, up from almost zero five years ago.
Still, China has not adopted many of the reforms that economists suggest are needed to lay the groundwork for a new phase of development that relies less on exports to other countries and depends more on the spending of the Chinese themselves. To do this, wages and incomes must rise.
The government must bolster the social safety net -- providing better pensions and health care to Chinese families so they do not have to save every last penny in case of a rainy day. And interest rates on bank deposits -- which the government keeps artificially low to reduce its borrowing costs and provide cheap credit to industry -- must rise too, so consumers can get a return on their savings.
Despite these uncertainties, the goal of a more balanced Chinese economy is closer than it has been in at least a decade.
Some effects of the global recession will linger. Exports of machines and equipment to the United States, accounting for 10 to 15 percent of China's export growth early in the last decade, will not recover until the American housing market does. And China's terms of trade will get worse as the price of energy and the other raw materials it imports keeps rising even as the electronic devices and other machines it exports keep getting cheaper.
China has already saturated markets in many of the low-tech goods it makes -- toys, for example. And gaining new markets in higher-tech goods against established rivals is likely to become increasingly difficult.
And weird as this may seem for a country of 1.4 billion people, China is looking at a labor shortage down the road that will start increasing wages ahead of productivity growth, eroding China's competitive edge. Its working-age population is expected to peak and start shrinking within five years, partly as a result of the one-child policy that depressed birthrates and accelerated the aging of the population.
China's backward farm economy will continue shedding workers for a few years, adding to the urban labor force. Still, Chinese factories on the coast are having a harder time drawing workers from the agricultural hinterland in the west. That is partly because rising food prices are raising farm incomes. And it is partly because living conditions are grim in Chinese cities, where workers must make do without a social safety net.
Whether China's economy stays on a more balanced keel is important for the entire world, which is struggling with weak consumer demand after a deep recession. It is also important for China -- whose reliance on exports to drive employment and growth is distorting the economy, repressing consumer demand, feeding a surge in unproductive investment and loading banks with dubious loans.
China's economy is in a peculiar spot. Its surplus has shrunk drastically, but without any of the reforms needed to transform China into more of a consumer economy that relies less on exports. In fact, household consumption has fallen consistently as a share of the economy since the early 1990s.
This path leads nowhere good. Further investment booms may continue to shrink China's trade surplus. But they come at a high cost: more resources wasted on empty buildings and unused roads.
Fortunately, China's leaders appear to understand the need to change. The 12th five-year plan begun last year is centered on the goal of raising family incomes, shifting to an economy more reliant on the production of services and building the kind of safety net that gives the Chinese people the confidence to spend some of their vast savings.
If these reforms are actually made, China could be on a more sustainable path of economic growth that would increase the well-being of regular Chinese. And American senators would have to blame somebody else for the nation's trade deficit.

HEADLINE: CBS Posts 80% Rise In Profit For Quarter

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
New revenue from syndication, online streaming services and subscription fees helped the CBS Corporation to report an 80 percent increase in profits on Tuesday, its strongest such first-quarter gains since it was spun off from Viacom six years ago.
The company's net earnings for the quarter were $363 million, or 54 cents a share, up from $202 million, or 29 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago. Wall Street analysts had predicted earnings of 44 cents a share. ''They are clocking it in every category,'' said David W. Miller, a managing director covering media and entertainment at the investment bank Caris & Company, calling the CBS earnings ''outstanding.'' 
Leslie Moonves, the CBS chief executive, said the first-quarter earnings foreshadowed a ''record 2012'' for the broadcaster, which is preparing to present its 2012-13 network television schedule to advertisers. The presentation on May 14 will kick off a period of so-called upfront advertising sales.
''We led the upfront last year, and we guarantee we will lead it again this year,'' Mr. Moonves said on a conference call with investors.
The company is benefiting from the CBS network's long-standing status as the most-watched among total viewers in the United States. CBS has fewer holes to fill on its television schedule than its competitors do, ''meaning that we'll be much more selective than our competitors will have to be,'' Mr. Moonves said Tuesday.
Heading into the upfront period, ''we're feeling a lot of strength from the ad market,'' he added.
But Mr. Moonves and other CBS executives pointed out that the company -- traditionally the most reliant on ad revenue of any of the major media companies -- is continuing to come up with more nonad revenue.
Of CBS Corporation's $3.92 billion in total revenue in the first quarter, 39 percent originated from nonadvertising sources, according to the company, up from 35 percent in the first quarter of 2011.
''Syndication, retrans and online streaming are having a huge impact on our numbers and are not directly tied to the economy,'' Mr. Moonves said, abbreviating the word retransmission, which refers to fees paid by distributors and affiliates for the rights to CBS programming. ''Many of these revenue sources did not even exist just a few short years ago,'' he noted.
A 12 percent gain in total revenue for the quarter -- from $3.51 billion in the same quarter last year -- was attributed in part to digital licensing deals. CBS already licenses some of its old shows to Netflix and Amazon's streaming services, and it is in talks with other such online video distributors.
In the conference call, Mr. Moonves seemed to let slip the name of at least one of them, Intel, which has reportedly been in negotiations with channel owners about selling a virtual cable subscription via the Internet. CBS, he said, was talking to ''the Intels of the world'' as well as existing cable operators like Comcast. New digital deals will be made ''over the next number of months,'' he said.
CBS revenue also grew thanks to traditional syndication deals, including a new one with the AMC network for ''CSI: Miami,'' and increases in subscriptions to Showtime Networks, its pay cable arm.
Its local broadcasting businesses were flat for the quarter. Joseph Ianniello, the CBS chief financial officer, said at the company's television and radio stations, local ad sales outpaced national ad sales, which is significant because local businesses can be a ''leading indicator'' of an economic rebound.
The automotive and retail sectors were the bright spots for local ad sales.
Speaking to investors on Tuesday, Mr. Moonves also singled out the company's news division, CBS News, for praise. The ''CBS Evening News,'' which has languished in third place among the network newscasts for years, is the only one of the three to be up year-over-year, he said.

HEADLINE: U.S.-China Military Talks to Open Amid Unease

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Limited military talks between China and the United States -- an arena in which the two sides view each other with mounting unease -- open here on Wednesday as a prelude to a wider-ranging economic and strategic dialogue between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and their Chinese counterparts.
China is increasingly suspicious of what it views as stepped-up spying by American planes and ships along its coast, and the United States is disquieted by China's growing array of weaponry, analysts on both sides say.
The two nations have been unable to agree on a serious agenda for military talks despite an escalation of tensions as China presses territorial claims in the East and South China Seas and the United States fortifies longstanding alliances from Australia to the Philippines. 
The meetings, known as the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, will be limited to a one-day session on Wednesday that will cover two subjects, cyberwarfare and maritime issues, Obama administration officials said.
The broader high-level talks scheduled to start on Thursday with Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Geithner are likely to be strained in public and dominated behind the scenes by the escape of the blind human rights lawyer Chen Guangcheng, apparently into American protection in Beijing. But both sides have plowed ahead with the diplomatic agenda since Mr. Chen's dramatic journey to Beijing from his house arrest in the countryside.
The Obama administration has remained virtually silent on Mr. Chen, refusing to confirm that he is in American hands and moving the choreography forward for what the Chinese consider ''all weather'' talks involving hundreds of diplomats and officials at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse complex, dotted with lakes and willow trees.
Washington's regard for the Chinese government's sensitivity may have helped the Beijing leadership remain outwardly calm about the Chen case, which comes at a time of political upheaval in the aftermath of the dismissal of Bo Xilai, a member of the Politburo.
Even before the Chen case erupted, there were few expectations of specific outcomes for the economic and strategic talks, in which every item on the agenda, from North Korea to the global economy, has been painstakingly negotiated.
Mrs. Clinton said in Washington before her departure on Monday that she would raise human rights during her visit.
Until Mr. Chen's case complicated the atmosphere, human rights were expected to play little part. Human rights talks between the nations are accorded a separate dialogue at a different time of year.
Still, the assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, Michael H. Posner, who has pressed Mr. Chen's case, is a member of Mrs. Clinton's delegation. He had been scheduled to accompany her before Mr. Chen's escape.
In the military talks, Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns and the acting under secretary of defense for policy, James N. Miller, will lead the American delegation, and Gen. Ma Xiaotian, deputy chief of the general staff of the People's Liberation Army, is the head of the Chinese delegation.
With the discussion generally limited to cyberwarfare and maritime issues, the talks will not include space weaponry or missile defense, two areas in which the Chinese are concentrating military expenditure, Obama administration officials said.
In a recent report on the American military relationship with China, Shirley A. Kan, a specialist in Asian security at the Congressional Research Service, wrote that China's ''reduced appreciation for military-to-military exchanges has accompanied its rising assertiveness.'' In an example of the rocky relationship, she noted that when Adm. Mike Mullen, the recently retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, visited China last year, he was the first chairman to do so since 2007.
Scott Harold, who is studying the military relationship between China and the United States for the RAND Corporation, echoed that view. ''There is a mutual suspicion by each side of the other's growing capabilities,'' he said.
The Chinese have acquired or are developing a variety of weapons and technologies that would enable them to put into practice the doctrine of ''anti-access, area denial,'' Mr. Harold said. The basic idea is to block American access to strategic waterways, particularly the seas off China's coast.
Among the weapons to advance the doctrine are ultraquiet submarines and advanced surface vessels equipped with antiship cruise missiles, Mr. Harold said. China is also testing ballistic missiles that can strike an aircraft carrier, he said.
In addition, China has built an advanced cyberprogram designed to disable a potential enemy's command-and-control capabilities, Mr. Harold said.
In response to the Chinese doctrine, Pentagon planners are devising a military fighting concept called the ''air-sea battle strategy'' that would ensure that the American military could deploy over great distances to defend United States allies and interests.
''I wouldn't characterize the situation as an arms race, but competitive military modernization through hardware and, more important, in doctrine,'' Mr. Harold said.
A major reason for the limited nature of the military talks between Beijing and Washington, American officials say, is the Chinese position that the United States must abide by three conditions: stopping arms sales to Taiwan, halting close-in maritime and airborne surveillance of China, and scrapping restrictions in the National Defense Authorization Act that prevent the export of American technologies deemed to have military use for China.
The export restrictions are unfair and demonstrate the United States' determination to keep China in an inferior position, said Yan Xuetong, the dean of modern international relations at Tsinghua University.
''The arms embargo is a clear indication that the United States does not want China to become a military power,'' said Mr. Yan, a prominent professor who reflects a more nationalistic belief among Chinese academics.
Military competition between the two powers is inevitable and should be recognized as such, he said.
The United States talked about more cooperation, but the Chinese military asked itself, '' 'What can I benefit from this cooperation, what payoff does the P.L.A. get?' '' Mr. Yan said, referring to the People's Liberation Army.
''We think the U.S. is hypocritical when they say, 'We want this cooperation for your benefit,' '' he added.
There should be more contact between the two sides in the mode of ''negative cooperation,'' Mr. Yan said.
''That way,'' he added, ''we can work together to prevent war between us.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 3, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about President Obama's decision to use a speech on Monday to gently prod China to improve its human rights record, but not to discuss the case of a prominent Chinese dissident lawyer said to be under American protection in Beijing, misstated the name of the high-level talks between the countries that are set to begin there today. And an article on Wednesday about limited military talks gave another incorrect rendering of the name of the broader talks. Those high-level talks are the Strategic and Economic Dialogue -- not the Strategic Economic Dialogue or the Strategic and Security Dialogue.

HEADLINE: 'Dystopian Future' Draws Problem Solvers to Mumbai

BYLINE: NARESH FERNANDES


HIGHLIGHT: The landscape of the city and its challenges become a subject of discussion at seminars and exhibitions in Mumbai. 

 BODY:
One recent weekend, a group of economists, university professors and tourism executives gathered in the conference room of a think tank near Nariman Point to ponder the question, "Is Mumbai truly global?" 
The previous evening, at the opening of an exhibition in Fort focused on urban identities and changing cityscapes, a huddle of artists and architects discussed "Opening spaces in the city: Sites, contexts and dialogues." Just up the road, at the National Gallery of Modern Art, the "Open Mumbai" exhibition uses maps and manipulated images to demonstrate how the congested metropolis could create more parks and walking paths. Weekly discussions have accompanied the event.
India's commercial capital, it seems, can't stop talking about itself. The main topic: How to prevent the future from being as dystopian as many fear it will become.
Every week brings a new lecture or a new art event examining the megacity's mega-problems: an acute shortage of affordable housing that has forced 62 per cent of its population to live in slums, the pressure-cooker conditions in local trains that carry 7.2 million people a day, the severe absence of parks that leaves every 1,000 Mumbaikars with merely 0.003 hectares of open space. (That's about 322 square feet, or 30 square meters. Compare that to 1.8 hectares for a similar number of New Yorkers.)
These problems and many others - always referred to in seminar-speak as "challenges" -make Mumbai the source of endless fascination for academics and policy analysts, from India and around the world. "Mumbai is a city that cannot be missed: a city with global aspirations and a fascinating local context and history," explained David Van Der Leer, a curator of the BMW Guggenheim Lab, "a combination of a think tank, community center and gathering place" that will be held in Mumbai over the next year, though dates have not yet been finalized.
The Lab, which has already been staged in New York City, "is looking at the most interesting cities around the world - cities that are undergoing, or, will be undergoing tremendous change over the coming years," said Mr. Van Der Leer. Mumbai simply had to be on the itinerary, he said.
These gargantuan "challenges" also attracted Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation to open an outpost of its Studio X network in Mumbai in February 2011. The studio, which hosted the recent "Opening Spaces" discussion as part of an art exhibition called "Trespassers Only," is a "working laboratory on the city," said its director, Rajeev Thakker. "We exchange ideas on culture, art, the space of education, real-estate development, music, literature, philosophy, film and of course architecture and urban design," he said.
Where some see problems, others see opportunity. Marla Stukenberg, the director of the Max Mueller Bhavan, the German government's cultural arm in India, recently helped organize a ten-day fair around the theme of "Cityspaces." German companies like BASF and Siemens opened futuristic pavilions in the heart of the city, employing touch screens and slick computer graphics to demonstrate products designed to enhance environmental efficiency and sustainability.
"Rapid urban development presents a number of challenges - both today and for the future," Ms. Stukenberg said. Challenges range from practical issues like efficient transport infrastructure, water supplies, waste-water disposal and waste management to social issues like the co-existence of rich and poor, she said. "We feel that Germany can contribute to finding solutions for the challenges mentioned above," she said.
Such overseas interest in Mumbai is powering the tornado of talk, suggests Mustansir Dalvi, who teaches at the Sir J.J. College of Architecture. Over the past few months, he has both organized and participated in several such city-focussed seminars with a foreign partner, who often was the reason the seminar was being held in the first place. "I am a bit cynical here, but Mumbai is the flavour the day because so many who stay and work in Mumbai are voluble and articulate and can give voice to our physical and existential state." He added, "Nobody is convening seminars on how great Mumbai is. It is mostly about finding virtues in its blight."
This blight is precisely why Mumbai needs to be dissected so acutely, said Leena Chandran Wadia of the Observer Research Foundation, the think tank that organized the roundtable on raising the city's global profile. She believes that the city could be a model for others around the world.
"At first glance Mumbai is so chaotic that it seems a miracle that anything functions," she said. "Yet as one spends time here one realizes that Mumbai not only functions, but it functions better than most other cities in India. Then one finds oneself constantly wondering how everything manages to hang together against all odds."
Despite all the seminars and roundtables and discussions, though, organizers are aware that it isn't easy to convert the ideas they generate into public policy, especially in a city where property developers, the politicians who make the rules for real estate development and the bureaucrats who regulate the murky process often are the same entity.
Ms. Wadia says that though her Observer Research Foundation has been able to attract the attention of some state chief ministers, recommendations never seem to get implemented. "I believe that the processes are simply not there, ones that convert a leaders' vision into action on the ground," she said.
Change isn't impossible - if it is backed by a lot of effort, insists P.K. Das, the architect who conceptualized the "Open Mumbai" exhibition on creating more public spaces in the city. Many politicians visited the exhibition and Mr. Das said he hoped they departed with fresh ideas. But most of all, he hoped that the exhibition and the discussions around it will convince Mumbaikars that it is actually possible to find solutions for many of their problems. "Pressures put on the government by the citizens and their movements will determine our success," he said.

HEADLINE: Retirement, Slipping Farther and Farther Away

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Over the last decade and a half, Americans' expected retirement age has slowly risen to 67 from 60, according to a new Gallup survey. 

 BODY:
Over the last decade and a half, Americans' expected retirement age has slowly risen to 67 from 60, according to a new Gallup survey.
If a standard retirement age of 60 sounds relatively low, remember that the economy was booming in the 1990s and Americans' savings were being inflated by the tech bubble. That's about the time when housing prices began to skyrocket, which also made homeowners feel particularly wealthy. Since then, of course, both the dot-com and housing bubbles have burst.
Americans have been putting their money where their mouths are, so to speak, and have been working longer and longer in recent decades. In 1996, for example, 45.8 percent of workers ages 60 to 64 were either working or looking for work. Last year, the figure was 54.5 percent.
Labor force participation rates have risen for other segments of older Americans, too:
While more people in their 60s and 70s want to work, the share of those older workers who have found jobs has fallen. Last year, 6.8 percent of workers 60 to 64 were unemployed. That compares with less than 3 percent in the late 1990s.
Perhaps 6.8 percent still sounds low, but consider that once unemployed, older Americans are very unlikely to find a job. The older a worker is, the more difficulty he or she has getting hired.
These trends have worrisome implications not just for older workers and their families, but for government budgets, too.
Struggling with deflated savings and few new job opportunities, older Americans are becoming increasingly dependent on Social Security and other public services.
In the same poll cited above, Gallup found that 33 percent of American nonretirees expect Social Security to be a "major source of income" for them in their old age. That's an uptick from 27 percent a decade ago.

HEADLINE: The Country and the City

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Brooks and Collins compare the social ethic of the Midwest to the mores of the East and Steak 'N Shake to White Castle. 

 BODY:
David Brooks: Gail, you are just back from Turkey investigating the international situation and the clash of civilizations. I am just back from southern Indiana where I investigated the clash of civilizations of a different sort, namely which serves better burgers: White Castle or Steak 'n Shake.
Gail Collins: This is not the opening salvo I expected. Thank you, southern Indiana. I thought we were going to have to talk about Osama bin Laden.
David: White Castle will always be a sentimental favorite - because it is what sustained me through my 20s, because they give you so many burgers, because of Harold and Kumar, and because the place so effectively arouses ironic reflections - and yet this time the Steak 'n Shake provided the superior experience.
Gail: I'm not actually a hamburger person, but I always did feel White Castle had more character.
David: We Americans get too little credit for democratizing food, for providing decent food for the masses, and by that I'm including Memphis barbecue, delis and pizza places in New York, chicken shacks in Chicago and so on. I know it's led to obesity and all that (tell me about it) but these places are part of a democratic driving force in our culture - the desire to produce decent stuff for everyone.
Gail: I always love your socioeconomic theories, but I am not totally sure the world of tomorrow will thank us for planetizing the Big Mac.
David: I'm serious. Somebody recently made the point that often the most important innovations aren't always on the high-tech cutting edge. They often involve who can do something reasonably well at a low price. It takes one sort of genius to design and run a Four Seasons hotel. It takes another to design and run a good Comfort Inn. This second kind of innovations has been one of the great democratizing forces of the age.
Gail: You're probably right. However, I prefer to think of America as a place where the average person can occasionally aspire to get a nice room in in a fancy hotel. With a view. Just once in a while.
David: All this is windup to raise a few questions about the state of our democratic culture. One of the reasons I like the Midwest is that it truly is more socially egalitarian than other parts of the country.
Gail: David, I am from southern Ohio, as you know. I am second to no one in my affection for my home turf. But I believe you overestimate the glories of the Midwestern character as compared to, say, the Eastern part of the nation. Growing up in Cincinnati, I did not feel oppressed because of my gender, religion or economic status. But I did believe that everybody from the east side of town looked down on those of us who came from the unfashionable west side of town.
David: I once conducted an interview with a businessman in a small town and I pulled up in my Audi A6, which was a very nice car but not super luxury. He saw my car and sighed, "Boy, I wish I could drive one of those." He certainly had the money to do that, but if he was seen driving anything other than a Ford or G.M. (and not a Cadillac either) people would think he was getting above himself.
Gail: My father, who was far from an elitist, would only drive a Cadillac. He believed that part of the fulfillment of the American dream was owning one. My siblings and I hated the Cadillac, which kept breaking down. But to my father owning one was an emblem of respect for the values of striving and upward mobility.
David: Harry Truman had that sort of deep social egalitarianism, but I think it is cracking or gone generally. Part of the problem is the rise of consumerism, as people seek to distinguish themselves through their distinct spending tastes. Part of it is the purification of the meritocracy - there is a hotter race to compete for status, based on what college you went to, what job you have or anything else.
Gail: This is my chance for a political pitch. My father was born into one of those chaotic, socially and economically unstable families that specialize in producing the next generation of juvenile delinquents. But through hard work and the G.I. Bill, he was able to attain a secure, middle-class life for himself and my mother, and send me and my brother and sisters to college, without having to saddle us with student loans.
If things look less stable today, it has less to do with the loss of middle-class Midwestern values than the shortage of jobs that pay middle-class Midwestern salaries.
David: If you want to understand the Tea Party sensibility, just drive from rural Indiana east to Washington, as I just did last night - through Ohio, West Virginia, central Pennsylvania and western Maryland. All the way along you see a certain kind of car - older, modest, often kind of beat up. Then you get past Frederick, Maryland, into the Washington suburbs and suddenly the auto fleet changes. The number of luxury cars explodes- Mercedes-Benzes, BMWs, Escalades.
Gail: I totally agree that we do not want the entire nation developing the value system of Washington lobbyists. But I think you're positing a general difference between the sections of the country that I don't accept. While there is certainly a flashy top layer here, average families seem pretty much the same.
David: The Washington metro area is the richest metro area in the country, and it shows. This region is largely living off the tax receipts of the rest of the country, but it is also living better than the rest of the country. It's not necessarily federal workers, but it is federal contractors, as well as all the lawyers and technicians who service and sell to the government. No wonder there is some resentment.
Gail: One of the things I have come to love about New Yorkers is that while they send more money to the federal government in taxes and get less back than almost anyplace in the country, they almost never complain about how Mississippi is getting a better deal than they are. They yell about their taxes constantly, of course. But I have very, very seldom heard them put the blame on Iowa farmers and their corn subsidies.
David: I also have to say that not enough is made of the meth problem in rural America. I'm always struck by this at public squares in small towns, or in Walmarts. You just see a lot of people whose lives (and faces) have been ravaged by drugs. They're out begging for quarters or sitting around. You just get the feeling that there is a large amount of social disintegration in the rural parts of America that drugs have fueled and exacerbated. What crack was in cities a few years ago, meth continues to be in other parts of the country today, with much less attention, perhaps because it's happening too far away from the policy elite.
Charles Murray was mostly right in "Coming Apart" when he wrote about the bifurcation of white America.
Gail: Please, let's not get into Charles Murray. I'm in the camp that says there's nothing wrong with America that a big burst of job growth for average people with high school educations wouldn't cure.
In the meantime, maybe one of the steps to healing in this country will come when the folks in the heartland and the folks on the coasts acknowledge that no section has a monopoly on family values. The first step toward solving our shared problems is accepting our shared faults.
David: Of course the other thing about the Midwest that always hits you is the incredible niceness of the people. Everyone is so energetically nice to you all the time you feel you have to be energetically nice to them back. I'm exhausted.
Gail: David, you're nice all the time. I think that must be because you were raised in the heartland of Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Occupy Wall Street: From the Streets to the Archives

BYLINE: JENNIFER SCHUESSLER


HIGHLIGHT: Archivists are collecting posters, flyers, pamphlets and other items related to the Occupy Wall Street protests. 

 BODY:
Earlier this week a Times article looked at social scientists who are trying to study Occupy Wall Street in real time. But a group of archivists are also hitting the streets, and the Internet, in an effort to preserve the movement's traces for scholars of the future.
Within weeks of the occupation of Zuccotti Park last fall archivists from the New-York Historical Society and other institutions were out scooping up posters, fliers, pamphlets, signs and other ephemera. "For us, it's an event in New York City," said Jean Ashton, the society's executive vice president and director of its library, which has so far amassed several hundred Occupy-related artifacts. "We want to make sure that people understand what happened here." 
Other archivists are collecting some of the explosion of digital materials by and about Occupy. New York University's Tamiment Library has been recording the meetings of the movement's Think Tank group and archiving the Web page of the New York group's general assembly. The Internet Archive, a nonprofit Web site, and the Occupy Archive, a project at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for the History of New Media at George Mason University, has been collecting material from Occupy sites beyond New York. 
So far OccupyArchive has some 3,200 items relating to hundreds of occupations around the country, mostly gathered by volunteers who have scoured the Web for scans of meeting minutes, posters, Flicker photos and other material. "Many local occupations were quite good about keeping minute notes, agendas and that kind of thing," Sharon Leon, the Rosenzweig's director of public programs, said. "That will eventually be a rich archive for historians doing work on social movements and post-recession reaction on the left."
But despite the profusion of material online some archivists say that the historical record of the future may have some gaping holes. While Twitter, Facebook and other social media have been crucial to the movement, the terms of use of most social media sites prevent anyone from publishing material harvested from them. "Look back at the Arab Spring," said Howard Besser, an archivist at N.Y.U. and founder of Activist Archivists, a group created last fall to coordinate the collection of digital media relating to Occupy. "We actually have precious little that scholars can use to look at how things spread."
Archiving efforts have also met some initial skepticism from the Occupy movement itself, though Mr. Besser said most people had overcome their wariness about collaborating with traditional institutions. "There are lots of people who don't get the idea of archiving, but that's true everywhere," he said. "Most people, when it's explained, are very quick to understand."
Activist Archivists has worked with Occupy Wall Street's archives working group to create a "Why Archive" postcard to distribute at future demonstrations. (The first of five bullet points: "Accountability. Archives collect evidence that can hold those in power accountable.") The group has also worked to counter fears that material gathered by archivists could end up being used in legal actions against protesters. Mr. Besser said they were looking into training activists to use ObscuraCam, a technology developed by human rights groups that automatically obscures faces in photographs and videos.
"The archivist part of us says we want to grab everything of enduring value and keep it," Mr. Besser said. "But the activist part says that we may not want to save certain things, or may not want the police to have access to certain things."
In the meantime Occupy is also storing its own archive of hundreds of signs, posters, fliers and one-of-a-kind objects recovered after the eviction from Zuccotti Park, like banners for the camp's kitchen and other facilities made out of orange plastic netting used by the police.
Anna Perricci, a member of the archives working group who is coordinating digital preservation efforts, said that it was important for Occupy to have an active part in curating its own history.
"There are a lot of other people recording the movement and telling its story," she said. "But I also want to empower occupiers to help preserve what is being made while their story is unfolding."

HEADLINE: At Milken, Feelings of Malaise

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: Judging from the mood of the attendees at the Milken conference, Wall Street is not the capitalist feeding frenzy it used to be. 

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- If a single word captured the mood of the Wall Street contingent at this year's Milken Institute Global Conference, "uncertain" would fit the bill.
"There's a lot of uncertainty in the U.S.," said Steven Drobny of Drobny Global Advisors, who was the moderator of a panel on alternative investments on Wednesday. Those words, more or less verbatim, were also relayed by members of panels on mergers and acquisitions, private equity and the global credit market.
"People are waiting and wondering what's happening," David Bonderman, the TPG Capital co-founder, said during the private equity panel. "It's an uncertain and dangerous world, and people are being cautious with their cash."
"Uncertain," of course, is one of those cloudy, shapeless words that serves as a stand-in for a general feeling of malaise in the financial world - the feeling that, for reasons as widely felt as they are difficult to pinpoint, Wall Street is not the capitalist feeding frenzy it used to be.
"The big difference between today and 2008 is that it used to be easier to make money," Marc Lasry, the founder of Avenue Capital Group, said during the alternative investments panel. "Today, you have so many more risks, and things are much more difficult."
As a networking event, of course, the Milken conference still shows all the signs of life: bankers and traders backslapping old friends, swapping business cards and taking meetings with clients at the Beverly Hilton's poolside bar.
But as an economic powerhouse, a conference where big deals once got hashed out in every corner and the atmosphere was one of bull market fist-pumping, the conference now feels more like the hopeful reunion tour of a once-great rock band.
Granted, there is much more to this gathering than finance - Michael Milken, the founder of the event, told DealBook on Tuesday that he considered education the biggest single field represented at the conference. But at its heart, the conference is a five-day paean to the primacy of the free market. And the free market, most attendees seem to feel instinctively, isn't what it used to be.
Much of the uncertainty expressed at this year's conference has revolved around the Obama administration and the bevy of new regulations that were introduced after the financial crisis to curb risk on Wall Street.
One senior private equity executive, speaking to DealBook in the Hilton's hallway on Tuesday, bemoaned the fact that a single new rule introduced as part of Dodd-Frank Act had forced him to spend $50 million a year on new auditors and compliance officers, whose sole job it was to calculate the compensation of all the employees at a given company.
"The rules have changed," he said.
But there are worries beyond Wall Street's profits. At a panel on job creation on Tuesday, talk revolved around the fact that for cities and states, traditional municipal bond financing was failing to provide the money needed for important public projects like repairing roads and building bridges. At a panel on the credit markets, panelists said that the new regulatory regime was making it harder for banks to lend, and leading to the rise of a shadow banking sector. At various points during the conference, panelists and attendees worried about the rise of China, the future of Social Security and the threat posed by Iran.
Indeed, the mood was so dark that on Wednesday morning, when it came time to hear from Nouriel Roubini, the economist known as "Dr. Doom," his proclamations about the deterioration of global economies barely registered on the fear scale.
Incidentally, in contrast to other Milken-goers, Mr. Roubini said the United States was doing "relatively well."

HEADLINE: The Declining Role of Start-Ups

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: Business leaders and politicians often laud the United States for its entrepreneurial culture, but start-up activity has been falling since the 1980s, a new report shows. 

 BODY:
Business leaders and politicians often laud the United States for its entrepreneurial culture, but the pace of start-up activity has been declining since the 1980s, a decline that - not surprisingly - accelerated during the most recent recession and its aftermath.
 A new report from the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, using data from the Census Bureau's Business Dynamics Statistics, shows that the number of start-ups in a given year declined from about 12 percent of all companies in the 1980s to less than 8 percent in 2010, the lowest point on record.
 The share of young businesses - defined as those started within the last five years - as a total of all companies also declined, to 35 percent in 2010, from 50 percent in the early 1980s.
 Such a decline can have a direct effect on the labor market, as new companies typically create jobs (although an increasing number are sole proprietorships).
 Between March 2009 and March 2010, 394,000 start-ups created 2.3 million jobs, compared to a net loss of 1.8 million jobs from all private sector employers over the same period.
 The Kauffman report did not address the underlying causes of the slowdown in the birth of new businesses, but suggested that the patterns "raise questions about whether the United States is becoming less entrepreneurial given the lower pace of start-ups and the smaller share of activity accounted for by young firms."

HEADLINE: How Robots Inspect the Oklahoma Sky

BYLINE: JUSTIN GILLIS


HIGHLIGHT: A field measurement site in Oklahoma is a crucial part of a global effort to understand how clouds could affect global warming. 

 BODY:
We were in the middle of Oklahoma, with cows lowing in the distance and nearby fields of immature winter wheat soaking up a bright February sun. Yet, incongruously, a robot army seemed to be marching across yon hill. 
Was it the first wave of an alien invasion?
As we drew closer, it became clear that we really were looking at robots, of a sort. But they weren't marching or menacing the great state of Oklahoma. They were firmly planted in place, most of them staring straight up at a cerulean sky. 
Others were pointed at the sun, and you could hear tiny clicks as they tracked its arc. If you listened closely enough, you could hear all sorts of clicks and clatters and whirs as the machinery on the hill did its work.
I had never seen anything like it - for good reason, it turns out. A Times photographer, Josh Haner, and I were visiting the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Climate Research Facility near Lamont, Okla. The name is a mouthful, I know, and doesn't quite tell you what the place does. 
It is the largest research center in the world for studying the effect of clouds on climate, and in many respects it is unique.

Most Americans don't know it exists, but the place is critical to the scientific quest to understand clouds. And as I outlined in a recent article, understanding clouds is a vital aspect of the effort to predict what will happen to the earth as humans continue to pour greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
Basic physics tells us that the planet will trap extra heat and begin to warm in response to those gases. The question then becomes, what feedbacks kick in that could either enhance the warming or offset some of it?
Changes in clouds are potentially a very large feedback. It is even possible that they could offset much of the warming, as a small group of scientific dissenters contends. The scientific majority believes enough evidence is in hand to discount that possibility, but that still leaves a wide range of potential effects from clouds. Will they be largely neutral in a warming climate? Or will they actually enhance the warming, making the climate problem worse?
This uncertainty is the biggest reason for the wide spread in estimates of the earth's future temperature. Narrowing the spread is critical if scientists are to give better advice to the world's policy makers, and that means learning a lot more about how clouds behave in various climatic conditions.
The Oklahoma center, set up two decades ago by the Department of Energy, is the flagship location for measuring clouds from the ground, but not the only one. As glorious as the skies over Oklahoma can be, they cannot necessarily stand in for the entire climate of the world. So the Department of Energy runs related research sites in Alaska, Australia and in the South Pacific, and it also runs data-gathering missions using ships and planes. Other countries have programs too, though not as ambitious as that of the United States.
On top of that, various satellites run by NASA and other agencies provide cloud measurements. A fabulous interactive graphic compiled by my colleague Jonathan Corum showing cloud cover for the world in March made use of such data from NASA.
The instruments at ARM Southern Great Plains, as the Oklahoma measurement site is called, carry names most people have never heard. Disdrometers, sunphotometers, spectroradiometers -- the list goes on. Some of the instruments point directly at clouds, measuring qualities like their height and density, but others detect an array of related properties. 
Scientists want to know not just whether it's raining on a given day, but how big the raindrops are. And at what angle are they falling? How much sunlight gets through thick cloud cover to strike the ground? How much sunlight and heat are bouncing from the ground back toward space? 
The thing that struck me most on our visit to the ARM site was the meticulous effort that goes into maintaining the instruments. John Schatz, the on-site manager, made it clear to us that ensuring the precision of the measurements was his highest priority. Early one morning, Mr. Haner and I tracked a technician named Patrick Dowell as he made his rounds dusting and adjusting the equipment on the hill with the care of a jeweler.
The big news at ARM when we were there was the recent installation, in Oklahoma and at other ARM sites around the world, of $30 million worth of new radar, paid for with funds from the 2009 economic stimulus bill. They promise to offer a crisper, three-dimensional view of the insides of clouds, another step toward helping scientists gain a better ability to foretell the earth's climate future.
Jennifer Comstock, a scientist from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory who helped show us around the Oklahoma site, explained how the measurements from ARM stream into a central data bank. Scientists around the world use the information to try to improve their computerized analyses of future climate, known as climate models.
"The more we understand about the atmosphere and how it works, and how these cloud systems form, the more information we can put into the models," she said. "That will really improve our simulations. I think we're getting there."
Late one afternoon, after many of the ARM workers had gone home, Mr. Haner and I wandered around among the instruments as a fading golden light bathed the hilltop. The gadgets clicked. They clattered. But mostly, they just stared straight up, searching the sky for answers that have not yet come.

HEADLINE: Lights Out for Research Satellites?

BYLINE: RACHEL NUWER


HIGHLIGHT: Experts warn that the nation's capability to collect data from space, vital to understanding the Earth's environment and preparing for the future, is in "precipitous decline." 

 BODY:
Earth-observing systems operated by the United States have entered a steep decline, imperiling the nation's monitoring of weather, natural disasters and climate change, a report from the National Research Council warned on Wednesday.
Long-running and new missions are frequently delayed, lost or cancelled because of budget cuts, launch failures, disorganization and changes in mission design and scope, the report said. 
In 2007, the research council, the working arm of the National Academies, issued a report highlighting research imperatives for the next decade and beyond for NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the United States Geological Survey, including the renewal of the Earth observations program. (The report issued on Wednesday was commissioned by NASA as a midterm assessment.) 
Although NASA responded favorably to the 2007 report, the committee said, the observational program's budget has fallen short and changes in the program's scope, overseen by the Office of Management and Budget and by Congress, have impeded progress. 
, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington and the chairman of the committee that produced the new report, suggested that it could serve as a sobering reality check. "It's likely our capabilities will decline fairly precipitously at just the time they're most needed," he said. "If nothing is changed, we're predicting to be down to 25 percent of our current capabilities by 2020."

Dr. Hartmann described the factors contributing to the decline in observational capacity as a "near-perfect storm" of problems. For starters, he said, there is the ongoing federal budget crisis. Most of the equipment that the nation currently maintains in space, he adds, is aging and will inevitably fail, but no replacements are in the pipeline. 
"If we want to have a continuous measurement of the Earth as a system to see if any changes are occurring, then we need to sustain these systems as our economy improves," he said.
Dr. Hartmann also cited a severe shortage of medium-size launchers, the equipment that shoots data-gathering satellites into space. Initiatives dating back to the Clinton and Bush administrations sucked up billions of dollars without producing many results, he added, referring to a proposed system that was supposed to combine the best elements of the nation's defense and civilian weather satellites but came to naught. 
The question comes down to what priority should be given to observing the Earth. For both scientists and laypeople, the arguments for embracing a high level of commitment are many. 
Surface winds are measured from space to predict and map hurricanes. Instruments for detecting movements in the Earth's crust help understand and track earthquakes. Sea-level fluctuations are monitored, severe weather warnings are issued and long-term weather forecasts are prepared with the help of satellites. 
Weather satellites also pick up emergency beacons used by those who venture into remote areas and become stranded, leading to the rescue of nearly 300 people in 2010 alone. 
Not least, space monitoring allows researchers to keep an eye on climate change and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, helping to inform scientific understanding of the processes that drive global warming and estimate how big the changes will be. 
"Almost everything you can imagine about how Earth as a system works," from natural hazards to planning involving water and air quality, "is measured or monitored from space," Dr. Hartmann said. "A lot of factors important for the commerce and quality of life are measured from space effectively and efficiently -- and those will go away."
Not all was a loss, however, the report said. NASA did follow through with several of the mission launches outlined in the 2007 survey, and the agency tried to make up for budget shortfalls by aggressively pursuing international partnerships. But that may not suffice, and NASA's Earth science budget will not sustain pressing national needs, the researchers said. 
Similarly, Dr. Hartmann and his colleagues found that NOAA's satellite Earth observation program and its next generation of polar environmental satellites - integral parts of NASA's program - are suffering from budget shortfalls and cost overruns that block progress. 
The National Research Council offers two solutions for slowing or arresting a decline: refining a cost-constrained plan for NASA and NOAA mission development, and appointing a new team of experts dedicated to attaining the 10-year goals. 
More money would help, of course, Dr. Hartmann said. But regardless of the amount of funds allocated by Congress, the agencies should develop an efficient, rational priority list to optimize their resources. 
In its conclusion, the committee recommends "a balanced set of good Earth science missions rather than just a few missions that strive for perfection in limited disciplines." Canceling future missions for the sake of a few high-profile launches, they write, is something the U.S. cannot afford to do. 
"We're pretty certain that we're in an era when humans have as much control over change on Earth and key life-sustaining processes as nature," Dr. Hartmann said. "We need the ability to observe Earth as a system, and we need an understanding of it."

HEADLINE: The Rail Bookshelf: 'How Kentucky Became Southern'

BYLINE: MARYJEAN WALL


HIGHLIGHT: An excerpt from Maryjean Wall's book, "How Kentucky Became Southern: A Tale of Outlaws, Horse Thieves, Gamblers, and Breeders." 

 BODY:
In the early 1900s, Kentucky was beginning to garner an increasing measure of power in the sport. Some seventy miles west of Lexington in Louisville, a change in ownership of Churchill Downs portended of a higher profile for this regional racecourse. An impresario named Matt Winn took over the struggling track the year that Sanders Bruce died. Winn began promoting the Kentucky Derby as something more than a regional race, an event greater than the race of the West, as New York papers called it. He said that he had watched the inaugural derby in 1875 as a thirteen-year-old seated in his father's wagon parked in the infield. Although he might not have seen the possibilities at the time, his vision for the derby was to work in synergy with the outside capitalists' expanding investment in the Bluegrass.
Increasing numbers of Americans did, in fact, begin paying attention to the Kentucky Derby, as a result of a fortunate set of circumstances surrounding the race. In 1913, a long-shot winner named Donerail broke the track record and paid an eye-catching $184.90 on a $2 bet. The resulting newspaper headlines grabbed everyone's attention. The following year, the derby received considerably more headlines when Old Rosebud shattered Donerail's recent track record, winning the race in two minutes and four and four-fifths seconds. In 1915, Regret became the first filly (and only one of three in total) to win the race. This, too, resulted in numerous attention-grabbing headlines in newspapers throughout the country. The headlines seemed bolder, larger than real life, for a New York society figure, Harry Payne Whitney, owned the filly. Regret gave the Derby sex appeal with her defeat of the males, and Whitney gave the Derby the cachet of his wealth. 
Legend tells how men at Whitney's farm rang a large bell outdoors in honor of Regret winning the race: a bell ringing that resounded with this new combination of Northeastern money and Bluegrass horses. This story implied incorrectly, however, that Regret was foaled and raised in Kentucky. Actually, she was a product of Whitney's farm in New Jersey. Whitney did not transfer his breeding operations to the Bluegrass until after her birth. By that time, he, like a growing number of turfmen, had accepted the notion that his horse farm belonged in the Bluegrass. Robert Aitcheson Alexander and the Bruce brothers would have heartily approved.
During the 1920s, Winn introduced the singing of "My Old Kentucky Home" before the running of the Derby, thus firming up imagined notions of the antebellum South with the race. But this did not occur until at least a decade after the notion of a Southern identity had taken hold of Bluegrass horse country. Horse-farm country anticipated the cultural turn that the Kentucky Derby would take and saved the Kentucky horse industry in the process.
The increasing appeal of Bluegrass land among these outside capitalists made all the difference for Kentucky's horse world. With each new infusion of outside wealth, the Bluegrass horse business expanded in ways that it had not done, on its own, during the latter part of the nineteenth century. The effect rippled throughout the entire community of Lexington and the surrounding towns. An infrastructure of ancillary businesses needed to support the horse business expanded with the growing number of farms. The horse business in central Kentucky increasingly entwined its fortunes with those of the local economy, which meant that more persons than just horse persons profited from this expansion. For example, the Kentucky farmer and breeder noted about horse auctions: "On the prices which obtain at them the prosperity of this community to some extent depends."
This evolving trend represented a startling turnaround from the previous estimation of the Bluegrass region in the eyes of these wealthy beholders. They slowly were letting go of that concern that the Bluegrass appeared too unstable for development. With this changing state of mind, they marched to the same drumbeat as did the readers of popular literature who had come to see Kentucky in more pleasing terms. Wealthy horse owners were no different than the larger society. Plantation literature had helped resituate the Bluegrass in their imaginations as an idealized Old South which that their fortunes would enable them to purchase, as though buying the lifestyle of a country squire. Meanwhile, despite the obfuscation of plantation literature, the realities of Kentucky lawlessness and violence still continued to transpire at their usual reckless pace.

HEADLINE: Progress Is Seen in Advancing a Final Volcker Rule

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Regulators are moving apace on the regulation, despite lobbyists' efforts to delay it. 

 BODY:
A major new rule that has drawn the ire of Wall Street is on track for completion sooner than some bankers had expected, dashing the hopes of financial industry lobbyists, who have pressed for a delay.
Regulators are making significant progress on a final draft of the regulation, the Volcker Rule, and some officials expected to complete it by September and possibly as early as this summer, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, cautioned that regulators have not set a firm date for completing the rule.
The Volcker Rule aims to rein in risky trading on Wall Street. Named for Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, it would ban banks from placing bets with their own money, a practice known as proprietary trading.
 On Wednesday, the chief executives of six large banks voiced concerns about new regulations like the Volcker Rule at a meeting with Daniel K. Tarullo, a Federal Reserve governor. The gathering, held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in Lower Manhattan, was arranged by Mr. Tarullo and JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, who has criticized elements of the Volcker Rule.
When regulators first proposed a version of the rule last year, they received a torrent of criticism from the financial industry, which complained about the length and complexity of the proposal. It was the most hostile response to any provision of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law, which created the Volcker Rule with the notion that banks should not make risky wagers while enjoying government deposit insurance and other types of backing.
Some opponents of the Volcker Rule urged regulators to tear up the draft and start from scratch. That tactic, which even gained support among some high-level regulators, was seen by some as a ploy to delay the rule-writing process until after the 2012 election, which might end the Democratic control of the Senate and the White House.
"Reproposal is necessary for several reasons," the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, an influential Wall Street lobbying group, said last month in a letter to regulators. "First, the changes to the proposal needed to correctly implement the Volcker Rule mandate and to avoid serious harm to our financial markets are so extensive that reproposal will be required as a matter of administrative law."
But regulators driving the rule-writing process have not discussed scrapping the draft and currently have no plans to repropose a new version, the people briefed on the matter said. In fact, regulators are moving forward on the wording of critical provisions, like exemptions that allow banks to hold a certain amount of securities for customers.
Much of the headway has been made at weekly meetings about the Volcker Rule at the Treasury Department, the people said. Coordinated by Mary J. Miller, the Treasury under secretary for domestic finance, the meetings have included senior lawyers from the agencies writing the rule: the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
While top regulatory lawyers like Robert Cook, head of the S.E.C.'s trading and markets division, attend the meetings, their deputies are holding conference calls and sifting through thousands of comment letters about the rule.
The progress might come as a surprise to the rule's opponents. Wall Street grew optimistic earlier this year when Mr. Tarullo told Congress there was a "real possibility" regulators would not meet the July deadline set forth in Dodd-Frank for completing the rule.
Even as banks began gearing up for the new regulations, selling or spinning off their stand-alone proprietary trading desks, they pressed for more time. Their hopes for delay were further bolstered last month when regulators clarified that banks have until 2014 to fully comply with the rule.
As Wall Street sees it, the Volcker Rule threatens the health of the financial industry and the broader economy. The banks' concerns center on the imprecise nature of proprietary trading, which can be blurred with the role of market-making - taking positions in stocks and bonds in order to sell them to clients.
Those fears were echoed by foreign governments, as well as by corporations big and small.
At Wednesday's meeting in New York with Mr. Tarullo, the bank chieftains underscored the danger to markets if market-making were to be constrained, according to a summary of the meeting. The meeting with Mr. Tarullo included Mr. Dimon; Lloyd C. Blankfein, the Goldman Sachs chief executive; and James P. Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, among others.
The executives on Wednesday highlighted statements in their earlier Volcker Rule comment letters, where they warned that if regulators adopted a broad interpretation of the crackdown, it could hurt market liquidity.
Mr. Tarullo declined to "respond or reply to views expressed by the bank representatives," the summary said.
The early draft of the Volcker Rule sought to distinguish between positions for proprietary trading and genuine market-making, which is exempt under Dodd-Frank. Supporters have urged regulators to adopt a strict final version of the rule, arguing that a bank could trade speculatively for its own account under the guise of market-making.
Regulators have not reached final agreement on a definition of market-making, though some said that the talks were advancing. The agencies have agreed not to apply a uniform definition of market-making to all varieties of securities.

HEADLINE: You Put the Spell on Me

BYLINE: DEB AMLEN


HIGHLIGHT: Sit a spell and solve with Neville Fogarty. 

 BODY:
THURSDAY'S PUZZLE - This is one of those days that I have been looking forward to for quite a long time. Today I get to introduce you to a very talented young man who is making his debut today, but whom I've had the pleasure of getting to know over the past couple of years.
Neville Fogarty and I first met electronically via either e-mail or social media, and we met in real life at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, which brings together puzzle lovers from all over. He's a very intelligent and charming young man who will introduce himself a bit later, but first, here's the rundown on his puzzle.
If you're confused, I'm not surprised. Yes, there MISPELLED (or rather MISSPELLED) words in this grid. No, it was not an accident. Mr. Fogarty was merely trying to drive you all crazy, so please send all angry e-mails to him care of the University of Kentucky, where he currently resides. If you're going to deliberately mislead people, Mr. Fogarty, the least you can do is answer the tsunami of e-mails I face every time some constructor gets cute with the theme.
Anyway, hands up if you filled in GENEOLOGY as an answer for the very clever clue "Study of trees?" and then stopped in your tracks, stared at the word, and said to yourself "Huh. That doesn't look right." But then you thought, just briefly, that maybe this was one of the ways your brain tricks you, right? Sometimes you look at a word long enough, and it appears to be spelled incorrectly, right?
Wrong. At least today. Their are five other wurds that are misspelled in this grid, and yu wood half known that if ewe had paid atention to the payoff (you caught the misspellings in this sentence, right?) We've seen this sort of thing before (Across Lite, Solution), but it has been a long time, and in my opinion, it's still a twisty way to confuse people on a Thursday. After overcoming my own confusion, I enjoyed it.
In nontheme news, I also enjoyed eating Green Eggs and Ham with SAMIAM, and briefly had NRA instead of NBA for "Shooters' grp.?", which was another very clever trick. 
So I hope we see more from Mr. Fogarty. This was a nice debut, and I look forward to watching his growth as a constructor.
During the meanwhile, let's find out more about him:
Constructor's Notes
I started solving crossword puzzles with my mom during the summer of 2007 in an effort to get on the game show Merv Griffin's "Crosswords." I did make it on - and I won! After solving puzzles for a few weeks like it was my day job, I was hooked. I continued to solve puzzles when I went back to school to start my sophomore year at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va., where I was majoring in mathematics and economics. After months of toying around with constructing puzzles, I submitted my first puzzle to The New York Times the following summer. I received my first rejection e-mail a couple of months later - and it certainly wasn't to be the last.
While continuing to submit puzzles to The Times and other publications (you might have seen my puzzles in The Los Angeles Times or The Chronicle of Higher Education), I began writing a crossword for our weekly school paper, the "Ring-tum Phi." When the "Phi" came out Monday evenings, I'd sit with a regular group of friends, watching (and occasionally helping) them solve the crossword. I was inspired by those evenings at our big round table, where I saw some pretty egregious misspellings go into the grid. I'd get complaints like, "Neville, these words don't cross right," only to look over and see a creative spelling there. Naturally, I had to turn this concept into its own puzzle.
I wrote this puzzle in the fall of 2009 - the beginning of my senior year. I got my acceptance e-mail in April 2010, while I was on a tour of South Korea with our university Chambers Singers. We were singing that evening at an all-women's university in Seoul, and I let out a rather excited yell from a bank of public computers when I read the good news - it drew a lot of attention from the students there! Since then, I've had another puzzle (a collaboration) accepted to The Times - you haven't heard the last from me.
Today, I live in Lexington, Ky., and I'm finishing up my first year in the University of Kentucky's Mathematics Ph.D program. While you've been solving this puzzle, I've been taking my last final exam of the term. Hopefully, neither of us was too stymied today! In the rare moment when I'm not studying, teaching or puzzling, I enjoy reading and playing racquetball and board games with the other graduate students.
I'd like to add a brief word of thanks to all of my friends in the puzzle community who've lent their support to me over the years by answering my wild questions and serving as inspiration by constructing wonderful puzzles. Thanks also to all of my friends and family who've helped me learn what the average crossword solver finds fun - especially my mom, "C" Fogarty, who is my tireless test-solver.
Welcome to the club, Mr. Fogarty. Good to have you here.

HEADLINE: Stone Links: A Physicist's Flap

BYLINE: MARK DE SILVA


HIGHLIGHT: In this week's links: Lawrence Krauss clarifies; a mind-brain debate; seminars sprout in Brooklyn, and more. 

 BODY:
In a recent interview with the Atlantic about his book "A Universe From Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing," Lawrence Krauss, a theoretical physicist at the University of Arizona, was notably dismissive of philosophy's intellectual value. After hearing from his friend, the distinguished philosopher Daniel Dennett, he's decided to clarify his comments. Though he acknowledges that philosophers can improve our understanding of ethics and the various sciences of the mind (neuroscience, cognitive and evolutionary psychology, etc.), he thinks no similar gains are on the cards when it comes to physics. In particular, he thinks the reflections of physicists themselves on their methods and results have been much more productive and insightful than those of philosophers. (See Rationally Speaking for a pro-philosophy reply.)
Where Are Their Minds? David Eagleman and Raymond Tallis debate the precise relevance of the brain to the mind - that is, of neural processes to psychological processes - in a dialogue in The Guardian. Eagleman defends the view that conscious processes represent just a fraction of the mind, that most of its properties are discoverable only by the experimental observation of neural activity. Tallis disagrees. He thinks the mind proper, rather than those things its existence depends on (most notably, the brain), are either potentially introspectible or discoverable through the study of social practices - that is, intersubjectivity.

Classes and Cocktails: Alternative education has a new Brooklyn home: Building on Bond, a restaurant and cafe in the Boerum Hill neighborhood, where the recently founded Brooklyn Institute for Social Research holds its classes. The school, written up in an article at Capital New York, was conceived in 2011 by a Columbia doctoral candidate, Ajay Chaudhary. Unlike other alternative learning groups in New York, it has a quasi-university feel to it, with rigorous, graduate-seminar style study emphasized (though classes conducted over drinks). The six-week courses fall broadly within the humanities. Some are quite traditional (a study of Walter Benjamin's "Arcades Project" - but with reference to "Mad Men"); some are not ("Telegraphs, Pneumatic Tubes and Teleportation; Or, the Way We Communicate Now," a course intended for "people who love or fear (or both) their iPad/Kindle/Twitter/Facebook/etc").

HEADLINE: UBS Earnings Sink, Following a Trend in Europe

BYLINE: JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: The bank, hit by a trading scandal last year, said it was pleased with its progress amid the financial crisis in Europe. 

 BODY:
8:41 p.m. | Updated 
UBS said on Wednesday that its profit slumped 54 percent in the first three months of the year after investment banking income dropped and the bank took an accounting charge on the value of its own debt.
The bank might also face a shareholder revolt over executive pay at its annual meeting in Zurich on Thursday. Some investors have raised concerns about the levels of compensation after a year in which the bank was hit by a trading scandal and its shares plummeted.
Net profit at UBS fell to 827 million Swiss francs ($911 million) in the first quarter from 1.8 billion francs in the period a year earlier. Operating income fell 22 percent, to 6.5 billion francs.
"Given challenging market conditions, I am proud of what our employees have achieved," Sergio P. Ermotti, the chief executive, said in a statement.
UBS is the latest European bank to report a drop in first-quarter earnings. Like its rival Credit Suisse, UBS is seeking to cut jobs and focus on the more lucrative parts of its investment banking operation, while adhering to stricter capital requirements.
The sovereign debt crisis in Europe, broader concerns about the stability of the banking system and government budget deficit issues in the United States are likely to continue to weigh on client activity in the second quarter, UBS said. But the bank also said it expected the wealth management unit to continue to attract net inflows of new money.
Jon Peace, a banking analyst at Nomura, said it "was not a bad result given a tough quarter" and "after the results from Credit Suisse last week, investors were prepared for a worse margin performance in the private bank." UBS shares rose 3.7 percent in Zurich on Wednesday.
Some shareholders remained less impressed with how much UBS was paying senior executives and its bankers. Like Barclays, Credit Suisse and Citigroup, UBS is facing some opposition from shareholders for its pay practices.
George Dallas, director of corporate governance at F&C Investments, gave UBS credit for cutting its 2011 bonus pool for the investment banking unit by 60 percent from a year earlier, but he said that "may not have been enough."
"It was a year in which profit diminished, it had a major fraud scandal and the market capitalization dropped," Mr. Dallas said. "Those facts should be taken more into account."
UBS uncovered a $2.3 billion loss from unauthorized transactions at its London equity unit in September, and a trader, Kweku M. Adoboli, was charged with fraud and false accounting. He is in custody awaiting trial this year. The trading loss led to the resignation of Oswald J. Grbel as chief executive.
UBS shareholders are to vote on the company's compensation report on Thursday. The vote is nonbinding, but a rejection of the report would still put pressure on the bank to reconsider its compensation policy.
Thomas C. Naratil, the chief financial officer, said in a conference call that he was "pleased with our progress" and that the bank was "on track" with its program to reduce costs by 2 billion francs.
The earnings included an accounting charge of 1.2 billion francs on the value of the bank's own debt and costs of 126 million francs related to the restructuring effort.
Excluding the credit charge, the investment banking operation had a pretax profit of 730 million francs in the quarter, down from 965 million francs in the period a year earlier. Total income at the unit fell as an increase in revenue from capital markets services and products, including equities, was unable to offset a drop in income from the debt, commodities and currencies business and a decrease in fees from advising on mergers and acquisitions.
Net new money in the wealth management business was 10.9 billion francs in the first quarter, mainly because of an increase from clients in the Asia-Pacific region and emerging markets. That was more than in the previous three months but less than in the first quarter of 2011. The bank also attracted more client money in its wealth management business in the United States.

HEADLINE: Romney Confronts Power of the Presidency

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The past few days have provided Mitt Romney a stark reminder of all the advantages an incumbent president has in setting the terms of debate. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney is witnessing the power of the presidency.
For months, the former Massachusetts governor has been the Goliath in a field of Davids - better organized, far richer and more experienced than those who challenged him. In the end, he was able to use his superior resources to dominate, and eventually vanquish, his Republican rivals.
But the last few days, as his focus has shifted to President Obama, have provided a stark reminder that the political scales have shifted. Mr. Romney's Boston-based operation faces an incumbent president whose fearsome campaign machinery of 2008 is now bolstered by the incalculable advantages of the office Mr. Obama holds. 
On Friday, the president's Chicago campaign team sent a message that little is off limits, using a searing video to raise doubts about Mr. Romney's toughness in a national security crisis. They followed that up on Tuesday with a hard-hitting, kitchen-sink television commercial accusing Mr. Romney of sending jobs overseas and of sheltering his personal wealth in Swiss bank accounts.
And then, in a seamless transition, Mr. Obama was in Afghanistanon Tuesday afternoon, vividly reminding Americans of the weighty responsibilities that he shoulders as the nation's commander in chief and - by way of the one-year anniversary - of his decision to approve the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.
His short speech to the nation - carried live by the TV networks after a top-secret trip to Kabul on Air Force One - offered the kind of platform that no challenger can hope to have.
"It's time to renew America -- an America where our children live free from fear and have the skills to claim their dreams," Mr. Obama said. "A united America of grit and resilience, where sunlight glistens off soaring new towers in downtown Manhattan, and we build our future as one people, as one nation."
When they shift back into campaign mode on Saturday, Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, will bring to a close the first week of the general election campaign with a pair of huge campaign rallies in Ohio and Virginia that are intended to rekindle memories of his 2008 campaign.
"These kinds of events are one of the hallmarks of this organization" Jim Messina, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, said in an e-mail to the president's supporters. "We're now entering the general election of his final campaign -- this day should be something pretty special."
Mr. Romney is not without resources. He is building a campaign filled with veteran political operatives who will have hundreds of millions of dollars at their disposal. The Republican candidate will be able to tap into a broad, national network of support from activists, wealthy donors, advocacy groups and local party officials hungry to retake the White House.
And the president will have to make a case for reelection to an American public that has grown weary of a slow-moving economic recovery that has failed to quickly erase the pain of millions of job losses from the worst recession in decades.
There are also risks for Mr. Obama as he seeks to balance his roles as candidate and president. Images like those from Afghanistan on Tuesday are a clear reminder that it is Mr. Obama - not anyone else - who has been in charge during the past several years.
For Americans who are struggling economically, that could serve to reinforce the notion that Mr. Obama should shoulder the blame for their plight. And declarations of success overseas can serve to highlight the financial failure that many still see at home.
Still, the last several days have demonstrated how presidential actions and decisions inevitably become part of the political narrative as Mr. Obama makes his case for a second term.
In the video released on Friday, Mr. Obama's campaign advisers went further than just highlighting the raid on Osama bin Laden. The video raised the question of whether Mr. Romney would have made the decision to send the Navy SEAL team into Pakistan had he been in the Oval Office. "Which path would Mitt Romney have taken?" the video asked.
Mr. Romney's allies reacted furiously, insisting that Mr. Romney would have done the same as the president and chastising Mr. Obama for what they deemed an unfair political attack. One of the fiercest criticisms came from Senator John McCain of Arizona, who accused his onetime rival of trying to score political points on an issue that should be bipartisan.
"This is the same president who said, after Bin Laden was dead, that we shouldn't 'spike the ball' after the touchdown," Mr. McCain said in a statement Friday. "And now Barack Obama is not only trying to score political points by invoking Osama bin Laden, he is doing a shameless end zone dance to help himself get re-elected."
By contrast, the surprise trip to Afghanistan - which, indeed, caught Mr. Romney and the rest of the nation off-guard - generated fewer declarations of outrage by Republicans, at least while Mr. Obama remained overseas.
Aides to Mr. Obama insisted on Tuesday that his trip to Afghanistan was not timed for political purposes, and Republicans largely accepted that. Mr. McCain did not attack him for going there.
Asked whether Mr. Obama was politicizing the war effort by going to Afghanistan, Mr. McCain told CNN: "I can't accuse the president of that. It's important that we send a message to friends and enemies alike that the United States has a long-term commitment to Afghanistan."
In a statement issued late Tuesday, Mr. Romney said that he was "pleased that President Obama has returned to Afghanistan. Our troops and the American people deserve to hear from our president about what is at stake in this war."
The weaving of campaign and official business is the hallmark of presidential reelection campaigns, perfected by previous administrations of both parties. And Mr. Obama's team will be no different in making use of the trappings of his office. 
How he handles that balance - and how Mr. Romney responds - will go a long way toward determining who wins in the fall.

HIGHLIGHT: Highlights from the DealBook newsletter. 

 BODY:
Once an Ambitious Law Firm, Reduced to Grim Dispatches | On Monday, about 50 former Dewey partners opened their in-boxes to find a poignant note. A fellow former partner said he was starting an assistance fund for Dewey staff members and junior lawyers who might find themselves unemployed. The same day, Dewey's remaining partners received a grim dispatch from the firm's leadership. Given Dewey's state, management encouraged them to look for new jobs.
These are dark days for Dewey & LeBoeuf, a New York law firm on the brink of collapse amid a partner exodus. Forged by a 2007 merger, it had set its sights on quickly becoming a global powerhouse in corporate law, employing more than 1,300 lawyers in 26 offices across the globe at its peak. Now the firm is teetering under the weight of too much debt and outsize pay guarantees made to its star lawyers.
Lawyers and staff members, unable to focus on client matters, milled about Dewey's office "shellshocked" on Tuesday, according to an employee. At one point, there was confusion over whether the firm's health care provider had suspended medical coverage, leading the firm to send an officewide e-mail blaming an "administrative issue" for the apparent suspension and explaining that coverage would soon be fully restored.
"Law firms aren't very joyful places even when things are going well," said the Dewey employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "How would I describe the atmosphere now? The first word that comes to mind is funereal." DealBook

Obama's Rocky Relationship With Wall Street | President Obama has had trouble attracting the level of support from Wall Street donors that he enjoyed in his first presidential campaign, Nicholas Confessore writes in The New York Times Magazine. "Some bankers believed that the administration's strategy was to talk tough in public and play damage control in private, and they were sick of playing along," Mr. Confessore writes.
A fund-raising dinner on March 1, for instance, where tickets topped out at $35,800, did not have as strong a Wall Street presence as the president's people had hoped. For reference, the 6th Floor blog has compiled a nearly comprehensive list of the dinner's attendees. NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE | NEW YORK TIMES 6TH FLOOR

HEADLINE: Steve Coll Talks About the Power of Exxon Mobil

BYLINE: JOHN WILLIAMS


HIGHLIGHT: The author of "Private Empire" answers questions about the global operations and influence of Exxon Mobil. 

 BODY:
In his new book, "Private Empire," Steve Coll offers an expansive portrait of Exxon Mobil: its leaders, operations, global entanglements, environmental impact and relationship to the United States government. In a recent interview via e-mail, Mr. Coll discussed the company's access to various presidents, the future of energy consumption and more. Below are excerpts from the conversation.
Q.
Dwight Garner called the book, "perhaps surprisingly," "impartial." Did you feel sympathetic toward Exxon Mobil as you researched?
A.
I try to think of my goal as a reporter more as empathy than sympathy. I want to understand and describe how the world looks to any of my subjects, why they act as they do. The aggregation of empathy is, I suppose, a form of impartiality.
Q.
Was the company's access to the government under George W. Bush and Dick Cheney drastically different from other administrations?
A.
The executives and lobbyists I interviewed said they had as much access to the Clinton administration as they did to the Bush administration. They found the Obama administration tougher going overall, especially early on. 
Q.
If anything, it seems after reading the book that Exxon is in the driver's seat with the government, and that it would be misleading to think of any given administration being more "friendly" to the company. Is that an accurate impression?
A.
I'd say Exxon Mobil and the U.S. are kind of parallel governments - sometimes in alliance, sometimes in opposition, and often just trying to keep their distance from one another. That is true across presidencies.
Q.
This is a huge subject, and a big book. How did you choose a structure for it, and how did that guide your research?
A.
Initially I conceived of a more general narrative of oil and American power in recent years, something of an updated version of Daniel Yergin's "The Prize," but one set in an era of limits and opposition for Big Oil. After six or more months of research, I decided to choose a single company to tell the larger story. Exxon Mobil seemed the only logical choice for American readers. Its size, power and footprint around the world also appealed. I then started to work on a structure that would move forward chronologically from the late 1990s, but also cut back and forth among settings. I had in mind those international thrillers - the movies where a plane is landing and a subtitle comes up, "Tehran" or "Abuja," and then the next scene is at the White House. The last piece of the structure fell into place when the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill took place in 2010. That event made me think I should bookend the narrative with twin oil spills - opening with the Exxon Valdez wreck, in 1989, and closing, more or less, with the Deepwater Horizon.
Q.
Lee Raymond, the former C.E.O., claimed that Exxon Mobil didn't want the government's help; it just wanted government to stay out of the way. You say he was "kidding himself" when he said that. What's the most striking way in which the company benefits from the government?
A.
It calls in help from the White House when it needs it; it stands apart at other times. The Bush administration's attempt to open up Russia's oil industry, and the way Exxon Mobil slipped into that very high-level diplomatic project, was one example. On another occasion, Cheney intervened to help Exxon Mobil win a major oil deal over Royal Dutch Shell in the United Arab Emirates. That is what Exxon Mobil wants from the American government - decisive help in a pinch, but only when the corporation requests it, and on its terms.
Q.
You write that Exxon is "both part of the problem and part of the solution" in some of the countries where it operates. What do you mean by that, and how do you think it could move that balance more toward solution?
A.
Because of changes in the global oil economy since the 1970s, Exxon Mobil has been driven into weak and unstable states - in West Africa, for example. Its power in these states is especially outsize because of the checks it writes to poor, corrupt, dictatorial governments, and also because of the prize that its oil and gas fields offers to contending guerrillas and coup-makers. So, not so much because it has "Exxon Mobil" written on the door, but because of this geopolitical structure, the corporation is often a more destabilizing or retarding force in poor countries than its executives are willing to acknowledge. The question is, what are Exxon Mobil's responsibilities, then, as a corporation? Sure, its operations lift up a relatively small number of people through employment and education. But what more is it reasonable to expect it to do as a corporate citizen? It's gotten somewhat better in corporate responsibility, and its record on environmental standards is relatively strong, but overall it remains behind the curve - its decisions and policies in Africa, for example, are more shaped by engineers, finance men and lawyers than by creative thinkers or business visionaries.
Q.
The company came out in support of a carbon tax, partly because it didn't want cap-and-trade restrictions. How much is the carbon tax support - and the company's environmental gestures more generally - just a public relations move?
A.
You'll hear different opinions about that. Their record in the main is that they mean what they say. They took what I would judge to be a radical stance of campaigning against mainstream climate science during the late 1990s and the first Bush term. Then they shifted - after doing a good deal of damage, in my judgment. Their support for a carbon tax is now on record, and I'd be surprised if they reversed it.
Q.
Even Exxon Mobil acknowledges that oil is a finite resource. But the book makes clear that global demand is only going to escalate, and that alternative energies as we currently know them are not going to meet that demand. So is it just completely impossible to imagine what the world of energy consumption will look like, say, 200 years from now? 
A.
Two hundred years is a long time, even in the slow-changing world energy system. I don't think we'll be burning fossil fuels with abandon in 200 years - assuming we don't set ourselves way backward economically by having a nuclear war or some such cataclysm. An era of renewable, sustainable energy systems is surely coming. You can argue over whether the turning point will be within 30 to 50 years or more like a hundred years. But something is going to have to give before 2200. It would be fun to come back and see what that something is.

HEADLINE: Carlyle Prices I.P.O. at $22, Below Expected Level

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The price was down from the range of $23 to $25 that Carlyle had previously disclosed, indicating some potential weakness in investor appetite. 

 BODY:
For years, the Carlyle Group had sought to follow its private equity rivals in stepping out as a publicly traded firm, a status that once promised wealth and prestige.
On Thursday, the investment firm is getting its wish - but is doing so with a slight limp.
Carlyle priced its initial public offering at $22 a stock unit on Wednesday evening - below its expected range of $23 to $25. That price will value the firm at about $6.7 billion when it begins trading Thursday on the Nasdaq stock market, under the ticker symbol "CG."
Years in the making, Carlyle's offering is still coming in at a relatively choppy time for alternative-investment firms. Volatile markets and an uncertain economic environment have crimped their ability to conduct the core business of striking deals.
The Blackstone Group, one of Carlyle's biggest rivals, reported a 24 percent drop in first-quarter earnings last month after its portfolio companies posted slower-than-expected growth. And while Kohlberg Kravis Roberts benefited from faster growth in its holdings, it suffered a steep drop in fees.
Just last month, the Oaktree Capital Group priced its I.P.O. at $43, the bottom of the investment firm's expected range. Oaktree's stock tumbled in its first day of trading, and has stayed down, closing on Wednesday at $40.05.
The public markets in general have been relatively difficult for private equity firms, despite an overall improvement in the I.P.O. market. An index of initial offering performance maintained by the research firm Renaissance Capital has returned 16.4 percent so far this year, compared with 11.8 percent by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Yet Blackstone's stock has fallen 5.4 percent this year. Apollo Global Management and K.K.R. have fared a little better, rising 1.9 percent and 5.8 percent.
"Private equity firms are a little more challenging for the I.P.O. investor," said Kathy Smith, a principal at the research firm Renaissance Capital. "These are not only more cyclical companies, but also harder to understand."
Portfolio companies that Carlyle has taken public have tended to fare better. About 36 percent of the 11 I.P.O.'s that the firm has held for its holdings since 2010 have priced above their expected ranges, according to data from Dealogic. That compares with just 25 percent of the 177 initial offerings in the United States during that time.
And on average, they have tended to remain above their I.P.O. price until at least one year after their stock sales.
People close to Carlyle argue that its executives remain upbeat about their own stock's prospects. The firm closed its order book on Tuesday amid significant demand at a lowered $22 to $23 range, allowing the firm and its advisers to better shape its initial investor base.
Carlyle's top management acceded to the lower price, believing that, as with the firm's portfolio companies, investors will pile in and drive the stock higher.
Wednesday's pricing followed weeks sprinting around the world by senior Carlyle executives pitching the offering to potential investors. At one point, the firm's co-founders - David M. Rubenstein, William E. Conway and Daniel A. D'Aniello - broke off into separate teams to cover more than 200 meetings on four continents, according to people briefed on the matter.
The message to investors was simple: Carlyle is one of the world's biggest alternative investment firms, with nearly $147 billion in assets under management and 89 leveraged buyout, real estate and hedge fund vehicles.
"By many measures, we are one of the largest and most diversified asset managers in the world," Mr. D'Aniello, Carlyle's chairman, said in a video presentation last month. "We've been a first mover, with teams on the ground in almost all the major emerging markets today."
Mr. Rubenstein was among the most active promoters. He began his portion of the road show in Asia, before traveling to the Middle East and then back to the United States.
Carlyle's offering was managed by a small army of underwriters, led by JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Credit Suisse.

HEADLINE: Things That Really Matter

BYLINE: CHARLES M. BLOW


HIGHLIGHT: Let's start with the Supreme Court. 

 BODY:
Another week of presidential politics, another outbreak of faux outrage and media manipulation.
President Obama's campaign released an ad trumpeting Obama's decision to conduct the military raid that ended in the killing of Osama bin Laden. Republicans - and some liberals with too much time and too-short memories - hit the roof. How dare he? How tacky. Below the office and out of bounds.
Oh please. Are they really that desperate? Do they really have election amnesia?
Television time and newsprint inches first created and then chronicled the incessant bickering about it, while another week passed with voters distracted from the issues that matter most.
This is what passes for news now: suckling the masses to sleep on the teat of triviality.
Issues are dry. Outrage is juicy. Screen viewers and page views. Bread and circuses. Whip the horses until the chariot runs off the cliff of the inconsequential and plummets into a valley of cash and ratings - the higher calling of the fourth estate be damned. It's all just a game. Hyperventilation is a high-paying job.
Well, I'm tired of it. I won't play along. It's not a game, particularly if you are one of the millions of Americans stretching your body and mind to their limits to make the ends meet. It's not a game if you don't make money from outrage, but are outraged by how little money you have. It's not a game if you fear, rightfully, that your "unalienable rights" to "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" are being treated as an alien concept - threatened or denied altogether.
So before I start hyperventilating myself, I'm going to throw up my hands and throw down a gauntlet. I'm going to give you meat. You can get your cake elsewhere.
Let's talk about the importance of the president in determining the composition of the Supreme Court and the critical role the court is playing in our lives.
Nominating Supreme Court justices is one of the most profound and enduring legacies of any presidency, and yet the subject gets so little airtime that Americans display a staggering degree of misunderstanding of the court and dissatisfaction with it.
According to a Pew Research Center poll released Monday, the favorability rating of the Supreme Court has reached a new low. Interesting. But that may be in part because the percentage of respondents with "no opinion" has reached a new high: it has more than doubled since 1985, moving from 8 percent to 19 percent.
In a November Pew Center News IQ survey, just under half of all respondents (47 percent) correctly identified Chief Justice John G. Roberts as a conservative. And that lack of understanding wasn't isolated to the less educated. Only 60 percent of those with a college degree got it right.
Maybe that helps explain why an October Gallup poll found that the percentage of people who thought that the court was too liberal was higher than those who thought that it was too conservative by nearly half (31 percent to 21 percent). Yes, you read that right: the Roberts court, which gave us Citizens United, was .
For the record, as The Times's Adam Liptak pointed out in 2010 after the completion of the Roberts court's fifth term:
In those five years, the court not only moved to the right but also became the most conservative one in living memory, based on an analysis of four sets of political science data.
There was even a nifty, if frightening, chart with the article that illustrated this rightward turn.
An Associated Press/National Constitution Center poll in August found that more than a quarter of Americans think that the decisions of the Supreme Court don't really affect their lives.
How can this be? Where did we go wrong? Part of the problem is the deplorable state of civic education in this country.
A January report by the Campaign for the Civic Mission of Schools was utterly distressing on this front.
According to the report:
A majority of America's schools either neglect civic learning or teach it in a minimal or superficial way (too often as an elective). The consequences of this neglect are staggering, but unsurprising. On a recent national assessment in civics, two-thirds of all American students scored below proficient.
As for knowledge of the court in particular, the report found that "almost a third mistakenly believed that a U.S. Supreme Court ruling could be appealed" and that:
when the Supreme Court divides 5-4, roughly one in four (23 percent) believed the decision was referred to Congress for resolution; 16 percent thought it needed to be sent back to the lower courts.
Not all the blame rests there, though. We in the media share it. Sex scandals are always big news. Oral arguments rarely are. The prurient trumps the truly important.
Now we have a Democratic president and a Republican candidate who have dramatically different visions of the court, one of whom is likely to nominate a replacement for one or more of the current justices.
As the Times pointed out in October, "Justice Scalia is now 75, as is Anthony Kennedy" and "Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 78. Since 80 is the average retirement age of justices over the past generation, whoever is elected president could shape the court for the next generation."
In his first term, Obama has appointed Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, two relatively liberal justices. Not only has Mitt Romney chosen Robert Bork, a rejected Supreme Court nominee, as one of the chairmen of his Justice Advisory Committee, he has made it clear that he will choose extremely conservative justices:
I would have favored justices like Roberts and Alito, Scalia and Thomas. I like justices that follow the Constitution, do not make law from the bench. I would have much rather had a justice of that nature.
There is little ambiguity here. Which of these two men will pick the next justice is of grave significance. This - like budgetary priorities and economic stewardship, concern for the earth and the air, and a candidate's penchants for war and appetite for peace - should be on the lips of every pundit and in the minds of every concerned citizen.
We don't get a do-over.

HEADLINE: Trapped In the Middle Seat

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
WHILE continuing economic uncertainty around the world has rattled business confidence, it has not stopped companies -- from the smallest widget-maker to the largest financial institution -- from sending their battle-tested travelers back on the road this year.
Still, business travelers face a changed world. Corporate travelers are locked between a vexing economic recovery and rising travel costs. They face higher fares, steeper fees and new challenges to navigate, even as their corporations insist that employees stretch travel dollars more than ever.
Air travel drops corporate travelers into a land of a thousand perils. Airline mergers in recent years have reduced competition. Many flights have been canceled, forcing more passengers to connect at big and increasingly crowded hubs. With higher demand and higher costs, airlines have increased ticket prices, both in coach and in business class.
Hotels, too, have raised rates, and are increasingly following the airline business in charging extra fees for a variety of services, including in-room Wi-Fi and access to business centers. 
Business travel is still growing this year, but corporations are being more cautious with their travel spending and enforcing greater adherence to travel policies.
''More businesspeople are traveling, but companies are being tighter with their budgets,'' said Henry H. Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and a founder of the Atmosphere Research Group. ''Travelers increasingly have to justify their trips, and trips have to be approved by more managers. They have to perform the equivalent of a return-on-investment analysis before they book.''
Yet frustrated as corporate travelers may be, they have never been better armed for the hazards of life on the road.
Mobile technology provides them with up-to-date information and immediate access to a broad range of resources unimaginable just a few years ago. They can make or change plane, hotel or dinner reservations on the fly and perform a thousand other tasks, from boarding check-in to room checkout, all from digital devices.
This access to mobile technology promises in coming years to further change the travel experience and how businesses manage it, corporate travel experts said.
''You can't say enough about mobile technology and how an expanding and incredible amount of information is provided and available to travelers through their mobile devices and apps,'' said Jay Campbell, the editorial director of the BTN Group, which publishes Business Travel News, Travel Procurement magazine, and The Beat, a specialized newsletter, all aimed at corporate travel managers.
The last decade has been tough for business travel. Business trips have dropped by 22 percent since 2000, according to a study by the Global Business Travel Association. Yet travel spending has increased by 3.6 percent during that period, largely because travel has gotten more expensive. The association says that business travelers are making fewer trips and opting to stay fewer nights while maximizing their time in one place.
''Travel managers have to do more with less,'' the association said in its latest market survey report.
A report by American Express, released last year, found that American businesses probably cut back on corporate travel a lot more than was necessary in the downturn of 2007 through 2009. And these cutbacks, the report said, probably worsened the recession and ''likely hampered business recovery in 2010 and beyond.''
Since then, the recovery has been held back by a series of factors, including the Japanese tsunami and nuclear meltdown, the European debt crisis, renewed geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Persian Gulf and a global rise in energy prices.
IHS Global Insight, an economic consulting firm, recently revised its forecast for global economic growth, saying it now expected the world economy to expand by 2.8 percent this year, up from the 2.7 percent rate it predicted in March. Global growth is expected to strengthen to 3.6 percent next year, the firm said, and reach 4.3 percent in 2014. But the forecast optimistically assumes a rebound in China and other emerging markets, a pickup in growth in the United States and the end to the recession in the euro zone.
After a timid uptick in 2010, business travel rebounded strongly last year. Airlines welcomed the return of business passengers, who account for the bulk of their revenue and helped the industry return to profitability. And they have fought as fiercely as ever for the company traveler's loyalty by refurbishing their planes with new seats in business class, renovated business lounges and improved service on board.
The International Air Transport Association said premium, or noncoach, travel rose by 6.3 percent in February, for instance, extending a trend that started last year.
''The performance of premium markets is once more being supported by improvements in the business environment, with both trade activity and business confidence increasing in recent months,'' the association said. ''Better economic results in the U.S., for example, are supporting traffic across the North Atlantic as well as having positive impacts on trade partners, with revived demand for Asian consumer exports.''
Michael W. McCormick, executive director of the Global Business Travel Association, said he expected travel spending by American businesses to grow this year to $260 billion, mostly thanks to domestic growth, while international spending remained relatively flat. That figure compares with $251 billion last year, and $234 billion in 2010. But in a reflection of the mixed outlook for business travel, corporations are expected to take fewer trips in 2012 and 2013, according to the group.
In 2010, American businesspeople took a total of 437 million trips. That figure rose to 445 million trips in 2011. But it is expected to drop to 440.4 million this year and 438.5 million next year as a result of fewer domestic trips. (International trips are still expected to grow, according to the forecast.)
''Full recovery in business travel spending will require a more sustainable economic environment, rather than the two-steps-forward-one-step-back pattern that has prevailed,'' the business travel association said in a recent report released with Visa.
Mr. McCormick said growth in business travel was stable, though slow. ''Last year we were in recovery mode, but everybody was looking for the next bad thing to happen,'' he said. ''I don't see this kind of concern anymore. Now, it's steady as she goes.''
Travelers are also spending more on each of their trips. The average amount spent in 2000 was $422, and it grew to $564 by 2011. Two-thirds of that increase was because of inflation, and a third was a result of real increases in expenditures. But every dollar invested in business travel has historically brought in $20 in extra profits to American businesses.
''We're seeing road warriors taking fewer trips but making the most of them, making more stops and spending more on the road,'' Mr. McCormick said. ''The productivity explosion is a huge factor, and it's being brought on by better travel management, better technology and making the most of their time on the road.''
At the same time, travelers are facing a world of rising prices. The surge in oil costs this year is once more forcing airlines to raise fares, analysts said. The industry's recent mergers have also pared competition in some markets and allowed airlines to charge more.
The airline industry's financial outlook remains fragile. High oil prices are the biggest threat to the sector's profitability. They are forecast to average $115 a barrel this year, the International Air Transport Association said, and a new spike in prices could easily wipe out the industry's tenuous gains.
With slow economic growth, and very low profit margins for the airlines, ''it will not take much of a shock to push the industry into the red for 2012,'' Tony Tyler, the director general and chief executive of the International Air Transport Association, said in a speech last month.
In 2011, average fares on domestic flights rose 10 percent, to $254, according to the American Express Business Travel Monitor. And prices keep on rising. Domestic fares averaged $261 in February, the latest month for which that data is available, compared with $250 in the same month last year, according to American Express. Hotel rooms are also going up: domestic nightly rates rose 3 percent on average, to $155, in February compared with last year.
International fares are soaring, too. Corporate fares for international flights from the United States averaged $2,240 in the first quarter this year, up from a recession low of $1,651 in the first quarter of 2009 and nearly double the rate of $1,190 for the same period in 2007, according to Travel G.P.A., which collects travel reservation data from 45,000 companies worldwide and produces scorecards on how well corporations maximize their travel spending.
''Travel budgets this year will be similar to last year's as companies focus on growing their businesses and get their travelers on the road,'' said Lane Dubin, a vice president and general manager for American Express Business Travel. ''But prices are up. And this creates a dilemma. Companies need to be increasingly strategic about how they manage their travel.''
The Travel Price Index, which includes the key travel components of the Consumer Price Index, measures travel inflation. It had strong growth in 2011, gaining 4 percent from the previous year, reflecting the price rises seen throughout the industry last year. The trend should moderate this year, although travel prices are still expected to rise by 2.2 percent.
This price inflation is forcing companies to tighten travel policies, said Rock Blanco, the president of Travel G.P.A.
Mr. Blanco said businesses did not pay much attention to travel policy enforcement from 2008 to 2011 because business travel slowed as the economy slowed. But with the return of business travel, companies know they must loosen the purse strings again, even as they are more focused on saving.
As a result, they are making sure employees adhere to company policies in booking air travel, which can mean buying tickets at least 14 days in advance, accepting the lowest fare even if it means a longer trip or a connecting flight and booking a lower grade of hotel or car rental.
Savings can be substantial, Mr. Blanco said. For instance, travel managers are increasingly asking employees to move down one hotel category, from the so-called Upper Upscale Hotel Tier, which includes brands like DoubleTree, Embassy Suites, Hilton and Hyatt Regency, to the Upscale Hotel Tier, which includes the brands Courtyard, Homewood Suites, Radisson and Residence Inn.
A midsize company with an annual travel budget of $5 million, including $1.1 million on hotels, could save $150,000 a year if just 5 percent of its hotel bookings were downgraded by one notch, Mr. Blanco said.
''If companies can get their employees to be more compliant, they can really maximize their savings,'' he said. ''For a while, policy enforcement had lost its way. But it is back in vogue now.''
Hotel chains have recognized the opportunity, said Mr. Harteveldt, the travel analyst. Holiday Inn, for instance, has completed a top-to-bottom refurbishment of its properties, with business travelers in mind. Likewise, Courtyard by Marriott and Hilton Garden Inn have undertaken redesigns recently, Mr. Harteveldt said.
''All this means that travelers can pretty much get a four-star experience in a three-star hotel,'' he said. ''Of course it all depends on the kind of travel, and some of these hotels are probably better for a one-night stay than a three-night stay.''
A recent report by Business Travel News found that 70 percent of 168 travel buyers surveyed from December 2011 to February 2012 said they had reviewed or tightened their expense policies. Three in five of businesses surveyed said they had introduced an online expense reimbursement system, according to Business Travel News, and more than half of the respondents had increased expense report auditing.
Corporations insist that each travel dollar has to go further these days, said Ron DiLeo, the executive director of the Association of Corporate Travel Executives.
''That's always been the biggest topic of conversation: each dollar, each euro, each yen gets scrutinized,'' he said. ''If you are a wasteful business traveler, you will not be working at your company for a very long time.''
But while emphasizing greater frugality, companies must adapt to new mobile technology and applications for travelers that are making their policies seem dated. New applications and Web sites like Kayak, FlightTrack, GateGuru, OpenTable and TripIt Pro help travelers manage their trips, find deals and look for the best place to dine or the cheapest fare to fly.
Corporations must learn how to embrace such innovations, not fight them, Mr. DiLeo said. Some are, notably Google, which allows employees to bank any savings they find on airfare or hotel rates and use them to upgrade a trip or spend an extra night.
Mr. Campbell, the BTN Group's editorial director, said there was a generational divide at play.
''The baby boomers who are still managing the travel departments of many companies don't feel they quite understand how the younger generation want or don't want to be connected with their company programs,'' he said.
Mr. DiLeo said: ''You can't stop travelers using their apps or device of choice. You have to accept they do it and help them manage it.''

HEADLINE: Carlyle's I.P.O. Is Priced at $22, Below Expected Level

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
For years, the Carlyle Group had sought to follow its private equity rivals in stepping out as a publicly traded firm, a status that once promised wealth and prestige.
On Thursday, the investment firm is getting its wish - but is doing so with a slight limp.
Carlyle priced its initial public offering at $22 a stock unit on Wednesday evening - below its expected range of $23 to $25. That price will value the firm at about $6.7 billion when it begins trading Thursday on the Nasdaq stock market, under the ticker symbol ''CG.'' 
Years in the making, Carlyle's offering is still coming in at a relatively choppy time for alternative-investment firms. Volatile markets and an uncertain economic environment have crimped their ability to conduct the core business of striking deals.
The Blackstone Group, one of Carlyle's biggest rivals, reported a 24 percent drop in first-quarter earnings last month after its portfolio companies posted slower-than-expected growth. And while Kohlberg Kravis Roberts benefited from faster growth in its holdings, it suffered a steep drop in fees.
Just last month, the Oaktree Capital Group priced its I.P.O. at $43, the bottom of the investment firm's expected range. Oaktree's stock tumbled in its first day of trading, and has stayed down, closing on Wednesday at $40.05.
The public markets in general have been relatively difficult for private equity firms, despite an overall improvement in the I.P.O. market. An index of initial offering performance maintained by the research firm Renaissance Capital has returned 16.4 percent so far this year, compared with 11.8 percent by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Yet Blackstone's stock has fallen 5.4 percent this year. Apollo Global Management and K.K.R. have fared a little better, rising 1.9 percent and 5.8 percent.
''Private equity firms are a little more challenging for the I.P.O. investor,'' said Kathy Smith, a principal at the research firm Renaissance Capital. ''These are not only more cyclical companies, but also harder to understand.''
Portfolio companies that Carlyle has taken public have tended to fare better. About 36 percent of the 11 I.P.O.'s that the firm has held for its holdings since 2010 have priced above their expected ranges, according to data from Dealogic. That compares with just 25 percent of the 177 initial offerings in the United States during that time.
And on average, they have tended to remain above their I.P.O. price until at least one year after their stock sales.
People close to Carlyle argue that its executives remain upbeat about their own stock's prospects. The firm closed its order book on Tuesday amid significant demand at a lowered $22 to $23 range, allowing the firm and its advisers to better shape its initial investor base.
Carlyle's top management acceded to the lower price, believing that, as with the firm's portfolio companies, investors will pile in and drive the stock higher.
Wednesday's pricing followed weeks sprinting around the world by senior Carlyle executives pitching the offering to potential investors. At one point, the firm's co-founders - David M. Rubenstein, William E. Conway and Daniel A. D'Aniello - broke off into separate teams to cover more than 200 meetings on four continents, according to people briefed on the matter.
The message to investors was simple: Carlyle is one of the world's biggest alternative investment firms, with nearly $147 billion in assets under management and 89 leveraged buyout, real estate and hedge fund vehicles.
''By many measures, we are one of the largest and most diversified asset managers in the world,'' Mr. D'Aniello, Carlyle's chairman, said in a video presentation last month. ''We've been a first mover, with teams on the ground in almost all the major emerging markets today.''
Mr. Rubenstein was among the most active promoters. He began his portion of the road show in Asia, before traveling to the Middle East and then back to the United States.
Carlyle's offering was managed by a small army of underwriters, led by JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Credit Suisse.

HEADLINE: Dolan and Bishops Urge State To Raise the Minimum Wage

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan and New York State's bishops are calling on the Legislature to increase the minimum wage, adding an influential source of support to a proposal that has divided lawmakers along party lines.
In a statement to be released on Thursday, Cardinal Dolan, the archbishop of New York, and the bishops express concern that ''it is becoming increasingly difficult for the working poor of our state to make ends meet'' and urge a ''modest'' increase in the minimum wage, now $7.25 an hour. 
Referring to full-time employees who earn the minimum wage, the statement said, ''Our sustained recession and painfully slow recovery have left many of these workers -- often people of color and frequently the newest immigrants to our shores who therefore have the fewest support systems -- on the brink of homelessness, with not enough in their paychecks to pay for the most basic of necessities, like food, medicine or clothing for their children.''
The statement, which was obtained by The New York Times in advance of its release, comes as Albany lawmakers continue to debate whether to increase the minimum wage. The proposal has emerged as the most divisive issue in the closing weeks of this year's legislative session, which is scheduled to conclude next month.
The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, is seeking to raise the wage to $8.50, and he has made the minimum wage his top priority this year. The current wage is lower than that in 18 states and the District of Columbia.
But the Republican majority in the State Senate has insisted that raising the minimum wage would hurt the state's business climate and therefore do more harm than good for poor New Yorkers.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, has neither endorsed nor opposed Mr. Silver's proposal. But in a radio interview on Wednesday, the governor seemed to edge closer to suggesting that a proposal like Mr. Silver's should be passed this year.
''I've always supported the minimum-wage concept,'' Mr. Cuomo said on the radio show, ''The Capitol Pressroom.'' ''I think that, especially at a time like now, a minimum-wage increase would be in order. You can have discussion about how much, over what period of time, et cetera, but we are more at a philosophical debate right now between the Senate and the Assembly.''
In the Legislature, neither side has shown any sign of changing course.
The Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican, said he was focusing his attention on pushing a package of business-tax credits; he said Wednesday that the Senate would probably pass those credits in two weeks.
Asked about the minimum wage, Mr. Skelos shook his head and replied, ''Nothing's changed,'' adding, ''We think it's a job killer, wrong time to do it, and that's our position.''
The statement from Cardinal Dolan and the bishops urges the parties to compromise.
''It is our hope and our prayer that the two sides could come together for some sort of action to address the grave problems facing the lowest-wage earners in our state,'' the statement said. ''We believe an increase in the minimum wage is a matter of fairness and justice, and we hope it can be addressed soon.''

HEADLINE: Flying Between Smaller Cities Is Becoming a Marathon Sport

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
It took Josh Hunter three separate planes, two connections and a two-hour drive to get from Mobile, Ala., to Cincinnati at Easter. When he added it all up, his 720-mile trip had lasted 12 hours -- about the same it would have taken him to drive.
''The whole point of flying should be to save a lot of time, and I didn't,'' Mr. Hunter said.
For anyone trying to fly between the smaller cities in the United States, it's not easy to get from here to there anymore. 
The major airlines have been paring service for much of the last decade. But their cutbacks accelerated three years ago as carriers merged, fuel prices spiked and the recession reduced demand for seats. Even after the economy started to recover and passengers came back, the big airlines did not restore many of their flights, particularly on routes to small airports, as they sought to bolster their profits.
The strategy has squeezed the regional airlines, whose purpose is to ferry passengers on behalf of the major airlines and provide the backbone of air service to the nation's small airports. Three regional carriers have filed for bankruptcy protection since 2010, including Pinnacle Airlines in April.
So while airports in large metropolitan areas like New York, Chicago and Atlanta have emerged relatively unscathed from these changes, the smaller cities have borne the brunt.
From 2006 to 2011, the nation's top 25 airports lost 4 percent of their nonstop domestic capacity, according to Jeffrey Breen, the president and co-founder of the Atmosphere Research Group. In that same period, the next 25 airports, among them Oakland, Calif., and Kansas City, Mo., lost 13 percent. At the next 50 airports -- places like Tulsa, Okla.; Providence, R.I., and Reno, Nev. -- the drop in direct service was even steeper, 15 percent. Smaller airports, like the one in Flint, Mich., have fared even worse, down 19 percent.
''We are all in the same boat here: most airports have lost nonstop capacity in the last five years,'' Mr. Breen said. ''But the smaller airports are really the ones that have taken it on the chin the most. It's been a perfect storm for them.''
The result is that travelers now face more complicated itineraries, often involving a connection at a big hub airport, and trips that used to take two or three hours can now stretch all day.
Fares in the smaller cities have also risen the most. Ticket prices out of Bellingham, Wash.; Harrisburg, Pa.; and Fort Myers, Fla., for instance, jumped 16 to 18 percent from the third quarter of 2010 to the third quarter of 2011, while the average nationwide increase was 6 percent, according to the latest data compiled by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.
The three most expensive airports to fly from? Cincinnati (where the average ticket price was $488 in the third quarter); Huntsville, Ala. (average price $473); and Memphis ($472). The nationwide average ticket price was $362. (And none of this includes extra fees for checked bags or seats with extra legroom, which have also been rising in recent years.)
''Smaller airports have taken the brunt of the fare increases over a long period of time because they lack the kind of competition that tends to drive down prices,'' said Rick Seaney, chief executive of FareCompare.com, which tracks ticket prices.
The regional airline industry once enjoyed explosive growth, starting in the 1990s. The number of passengers flying on regional jets doubled from 1990 to 2000 and doubled again from 2000 to 2010. Regional jets still account for half of all domestic flights, though because those jets are smaller (on average, just 56 seats), they carry only about a fifth of all domestic passengers.
The regional business was profitable because airlines used them extensively in exchange for a fixed fee per flight. But as the big carriers looked to cut costs, they renegotiated their deals with their regional partners. With little control over their own schedules and routes, and with fuel prices rising, these smaller carriers have struggled. Many routes, particularly those on 50-seat planes, are no longer economical.
''The regional model,'' said Helane Becker, an airline analyst at Dahlman & Rose, ''is broken.''
Sean Menke, the president of Pinnacle Airlines, made the same point when his carrier filed for bankruptcy. ''Quite simply, our current business model is not sustainable.'' The economics of the airline industry have also changed in recent years. High fuel prices have made it nearly impossible for new airlines to muscle their way into the business by slashing prices and offering service to airports that were overlooked by major carriers -- as Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways once did.
Don Bornhorst, the senior vice president of Delta Connection, the regional service owned by Delta Air Lines, said many markets did not have enough passengers to justify the flights. Delta recently canceled its two daily flights from Sioux City, Iowa, to its hub in Minneapolis-St. Paul.
He noted that the big airlines had also cut back service to their midsize hubs, like Memphis and Cincinnati, to concentrate on the bigger ones, like Atlanta.
''With the industry consolidation, the need for the smaller regional jets flying to the number of smaller regional hubs has gone down,'' Mr. Bornhorst said. The cuts by the big airlines are not the only problem. Adding to the regional industry's difficulties is the fact that passengers are often willing to drive for an hour or two to get a cheaper fare. With ample service to large regional hubs like Raleigh, N.C., there is less need for additional service to places like Greensboro or Winston-Salem, which are within two hours of Raleigh-Durham International Airport.
The regional airlines have also been hamstrung by labor contracts at the main airlines that restrict the size of planes that can be flown by the smaller carriers. United, for instance, cannot lease regional jets with more than 70 seats.
American Airlines, which is currently in bankruptcy, is seeking to amend its labor contracts so its regional subsidiary, American Eagle, can fly jets with more than 50 seats.
The case could prove a litmus test for the industry, said Robert W. Mann, an airline consultant.''The outcome will influence the makeup and growth trajectory of the regional industry for the next several decades,'' Mr. Mann said.
In the meantime, more people will have travel experiences like Mr. Hunter, a 30-year-old flight instructor, whose Easter weekend travel turned into an odyssey. He first flew from Mobile to Houston, then to Cleveland, and finally to Columbus, where he drove two hours to his destination.
While he could have connected only once, in Atlanta, that one-stop ticket would have been more than double the price. ''That's the ridiculous state of regional airlines today,'' Mr. Hunter said.

HEADLINE: Inventor, Age 13, Hires Marketers For a Cure for Hiccups

BYLINE: By JESSICA BRUDER

 BODY:
To silence her stubborn hiccups during the summer of 2010, Mallory Kievman tried swallowing saltwater, making herself gag, eating a spoonful of sugar, sipping pickle juice and drinking a glass of water upside-down. Nearly two years and 100 attempted folk remedies later, the 13-year-old is preparing to lead a team of M.B.A. students from the University of Connecticut in building a company that can bring her invention -- Hiccupops, or hiccup-stopping lollipops -- to market this summer.
''It's very rare, when you're evaluating businesses, that you can envision a company or product being around 100 years from now,'' said Danny Briere, a serial entrepreneur and the founder of Startup Connecticut, which nurtures new companies, including Hiccupops, and is a regional affiliate of the Startup America Partnership. ''Hiccupops is one of those things. It solves a very simple, basic need.'' 
Mallory met Mr. Briere last spring at the Connecticut Invention Convention, an annual competition for kids. ''I went there, and I knew it would either be a hit or a miss project,'' she said. ''People would either like it, or they would think I was crazy.''
She had developed the product in her family's Manchester, Conn., kitchen, amalgamating her three favorite cures -- lollipops, apple cider vinegar and sugar -- into a single confection. ''It triggers a set of nerves in your throat and mouth that are responsible for the hiccup reflex arc,'' said Mallory with a matter-of-fact tone. ''It basically over-stimulates those nerves and cancels out the message to hiccup.''
The judges didn't think she was crazy. Instead, they awarded Hiccupops prizes for innovation and patentability. As part of her winnings, intellectual property lawyers filed for a patent, now pending, on Mallory's behalf.
Soon, she will even have her own team of consultants. The University of Connecticut's Innovation Accelerator plans to dispatch a group of graduate business students this summer to help push Hiccupops out into the world. The students will work from late May through August and get paid for their labor by the Connecticut Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, a university hub that hosts the Innovation Accelerator program. The center's executive director, Christopher Levesque, will be their mentor.
''It's a nifty invention and it has some terrific potential benefits for society,'' said Mr. Levesque. ''It straddles that line between an attractive, go-to product that people might like to savor and a helpful nutraceutical aid. It's innovative, born of some real ingenuity.''
So far, Mallory has presented her product at a state economic summit and at the Xcellr8 Innovation Cell, a networking group. In January, she joined a group of Startup America entrepreneurs ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.
''It's funny to see her give a business overview presentation, because she shows the organizational chart and there's her as the C.E.O. and head of R&D,'' said her father, Adam Kievman, laughing. ''Then you get a picture of me, and it says 'adult supervision.' It's been great to see it come together because this was something that she developed on her own. I'm trying to do my best to support it but to also not, you know, drive it.''
This is how Mallory explains her father's role: ''He's helping me with a lot of the business stuff. And he's also helping me handle stuff like using the stove.''
Mallory hopes Hiccupops will become a staple of school nurses' offices and drugstores. She also wants to explore a medical niche, since hiccups are a common and uncomfortable side effect of chemotherapy. ''It always has been really appealing to me to be able to sort of have a product out there that can help people,'' she said. ''I want to become a doctor and go into medicine.''
So far, her biggest challenge has been working through more than 40 batches to find a formula that hardens well and is stable enough for shelf storage. That part is over now, she said, so she's working on ''tweaking the taste'' and finding the right contract manufacturer.
For at least one member of Mallory's team, the move to a professional facility can't happen soon enough. ''It's been a lot of mess in the kitchen lab,'' her father said. ''So, yeah, Mallory's mom isn't really thrilled with all the development work going on.''

HEADLINE: Progress Is Seen in Advancing a Final Volcker Rule

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
A major new rule that has drawn the ire of Wall Street is on track for completion sooner than some bankers had expected, dashing the hopes of financial industry lobbyists, who have pressed for a delay.
Regulators are making significant progress on a final draft of the regulation, the Volcker Rule, and some officials expected to complete it by September and possibly as early as this summer, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, cautioned that regulators have not set a firm date for completing the rule.
The Volcker Rule aims to rein in risky trading on Wall Street. Named for Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, it would ban banks from placing bets with their own money, a practice known as proprietary trading. 
On Wednesday, the chief executives of six large banks voiced concerns about new regulations like the Volcker Rule at a meeting with Daniel K. Tarullo, a Federal Reserve governor. The gathering, held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in Lower Manhattan, was arranged by Mr. Tarullo and JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, who has criticized elements of the Volcker Rule.
When regulators first proposed a version of the rule last year, they received a torrent of criticism from the financial industry, which complained about the length and complexity of the proposal. It was the most hostile response to any provision of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law, which created the Volcker Rule with the notion that banks should not make risky wagers while enjoying government deposit insurance and other types of backing.
Some opponents of the Volcker Rule urged regulators to tear up the draft and start from scratch. That tactic, which even gained support among some high-level regulators, was seen by some as a ploy to delay the rule-writing process until after the 2012 election, which might end the Democratic control of the Senate and the White House.
''Reproposal is necessary for several reasons,'' the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, an influential Wall Street lobbying group, said last month in a letter to regulators. ''First, the changes to the proposal needed to correctly implement the Volcker Rule mandate and to avoid serious harm to our financial markets are so extensive that reproposal will be required as a matter of administrative law.''
But regulators driving the rule-writing process have not discussed scrapping the draft and currently have no plans to repropose a new version, the people briefed on the matter said. In fact, regulators are moving forward on the wording of critical provisions, like exemptions that allow banks to hold a certain amount of securities for customers.
Much of the headway has been made at weekly meetings about the Volcker Rule at the Treasury Department, the people said. Coordinated by Mary J. Miller, the Treasury under secretary for domestic finance, the meetings have included senior lawyers from the agencies writing the rule: the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
While top regulatory lawyers like Robert Cook, head of the S.E.C.'s trading and markets division, attend the meetings, their deputies are holding conference calls and sifting through thousands of comment letters about the rule.
The progress might come as a surprise to the rule's opponents. Wall Street grew optimistic earlier this year when Mr. Tarullo told Congress there was a ''real possibility'' regulators would not meet the July deadline set forth in Dodd-Frank for completing the rule.
Even as banks began gearing up for the new regulations, selling or spinning off their stand-alone proprietary trading desks, they pressed for more time. Their hopes for delay were further bolstered last month when regulators clarified that banks have until 2014 to fully comply with the rule.
As Wall Street sees it, the Volcker Rule threatens the health of the financial industry and the broader economy. The banks' concerns center on the imprecise nature of proprietary trading, which can be blurred with the role of market-making - taking positions in stocks and bonds in order to sell them to clients.
Those fears were echoed by foreign governments, as well as by corporations big and small.
At Wednesday's meeting in New York with Mr. Tarullo, the bank chieftains underscored the danger to markets if market-making were to be constrained, according to a summary of the meeting. The meeting with Mr. Tarullo included Mr. Dimon; Lloyd C. Blankfein, the Goldman Sachs chief executive; and James P. Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, among others.
The executives on Wednesday highlighted statements in their earlier Volcker Rule comment letters, where they warned that if regulators adopted a broad interpretation of the crackdown, it could hurt market liquidity.
Mr. Tarullo declined to ''respond or reply to views expressed by the bank representatives,'' the summary said.
The early draft of the Volcker Rule sought to distinguish between positions for proprietary trading and genuine market-making, which is exempt under Dodd-Frank. Supporters have urged regulators to adopt a strict final version of the rule, arguing that a bank could trade speculatively for its own account under the guise of market-making.
Regulators have not reached final agreement on a definition of market-making, though some said that the talks were advancing. The agencies have agreed not to apply a uniform definition of market-making to all varieties of securities.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Decline

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Demand for factory goods dropped in March in the United States by the most in three years, driven lower by a sharp fall in orders for commercial aircraft. 
The Commerce Department said Wednesday that orders for factory goods fell 1.5 percent. That was the steepest decline since March 2009, when the economy was mired in recession. Orders rose 1.1 percent in February.
A chief reason for the drop was aircraft orders plummeted nearly 50 percent. Those orders can fluctuate sharply from month to month.
Excluding transportation goods, orders were unchanged. Demand for less durable items, such as food, chemicals and gasoline, rose 0.5 percent.
Separately on Wednesday, a private survey showed that businesses in the United States sharply reduced hiring in April.
Payroll provider ADP said that businesses added 119,000 jobs last month, far lower than a revised total of 201,000 jobs in March. The report comes two days before the government issues its own report on monthly job growth.
The ADP report, which covers hiring only in the private sector, has been known to deviate sharply from the government's figures, which will be released on Friday.
For example, the government's previous report said employers added just 120,000 jobs in March -- much lower than ADP's estimate.

HEADLINE: China Curbs On Currency Still an Issue

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The pace of appreciation of the Chinese currency against the dollar has slowed in the last year, ensuring that China's manipulation of its exchange rate remains a central topic as Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner arrives in Beijing for the annual dialogue between the nations.
While praising the Chinese government for its progress, Treasury officials have promised to maintain the pressure. 
''The process of correcting the misalignment of the exchange rate remains incomplete,'' Mr. Geithner said in a speech in April. ''The Chinese currency needs to appreciate further against the dollar and the other major currencies.''
The Chinese government has been holding back the pace of appreciation, which makes Chinese goods relatively more expensive and American goods relatively cheaper.
With bond yields spiraling in Italy and Spain last winter, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund warned of recessions across Europe, sluggish growth in the United States and Japan and the possibility of hard landings in fast-growing emerging economies, like China's.
Economic issues have been overshadowed by diplomatic ones in advance of Mr. Geithner's meetings Thursday, which will include Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and officials from the upper echelons of the Chinese government. Last week, Chen Guangcheng, a blind human rights lawyer, escaped from Chinese security forces and sought refuge in the United States Embassy in Beijing. On Wednesday, he left the compound, but his fate remained unclear.
A senior administration official in the American delegation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid disturbing diplomatic relations, said that the incident had not seemed to disrupt the economic dialogue, even as it had taken some attention from it.
Officials on both sides, who had spent about two months negotiating before the meetings, were determined to pursue their respective agendas, and early sessions were congenial, the administration official said.
''Both sides are bending over backward to not make strong statements about the issue,'' said Nicholas R. Lardy, a China specialist at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based research group. Mr. Peterson said in a call with reporters that he expected open talks but little progress.
Mr. Geithner's central goal is to encourage changes to make the Chinese currency and financial systems more responsive to market forces, with exchange rate and interest rate controls as main points of American concern.
The renminbi has appreciated about 30 percent against the dollar since 2005, adjusting for both economies' rates of inflation.
Beijing had halted the currency appreciation during the financial crisis from summer 2008 to mid-2010 to help increase the competitiveness of Chinese exporters and maintain China's rapid pace of economic growth. But the government allowed the currency to resume its upward drift in 2010, to applause from the Obama administration.
The rate of appreciation initially spiked. But about 18 months ago, it started to fall, and the currency remains too cheap relative to the dollar, according to the Congressional Research Service.
The American official taking part in the dialogue said that in response to the widespread worries, the Chinese government might have halted the renminbi's appreciation or even allowed the currency to fall in value relative to the dollar over the winter. But that did not happen, the official said, for which Washington gave China's government credit.
Moreover, last month the Chinese central bank widened the currency's trading band to a daily range of 1 percent from a range of 0.5 percent, letting market forces play a bigger role in determining the value of the currency versus the dollar.
The appreciation of the currency and other changes by the Chinese government have started to rebalance the country's economy.
China's current-account surplus, a measure of how much more the country exports than it imports, fell to less than 3 percent of economic output in 2011 from about 10 percent in 2010. Its trade surplus has fallen as well. And as the government has eased certain controls, more Chinese companies are investing overseas.
But an International Monetary Fund report released in April warned that the changes have not been a result of increased consumption as a share of Chinese economic output, which the fund and the Obama administration describe as vital for the world economy.
Instead, the results were because of trade and currency dynamics. ''Sustainable rebalancing will depend on China's successful transition from investment-led to consumption-led growth,'' the report said.
The official said that given the brightening global outlook, Washington expected the currency appreciation to continue, and would press for that and a variety of economic and financial changes at the meeting.
In the April speech, Mr. Geithner focused on changing China's financial system: loosening state controls on interest rates, leveling the playing field so that private companies can compete with China's state-owned enterprises and allowing the value of the renminbi to be determined by market forces.
Progress on the currency issue is expected to be slow but consistent.
''For so long, that's been the flash point in the bilateral relationship,'' said William R. Cline, a former Treasury official now at the Peterson Institute. But the global recession seemed to convince China that absolute reliance on exports for growth was a ''risky strategy,'' he said.
The administration has applauded China's efforts to let its currency appreciate, but it remains a hot-button issue in Washington.
The Senate last year passed a bill punishing China for undervaluing its currency but the bill never passed the House.
Moreover, Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, has repeatedly promised on the campaign trail to name China as a ''currency manipulator,'' a term the Obama administration has avoided.

HEADLINE: In Praise of the Misunderstood Quince

BYLINE: By MICHAEL TORTORELLO

 BODY:
AFTER half a century in public life, the most famous quince trees in New York are looking -- let's say mature. Or how about distinguished?
No need to beat around the bush, said Deirdre Larkin, the horticulturist who tends the four beloved quinces at the Cloisters Museum and Gardens, along the Hudson River in Fort Tryon Park.
''They are old, and nothing will change that,'' she said. ''We have a habit of thinking when you are aged, you might as well be dead and replaced with something new.'' Yet in Europe, where the quince's yellow pome is a culinary treasure, orchardists will buttress the sagging limbs with a crutch. As fixes go, this would seem to be the equivalent of rigging a two-legged dog with training wheels.
But, Ms. Larkin said, ''trees can live for hundreds of years.'' 
''The period of their senescence is the longest period of their life,'' she said. ''Even though I am aging -- I am not going to look the way I looked when I was 30, 40 or 50 -- I'm not going to die tomorrow.''
Especially not if Ms. Larkin, who is 61, takes care of herself the way she babies her quince trees. In recent years, she has untangled the girdled roots and sprayed the leaves for protection against the desiccating winds that blow in from New Jersey. And with an arborist, Fran Reidy, she has waged a fierce campaign against another enemy, the apple maggot, deploying a product called Tanglefoot (which sounds like an epithet on ''Dancing With the Stars''). Given such diligence, you might think these were not just the most famous but the only quince trees in New York. Not so. Or not quite. A handful of Hudson Valley growers sell quince at the city's Greenmarkets in October and November. But after a few years of fruitless searching, you may come to the same conclusion that I did last fall: if you want a good quince, you'll have to grow it yourself.
What most Americans know about quince (Cydonia oblonga) -- if they know about quince at all -- is that it was once a fixture in Grandma's garden. O.K., Great-Great-Grandma's garden. As long ago as 1922, the great New York pomologist U. P. Hedrick rued that ''the quince, the 'golden apple' of the ancients, once dedicated to deities, and looked upon as the emblem of love and happiness, for centuries the favorite pome, is now neglected and the least esteemed of commonly cultivated tree-fruits.'' Almost every Colonial kitchen garden had a quince tree. But there was seldom need for two, said Joseph Postman, the United States Department of Agriculture scientist who curates the quince collection in Corvallis, Ore. Settlers valued quince, above all, as a mother lode of pectin for making preserves. And for that task, a little fruit went a long way.
''If you put the seeds in a cup of water, it becomes almost like Jell-O,'' Mr. Postman said. This goo doubled as a pomade. (If you try this at home, please post photos.) Like so many American workers, the quince lost its job to a disruptive technology: powdered gelatin, introduced by Charles Knox in the 1890s. Unemployment has been tough. Today the nation's entire quince crop covers a paltry 250 acres -- about the size of the lawns in Central Park. By contrast, farmers this year will raise some 350,000 acres of apples and 96 million acres of corn.
SO we arrive, perforce, at a fundamental question: Is raw quince edible?
''Maybe I'm not a fair one to ask,'' Mr. Postman said. ''Because I will eat a lot of things right off the tree that my wife will turn up her nose at.'' The skin, fuzzy at first, has ''an objectionable texture,'' he added. And when the flavor is not sour, it's sour and astringent. Cutting into the obdurate flesh practically takes a katana. But then what to make of the many appetizing quince products I recently assembled on my kitchen counter, like quince paste (what the Spanish call membrillo), quince slices in syrup and quince butter with almond and pinyon?
The key to enjoying quince at home, apparently, is to cook it and cook it and cook it. At that point, the quince is ready to cook.
I also got my hands on what may be the country's only commercial quince liqueur and quince cider. The latter came from Eaglemount Wine and Cider, near Port Townsend, Wash., where Trudy Davis, a vintner, has been experimenting with about a ton of quince from the San Juan Islands. I would pair this noncloying cider with something dry and sharp: say, a cave-aged English Cheddar and a few episodes of Aubrey Plaza's deadpan on ''Parks and Recreation.''
True to reputation, ''quince are quite hard to work with,'' Ms. Davis said, even with a ''big commercial grinder.''
The quest for a quince that can be eaten out of the hand like its botanical cousins, the apple and the pear, has sent Mr. Postman on collecting trips to the tree's ancestral homeland in the Trans-Caucasus: Armenia and Georgia. He accessioned another store of quince from a forsaken Soviet-era gene bank in Kara-Kala, Turkmenistan.
Some of these cultivars, with improved cold-hardiness and disease-resistance, are trickling into the garden world from One Green World, a tree farm in the Willamette Valley. The nursery stocks a Russian variety called Aromatnaya that I recently ordered, as a bare-root sapling, to start this spring in the yard.
The quince tree is self-pollinating: you need only one. If you train the growth to a few trunks, a quince shouldn't get much taller than a gardener can reach with a six-foot ladder.
Whatever the habit, there's a case to be made for the quince as an ornamental, and Mr. Postman gamely makes it. ''Few small trees rival the quince in becoming interestingly gnarled and twisted with age,'' he writes in a monograph with the fitting title ''The Unappreciated Quince.''
By now, Mr. Postman has probably grown more varieties of quince than anyone else on the continent. The Corvallis germ-plasm repository contains 50 or 60 edible varieties, and provides material to researchers and plant breeders. In plainer terms, Mr. Postman's wife calls him ''a tree librarian.''
When I spoke to Mr. Postman, in fact, the couple was driving across Arizona with a fresh quince cutting in the back seat. Mr. Postman had just stopped at the historic Mission San Jose de Tumacacori, about 20 miles north of the Mexican border. Researchers there have been replanting the neglected orchard with the forgotten fruit varieties of 17th-century Jesuit missionaries. An appetite for the quixotic seems to go with raising quince.
''I hesitate to use this word, but it almost feels like a cult,'' Mr. Postman said. ''There's a group of dedicated quince fanciers around, and they're kind of spreading the word and other people are getting interested.''
Or maybe not, he allowed.
''I tend to run in this set of fruit fanatics, so it's hard to tell.''
TREMAINE ARKLEY, for example, began growing quince eight years ago to take to his aunt, who remembered the fruit from the Sephardic cuisine of her youth. He started, conservatively, with 12 trees.
Last fall, Mr. Arkley brokered eight tons of quince to restaurants, farmers' markets, a cidery, a distillery and presumably every other quince nibbler within 50 leagues of his farm in Independence, Ore. ''It's sort of my personality,'' he said. ''I tend to overdo things, that's the honest truth. Instead of one, why not get 12?''
Mr. Arkley was due for a new obsession, anyway. In the 1980s, he took up six-wicket croquet. (''Not backyard croquet,'' he said, ''but the kind played in the British Empire, on a putting-green surface.'') Within a few years, he had become national champion. The 25 quince trees he currently grows on his 1900-era farmstead stand just north of the laser-leveled croquet lawn.
Another 125 trees, of an old French variety, belong to Earl Bruck, a nearby orchardist. ''He originally planted 1,000,'' Mr. Arkley said. But ''he didn't know how to sell them.''
''They were rotting on the ground,'' Mr. Arkley continued. ''He started ripping the trees out. When I met him, I said: 'Earl, stop! Let me see if I can market these for you.' ''
Mr. Arkley is pleased to have found a good home for all that quince. Even so, ''I don't think it will ever have a big following,'' he said. ''Just like croquet will never be a big sport.''
So why grow this disregarded fruit?
''I'll tell you why: because everyone else grows pears and apples and cherries and plums,'' Mr. Arkley said. ''Why bother? I like to do something offbeat. With a name like mine -- where do you start? It's a curse: Tremaine Arkley? Come on. You go to Google 'Tremaine Arkley,' and I'm the only one in the world.''
Mr. Arkley, in other words, is a quince among quinces.
Grow It, Cook It, Treat It Right
A bushel of good quince will fetch $2.50 at farmers' markets in New Jersey. At least it did in the late 19th century, when the Rev. William W. Meech published ''Quince Culture,'' the definitive -- and possibly the only -- guide to cultivating the fruit. (You can read it at archive.org.)
Alas, the price of quince may have fallen since then. The problem, quince partisans maintain, is that few of us know what to do with the adamantine fruit. The food writer Barbara Ghazarian offers a bumper crop of ideas in her cookbook ''Simply Quince.'' There are basic instructions here for baking, poaching, pickling and preserving quince. A savory palate might want to try one of the more ambitious recipes, like duck breasts with quince-sambal chutney.
As for the creamy cauliflower-quince gratin? Let's save that until the quince revival has taken firm root. The book ($20) is available on Ms. Ghazarian's Web site (queen-of-quince.com), along with a handy coring tool she calls the Fresno Armenian Ladies' Kitchen Widget ($12.50).
The best-tasting variety of quince remains a subject of conjecture. Mr. Meech identified 15 varieties including an ''orange'' type that he, with great reluctance, consented to call Meech's Prolific. It's one of the six cultivars grown at the Willowrose Bay orchard, in Washington, that Trudy Davis, a vintner, blends into a fragrant hard cider (eaglemountwinery.com; a 750-milliliter bottle costs $19, and the 2012 vintage comes out later this month).
Nine quince varieties can be found at One Green World, a Willamette Valley nursery that specializes in uncommon fruit trees (onegreenworld.com; $21.95 to $24.95 for a bare-root tree). The self-professed quince fanatic Tremaine Arkley prefers the flavor of the nursery's Central Asian cultivars, Aromatnaya and Smyrna. Another Northwest grower, Raintree Nursery, lists Smyrna and a couple of other varieties for more or less the same price (raintreenursery.com).
Smyrna, by the way, is the quince with the ''beautifully contorted habit'' that Deirdre Larkin, a horticulturist, tends fastidiously at the Cloisters Museum and Gardens. Her quince quartet in the Bonnefont garden is healthy (repeat, these trees are not dying!). But ''providing for all contingencies,'' Ms. Larkin recently ordered some understudies from Ty Ty Nursery, in Georgia (tytyga.com; prices start at $59.75 for a five- or six-foot bare-root tree).
Chilly winters haven't seemed to frighten the Smyrna quince that Ms. Larkin keeps at her weekend house in the Catskills. As Joseph Postman, a quince curator, noted in a recent study the United States Department of Agriculture found that quince was ''much more cold hardy than we anticipated, particularly these varieties from Russia and Armenia.''
A bigger problem, Mr. Postman said, may be fire blight, a bacterium that thrives in hot, humid climates and leaves scorched-looking wood in its wake. ''Quince is notoriously susceptible,'' he said. But ''New York is not as prone as places a little farther south.''
Overhead watering fosters fire blight, as does fertilizing, which encourages the growth of susceptible suckers. But once established, the trees seem to do fine without such ministrations, Mr. Postman said.
After all, if a lack of attention were fatal, the quince would be gone by now.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.N. Committee Puts 3 North Korean Companies on a Blacklist

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -- A United Nations Security Council sanctions committee on Wednesday added three North Korean state companies to a United Nations blacklist of firms banned from international trade in response to the country's launching of a rocket last month. 
The decision by the Security Council's North Korea sanctions committee came after China consented to sanctions on the companies. It falls far short of the roughly 40 companies the United States, the European Union, South Korea and Japan had wanted to blacklist after the launching by the North, which they suspected was done to test missile technology.
The newly blacklisted companies are ''very significant North Korean entities'' involved in the country's nuclear and missile programs, said the United States ambassador to the United Nations, Susan E. Rice.
The three companies are Green Pine Conglomerate, Amroggang Development Banking Corporation and Korea Heungjin Trading Company. Analysts have said that North Korea often changes the names of companies once they are put on sanctions lists.
Last month, the Security Council adopted a ''presidential statement'' that strongly condemned North Korea's rocket launching, called for adding names to the list of those hit by existing sanctions and warned the North of further consequences if it carried out another missile launching or nuclear test.

HEADLINE: Loose Lips Can Sink Trips

BYLINE: By DAVID WALLIS

 BODY:
PETER COCHRANE, a technology consultant, entrepreneur and blogger, usually unwinds on the train between his home in Ipswich, England, and London with coffee, cookies and a newspaper.
But during a memorable trip in March 2006, neighboring passengers disturbed his relaxation rituals by behaving in a very un-British manner: They were loud.
The English might sing at soccer stadiums, but they usually keep quiet on British Rail.
Mr. Cochrane shot his noisy neighbors a cold stare. No luck. So he decided that if he couldn't beat them, he would join them. He then began actively listening to the consultants across the aisle conduct a mobile business meeting. 
''Within a matter of minutes, I know who they are. I know who their client is. What kind of business they're in. I know what the turnover is,'' said Mr. Cochrane. ''And I know what kind of difficulties they are having.''
The consultant in charge then announced an imminent conference call with a client. ''The number to dial in is this and the passcode is this,'' said Mr. Cochrane, who ''couldn't resist'' dialing into the conference call as well. He entered the overheard passcode and covertly monitored the conversation among his seatmates and a publicly held aerospace company. ''If I had been a bad boy,'' said Mr. Cochrane, ''I could have undoubtedly made some profit.''
Blabbing on a business trip can cause repercussions.
In 2009, Robert B. Robbins, a partner in the Washington office of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, unwittingly broadcast his law firm's intention to lay off several associates to fellow Amtrak passengers. In a cellphone call, the lawyer named co-workers facing unemployment. The indiscretion mortified a law student on the train, who alerted the blog Above the Law.
News of the gaffe prompted Mr. Robbins's law firm to publicly apologize ''for the unfortunate manner in which our deliberations about reductions have become public.'' Mr. Robbins kept his job but got a new nickname: Acela Bob.
In an age of hyperconnectivity, when several airlines offer in-flight cellphone service and an increasing number of buses, trains and even taxis now provide Wi-Fi access, business travelers routinely expose proprietary information.
''People are woefully lax'' about information security practices, said Cynthia Cheng Correia, who teaches a course at Simmons College in Boston on competitive intelligence, which is the legal and ethical monitoring of business or professional rivals.
Ms. Cheng Correia pointed out that you could give away the store without saying a word. On one flight, she sat next to a sales manager working on a database marked ''clients.'' Ms. Cheng Correia happened to be reviewing photos on her cellphone at the time and could have snapped a shot of her neighbor's computer screen. ''He would not have been the wiser,'' she said.
Shoulder surfing, or surreptitiously reading a stranger's documents or laptop, is widespread. In a 2007 survey of 400 business people commissioned by 3M United Kingdom, 80 percent shoulder-surfed. Still, when they were the subjects of such unwanted attention, more than half of respondents said they had just ignored it.
Ms. Cheng Correia suggested that the casual appearance of seatmates often lulls business travelers into a false sense of security. ''We can't say we're safe just because we're surrounded by crying babies,'' she said, adding that first-class snoops often lurk in coach: ''There are more eyeballs in coach than in first class or business class.''
Richard Plansky, senior managing director for business intelligence and investigations at Kroll in New York City, advises travelers concerned with shoulder surfing to go on a ''data diet'' before a business trip.
''Do you really need to bring a laptop, and an iPhone and a USB drive?'' Mr. Plansky asked. He warns clients traveling to China or Russia that the answer should be no. Corporate security experts accuse state security operatives in both countries of trying to steal trade secrets from visiting business travelers. He counsels clients traveling to high-risk countries to carry laptops and cellphones devoid of valuable information. ''You can't lose what you don't have,'' said Mr. Plansky.
Ken Rygler, a consultant in the microelectronics industry, worries more about the prying eyes of curious seatmates than Chinese intelligence agents. During flights, he avoids using PowerPoint ''because the font is so big.''
Mr. Rygler sometimes snoops on neighboring passengers, especially on flights linking high-tech hubs. He recalled digging up interesting information on a flight between Austin, Tex., and San Jose, Calif. Mr. Rygler learned that one of his client's competitors had struggled with a problem at its factory. ''It was not public,'' said Mr. Rygler. ''It was helpful.''
Some private investigators stake out airport lounges near a company's headquarters to gather information from traveling employees. Mr. Plansky of Kroll dismissed such methods as inefficient, though he said he considered conferences and trade shows ''particularly risky'' destinations for travelers with intellectual property to protect.
Leonard Fuld of the firm Fuld & Company in Cambridge, Mass., stressed that competitive intelligence professionals had more in common with librarians than spies, but he acknowledged that an eavesdropping expedition near a conference center could prove valuable.
''You draw concentric circles around the location of the trade show or conference. You know the restaurants and hotels around the conference will have people filled to the brim that are attending the show. That could be useful,'' said Mr. Fuld.
Some conference attendees are easy marks. They wear name tags outside conference centers and clothing emblazoned with corporate logos. And employees of large companies could find it tempting to talk shop at industry events because they might see only co-workers from other offices at conventions.
Disclosures would not surprise Robert D. Brownstone, a lawyer at Fenwick & West in Mountain View, Calif., who frequently lectures about information security at conferences.
He recalled that before a speech at an employment law conference in Florida, he used a computer reserved for registrants. A Microsoft Word file entitled ''Severance.doc'' was on the desktop.
''Just by hovering on the icon on the desktop, a yellow bubble came up with the name of the law firm,'' said Mr. Brownstone. ''I opened it up and saw a final or prior draft of a severance agreement. Here's someone at a conference, learning to be a better employment lawyer and they obviously went into their work e-mail or their computer and dropped something onto the drive and left it sitting there.''
On the road, Mr. Brownstone adheres to a strict protocol to protect confidential information. He uses a software program, Better File Rename, to make documents seem innocuous, and carries a portable scanner to digitize documents. ''I just don't want to have stuff that anybody could eyeball,'' said Mr. Brownstone. He also avoids speaking on his cellphone with clients when traveling. ''I've been a lawyer 25 years; I can only remember one phone call with a client.''
If he speaks with colleagues outside the office, Mr. Brownstone practices what might be called verbal encryption. He recalled working in New York City in the 1980s and 1990s on prominent cases like the defense of Michael R. Milken, who was eventually convicted of securities fraud, and the civil case filed against Claus von Bulow by his stepchildren.
''If we were going to court, the senior partner and I would be hopping in a cab to go to the federal courthouse,'' said Mr. Brownstone. ''We would use code names for the key players in the case. You don't know who the cabdriver just drove or is about to drive.''
Mr. Brownstone sheepishly admits that he fails to use a privacy filter on his laptop. ''Shame on me,'' he said. He is not alone. A 2010 survey by the software security company People Security of 800 attendees of an information technology conference found that only 13 percent used screen shields, which block the sideways view of curious onlookers without diminishing the user's view.
There may be physiological and psychological reasons airline passengers leak information. In the analysis of Robert Bor, an aviation psychologist and the editor of a book called ''Passenger Behaviour,'' (Ashgate, 2003) some travelers experience in-flight anxiety when away from familiar settings. ''That anxiety can make us more susceptible to engaging with people,'' said Mr. Bor.
Airline passengers, he said, often suffer from fatigue, jet lag, low blood sugar from not having eaten or hypoxia, which is mild oxygen deprivation. ''Being at 35,000 feet for more than two hours is going to make you mildly hypoxic,'' said Mr. Bor, ''and slightly less oxygen will make you euphoric or may give slightly poorer judgment.'' Given the emotional and physical stresses, Mr. Bor judged commercial airlines as the perfect environment to turn a frequent flier into a chatterbox.
Before breaking out the BlackBerry or yammering to a co-worker -- whether in the skies or on the rails -- consider the burden placed on the professional listener who may be minding your business from the next seat.
''You can't undo what you hear,'' said Ms. Cheng Correia, the Simmons professor. ''You might be able to avert your eyes, but you can't just plug your ears and go 'la, la, la, la, la.' ''

HEADLINE: UBS Earnings Sink, Following a Trend in Europe

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
8:41 p.m. Updated
UBS said on Wednesday that its profit slumped 54 percent in the first three months of the year after investment banking income dropped and the bank took an accounting charge on the value of its own debt.
The bank might also face a shareholder revolt over executive pay at its annual meeting in Zurich on Thursday. Some investors have raised concerns about the levels of compensation after a year in which the bank was hit by a trading scandal and its shares plummeted. 
Net profit at UBS fell to 827 million Swiss francs ($911 million) in the first quarter from 1.8 billion francs in the period a year earlier. Operating income fell 22 percent, to 6.5 billion francs.
''Given challenging market conditions, I am proud of what our employees have achieved,'' Sergio P. Ermotti, the chief executive, said in a statement.
UBS is the latest European bank to report a drop in first-quarter earnings. Like its rival Credit Suisse, UBS is seeking to cut jobs and focus on the more lucrative parts of its investment banking operation, while adhering to stricter capital requirements.
The sovereign debt crisis in Europe, broader concerns about the stability of the banking system and government budget deficit issues in the United States are likely to continue to weigh on client activity in the second quarter, UBS said. But the bank also said it expected the wealth management unit to continue to attract net inflows of new money.
Jon Peace, a banking analyst at Nomura, said it ''was not a bad result given a tough quarter'' and ''after the results from Credit Suisse last week, investors were prepared for a worse margin performance in the private bank.'' UBS shares rose 3.7 percent in Zurich on Wednesday.
Some shareholders remained less impressed with how much UBS was paying senior executives and its bankers. Like Barclays, Credit Suisse and Citigroup, UBS is facing some opposition from shareholders for its pay practices.
George Dallas, director of corporate governance at F&C Investments, gave UBS credit for cutting its 2011 bonus pool for the investment banking unit by 60 percent from a year earlier, but he said that ''may not have been enough.''
''It was a year in which profit diminished, it had a major fraud scandal and the market capitalization dropped,'' Mr. Dallas said. ''Those facts should be taken more into account.''
UBS uncovered a $2.3 billion loss from unauthorized transactions at its London equity unit in September, and a trader, Kweku M. Adoboli, was charged with fraud and false accounting. He is in custody awaiting trial this year. The trading loss led to the resignation of Oswald J. Grubel as chief executive.
UBS shareholders are to vote on the company's compensation report on Thursday. The vote is nonbinding, but a rejection of the report would still put pressure on the bank to reconsider its compensation policy.
Thomas C. Naratil, the chief financial officer, said in a conference call that he was ''pleased with our progress'' and that the bank was ''on track'' with its program to reduce costs by 2 billion francs.
The earnings included an accounting charge of 1.2 billion francs on the value of the bank's own debt and costs of 126 million francs related to the restructuring effort.
Excluding the credit charge, the investment banking operation had a pretax profit of 730 million francs in the quarter, down from 965 million francs in the period a year earlier. Total income at the unit fell as an increase in revenue from capital markets services and products, including equities, was unable to offset a drop in income from the debt, commodities and currencies business and a decrease in fees from advising on mergers and acquisitions.
Net new money in the wealth management business was 10.9 billion francs in the first quarter, mainly because of an increase from clients in the Asia-Pacific region and emerging markets. That was more than in the previous three months but less than in the first quarter of 2011. The bank also attracted more client money in its wealth management business in the United States.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Occupy Wall Street: From Streets to Archives

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER

 BODY:
Earlier this week a Times article looked at social scientists who are trying to study Occupy Wall Street in real time. But a group of archivists are also hitting the streets, and the Internet, in an effort to preserve the movement's traces for scholars of the future.
Within weeks of the occupation of Zuccotti Park last fall archivists from the New-York Historical Society and other institutions were out scooping up posters, fliers, pamphlets, signs and other ephemera. ''For us, it's an event in New York City,'' said Jean Ashton, the society's executive vice president and director of its library, which has so far amassed several hundred Occupy-related artifacts. ''We want to make sure that people understand what happened here.'' 
Other archivists are collecting some of the explosion of digital materials by and about Occupy. New York University's Tamiment Library has been recording the meetings of the movement's Think Tank group and archiving the Web page of the New York group's general assembly. The Internet Archive, a nonprofit Web site, and the Occupy Archive, a project at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for the History of New Media at George Mason University, has been collecting material from Occupy sites beyond New York.
So far OccupyArchive has some 3,200 items relating to hundreds of occupations around the country, mostly gathered by volunteers who have scoured the Web for scans of meeting minutes, posters, Flicker photos and other material. ''Many local occupations were quite good about keeping minute notes, agendas and that kind of thing,'' Sharon Leon, the Rosenzweig's director of public programs, said. ''That will eventually be a rich archive for historians doing work on social movements and post-recession reaction on the left.''
But despite the profusion of material online some archivists say that the historical record of the future may have some gaping holes. While Twitter, Facebook and other social media have been crucial to the movement, the terms of use of most social media sites prevent anyone from publishing material harvested from them. ''Look back at the Arab Spring,'' said Howard Besser, an archivist at N.Y.U. and founder of Activist Archivists, a group created last fall to coordinate the collection of digital media relating to Occupy. ''We actually have precious little that scholars can use to look at how things spread.''
Archiving efforts have also met some initial skepticism from the Occupy movement itself, though Mr. Besser said most people had overcome their wariness about collaborating with traditional institutions. ''There are lots of people who don't get the idea of archiving, but that's true everywhere,'' he said. ''Most people, when it's explained, are very quick to understand.''
Activist Archivists has worked with Occupy Wall Street's archives working group to create a ''Why Archive'' postcard to distribute at future demonstrations. (The first of five bullet points: ''Accountability. Archives collect evidence that can hold those in power accountable.'') The group has also worked to counter fears that material gathered by archivists could end up being used in legal actions against protesters. Mr. Besser said they were looking into training activists to use ObscuraCam, a technology developed by human rights groups that automatically obscures faces in photographs and videos.
''The archivist part of us says we want to grab everything of enduring value and keep it,'' Mr. Besser said. ''But the activist part says that we may not want to save certain things, or may not want the police to have access to certain things.''
In the meantime Occupy is also storing its own archive of hundreds of signs, posters, fliers and one-of-a-kind objects recovered after the eviction from Zuccotti Park, like banners for the camp's kitchen and other facilities made out of orange plastic netting used by the police.
Anna Perricci, a member of the archives working group who is coordinating digital preservation efforts, said that it was important for Occupy to have an active part in curating its own history.
''There are a lot of other people recording the movement and telling its story,'' she said. ''But I also want to empower occupiers to help preserve what is being made while their story is unfolding.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Methodists Vote Against Ending Investments Tied to Israel

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN

 BODY:
The United Methodist Church, the nation's largest mainline Protestant denomination, voted against two proposals on Wednesday to divest from companies that provide equipment used by Israel to enforce its control in the occupied territories.
The closely watched vote, at the church's quadrennial convention in Tampa, Fla., came after months of intense lobbying by American Jews, Israelis and Palestinian Christians. After an afternoon of impassioned debate and several votes, the delegates overwhelmingly passed a more neutral resolution calling for ''positive'' investment to encourage economic development ''in Palestine.''
However, the Methodists also passed a strongly worded resolution denouncing the Israeli occupation and the settlements, and calling for ''all nations to prohibit the import of products made by companies in Israeli settlements on Palestinian land.'' 
An international movement for ''boycott, divestment and sanctions'' has gained steam as the peace process in the Middle East has come to a virtual standstill, and allies of the Palestinians have argued that these strategies could pressure Israel to stop building settlements and return to the negotiating table.
The divestment question has come up repeatedly over the years in mainline Protestant churches, which have long cultivated relationships with Palestinian Christians and regularly send delegations to Israel and the occupied territories. These denominations support hospitals, schools and charities in the territories.
The Presbyterian Church USA will vote on a divestment measure at its general assembly, which begins on June 30 in Pittsburgh. (The Presbyterians voted for divestment in 2004, then backed off at their next general assembly two years later.)
The presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, the Rev. Katharine Jefferts Schori, recently came out against divestment and boycotts, and instead urged Episcopalians to invest in development projects in the West Bank and Gaza.
The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the nation's largest Lutheran denomination, rejected divestment in 2007 and 2011.
In Tampa, many delegates took to the floor to testify that they had traveled to the Holy Land and met with Palestinian Christians who were suffering and increasingly desperate for an end to the occupation. But in the end, they listened to some Jewish leaders and fellow Methodists who warned that divestment was a one-sided strategy that penalized only Israel.
The Rev. Alex Joyner, a Methodist pastor in Franktown, Va., and a member of an antidivestment caucus called United Methodists for Constructive Peacemaking in Israel and Palestine, said: ''We are all concerned about the suffering and the ongoing occupation, because it is hurting Israeli and Palestinian society. But what the church has said is we want a positive step, and we reject punitive measures as a way of trying to bring peace.''
The Methodist delegates in Tampa, primarily occupied with proposals for church reorganization plans, were lobbied heavily on the divestment question. Divestment advocates dressed in bright yellow T-shirts passed out literature and sponsored free luncheons for delegates. Jewish Voice for Peace, a liberal American Jewish group that supports divestment, sent several organizers.
Desmond Tutu, the Anglican archbishop emeritus of Cape Town and a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, wrote an article in The Tampa Bay Times likening the Israeli occupation to apartheid and saying that divestment could be as effective in Israel as it was in South Africa.
On the other side, more than 1,200 rabbis representing every stream of organized Judaism signed a letter, mailed to the delegates before the convention, beseeching them to vote against divestment. They argued that the tactic ''shamefully paints Israel as a pariah nation, solely responsible for frustrating peace,'' and said a vote for divestment would ''damage the relationship between Jews and Christians.''
The divestment resolution called specifically for pulling investments in the church's pension funds out of three companies: Caterpillar, Hewlett-Packard and Motorola Solutions.
Advocates for divestment say that Caterpillar supplies the bulldozers and earth-moving equipment used by the Israel Defense Forces to clear Palestinian homes and orchards; that Hewlett-Packard provides, sometimes through subsidiaries, biometric monitoring at checkpoints and information technology to the Israeli Navy; and that Motorola supplies surveillance equipment to illegal settlements in the West Bank and communications equipment to the occupation forces.
In two separate votes, divestment was defeated by a 2-to-1 ratio. Susanne Hoder, a Methodist from Rhode Island and a spokeswoman for a group for divestment, the United Methodist Kairos Response, said: ''Though we did not get the decision we hoped for, we have succeeded in raising awareness about the persecution of Palestinian Christians and Muslims. We have awakened the conscience of the churches and pointed out the inconsistency between our words and our actions.''
Ms. Hoder said that four geographic regions, or ''annual conferences,'' of the Methodist Church -- Northern Illinois, California Pacific, New York and West Ohio -- had already voted to pull out their own investments. ''We expect that more United Methodist conferences will do this,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Where 'Just Looking' Is Just Fine

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
THE kook on the bus had a Starbucks cup filled with ice on his head. He was crooning a soulful version of ''Fly Me to the Moon.'' The guy was not a performance artist, and yet his serenade seemed aptly artful since the M35 bus was headed for the next big cultural destination, a rock in the East River that, as far as many New Yorkers are concerned, might as well be in space.
Typically speaking, there are three reasons to be aware of Randalls Island, the art dealer Angela Westwater said last week: ''You have children who have sports events there, you're going to Cirque du Soleil or you've seen the sign for the island for 10 seconds as you drive out of Manhattan across the Triborough,'' now renamed the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge.
Come Friday there is another. It is then that the London-based Frieze Art Fair flings open its tent to the public and brings its distinctive brand of arts entertainment to the city, a kind of trade show as fun fair, both commercially down-and-dirty and aggressively high-minded at once. 
''The art world is very event-driven now,'' said the seasoned art dealer Mary Boone. Viewing art, Ms. Boone added, ''has become a spectator sport.''
As spectacle, Frieze has a history of delivering the goods. In just under a decade, the fair has gone from being a scrappy upstart to becoming a fixture on the international art circuit, a requisite stop for an elite group of buyers and sellers and, increasingly, for a broader public that just likes to look.
Despite the complaints of those who can be relied on to decry the blurring of lines between high and low culture and the increasingly incestuous relationship between commerce and art, art fairs in general and Frieze perhaps best of all provide a surprisingly democratic service to the general public: a one-stop-shopping survey of the state of contemporary art.
Is it imperfect? It is. Much goes missing. Yet, traipsing the aisles of Frieze 2011 in October, a fairgoer was likely to pass not merely scores of booths hung with blue-chip products by predictable art stars, but also the Brazilian artist Laura Lima providing real-life beauty makeovers that rendered one older, the Romanian-born artist Andra Ursuta transformed into an Iron Age mummy, and the brilliant Polish artist Pawel Althamer in the garb of a billy goat from a popular children's tale, a costume in which he has wandered the world.
''There are multiple audiences we try to reach,'' Amanda Sharp, one of the Frieze Art Fair organizers, said last week. Ms. Sharp and her business partner Matthew Slotover are gambling millions on the notion that Frieze can provide what other local art fairs haven't lately, an experience combining serious finance with communitarian values, a fair that tries to avert the dead-zone formality of most trade shows and that deflects the knives of critics always ready to skewer a commercialized art world by using a time-tested strategy of bread and circuses.
''The international focus is the reason I think Frieze is one of the most exciting things to happen in New York in 20 years,'' said Andre Balazs, the hotelier behind the Standard hotel chain. ''What Art Basel Miami Beach did in Miami Beach was transformational,'' Mr. Balazs added, referring to the art fair that in 10 years altered the international art calendar and goosed up the economy during the traditional pre-Christmas lull in that beachfront tourist town. ''New York is obviously not Miami, but I feel like Frieze offers an existential answer to the cultural stasis New Yorkers feel right now.''
Even for the fair's abnormally confident organizers, that claim seems a mite overweening. ''I don't know if I would go that far,'' Mr. Slotover said last week. ''But I am very much pro-democratization and a larger engagement,'' between a broad public and the often insular contemporary art world, he said. Citing a visitor survey of Frieze London that suggested 80 percent of visitors arrived with no intention (or prospect) of buying art, Mr. Slotover added: ''We're the only fair that calls itself a fair.''
Those who journey across the East River will find in place of the usual convention-hall dead zone a luminous, undulant caterpillar tent designed by the local architectural firm SO-IL. Inside it will be booths representing a roster of close to 180 international galleries, lured here in part by the kickoff of a commercially crucial spring season when the art world converges on New York for the major auctions of contemporary art.
Fairgoers will also encounter a separate posse of newer and younger galleries assembled under the rubrics of Frieze Focus and Frieze Frame; a talk series featuring the writer Rick Moody, among more-predictable art world suspects; a program of eight public art projects commissioned by Cecilia Alemani, curator and director of the High Line Art Program; and a selection of pop-ups from foodie favorites like Roberta's, the Fat Radish, Frankie's Spuntino and the Standard, underscoring another Frieze trademark, a desire to fill bellies as well as to feed eyes.
That there nowadays is an ''increasingly art-hungry general public,'' as the dealer Angela Westwater said, no longer seems open to debate. Consider, Ms. Westwater said, free night at the New Museum, a short walk along the Bowery from her Norman Foster-designed gallery, ''when there can be lines around the block.'' Consider art installations like the Starn Brothers' vertiginous bamboo structure ''Big Bambu,'' which drew large crowds in 2010 to the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Roof Garden at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as Ms. Westwater noted, and the Alexander McQueen show at that same institution, which drew 661,509 visitors.
''Whether or not you like Alexander McQueen,'' Ms. Westwater continued, that is a lot of interest in a show of what, as some sharp-eyed viewers noted, was as much about performance and sculpture as fashion.
''At one level, you think, does an endless horizon of booths fill me with excitement?'' said Elisabeth Sussman, a longtime curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the organizer with Jay Sanders of this year's biennial. ''But there's no way around this, the information at Frieze is fantastic.''
Like the carnival it in some ways resembles Frieze is also the only art fair that takes place beneath a big top. ''Who else would build this but idiots like us?'' Mr. Slotover said.
The tent itself cost close to $1.5 million, according to Ms. Sharp, the fair itself a good deal more. ''Multiples of seven figures, millions and millions and millions,'' for a fair that, counting a V.I.P. preview, will last a total of five days, she said. ''Obviously it's a huge risk, but we like doing things with panache and a smile.''
The first Frieze Art Fair made its debut in Regent's Park in London in 2003, in a structure designed by the then little-known architect David Adjaye. Despite its organizers' lack of experience, Frieze quickly earned a reputation for serious purpose and sufficient curatorial heft to compete with the venerable Art Basel, held every June in that Swiss city, as well as other contemporary art fairs like Art Basel Miami Beach, the Independent, the Art Dealers Association of America fair, and the Armory show, itself conjured up in 1994 as an assault on a scene that the organizers (Pat Hearn, Colin De Land, Matthew Marks and Paul Morris) considered moribund.
''We couldn't organize our way out of a paper bag,'' at the beginning, Ms. Sharp said, mindful of the fact that neither she or Mr. Slotover had ever edited a magazine, either, when together they founded the successful art journal Frieze on a small grubstake from his parents in 1991.
That 36-page pilot issue appeared just in time to coincide with the emergence of a group of novice artists lumped together under the hastily coined acronym YBA (Young British Artists) and an exploding London gallery scene.
The success of the magazine, seemingly inevitable in retrospect, was no more guaranteed than anything else the pair has impulsively undertaken since -- including Mr. Slotover said, Frieze New York. ''It's all a crapshoot,'' he said.
If so, it is one backed by both Deutsche Bank and a lineup of blue-chip dealers from the United States (Gagosian, Hauser & Wirth, Lehmann Maupin, Michael Werner) and abroad (Vermelho from Sao Paulo, Kurimanzutto from Mexico City, White Cube and Gavin Brown's Enterprise from New York, Rampa and Rodeo from Istanbul.)
''What's interesting about Frieze is that it's not just collectors who are having a great experience,'' said David Maupin, a director of the Lehmann Maupin gallery. ''It's not just for the one percent. It's for John Q. Public, too.''

HEADLINE: A Delicate New Balance on National Security

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- One moment he boasts about taking out America's No. 1 enemy, and the next he vows to bring home troops from an unpopular war. For President Obama, the days leading up to his re-election kickoff have been spent straddling the precarious line between hawk and dove, and possibly redefining his party for years to come.
For four decades, Democrats have been confounded by a deeply ingrained soft-on-security image that has hurt them at the ballot box. But in a country now tired of war yet still seeking to project strength, Mr. Obama is trying to reposition his party on national security, much as Bill Clinton did on economic and domestic policy in the 1990s, triangulating between two poles.
The blend, captured by an unannounced trip to Afghanistan on Tuesday that ended in a nationally televised address, has frustrated critics on both left and right. Many in his party's liberal base have grown disenchanted with Mr. Obama for tripling troop levels in Afghanistan, carrying over many of President George W. Bush's counterterrorism policies and in some ways even expanding them. Many conservatives, on the other hand, argue that behind the raid that killed Osama bin Laden lies a fundamentally weak approach to rivals and rogue states like Iran, North Korea and Russia. 
If it seems to some like the doctrine of having it both ways, it has scored well with a broad cross-section of the country, as measured by polls and focus groups. And Mr. Obama's advisers have made clear in recent days that they believe he can play offense on national security as no other Democratic presidential candidate has since the Vietnam War.
''The post-9/11 paradigm that existed for several years, where you were either all in with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan or you were not sufficiently hawkish, I think no longer applies,'' said Benjamin Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to the president. ''He's demonstrated that you can end those wars while actually more effectively targeting our enemy.''
Republicans see it as more calculation than conviction, more about winning an election than making America safe. ''He's in an odd position, sort of betwixt and between, and he can't really figure out which way he wants to go,'' said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, a Republican member of the Armed Services Committee and chairman of his party's Senate campaign committee.
Of course, the innovations of drone warfare make it easier for a president to be tough at little cost to Americans, or to his political standing. Mr. Cornyn said that Mr. Obama denounced harsh interrogation techniques but evinced no hesitation about killing suspected terrorists -- even an American citizen -- from the skies. ''It looks kind of superficial to me,'' he said, ''and looks expedient.''
Mr. Obama has long expressed a complicated view of national security that did not neatly fit into old boxes, but it was initially obscured by his strong opposition to the Iraq war. As a candidate in 2007 and 2008, he cited that stance as his central argument against his rival for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Less widely noticed was his attempt to balance that with vows to send more troops to Afghanistan and unilaterally strike inside Pakistan if necessary to capture or kill Bin Laden. At the time, many analysts thought those positions were more about avoiding the historical trap that past antiwar Democrats had fallen into. But four years later, Mr. Obama has presided over a national security policy that has married elements of both parties.
''What you're seeing is carrying out a very well thought-out and very effective foreign policy -- more than anything it's pragmatic and practical,'' said Representative Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. ''He has done exactly what he said he was going to do.''
A New York Times/CBS News poll conducted last month showed that Mr. Obama had neutralized the traditional Republican advantage on national security. Fifty-nine percent expressed confidence in Mr. Obama's ability to be an effective commander in chief, slightly more than the 56 percent who had confidence in that area in Mitt Romney, the putative Republican nominee.
''I think it has worked politically, but it is the type of thing that stops working the day after the election,'' said Peter D. Feaver, a Duke University professor who worked on Mr. Bush's national security staff. ''If the policies are unwise, and I think they are at least fraught if not unwise, then those chickens come home to roost eventually.''
Politically, at least, Republicans in recent days struggled to come up with an effective counterpunch. They complained that Mr. Obama was politicizing national security when his campaign released a video last week hailing the Bin Laden raid. But if the video struck some as unseemly, including some in the White House who worried it was undignified, it kept the conversation focused for days on what the Obama team wanted to focus on.
As late as Tuesday night, former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told Fox News that Mr. Obama's order launching the raid was not ''a tough decision,'' and that it ''would just be dumbfounding'' to decide otherwise. Democrats on Wednesday gleefully circulated a newspaper article reporting that Mr. Rumsfeld once pulled the plug on a raid to capture top Qaeda figures because it was too risky.
After initially saying that Mr. Obama was exploiting the raid, Mr. Romney and other Republicans pivoted by Wednesday to a more measured reaction to the president's trip to Afghanistan. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, told a home-state radio station that ''the only qualms I have about anything the president said is emphasizing to our enemies exactly what our next military move is, or the lack of a military move.'' Mr. Obama, he said, is ''misleading the American people'' if he leaves the impression that the war on terrorism is over.
Mr. Obama, who campaigned on Sunday with Mr. Clinton, seems to be following his Democratic predecessor's playbook. After a generation of Democrats alienating voters with liberal domestic positions, Mr. Clinton moved the party toward the center on issues like trade, welfare and deficit spending.
Recent focus groups conducted by Third Way, a Democratic-leaning group dedicated to that shift, found some success for Mr. Obama in doing the same for national security. ''His brand on security has been very, very strong, and there's no doubt that has been a radical shift in the way people think about Democratic presidents,'' said Matt Bennett, the group's senior vice president.
But it was limited to Mr. Obama. When it came to Democrats generally, Mr. Bennett said: ''We heard the same thing we heard in '08: they're weak, indecisive, afraid to use force. It just isn't enough to completely change the brand. I think he's done everything he can possibly do. It's not his fault. It's just it can't be fixed in one term.''

WASHINGTON
WHAT makes a house a home? The lives lived in it, of course. The relationship between people and their homes, sometimes passionate, sometimes indifferent, confounding or fraught, is the subject of ''House & Home,'' an exhibition that opened Saturday at the National Building Museum here.
In photographs, films, models, timelines and nearly 200 artifacts (including a pink flamingo lawn ornament, a tortilla press, an early Apple home computer and a vibrator from the 1920s), all spread among six galleries, the show gamely asks some of the big questions: How have government policies shaped who lives where over time? Why do houses look the way they do? How does architecture affect individuals? How does it shape neighborhoods? What do we do at home? What is housework? What is play? And, finally, how do our homes express who we are, as well as who we'd like to be?
''Many of us are familiar with the idea that our houses are reflections of our personality,'' said Thomas Mellins, an architectural historian and independent curator, who organized the exhibition with Donald Albrecht, curator of architecture and design at the Museum of the City of New York, and Sarah Leavitt, a curator at the museum. 
''In America,'' Mr. Mellins continued, ''we are very connected to this idea of individuality. Even if we do inherit a place to live, we are interested in personalizing it and having it express our innermost thoughts, desires, aspirations. What is less obvious or less known to most Americans is the way in which their houses reflect major economic changes, government policy, technological advances and consumer culture.''
First, the setting. The National Building Museum lives in a brick palazzo-style monument that was built after the Civil War to do two things: house the United States Pension Bureau and hold events like inaugural balls. It's been the home of the museum since 1980, a place to tell stories about the built environment.
This being Washington, it is a monument with a capital M. It is mostly all atrium, a thunderously large interior with gargantuan Corinthian columns, a spectacular party space indeed (or an end-of-the-party space: Hillary Rodham Clinton delivered her concession speech here in 2008). The galleries live on the second floor, up wide and worn brick stairs (a gentle angle that was intended to accommodate Civil War soldiers on crutches). Having been walloped over the head with so much architecture, you have to recalibrate your eye to these more diminutive spaces, which at first feel underwhelming.
The show begins pictorially, with two gallery walls blanketed with images harvested from the American Memory Association, historical societies, the Historic American Buildings Survey, and the Flickr universe. If the traditional American house is a single-family unit, these photographs show that, in reality, we are perhaps more likely to be living in public housing, penitentiaries, military barracks, gated communities and, yes, mansions, herded there by government policies both beneficial and devastating. There's Graceland; a relocation center in California; the bungalows of the Rockaways; slave quarters on a Georgia plantation; a branded house by Martha Stewart for KB Homes; a West Virginia mining company's housing; and a Lustron house.
Nearby, in the center of this first gallery, dollhouses -- a stately, chockablock Victorian and a peppy modern dream house designed by an architect for Woman's Day magazine in 1976 -- are outfitted with the decorating totems of the day (an ermine rug in the former, and ethnic masks and low-slung orange sofas in the latter). They make the point that ideas about style and aspiration, and an appetite for shelter magazines, are planted early in life.
The huge collection of American stuff here -- cultural artifacts that are by turns curious, kitschy, useful, soulful or disposable -- suggests an eBay or flea-market bender. These specimens are organized thematically rather than chronologically, moving from the outside (a Baltimore painted screen door, a push lawn mower) in, and throughout the rooms of the house.
The curators have mostly let the objects speak for themselves, leaving you to fill in the gaps with your own memories. A wok is simply described as ''a Chinese cooking tool''; a George Foreman grill was manufactured in pink, ''presumably to appeal to a female shopper.'' If you're a certain age, you may recall the wok's ubiquity in the 1970s, when it was a kind of culinary ambassador whose arrival in American kitchens signaled the end of one sort of food culture, where ''foreign'' meant French, and the beginning of a multiethnic exploration that is continuing. Similarly, you might have heard Davia Nelson and Nikki Silva, otherwise known as the Kitchen Sisters of NPR, detail the Foreman grill's popularity with the homeless and others living on the margins of society, for whom the grill became a secret, or hidden, ''kitchen.''
That Farrah Fawcett poster from 1976, for years the favored wall decor in the bedrooms of heterosexual teenage boys, perhaps needs no dissertation, though the curators do note that 12 million posters have been sold to date. (The red bathing suit resides around the corner at the Smithsonian, donated last year by Ms. Fawcett's partner, Ryan O'Neal.) In a nod to gender parity, right next to the poster is a vibrator from the 1920s, a fearsome-looking device that resembles an electric drill.
Perhaps the most contemporary object in this blizzard of things is a compost pail, once a staple in farmhouses, which is increasingly showing up in suburban and urban kitchens, now a status symbol as potent as a Viking range.
In gallery after gallery, the show explores how the American dream of homeownership has played out over the years, in consumer artifacts like these and models of architectural milestones, culminating in a double-screen immersion into architect-designed spaces.
Six short films depict daily life inside six examples of terrific contemporary architecture: a FlatPak prefab house in New York; a 6,500-square-foot concrete-and-steel luxury showplace in Arizona; an 84-square-foot ''tiny house'' in a Washington State backyard; a dormitory in the round at the Maryland Institute College of Art; a duplex in New Orleans; and, in Los Angeles, social housing for formerly homeless and disabled men.
Yes, the soundtrack recalls a New Age spa and the perky instructional films shown in middle school, and the inhabitants have the awkward postures of those trying to act natural in front of a camera, the presence of which is always felt. Yet the scenes are compelling and moving: Dee Williams carrying her dog down the ladder from the sleeping loft in her Tumbleweed Tiny House; Rodney White and Tom Brown enacting the quotidian rituals of couples everywhere in their Dwell-worthy FlatPak. Collectively, the films make the point that good architecture is a luxury, and the (mostly white) consumers of it are lucky indeed. It is telling that the one black face is that of James Sinclair, formerly homeless but now a resident of the New Carver Apartments, new communal housing in Los Angeles.
The American dream was never available to every American, not really. Who gets to live where, and under what circumstances, is the solemn backbeat of the exhibition, explicitly traced in an illustrated timeline in the penultimate gallery, which notes government and civic interventions and restrictions that have helped and hindered homeownership, like the enduring racism that kept mortgages and entire communities off-limits to black Americans. ''No man who owns his own house and lot can be a communist,'' William Levitt said. But no black man could own a Levittown house.
The timeline ends in 2008. No mention is made of the securitizing of mortgage derivatives, but there is a photograph of the Foreclosure Express, a free shuttle for prospective buyers that toured the foreclosure-pocked neighborhoods of Las Vegas, hunting for bargains.
''House & Home'' is at the National Building Museum until May 1, 2017; information: nbm.org.

HEADLINE: A Close Look at ExxonMobil And Corporate Responsibility

BYLINE: By JOHN WILLIAMS

 BODY:
In his new book, ''Private Empire,'' Steve Coll offers an expansive portrait of Exxon Mobil: its leaders, operations, global entanglements, environmental impact and relationship to the United States government. In a recent interview via e-mail, Mr. Coll discussed the company's access to various presidents, the future of energy consumption and more. Below are excerpts from the conversation.
Q.
Dwight Garner called the book, ''perhaps surprisingly,'' ''impartial.'' Did you feel sympathetic toward Exxon Mobil as you researched? 
A.
I try to think of my goal as a reporter more as empathy than sympathy. I want to understand and describe how the world looks to any of my subjects, why they act as they do. The aggregation of empathy is, I suppose, a form of impartiality.
Q.
Was the company's access to the government under George W. Bush and Dick Cheney drastically different from other administrations?
A.
The executives and lobbyists I interviewed said they had as much access to the Clinton administration as they did to the Bush administration. They found the Obama administration tougher going overall, especially early on.
Q.
If anything, it seems after reading the book that Exxon is in the driver's seat with the government, and that it would be misleading to think of any given administration being more ''friendly'' to the company. Is that an accurate impression?
A.
I'd say Exxon Mobil and the U.S. are kind of parallel governments - sometimes in alliance, sometimes in opposition, and often just trying to keep their distance from one another. That is true across presidencies.
Q.
This is a huge subject, and a big book. How did you choose a structure for it, and how did that guide your research?
A.
Initially I conceived of a more general narrative of oil and American power in recent years, something of an updated version of Daniel Yergin's ''The Prize,'' but one set in an era of limits and opposition for Big Oil. After six or more months of research, I decided to choose a single company to tell the larger story. Exxon Mobil seemed the only logical choice for American readers. Its size, power and footprint around the world also appealed. I then started to work on a structure that would move forward chronologically from the late 1990s, but also cut back and forth among settings. I had in mind those international thrillers - the movies where a plane is landing and a subtitle comes up, ''Tehran'' or ''Abuja,'' and then the next scene is at the White House. The last piece of the structure fell into place when the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill took place in 2010. That event made me think I should bookend the narrative with twin oil spills - opening with the Exxon Valdez wreck, in 1989, and closing, more or less, with the Deepwater Horizon.
Q.
Lee Raymond, the former C.E.O., claimed that Exxon Mobil didn't want the government's help; it just wanted government to stay out of the way. You say he was ''kidding himself'' when he said that. What's the most striking way in which the company benefits from the government?
A.
It calls in help from the White House when it needs it; it stands apart at other times. The Bush administration's attempt to open up Russia's oil industry, and the way Exxon Mobil slipped into that very high-level diplomatic project, was one example. On another occasion, Cheney intervened to help Exxon Mobil win a major oil deal over Royal Dutch Shell in the United Arab Emirates. That is what Exxon Mobil wants from the American government - decisive help in a pinch, but only when the corporation requests it, and on its terms.
Q.
You write that Exxon is ''both part of the problem and part of the solution'' in some of the countries where it operates. What do you mean by that, and how do you think it could move that balance more toward solution?
A.
Because of changes in the global oil economy since the 1970s, Exxon Mobil has been driven into weak and unstable states - in West Africa, for example. Its power in these states is especially outsize because of the checks it writes to poor, corrupt, dictatorial governments, and also because of the prize that its oil and gas fields offers to contending guerrillas and coup-makers. So, not so much because it has ''Exxon Mobil'' written on the door, but because of this geopolitical structure, the corporation is often a more destabilizing or retarding force in poor countries than its executives are willing to acknowledge. The question is, what are Exxon Mobil's responsibilities, then, as a corporation? Sure, its operations lift up a relatively small number of people through employment and education. But what more is it reasonable to expect it to do as a corporate citizen? It's gotten somewhat better in corporate responsibility, and its record on environmental standards is relatively strong, but overall it remains behind the curve - its decisions and policies in Africa, for example, are more shaped by engineers, finance men and lawyers than by creative thinkers or business visionaries.
Q.
The company came out in support of a carbon tax, partly because it didn't want cap-and-trade restrictions. How much is the carbon tax support - and the company's environmental gestures more generally - just a public relations move?
A.
You'll hear different opinions about that. Their record in the main is that they mean what they say. They took what I would judge to be a radical stance of campaigning against mainstream climate science during the late 1990s and the first Bush term. Then they shifted - after doing a good deal of damage, in my judgment. Their support for a carbon tax is now on record, and I'd be surprised if they reversed it.
Q.
Even Exxon Mobil acknowledges that oil is a finite resource. But the book makes clear that global demand is only going to escalate, and that alternative energies as we currently know them are not going to meet that demand. So is it just completely impossible to imagine what the world of energy consumption will look like, say, 200 years from now?
A.
Two hundred years is a long time, even in the slow-changing world energy system. I don't think we'll be burning fossil fuels with abandon in 200 years - assuming we don't set ourselves way backward economically by having a nuclear war or some such cataclysm. An era of renewable, sustainable energy systems is surely coming. You can argue over whether the turning point will be within 30 to 50 years or more like a hundred years. But something is going to have to give before 2200. It would be fun to come back and see what that something is.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Britain's Biggest Satellite Broadcaster Distances Itself From Murdoch

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL and AMY CHOZICK; Sarah Lyall reported from London, and Amy Chozick from New York. Julia Werdigier contributed reporting from London, and Alan Cowell from Paris.

 BODY:
LONDON -- Britain's biggest satellite broadcaster, British Sky Broadcasting, or BSkyB, distanced itself on Wednesday from its largest shareholder, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, in a sign of the difficulties Mr. Murdoch faces here following a scathing parliamentary report that declared him not fit to run a global media empire.
''I would emphasize that it's important to remember that Sky and News Corporation are separate companies,'' Jeremy Darroch, BSkyB's chief executive, told reporters. ''We believe that Sky's track record as a broadcaster is the most important factor in determining our fitness to hold a license.'' 
The report, released Tuesday by the House of Commons's Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, was highly critical both of Mr. Murdoch's overall governance and of the behavior of several high-ranking employees in his British newspaper arm, News International, in the phone hacking scandal that erupted here last summer.
While its message was diluted by partisan discord -- the panel's minority Conservatives refused to endorse the characterization of Mr. Murdoch as not fit, while its Labour members and a lone Liberal Democrat voted to include the language -- it nonetheless provided a searing indictment of News Corporation that added to the raft of legal and corporate troubles the company faces here.
In New York on Wednesday, News Corporation's board of directors met to discuss the committee report and the latest developments in Britain. In a statement, the board expressed its ''full confidence in Rupert Murdoch's fitness and support for his continuing to lead News Corporation,'' praising Mr. Murdoch's ''vision and leadership in building News Corporation'' and his performance as chairman and chief executive.
But in Britain, the company's problems are far from over. A judicial investigation into media practices, the Leveson Inquiry, has unearthed endless examples of dubious and unethical behavior from Britain's tabloid newspapers, especially The News of the World, the now-defunct Murdoch-owned paper at the center of the scandal. The panel is continuing to amass evidence and is expected to make its initial report in the fall.
At the same time, about 40 people -- including police officers and editors and reporters at The News of the World and at The Sun, another Murdoch tabloid -- have been arrested in a widening criminal investigation into phone hacking, e-mail hacking, bribing public officials and tampering with evidence. None have yet been charged, though prosecutors say that they are beginning to consider what charges they might bring against some of the suspects.
Those arrested include two former editors of The News of the World -- Andy Coulson, whose most recent job was communications director for Prime Minister David Cameron; and Rebekah Brooks, a favorite of Mr. Murdoch, whose most recent job was chief executive of News International.
The company has paid out millions of pounds in legal fees and damages to dozens of celebrities, politicians, sports stars and other public figures who say their phones were hacked by reporters and investigators from The News of the World. But it faces new lawsuits from numerous other potential litigants.
The BSkyB investigation is worrying for a different reason. In a politically charged atmosphere, the British broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, is assessing whether News Corporation should be allowed to continue to hold its stake in BSkyB. If it is declared not ''fit and proper,'' News Corporation could be forced to sell its stake.
News Corporation owns 39.1 percent of BSkyB, and Mr. Darroch's remarks were an effort to establish that all the drama around News International and Mr. Murdoch has not affected BSkyB's performance. In a statement, BSkyB said: ''The company is engaging with Ofcom in the process and continues to believe that it remains a fit and proper license holder, as demonstrated by its positive contribution to U.K. audiences, employment and the broader economy, as well as its strong record of regulatory compliance and high standards of governance.''
Less than a year ago, the company was negotiating a $12 billion deal that would have allowed it to take over all of BSkyB. The effort was hastily abandoned in the midst of the phone hacking furor. The move was a blow to the company, which had been counting on the sale to expand its European television holdings.
Some analysts in Britain said they thought that it was, on balance, unlikely that Ofcom would rescind News Corporation's license. It has done that only once before, in the case of a company that had repeatedly breached the terms of its license and was broadcasting pornography.
''The report is an ad hominem attack'' against Mr. Murdoch, said Adrian Monck, a journalism professor at City University London. ''It doesn't go to the top of governance of the company. They haven't connected the board and Rupert Murdoch with criminal misconduct; he is not going to face criminal proceedings, and nor are any of his current directors. I don't think there's enough here for Ofcom to come against them.''
In addition to the phone hacking and related accusations, Mr. Murdoch is facing more traditional kinds of trouble with his newspapers in Britain. Circulation at The Sun on Sunday, a new tabloid meant to replace The News of the World, has fallen since Mr. Murdoch introduced it in February, and the Murdoch brand has been possibly irreparably tarnished here.
If News Corporation tries to resurrect its bid to buy the rest of BSkyB, as many analysts believe it will, it would most likely be pressed to spin off the money-losing British newspaper business as a way to overcome regulations against concentration in media ownership.
''Investors see the British newspapers as anachronistic and troublesome,'' said Lorna Tilbian, executive director and the head of media research at Numis Securities.
In the United States, several shareholder groups, including the California State Teachers Retirement System, called for the News Corporation's board to become more independent. The board includes Mr. Murdoch's sons, James and Lachlan, and the chairman of its corporate governance committee, Viet D. Dinh, is godfather to one of Lachlan Murdoch's sons.
''Effective board leadership is even more important to provide proper oversight to the company and management,'' said Anne Sheehan, the retirement system's director of corporate governance.

An article on Tuesday about President Obama's decision to use a speech on Monday to gently prod China to improve its human rights record, but not to discuss the case of a prominent Chinese dissident lawyer said to be under American protection in Beijing, misstated the name of the high-level talks between the countries that are set to begin there today. And an article on Wednesday about limited military talks gave another incorrect rendering of the name of the broader talks. Those high-level talks are the Strategic and Economic Dialogue -- not the Strategic Economic Dialogue or the Strategic and Security Dialogue.

HEADLINE: Contradictions Temper Optimism in Deal on Chinese Lawyer

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

 BODY:
Did Chen Guangcheng, the blind self-taught lawyer who spent the past six days holed up in the American Embassy in Beijing, make China's leaders blink? Or will American diplomats come to regret the agreement they helped negotiate on his behalf?
In the hours after he left the embassy on Wednesday with a deal that American officials said included security guarantees for him and his family, there were competing narratives among Chinese rights advocates and elected officials in Washington over whether the arrangement, negotiated by Beijing and Washington, represented an unalloyed victory for Mr. Chen or an expedient and foolhardy concession to China's authoritarian government.
And Mr. Chen himself seemed to be developing second thoughts about whether he could trust Chinese assurances that he and his family would remain safe inside China.
American diplomats and friends of Mr. Chen say that because he was not seeking political asylum in the United States but wanted to stay in China to continue his legal advocacy work, the agreement was the best denouement for a tense diplomatic drama that threatened to upstage a set of meetings this week, the United States-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, and bruise a relationship increasingly vital to both sides. 
''I am pleased that we were able to facilitate Chen Guangcheng's stay and departure from the U.S. Embassy in a way that reflected his choices and our values,'' Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a statement after speaking to Mr. Chen by phone as he was transported to a Beijing hospital for medical treatment.
But that optimism, initially shared by a number of human rights advocates both in China and abroad, began to fray later in the day after Mr. Chen began telling friends and foreign news outlets that he had changed his mind and was now seeking to leave China with his family.
Mr. Chen on Wednesday night told supporters that he had accepted the deal only after Chinese officials threatened his wife. That account, while denied by American officials, could turn what had at first appeared to be a diplomatic triumph for the United States into a darker, more ambiguous tale.
Teng Biao, a lawyer who has provided legal help to Mr. Chen in the past, said Mr. Chen changed his mind after arriving at the hospital and talking to his wife and supporters. Speaking by phone from the hospital on Wednesday, Mr. Teng said that Mr. Chen grew especially concerned by the sight of so many plain-clothed police officers and by the realization that American officials had left the hospital for the evening. ''The Chinese government has a habit of failing to keep their promises,'' said Mr. Teng, who said he warned Mr. Chen of the potential risks if he stayed in China.
In an interview Thursday morning, Mr. Chen said he was swayed in large part by his wife, who told him how the police had tied her to a chair for two days after he fled and moved into his home. ''They even tried to install an electric fence outside my house,'' he said. ''The police essentially moved into my house. They are in my yard and on the rooftop every single day. They eat and sleep there.''
Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong, said his initial elation sagged after he participated in a conference call with State Department officials who were trying to explain the deal to American rights groups. His biggest concern, he said, was that Foreign Ministry officials, not the top Chinese leaders, had provided the assurances for Mr. Chen's protection. Such guarantees, he said, might not be enough to prevent more powerful, and vengeful, officials in public security ministries from subverting the deal. ''The Foreign Ministry is low on the food chain in China,'' he said. ''It would take considerable political authority to guarantee Chen Guangcheng's safety in China.''
Renee Xia, international director of Chinese Human Rights Defenders, said the Obama administration was naive for accepting Beijing's assurances that it would give Mr. Chen the freedom to continue his work -- and his criticism of China's failure to carry out long-stalled legal overhauls.
''The Chinese promise of Chen's safety and freedom is unenforceable,'' she said. ''The government has no credibility -- the record speaks volumes to the contrary -- and I think this agreement will come back to haunt the Obama administration.''
Bob Fu, president of China Aid, a Christian advocacy group in Texas, said he was worried that Mr. Chen had been pressured by both sides to agree to a deal before the start of the meetings, which begin Thursday. ''I was a little surprised that he accepted the offer so quickly,'' said Mr. Fu, an exiled Chinese dissident who wields considerable influence in Washington. ''I don't think he's in a normal state of mind after seven years of trauma and these six roller-coaster days.''
But many human rights advocates said Beijing's agreement to even discuss the terms of Mr. Chen's release was significant, given that Communist Party leaders are loath to accede to pressure from foreign governments or individual dissidents. They noted that although Mr. Chen's extralegal detention was carried out by provincial officials in Shandong, Politburo members were fully aware of his predicament and could have intervened.
They added that Mr. Chen's case has been raised by numerous diplomats over the years, including Mrs. Clinton, and it was public security agents in Beijing who had abducted him and his family from the capital in 2006. After they were returned to Shandong more than 300 miles to away, Mr. Chen was tried and then sentenced to more than four years in prison on charges that Chinese legal scholars called spurious.
Jerome Cohen, an expert on Chinese law at New York University, acknowledged that the road ahead would be bumpy, but said the deal was significant because it freed Mr. Chen from the local authorities responsible for his continued persecution. Mr. Cohen said he thought it was unlikely that the Chinese side would renege on its word because the consequences to relations with the United States could be enormous.
''There still needs to be flesh put on these bare bones, but it could be new way forward for human rights lawyers,'' said Mr. Cohen, a longtime champion of Mr. Chen who helped provide him with a custom-made laptop for the visually impaired that was later confiscated by public security agents. ''The question is how much support will he get from the U.S. government and from the Chinese government, because they do have an interest in making this work.''
In the end, advocates say, Mr. Chen played his hand well by gaining entry to the American Embassy, but also by recording a video, posted on the Internet last week, that pleaded with the central government to intervene on his behalf. The video, in the form of an appeal to Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, blamed only local officials for his persecution and for wantonly trampling on Chinese law.
That gambit, analysts say, provided Beijing an opportunity to come off looking righteous.
Many rights campaigners on Wednesday said they were still amazed that the deal, as presented by American officials, provided so much of what Mr. Chen was seeking. The potential political costs to China's top leaders, they said, were not insignificant.
Despite his criticisms, Mr. Bequelin of Human Rights Watch said the deal if it holds up has the potential to change the way the authorities handle nettlesome dissidents. ''I'm astonished that Beijing bowed to the demands of Chen Guangcheng in such a public manner,'' Mr. Bequelin said. ''The key question is whether the Chinese government can be trusted to keep its promise over the long term. But still, for now, they're handing a significant victory to activists and to one of the most respected activists in China.''

HEADLINE: 'GenTX' Wants Texans to Wear College T-Shirts on Friday

BYLINE: LILY ALTAVENA


HIGHLIGHT: On Friday, students all over the Lone Star State will be wearing T-shirts from their favorite universities to increase awareness about college attendance. 

 BODY:
Calling all Texans with college apparel: Friday is Generation TX Day, or "GenTX," as the event's organizers call it. Students all over the Lone Star State will be wearing T-shirts from their favorite universities to increase awareness about college attendance.
By 2030, "nearly 60 percent of all Texans will have only a high school diploma or less," a 2005 study from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics predicted.
GenTX is part of a statewide initiative with the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board to encourage an entire generation of Texans to attend two- or four-year colleges. The movement is financed by a grant from the United States Department of Education. 
"It is an innovative approach to creating a sustainable movement in communities across Texas to support our students - especially first-generation and economically disadvantaged students - in pursuing post-secondary education, including career and technical certifications, two-year and four-year degrees," said Raymund A. Paredes, the state's commissioner of higher education.
Parents may sometimes struggle with giving college admissions advice to their child, especially if the student would be the first in her generation to go to college. The Generation TX Web site, while encouraging students to enroll, also offers resources to students about how to apply to and pay for college.
Vince Young, the former University of Texas star and N.F.L. quarterback, a free agent seeking a job with a new team, is also cheering for the GenTX movement. In a promotional video, clad in a yellow GenTX T-shirt, Young -- who left college early to turn pro -- said he was looking forward to graduating in a year. It would bring a "huge smile to my face," he said, "to walk across the stage in May, throw my hat, to wear my gown, to get my degree in one of the biggest graduations of all-time."
He encouraged students to work hard so that they could go to college, too.
"I challenge you to take dead aim at all these opportunities that you have," he said in the video. "It's a bigger picture when you finish. And you'll be happy, and you'll make your family and your parents happy. And me, I'll definitely be happy for you."

HEADLINE: Nielsen Reports a Decline in Television Viewing

BYLINE: BRIAN STELTER


HIGHLIGHT: Some people are spending more time playing video games and watching Web video -- though television still retains the lion's share of free time. 

 BODY:
10:45 a.m. | Updated 
The number of American households with access to a television set and a TV signal is shrinking for the second year in a row.
The data, released by The Nielsen Company on Thursday morning, is sure to be pored over by television and Internet executives for evidence of changes in consumer behavior.
While the vast majority of American homes still have functioning television sets, more than one million no longer meet Nielsen's definition of a "TV household:" those that have at least one television set and a cable, satellite or antenna connection. 
Last year, for the first time in 20 years, Nielsen said the number of such households had dropped to 114.7 million, from 115.9 million previously, despite a rise in the number of households in the country. On Thursday, Nielsen said the figure had dropped further, this time to 114.1 million. 
The company, which monitors a sample of United States households to produce TV ratings every day, also estimated that the total number of people living in those homes has shrunk, but at a lesser rate -- to 289.2 million, down 100,000 from 289.3 million last year. Nielsen attributes the drops both to economic factors and to technological ones. 
Not surprisingly, given the lower number of households with TV sets, the total number of Americans who watched any traditional TV in a given month also declined during the last three months of 2011, according to Nielsen: 284.4 million, down about 1.7 percent from 289.3 million during the same time period in 2010.
To the astonishment of some in the industry, total TV viewing has been on the rise in the U.S. for years, despite a plethora of other entertainment options. But new Nielsen data, also released on Thursday, showed an unusual dip in TV viewing in the last three months of 2011. At the same time, some people are spending more time playing video games and watching Web video -- though TV still retains the lion's share of people's free time.
In the last three months of 2011, the average American with a TV set at home spent 153 hours and 19 minutes watching "traditional TV" -- TV viewed on a set rather than a computer or a tablet. That total is about 46 minutes less than was watched in the last three months of 2010, or a decline of 0.5 percent. 
Per person, the decline comes out to be about 30 seconds a day, hardly a seismic shift. But it is likely to be scrutinized by researchers nonetheless because previous surveys in the first nine months of 2011 showed that the average time spent watching TV each month was up versus the same period in 2010.
Nielsen also reported quarterly declines in year-over-year television viewership once in 2009 and once in 2010, but those declines were not as pronounced as the ones at the end of 2011 were.
In a report to its television industry clients, Nielsen wrote of the viewership decline: "This may be the result of leveling off after a period of sustained growth, weather and economic factors or of other viewing options."
Nielsen defines traditional TV as consumption through a television set, either live or via a digital video recorder or video-on-demand service. The company does not count consumption on computers, phones or tablets like the iPad. That may explain, in part, why the total number of viewers slipped late last year. They may still be watching TV, even on TV sets, but not through cable or antenna connections. Nielsen has said in the past that it is assessing whether to define "TV household" to include these viewers. 
The headline of Nielsen's report on Thursday called Americans "voracious video viewers."
"The average American watches nearly five hours of video each day, 98 percent of which they watch on a traditional TV set," the report states. "Although this ratio is less than it was just a few years ago, and continues to change, the fact remains that Americans are not turning off. They are shifting to new technologies and devices that make it easier for them to watch the content they want whenever and wherever is most convenient for them. As such, the definition of the traditional TV home will evolve."

HEADLINE: Spending Big Money on an 'Infinite Scream of Nature'

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: "The Scream" set a record for an artwork sold at auction Wednesday. Inevitably, some will be appalled that so much money was spent on art, no matter how celebrated. 

 BODY:
Nearly a full century ago, in December 1912, an exhibition of Scandinavian artists came to New York. An article in this newspaper heralding the arrival noted in a headline that "the strong list of painters" included the likes of "Zorn, Fjaestad, Anna Boberg, Bruno Liljefors, Larsson and others."
Philistine that I am, I confess to being unfamiliar with Zorn, Fjaestad et al. But deep in the article, a name popped up that did ring a bell. It belonged to a Norwegian fellow, Edvard Munch. He was one of the "others," although even then he surely deserved to be up there with the rest. After all, as the Times writer observed, "he is the Strindberg of painting and the most individual artist in the exhibition."
With considerably more clat - certainly with his own headline - Munch was back in town Wednesday night, represented by an 1895 version of "The Scream," one of the most famous works that he or any other person holding a brush ever produced. If you've never seen a tacky facsimile of it, there's a chance that you have also never seen a coffee mug, a T-shirt or a Macaulay Culkin poster (which is not the worst thing that could be said about anyone).
Munch, who died in 1944 at 80, said that the idea for "The Scream," literally the picture of torment and dread, came to him while walking at sunset with friends. He lagged behind them "shivering with fear," he wrote, and "then I heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature."
That was some shriek. It is now worth $119.9 million.
That's what it went for at Sotheby's on Wednesday night, setting a record for an artwork sold at auction and eclipsing the $106.5 million that Picasso's "Nude, Green Leaves and Bust" drew at Christie's two years ago. The unidentified winner among five bidders had been on the phone. Presumably, a person able to part with that kind of money doesn't spend a lot of time wallowing in Munchian angst.
In one sense, an auction like this is hard to distinguish from, say, the Kentucky Derby, coming up on Saturday. Both events, for many people, are less about art and sport than about winning or losing big dollars.
Before Wednesday night's sale, oddsmakers were making book on what "The Scream" would fetch. Ladbrokes, the British bookmaking outfit, made it 3 to 1 that the price would exceed $150 million, and 3 to 2 that it would at a minimum beat the Picasso. Side bets were possible on the buyer's nationality. The longest odds were on an American. That may give you an idea of what some people beyond our borders think of our economic condition.
Inevitably, some will be appalled that so much money was spent on a piece of art, no matter how celebrated. Could it really be worth what it would cost to hire a few thousand teachers, police officers and firefighters?
Of course, the same could be asked about many other endeavors. Is a man who swings a stick at a ball truly worth $275 million, which is whatAlex Rodriguez was assured (potential bonuses not included) in his deal with the Yankees? Is any meal worth $585 a head, which is what Zagat's says the tab can run at Masa? Was Newt Gingrich worth the $20 million that the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, poured into ahapless presidential campaign? 
At least if you own "The Scream," you have something that is bound to last, unless someone steals it, which is what has twice happened with other versions of the painting. They were later recovered.
You have to give Munch this: He put his soul into his work. This was no happy camper. "From the moment of my birth, the angels of anxiety, worry and death stood at my side," he said.
The closest he may have come to optimism was an observation that, after his death, "from my rotting body, flowers shall grow, and I am in them, and that is eternity."
The imagery may not be the loveliest. But being in flowers for eternity sounds even better than selling for nearly $120 million. Besides, it's something all of us can aspire to.

HEADLINE: My Mom Was My Roommate

BYLINE: GISSELLE PEREZ


HIGHLIGHT: At 24 years old, sleeping alone for the first time. 

 BODY:
The last time I slept alone, it was in a crib. Ever since then, I shared a bed with my mother. And this was in Washington Heights, a Manhattan neighborhood known for its relatively affordable and spacious apartments. 
I guess our place, with its four bedrooms, is considered big by many standards. But with only one bathroom, it definitely wasn't meant for eight people.
There's my mother, 61, and my father, 82, and my Uncle Ramon, who has lived with us since he got his green card back in January 2000. Then there are the twins, Elaine and Rosemary, my 30-year-old sisters. And last year my 27-year-old sister, Vanessa, was laid off from her job in Virginia Beach and wound up moving back home with her 3-year-old daughter. She is pregnant, due this August. We're like the Dominican Kardashians, with all of the drama, but none of the wealth. 
According to 2011 census data, 10 percent of women (and 19 percent of men) age 25 to 34 live in their parents' homes. I'm 24, and for women in my age bracket the figure is 50 percent - though that includes college students living in dorms, something that wasn't an affordable option for me. Demographers say that the trend is rising - that it started going up before the recession, and has only continued since. 
But I don't feel like part of a new trend. It just seems normal to me. Since the age of 13, I have been waking up early to prepare breakfast for my family, anything from farina - basically Cream of Wheat - to eggs, bacon and mangu, a plantain mash. My father never went to school and my mother only went to third grade, so reading and translating were also my responsibility. I wore hand-me-down clothes from my sisters. There were times we slept on the couch because there weren't enough mattresses. Our lives were based on traditional values about the importance of family, values many of our neighbors shared. I love my parents, but it was hard taking care of them when I was still a child myself. I got really stressed and cried at times. 
Later, it was hard to date, because I didn't want to bring a guy to my house where he could see how crowded it was. Most of all, I didn't want anyone to find out that I had to share a bed with my mother. Because she was a noisy and restless sleeper, my father refused to share a bed or even a room with her. He had his own room, and so did my uncle. Since I was the youngest girl, I had to bunk with my mother, while my sisters shared the last room. It meant that, even at 3 a.m., when everyone was asleep, I still didn't have any privacy. 
In the last few years, I've been taking night classes, which means I have some quiet time at home during the day and also that I can take a long shower in the afternoon, instead of fighting everyone for bathroom time in the morning. But a few months ago, I found out that our apartment was going to get even more crowded. Uncle Ramon's wife and his five adult children, who all have kids of their own, have always lived in the Dominican Republic. In October he was finally able to get visas for them. We were their only immediate relatives in the United States, which meant they were going to move into our overcrowded apartment. With 13 new people arriving, our apartment would soon look like an urban soup kitchen, like a clown car where people just keep popping out. 
Just when I was about to reach my breaking point, my mother came to me with the news that Uncle Ramon's family wasn't moving in after all, that they'd found a place in New Jersey. Even more surprising: my uncle was moving there with them. Suddenly, for the first time ever, there was a vacant room in our apartment. I was sure my sisters and I were going to fight for the available space, and that it would probably go to Vanessa, her daughter and the new baby. But Elaine, who has always been a thoughtful sister, convinced my mother to give it to me, saying it was finally time for me to have my own space. Everyone else agreed. 
I immediately decided to mark my territory. I painted one wall pink and the rest a pale silver to make the room look bigger. I bought a television and a new mattress, all my own. But my first night in the new room, I kept waking up every hour, nervous and sweating. After all this time, I didn't know how to sleep without my mother! It felt like I was going through withdrawal. 
It took a month before I could sleep the full night, but now that I'm used to it, I feel like I'll never be able to share a bed with someone else again. When I graduate this month, I'll be the first person in my family with a four-year college degree. I'm trying to line up a full-time job, and I have already started applying for apartments in Chelsea, Hell's Kitchen and the Bronx - anywhere but Washington Heights. Until then, every night in my own bed, I find peace, stretching my arms and legs out as far as I like.

HEADLINE: More Teenagers Use 'Highly Effective Contraception'

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: Along with a decrease in pregnancies among teenagers, the C.D.C. has found that more teenagers report using "highly effective" methods of birth control. 

 BODY:
Teen pregnancy rates are at a 30-year-low (and births to teenage mothers are down as well, to 3.4 births per 1,000 girls 15 to 19 years old in 2010, the lowest rate since the government began keeping track in 1940). Today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released numbers offering one possible reason for those positive trends: more sexually experienced teenagers reported current use of highly effective contraceptive methods (intrauterine device, implant, pill, patch, ring or injectable contraceptive).
Approximately 60 percent of teenagers between 15 and 19 years old said they used the "highly effective methods" in the National Survey of Family Growth - an increase from 47 percent in 1995.
When reporting the decreased birth rates to teenagers, the Economix blog noted the variance from state to state, and many readers observed that the map bore a striking resemblance to maps reflecting different sex education practices and the availability of various family planning services. With respect to the availability and use of birth control, graphic data was a little harder to come by, but in the five states where teenagers were most likely to report the use of birth control pills when they last had sex (New Hampshire, Maine, Wisconsin, Montana and Alaska), birth rates to teenagers were around, or in three cases below, the national average.
Those states are also among the states with the least restrictions surrounding teenagers obtaining birth control without a parent's permission. Of the five states with the highest rates of pregnancy among teenagers, three (Texas, Oklahoma and Mississippi) restrict the ability of a minor to access contraceptive health care, and four (those three, plus Arkansas) stress abstinencein their sexual education programs. Conclusive? Far from it. But these numbers should give policy-makers in states with high teenage pregnancy rates something more to think about.

HEADLINE: Stockholm Syndrome in the Pimp-Victim Relationship

BYLINE: NATALIE KITROEFF


HIGHLIGHT: To understand why women don't run away from abusive pimps, listen to T, who was first sex-trafficked at age 10. 

 BODY:
If you want to understand why girls who are sex-trafficked don't run straight to the police, Withelma Ortiz, known as T, could tell you a thing or two. The 22-year-old has a pretty good grasp on the issue - having been first sold for sex at age 10.
T was 10 years old when she met a man who said he could change her life. She had told him that she'd essentially been in foster care since birth, living with families that sexually and psychologically abused her. He was appalled. He said he wanted to take care of her. He would feed her, clothe her, take care of her when she was sick. "He basically told me that I could survive," T recalled. "You know, when nobody cared what happened to me, nobody cared what was going on with me, I could survive." T's biological father was in jail, and her biological mother was nowhere to be found. She was not about to turn down the first person who ever tried to make that kind of connection with her.
In a way, the man was right: He did change her life. He began selling T for sex across the West Coast. It turned out that her youthful "tween" body was a major selling point, and he demanded that she meet a quota of a thousand dollars a night. "The chains around the mind, the captivity of the mind, it started there," she said. "But it got to a place in which my physical life was threatened." Her pimp would beat her mercilessly - but then would beg for her forgiveness. This was unusual for T. She was used to caretakers beating her, but no one had ever been sorry for it. "Somebody finally beats the crap out of you and then comes back and kisses it and says, 'I want to make it better.' " To a 10-year-old T, this was love.

After five years of this abuse, her pimp was arrested on sex-trafficking charges. But it took T years to realize that he could no longer hurt her. And when he was put on trial, she refused to testify against him. She regrets that decision deeply, but is very clear about why she made it: "One word," she told me bluntly. "Stockholm syndrome."
The psychological manipulation involved in T's relationship with her pimp seems to be a common feature of sexual exploitation in America. Pimps prey on vulnerable girls and women, using a cunning mix of violence and tenderness to alternately degrade and then elevate them. The result is that these girls and women become psychologically attached to their pimps, and do not turn against them out of a dependency that is equal parts fear and misplaced affection.
This dynamic was on full display in a historic sex-trafficking indictment by the Manhattan district attorney's office.
Several years ago, public prosecutors in New York City began to notice that women the police were arresting for prostitution had a few things in common. They all came from Allentown, Pa., they all had similar business cards, and, curiously, matching tattoos. The name King Koby was inked in different places on their bodies; one had it above a bar code on her neck, another next to a dollar sign on her pelvis.
The discovery set off a major investigation that culminated last week in the indictments of Vincent George Sr. and Vincent George Jr. - father and son - on sex-trafficking charges. The pair are accused of running a prostitution ring that garnered hundreds of thousands of dollars selling women for sex, women who in return were "given a few dollars a night to buy food and other necessities." It was George Jr. who branded the women with his street name, King Koby, but both father and son used other forms of psychological abuse to keep them in line.
But these women refused to testify against their exploiters. In fact, according to court documents, they refused to admit that they had pimps at all. District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. compared their reaction to that of domestic violence victims, saying in a press release, "These victims are often emotionally and economically dependent upon their abusers, and remain silent as their worlds grow smaller and more dangerous."
For girls and women who were raised in unsafe and unloving environments, this dependency runs particularly deep. If you've never really felt valued, it is even harder to speak out against perhaps the only person to ever show you love.
T's story has a happier ending. When I first met her in New York City, she gave me a bright pink business card. Just under her name in small print, it reads: "Advocate/Activist/Go-Getter." T is an ambitious woman with an undeniable will to survive, and those descriptors fit her perfectly. After seven years of being sold to men, she managed to escape that life, and even get her high school diploma.
Now her eyes are set on college. T's dream is to get a degree in mass communication, and perhaps even spend a semester studying abroad in Puerto Rico, where her father's family still lives. She has even started a campaign - T Goes to College 2013 - to raise funds to cover tuition.
When I asked her what she wanted to do after college, T said she would always continue her advocacy work for sex-trafficking victims and foster children. But she didn't want to commit to a career just yet. "I don't want to limit myself," she explained. And that, you can be sure, she won't.

HEADLINE: Lowered Expectations on the Jobs Report

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Optimism has been in shorter supply since the employment figures fell short of expectations a month ago. April's report is due Friday. 

 BODY:
What a difference one bad month - and one bad report - can make in expectations.
A month ago, after three strong jobs reports, the median forecast of economists polled by Bloomberg was for a gain of 205,000 jobs in March. The low estimate was for 175,000 jobs, only 30,000 less. 
At that point, there was widespread acceptance of the idea that economic recovery was firmly established. Genuine pessimism was hard to find.
The actual report said that only 120,000 jobs were created. 
Unsurprisingly, there is a lot less optimism now. The median forecast for the April number - to be reported Friday morning - is 160,000. But several expect a number at or below 125,000. The minimum forecast is 89,000.
Last month's jobs report, coupled with a disappointing report last week on first-quarter gross domestic product, brought back talk of a double-dip recession. That seems unlikely, particularly considering the fact that corporate profits for the first quarter seem to be coming in strong.
Of course, it is worth remembering that the official figure will be little more than a good guess. Last month's number will be revised, as it always is. It would be disturbing if the revision were down, given that recent revisions have been generally positive.
What may be needed for a strong recovery now is something that no one seems to expect: a revival in government jobs. Last month, there were 200,000 fewer government jobs than there had been a year earlier. The Bloomberg consensus is for a loss of another 5,000 government jobs in April.
In my Off the Charts column, which will go online Friday, I will look at the divergence in economic growth between the government and the private sectors. One number worth noting is that over the last two quarters, the private sector of the United States economy grew at an annual rate of 4 percent. If that were the number people focused on, there would be no talk about a slowdown.
But the government sector, over that same period, declined at an annual rate of 3.6 percent. That left the overall growth rate at a much less impressive figure of 2.6 percent.

TOP STORIES
Progress Seen in Advancing a Final Volcker Rule | A major new rule that has drawn the ire of Wall Street is on track for completion sooner than some bankers had expected, dashing the hopes of financial industry lobbyists, who have pressed for a delay.
Regulators are making significant progress on a final draft of the regulation, the Volcker Rule, and some officials expected to complete it by September and possibly as early as this summer, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, cautioned that regulators had not set a firm date for completing the rule.
The Volcker Rule aims to rein in risky trading on Wall Street. Named for Paul A. Volcker, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, it would bar banks from placing bets with their own money, a practice known as proprietary trading.
On Wednesday, the chief executives of six large banks voiced concerns about new regulations like the Volcker Rule at a meeting with Daniel K. Tarullo, a Federal Reserve governor. The gathering, held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in Lower Manhattan, was arranged by Mr. Tarullo and JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, who has criticized elements of the Volcker Rule.

Carlyle's I.P.O. Is Priced at $22, Below Expected Level | For years, the Carlyle Group had sought to follow its private equity rivals in stepping out as a publicly traded firm, a status that once promised wealth and prestige.

Carlyle priced its initial public offering at $22 a stock unit on Wednesday evening, below its expected range of $23 to $25. That price will value the firm at about $6.7 billion when it begins trading on Thursday on the Nasdaq stock market, under the ticker symbol CG. DealBook

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Hazards

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
The story ofRichard Grenell's departure from Mitt Romney's campaign after just weeks as foreign policy spokesman demonstrates the campaign's struggle to placate Republican conservatives and spot potential hazards in the appointment of high-profile aides, Michael Barbaro, Ashley Parker and Helene Cooper write. Mr. Grenell, who is gay and supports same-sex marriage, left the campaign on Tuesday amid protests from the religious right over his appointment.
For all but one of the former 2012 Republican presidential candidates, an opportunity to heighten their profiles has instead left them in debt and struggling to hold on to what political capital they have left, a reminder of the risk politicians take to run for the nation's highest office, Katharine Q. Seelye writes. While Rick Santorum seems to be the only former candidate to emerge with brighter prospects, others like Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota are running for re-election with damaged reputations. And though some of them are expected to endorse Mitt Romney, the presumptive nominee, none of them appear to be enthusiastic about him.
On national security policy, President Obama has married the hawk and dove approaches that have defined the strategies of Republicans and Democrats for decades, Peter Baker writes. The feat has annoyed the president's base and critics for different reasons but it has lifted Mr. Obama's appeal -- though not that of Democrats in general -- among a broad cross-section of voters who are sick of war but still want the United States to look strong.
Eric Lichtblau reports that the major cellphone companies are coming under Congressional scrutiny for helping local police departments conduct surveillance on cellphone users, often without a warrant, after The Times detailed the widespread practice in an April 1 article. The top Democrat on a Congressional privacy panel has asked the carriers to turn over information related to the police departments' requests, seeking information on the legal and policy implications of cellphone surveillance and the financial relationship between police departments and phone carriers.
Around the Web:
Donors could soon be able to give up to $50 to political campaigns just by sending a text message if the Federal Election Commission responds favorably to a petition by two consulting firms, according to The Washington Post.
Mitt Romney is trying to portray himself as someone who unites America on all economic levels, while casting President Obama as a divider, The Wall Street Journal notes.
Happening in Washington:
Economic reports scheduled to be released Thursday include quarterly productivity data and weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., followed at 10 by weekly mortgage rates and the monthly service sector index.
President Obama's day includes lunch with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., followed by a meeting with his senior advisers. In the evening, the president will speak at a Cinco de Mayo reception in the Rose Garden.
Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and John Morton, the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, will speak at an anticounterfeiting conference.

HEADLINE: A Tight Race in Swing States

BYLINE: ALLISON KOPICKI


HIGHLIGHT: The latest Quinnipiac University poll shows that President Obama and Mitt Romney are essentially tied in Florida and Ohio, while the president leads in Pennsylvania. 

 BODY:
A new poll of key swing states shows a very competitive contest for President Obama and Mitt Romney in the months ahead, with the candidates tied in Ohio and Florida, and Mr. Obama leading in Pennsylvania.
 In the survey conducted by Quinnipiac University from April 25 through Tuesday, voters in the three states say the country is still in a recession, but a majority think the economy has begun to recover.
With the campaigns beginning to focus on the general election, the Quinnipiac poll asked voters about a number of potential running mates for Mr. Romney. Not surprisingly, voters in each state favored their native son, so to speak. In Florida, more than half of Republican voters said they supported the state's Senator Marco Rubio. Ohio Senator Rob Portman had the support of 3 in 10 Republicans in Ohio. Nearly 3 in 10 Pennsylvania Republicans supported Chris Christie, the governor of neighboring New Jersey, and about the same number also supported Mr. Rubio.
In Florida, support for the presidential candidates is almost evenly divided, with 43 percent supporting Mr. Obama and 44 percent supporting Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor. In late March, Mr. Obama had a lead of seven points. At 40 percent, Mr. Romney's favorability is highest in Florida, but about a quarter of voters in all three states say they have not heard enough.
Nearly half of Florida voters say Mr. Romney would do a better job on the economy, compared with 4 in 10 who say Mr. Obama would.
Ohio voters are also split over the two candidates: 44 percent support Mr. Obama and 42 percent support Mr. Romney. A March Quinnipiac poll had Mr. Obama up by six points in the state. Mr. Obama's favorable rating is higher, 46 percent to Mr. Romney's 36 percent.
 A gender gap emerges in Ohio, with half of women supporting the president and 37 percent supporting Mr. Romney, and men backing Mr. Romney by a 10-point margin. 
In Pennsylvania, Mr. Obama has an 8-point lead over Mr. Romney, and an even wider margin among women. Women in Pennsylvania support the president by 17 points over Mr. Romney, while men are divided: 44 percent for Mr. Romney to 41 percent for Mr. Obama. 
In all three states, more voters approved than disapproved of Mr. Obama's handling of the situation in Afghanistan, and about 6 in 10 voters in each state said the United States should not be involved there.
 In Florida and Ohio, about half of voters said the Supreme Court should overturn the health care law, while about 4 in 10 said it should be upheld. In Pennsylvania, voters were more closely divided, 46 to 41 percent for overturning it. 
From April 25 to May 1, Quinnipiac University conducted a telephone survey of 1,169 Florida voters; 1,130 Ohio voters; and 1,168 Pennsylvania voters, all with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

HEADLINE: This Sunday: A Video Introduction to The Money Issue

BYLINE: THE STAFF


HIGHLIGHT: Hugo Lindgren introduces the magazine's Money Issue - and puts some of its lessons to use - in his video note. 

 BODY:
In the magazine's Money Issue, Adam Davidson writes about a former partner of Mitt Romney's at Bain Capital who thinks that income inequality isn't the problem with the U.S. economy; it's part of the solution. The issue also includes Nicholas Confessore on Barack Obama's courtship of Wall Street, Amanda Fortini on coupon-clipping as the key to economic growth, Keith O'Brien on how McDonald's came back from the bring of a public relations nightmare (going online tomorrow) and Pietra Rivoli on the business of going broke.
Hugo Lindgren, the editor of the magazine, introduces this special issue - and puts some of its lessons to use - in his video note. Wait for the surprise cameo.

HEADLINE: Inflation and Joblessness: The Tipping Point

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: A Federal Reserve official says the natural rate of unemployment -- below which inflation kicks in -- has risen to 6.5 percent, from 5 percent before the recession. 

 BODY:
Another day, another clue in the quest to understand why the Fed isn't trying harder to reduce the rate of unemployment:
John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said Thursday that the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment - the lowest level that can be reached without leading to inflation - may have climbed as high as 6.5 percent, compared to 5 percent before the recession.
First time hearing about the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or Nairu? No worries. It's an important concept, but also pretty obscure. Basically, the idea is that some unemployment is good, or at least unavoidable. People change jobs. Industries disappear and workers need to be retrained. And a pool of unemployed workers limits the competitive pressure to raise wages.
In technical terms, many economists - including the ones who run the Fed - believe that pushing unemployment below a certain level will cause wages and prices to rise. They call that level the natural rate of unemployment. And Mr. Williams thinks recent disruptions, which have left some workers ill equipped to find new jobs, have raised that rate as much as 1.5 percentage points.
(In a February research note, Mr. Williams and a co-author calculated that the rate might have climbed as high as 6.7 percent.)
First time hearing about John Williams? Well he, too, is important, if a bit obscure. Mr. Williams is one of the 10 people with votes on the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets Fed policy. He generally is in the activist faction that supports efforts to bolster growth. Indeed, just a few months ago, Mr. Williams seemed to be in favor of doing more.
But Mr. Williams has sounded a lot less enthusiastic in recent speeches. So has the rest of the activist wing. And that is a little easier to understand if the Fed has concluded that it shouldn't try to push the rate of unemployment below 6.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Bank of America Goes With WPP as It Changes Ad Agency Lineup

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The company, which is estimated to spend $2 billion a year around the world on ads and marketing, said it would hire a dedicated team being assembled by the agency group WPP. 

 BODY:
Bank of America, seeking ways to resolve persistent image problems with customers, said on Thursday that it was making a major change to its lineup of advertising agencies.
The company will hire a dedicated team being assembled by the agency group WPP to serve as its worldwide agency of record for tasks like image advertising, creating ad campaigns for its three divisions and branding assignments. 
The company is estimated to spend $2 billion a year around the world on ads and marketing.
The decision represents an expansion of an existing relationship with WPP because Bank of America already works with a WPP agency named the Brand Union for branding tasks. The part about the WPP team creating ads as the worldwide agency of record is new, however. WPP will be taking over brand advertising from an Omnicom Group agency, BBDO Worldwide, which has been creating ads for the bank's United States consumer retail business since 2006.
Along with the departure of BBDO, the theme that BBDO created for Bank of America, "Bank of opportunity," will also come to an end.
Despite the hiring of WPP, Bank of America said it would continue to work with Hill Holliday in Boston, an agency owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies. Hill Holliday will continue to create ads for the U.S. Trust and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management divisions of Bank of America and will also work on what were described as additional creative assignments.
"This team of agencies will help us better communicate both the progress we've made," Anne Finucane, global strategy and marketing officer at Bank of America in Boston, said in a statement, "as well as the value of our brand and our company to all our stakeholder groups around the world and across all our lines of business." 
The dedicated unit at WPP will be named Team Bank of America and based in New York. It will operate separately from the New York headquarters offices of WPP agencies like Grey, JWT, Ogilvy & Mather and Y&R, mirroring an agency that WPP has recently opened in New York that is dedicated to creating campaigns for the Lincoln division of Ford Motor. 
The statement by Ms. Finucane also made reference to efforts at Bank of America under its new leader, Brian Moynihan, to become "a stronger, more straightforward company," which have included reducing the size of the company and focusing on core financial services.
Bank of America declined to provide executives to discuss the decision and referred a reporter to Ms. Finucane's statement.
The decision came after a review that began in January, two months after Bank of America endured a black eye to its image by trying to charge a $5 fee to use its debit cards.
The company has also had a rougher time than other banks in recovering from the financial crisis and the recession, particularly in terms of how it is handling home mortgages.
The changes in the Bank of America agency lineup do not affect agencies including Digitas, which handles digital creative chores, and Starcom USA, which handles media planning and buying. Both those agencies are part of the Publicis Groupe.
The decision by Bank of America is the second time this week that a big marketer has asked WPP to assemble a team to create campaigns. On Tuesday, MillerCoors hireda new multiagency team to be put together by WPP to create ads for beer brands like Coors Light and Coors Banquet. 
WPP also has dedicated teams that create campaigns for Ford Motor and Mazda Motor. The approach sometimes misfires, however, as when WPP formed a team named Enfatico to create ads for Dell but had to disband it amid dissatisfaction with its output and operations.

HEADLINE: Bachmann Backs Romney Months After Leaving Race

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: At a rally in Virginia on Thursday, Michele Bachmann officially threw her support behind Mitt Romney, calling the choice in November between him and President Obama "very easy." 

 BODY:
PORTSMOUTH, Va. - Since running against Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination this year, Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota has slowly been changing her tune about the man who has now become their party's presumptive nominee. And at a rally here on Thursday with Gov. Bob McDonnell, Mrs. Bachmann officially threw her support behind Mr. Romney, calling the choice in November between him and President Obama "very easy."
"We're all here together to have a welcome party here in the Tidewater area for the next president of the United States, President Mitt Romney," Mrs. Bachmann said, giving her endorsement three months after quitting the presidential race. "I am honored to be able to be here to introduce not only Gov. Bob McDonnell, the fabulous governor of the state of Virginia, but also to lend my voice and my endorsement to Mitt Romney as our president and take the country back."
Standing by her side, Mr. Romney said, with a smile: "Thank you."
Mrs. Bachmann explained her decision in simple terms.
"You see, I think for all of America, this is a very simple proposition this November - President Barack Obama, President Mitt Romney," said Mrs. Bachmann, who also noted that the three politicians onstage - herself, Mr. McDonnell and Mr. Romney - each have five children. "You decide. Very easy."
In late 2011, when she was still running against Mr. Romney, Mrs. Bachmann said that, "he has been very inconsistent in his positions."
But in April, when it became clear that Mr. Romney would be the likely nominee, she stopped short of an endorsement, saying on "Meet the Press" that she was "very seriously looking at an endorsement for Mitt Romney."
"Mitt Romney is an extremely smart guy," Mrs. Bachmann said at the time. "He's been extremely successful in creating jobs in the private economy."
And on Thursday, Mrs. Bachmann, who has disagreed with Mr. Romney in the past on social issues like abortion, stood onstage with Mr. Romney against the backdrop of an enormous Virginia state flag, and said the race against Mr. Obama "isn't personal."
"This is about having a performance review after three and a half years," she said. "When you look at 38-plus months of unemployment above 8 percent, when you look at a doubling of America's energy prices at the pump, when you look at debt accumulation in excess of $5 trillion under his watch, there is no question in my mind: Americans will go to the polls, and they'll be saying, Mr. President, you're fired, and instead, we will soundly stand for someone who believes in America, who believes in our children, who believes in the hope of opportunities for this next generation."
Mrs. Bachmann joins at least three other former Republican contenders, including Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, Tim Pawlenty, and Jon M. Huntsman Jr., in endorsing Mr. Romney. Others, including Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, have yet to formally endorse.

HEADLINE: Once Remote, Goldman Sachs Puts on a Friendly Public Face

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: By stepping into the spotlight even a little, Goldman appears to be embarking on a subtle campaign to repair its reputation. The bank's message is simple: Goldman cares about its clients and its community. 

 BODY:
After a steady stream of criticism since the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs is trying to burnish its image.
Last week, the company's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, gave rare back-to-back televised interviews to CNBC and Bloomberg Television, in which he emphasized the company's focus on clients. And on Wednesday, he spoke at a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender conference called "Out on the Street," explaining the company's support for gay rights. In recent weeks, Goldman executives have been more talkative with reporters.
By stepping into the spotlight even a little, Goldman appears to be embarking on a subtle campaign to repair its reputation. The bank's message is simple: Goldman cares about its clients and its community.
 It is unclear whether such moves will change public perception, in large part because Goldman does not have a new story to tell. The financial company made a another public relations push a couple of years ago, with little success. In 2010, Goldman - still reeling from Congressional hearings, a government lawsuit and a less-than-flattering portrayal as a "vampire squid" in a Rolling Stone article - rolled out a series of national advertisements aimed at improving its public standing.
But with its latest effort, Goldman is taking a different tack by reaching out even though there is no blowup.
"Any time that you're engaging proactively is a good thing," said Michael W. Robinson, an executive vice president at Levick Strategic Communications, a public relations firm. "The press around Goldman is never going to go down to zero, but the goal is to be less interesting and less attractive as a target."
Goldman has long been wary of courting the public. Goldman was a private partnership until 1999. Its first public relations executive worked from his apartment in Manhattan, laboring under the principle that most press was bad press, according to a book about Goldman Sachs, "Money and Power," by William D. Cohan.
In the aftermath of the financial crisis, Goldman hunkered down, as the company became the poster child for Wall Street excess. While other banking chiefs vocally defended their companies, Mr. Blankfein largely remained quiet. The company even pulled back on granting interviews for noncontentious events like quarterly earnings.
The company's top public relations official at the time, Lucas van Praag, was alternately admired and scorned for couching withering dismissals of critics in elegant phrases. Among Mr. van Praag's greatest hits were his dismissals of news articles as "effluent," "frankly, pretty stupid" and "chimera produced by a febrile mind."
Now Goldman is taking its communication cues from a new executive. In March, the company hired Richard Siewert Jr., a former Clinton press secretary who was a senior adviser to Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner until last year, to head public relations.
Mr. Siewert, known as Jake, immediately faced a trial by fire.
Just before Mr. Siewert joined Goldman, the company was rebuked by a Delaware state judge for its conduct in the sale of a client, the El Paso Corporation. The judge, Chancellor Leo E. Strine Jr., criticized the investment bank for playing both sides of the deal, given that it owned a stake in El Paso's acquirer, Kinder Morgan.
Mr. Siewert's first official day on the job coincided with the publication of an article on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times by Greg Smith, a former Goldman executive who denounced a "toxic and destructive" environment in which some colleagues belittled clients as "muppets." The piece helped rekindle the continuing debate about Goldman's practices, while stirring up strong defenses of the company within its ranks of executives and alumni.
Since then, Goldman seems to have begun a low-key charm offensive. In late April, Mr. Blankfein, appearing relaxed without a suit jacket, sat down with CNBC and Bloomberg at a company conference on emerging markets. Buoyant and smiling, he reiterated the company's client-centric philosophy, while acknowledging that the company had some work to do.
"Obviously, it has occurred to us that we haven't gotten everything right," he told CNBC.
Mr. Blankfein's higher profile has extended beyond television interviews. In February, he became the Human Rights Campaign's first national corporate spokesman for same-sex marriage, saying publicly what he had advocated more privately for years. On Wednesday, he elaborated on his views, telling a crowd in Midtown Manhattan that Goldman's support of gay marriage had cost it at least one prominent client.
"They didn't want to continue a relationship that they had with us in money management," he told the "Out on the Street" audience, according to news reports. He declined to name the company, but added, "If you heard the name, it wouldn't surprise you."
Even client-focused events, independent of public relations efforts, may engender good will. Goldman is planning a new conference, the "Builders and Innovators Summit," a salon of sorts where established entrepreneurs can meet and mentor up-and-comers. The conference, scheduled for late October in Newport Beach, Calif., arose from two years of discussions with senior management about how to better engage entrepreneurs. In many ways, it harks back to Goldman's roots in helping nascent companies, including working years ago with Sears, Roebuck and Ford Motor on their public stock offerings.
"The more of this that they do, the more that they reduce anxiety about the firm," Mr. Robinson said.

HEADLINE: Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan's Budget

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Romney seems to be embracing proposals by House Republicans that would push Medicare costs onto consumers and bolster health care companies and big banks, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The conventional wisdom in American presidential politics is that once a candidate has secured a party's nomination, he tends to move away from articulating the views of the party faithful toward the political center. This makes sense as a way to win votes in the general election, and there has been a presumption that Mitt Romney will head in that direction.
However, in a panel discussion on Tuesday, Vin Weber, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, indicated that the campaign might be moving toward positions on fiscal policy that were close to those proposed by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and his Republican colleagues on the House Budget Committee. 
When Mr. Ryan presented his budget in March, Mr. Romney described it as "marvelous." In the Wisconsin primary, Mr. Ryan campaigned with Mr. Romney and speculation arose that Mr. Ryan might be the Republican vice presidential candidate.
Yet Mr. Romney's embrace of the Ryan plan during the general election campaign would represent a significant shift toward a much more extreme view on the future of government than many Romney proposals during the primaries (see this assessment of his primary proposals by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan bipartisan fiscal watchdog focused on deficit reduction). 
Mr. Weber said he was not speaking for Mr. Romney; I was on the same panel, and my strong impression is that Mr. Weber was floating trial balloons.
Mr. Ryan's proposals would substantially phase out the federal government's role in providing basic social insurance for older people by sharply reducing Medicare and by eliminating almost all nonmilitary discretionary spending.

The House Budget Committee is also proposing to remove the only safeguard we have against the failure of another megabank. Some libertarians praise these proposals. But these Republicans' strategy is not so much to remove government in favor of abstract "markets" but to shift the balance of power away from government and toward entrenched private lobby groups, particularly in the health care sector and on Wall Street.
On Medicare, Mr. Ryan's proposal is very simple. He wants to cap increases in spending on Medicare below the rate at which health care costs increase. By his own estimates, the share of Medicare spending relative to the size of the economy would shrink sharply over the coming decades. (Mr. Ryan proposes to keep Medicare in place for people currently retired and soon to reach the eligibility age of 65, so his proposal would affect people 55 and under today. I, by the way, am not yet 55).
Mr. Ryan's approach certainly reduces this dimension of government spending over time. But keep in mind how the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has assessed these ideas: according to the C.B.O., this approach would increase total health care costs as a share of the economy and as paid by you (see Figure 1 on Page 22 of this C.B.O. document, which analyzes the proposal Mr. Ryan presented last year; while some details are different this year, the essential substance is the same). 
The idea behind this C.B.O. scoring is simple. At present the government buys health care for about 100 million Americans. Certainly, the government could use this buying power more effectively as a way to hold down costs. The government has much more market power than you or I would have relative to health care providers and insurers when we are in our 70s, 80s and 90s. 
The C.B.O. scoring is based on actual experience, including administrative costs in Medicare compared with private insurance. These costs will fall directly on older Americans and their families. 
Before Medicare was created in the 1960s, there was no meaningful health care insurance for older Americans - and there will be none after Medicare is phased out. For the private sector, this is a set of uninsurable risks.
The federal government provides a minimum level of social insurance to all of us, in case we outlive our assets and our families' ability to support us. Mr. Ryan - and now perhaps Mr. Romney - would end this role.
According to the C.B.O., the net impact would be to increase what you pay for health care. The government-provided piece would decline, but your insurance premiums and other out-of-pocket expenses would increase. 
Just as striking is Mr. Ryan's proposal for nonmilitary discretionary spending. This currently amounts to about $650 billion, about 4 percent of gross domestic product, and it has been around this size relative to the economy for about 50 years. 
This now represents about 20 percent of federal government activity. The federal government is roughly a $3.3 trillion shop, annually, with the big chunks of spending being Social Security, Medicare and other government-backed health care, and the military. The United States economy has a total annual production, or G.D.P., of about $15 trillion.
Mr. Ryan is less clear on the details, but assuming that he would seek to maintain military spending at no less than 3 percent of G.D.P. - which is its lowest level in the postwar period - my colleague James Kwak has projected that the domestic discretionary spending would fall to almost zero in the coming decades (see the charts at the end of this blog post).
I'm all in favor of bringing the federal debt under control - and stabilizing it at a reasonable level relative to the size of the economy (say, 40 or 50 percent of G.D.P.). But there is no need to eviscerate the federal government to achieve this over a reasonable time frame.
Mr. Ryan's plan would effectively shut down the federal government's ability to set rules for the economy and to provide essential public services, such as air traffic control, the monitoring of hurricanes and the provision of disaster relief. 
Big private companies will no doubt do well under this approach; there will be fewer restrictions on what they do (e.g., as the Environmental Protection Agency winds down or food safety rules go unenforced), and they will be able to increase their market power (as the Department of Justice drops its remaining interest in antitrust issues).
This is bad news for entrepreneurs or anyone seeking to invest in start-up companies. The playing field will become ever more uneven - just as it was when J.P. Morgan and his colleagues were building the original industrial, railroad and energy trusts at the end of the 19th century.
From the perspective of too-big-to-fail banks, the news from Mr. Ryan is even better. The House Republicans are proposing to repeal Title II of Dodd-Frank, which creates the legal authority to wind down large financial institutions in an orderly fashion. 
Without this, we are back at the situation of fall 2008, where big banks can blow themselves up, inflict great damage on the economy and also receive large-scale bailouts (see my recent post in this space for more on exactly how that works).
None of these Republican proposals should be dismissed as pure rhetoric. For many Republicans in Congress, the Ryan proposals are a very real agenda. And as Ezra Klein has argued, if Mr. Romney is elected president, the Republicans are likely to gain control of the Senate and would almost certainly be able to push through a version of the Ryan agenda - particularly as the key details would be immune to filibuster in the Senate.
Under such a Ryan-Romney approach, big risks - such as severe ill health and the danger of other calamities - would be shifted from society to individuals. Large corporations in health care and finance and perhaps in other sectors would benefit. So, too, would the people who control those favored legal entities.
This is a return to the way the United States economy operated more than 100 years ago - in what Mark Twain ironically labeled the Gilded Age. A few people would do very well; almost everyone else is in for a hard time.

HEADLINE: A.I.G. Says Its Earnings Doubled In 1st Quarter

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The American International Group, the huge insurer that came close to collapsing during the financial crisis before being bailed out by the federal government, said on Thursday that its earnings more than doubled in the first quarter. 
A.I.G. reported that its net income, after paying preferred dividends, climbed to $3.2 billion, or $1.71 a share, in the three months that ended March 31. That compares with net income of $1.3 billion, or 31 cents a share, in the same period last year.
The company's after-tax operating income, which excludes the impact of certain investments and hedging activities, was $3.1 billion, or $1.65 a share. In the prior-year period, it was $2.1 billion, or $1.34 a share. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting on average adjusted net income of $1.19 a share in the latest quarter.
The gains at A.I.G., which is based in New York, were driven mainly by improved performance at its Chartis and SunAmerica insurance units. A.I.G.'s aircraft leasing business also posted a higher operating income.
In addition, A.I.G. recorded a $1.3 billion increase in the fair value of its interest in a limited-liability company formed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as an investment vehicle after the 2008 financial crisis.
Management said the company achieved a milestone during the quarter: the amount of outstanding or authorized assistance from the United States is now down by 75 percent.
A.I.G. got the biggest bailout of the financial crisis: $182.5 billion. The Treasury Department provided $68 billion under its financial bailout program, and the New York Fed gave A.I.G. a $114 billion lifeline. A.I.G. has repaid all but $17.5 billion of the Fed loans.
The Treasury Department still owns about 70 percent of A.I.G.'s common stock and has been selling its shares in chunks. It has recovered $18 billion of the $68 billion it gave to A.I.G.
In the latest quarter, A.I.G.'s Chartis unit generated $1 billion in operating income, compared with a $424 million operating loss a year earlier.
SunAmerica's operating income rose to $1.3 billion, from $1.2 billion in the prior-year period, aided by investment gains. Those gains were partly offset by lower returns from hedge fund and private equity investments.
Shares of A.I.G. ended regular trading down 62 cents, or 1.8 percent, at $34.14. The stock slipped 53 cents to $33.61 in extended trading.

HEADLINE: Models for Government

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Testing, correcting and retesting through rigorous research methods in government programs are so rare, as noted in David Brooks's April 27 column, ''Is Our Adults Learning?,'' that we often perpetuate costly programs that don't work. 
When Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg created the Center for Economic Opportunity in 2006 as a research and development shop to study new solutions to poverty, New York City took a major step in defying that trend by subjecting all new initiatives to serious evaluation and the commitment to ending what does not work, and replicating what proves successful.
The center, which is this year's recipient of the Kennedy School of Government's Innovations in American Government award, is now replicating best practices in employment training and economic empowerment across eight American cities. It is a model worth replicating.
And at the federal level, it would be well worth exploring, for instance in the food stamp program, where anti-obesity efforts like prohibiting purchase of sugar-sweetened beverages could be tested in select localities to determine if the country's most important nutrition assistance program could be made more nutritious.

HEADLINE: For Chinese, a Man in the News Is Much Discussed, if Not By Name

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES and SHARON LaFRANIERE

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Those outside of China know him as Chen Guangcheng, the self-trained lawyer whose crusade for individual rights has led him to confinement, escape and, now, an international diplomatic incident. Ordinary people inside China refer to him online in a different, coded way.
First he was ''blind lawyer;'' then ''blind man,'' then ''A Bing,'' a reference to a nationally famous blind musician. All were blotted out by the Chinese government's pervasive, highly computerized security apparatus. Lately, his plight has been referred to as ''UA898'' -- the daily United Airlines flight from Beijing to Washington that, this week, has come to symbolize Mr. Chen's demand to emigrate to the United States rather than face an uncertain future in his homeland. 
Mr. Chen's demands to be treated like any other Chinese citizen have galvanized much of the world, and incited a global debate over China's human rights policies not seen since another Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize.
But in the airless space for discussion that is contemporary China, neither Mr. Chen nor Mr. Liu is a suitable topic for debate. They are nonentities, or, if they are referred to at all, they are vague threats to the harmonious society that President Hu Jintao promised when he assumed power at the start of the last decade.
''The West and its supporters in China always need a tool to work against China's current political system,'' the nationalistic state-run newspaper Global Times wrote this week, in one of the first official mentions of the Chen dispute. ''Those who want to plot against China by making use of Chen Guangcheng may be just deluding themselves.''
The official position was stated most doggedly, perhaps, on Thursday, when the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Liu Weimin, was asked to explain why Mr. Chen had long been a prisoner in his own home, an incarceration long described in written and video reports, accepted worldwide, as brutal and unending.
''After Chen Guangcheng was released from prison, he is a free person as far as I know. He has been living in his own house,'' Mr. Liu stated. Challenged on that, he responded: ''That's what you said. As far as I know, he's living in his hometown.'' He also deflected a spate of other questions about Mr. Chen and Liu Xiaobo's wife, Liu Xia, mostly saying that China's legal system ensures proper treatment of all citizens.
The facts of Mr. Chen's detention are, of course, undisputed. But in a year of change, when China's entire leadership is poised for decennial turnover at a Communist Party congress this autumn, there is scant incentive to rock the boat.
Little about the reported deal between Chinese and American diplomats concerning Mr. Chen's future -- the plan that was unraveled on Thursday in the global press -- has become known inside China. Instead, Chinese authorities on Thursday again castigated American officials for unspecified violations of international law in their efforts to give Mr. Chen refuge at the United States Embassy, and repeated their demands that Washington apologize for its actions and punish those who helped Mr. Chen escape.
On Thursday, in contrast to their reported agreement to stop persecuting Mr. Chen, the Chinese authorities stepped up already onerous security restrictions on a number of friends and supporters who had encouraged or helped carry out Mr. Chen's flight last week from Shandong.
In a post on Twitter, Zeng Jinyan, a rights activist and the wife of Mr. Chen's ally Hu Jia, said she was visited Wednesday evening by state security agents and ordered confined to her home. ''This morning they followed me in a black car when I was sending my child to kindergarten,'' she wrote. ''They told me they would accommodate me and my child's needs to go to kindergarten, but I won't be able to leave my house for a few days. This is the beginning of my house arrest.''
Ms. Zeng and some other activists have begun to ask journalists to stop calling them, saying the conversations are endangering their safety.
Nicholas Bequelin, a Hong Kong-based researcher with Human Rights Watch, noted that forced confinement at home is the same punishment -- albeit without beatings and some other severe measures -- that Mr. Chen was trying to escape.
He said that the mishandling of the Chen case had cost the United States considerable leverage in its dealings with China, but that it still could salvage the situation by demanding guarantees from China's top leaders that Mr. Chen would be treated well or allowed to emigrate.
That, he said, would probably require the White House to make resolving Mr. Chen's case a precondition for normal United States-China relations, including the current Strategic and Economic Dialogue. ''I can't see much of a middle way'' to settle the issue without a forceful American response, he said.

HEADLINE: For Nielsen, Fewer Homes Have a TV

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
10:45 a.m. Updated The number of American households with access to a television set and a TV signal is shrinking for the second year in a row.
The data, released by The Nielsen Company on Thursday morning, is sure to be pored over by television and Internet executives for evidence of changes in consumer behavior.
While the vast majority of American homes still have functioning television sets, more than one million no longer meet Nielsen's definition of a ''TV household:'' those that have at least one television set and a cable, satellite or antenna connection. 
Last year, for the first time in 20 years, Nielsen said the number of such households had dropped to 114.7 million, from 115.9 million previously, despite a rise in the number of households in the country. On Thursday, Nielsen said the figure had dropped further, this time to 114.1 million. The company, which monitors a sample of United States households to produce TV ratings every day, also estimated that the total number of people living in those homes has shrunk, but at a lesser rate -- to 289.2 million, down 100,000 from 289.3 million last year. Nielsen attributes the drops both to economic factors and to technological ones.
Not surprisingly, given the lower number of households with TV sets, the total number of Americans who watched any traditional TV in a given month also declined during the last three months of 2011, according to Nielsen: 284.4 million, down about 1.7 percent from 289.3 million during the same time period in 2010.
To the astonishment of some in the industry, total TV viewing has been on the rise in the U.S. for years, despite a plethora of other entertainment options. But new Nielsen data, also released on Thursday, showed an unusual dip in TV viewing in the last three months of 2011. At the same time, some people are spending more time playing video games and watching Web video -- though TV still retains the lion's share of people's free time.
In the last three months of 2011, the average American with a TV set at home spent 153 hours and 19 minutes watching ''traditional TV'' -- TV viewed on a set rather than a computer or a tablet. That total is about 46 minutes less than was watched in the last three months of 2010, or a decline of 0.5 percent.
Per person, the decline comes out to be about 30 seconds a day, hardly a seismic shift. But it is likely to be scrutinized by researchers nonetheless because previous surveys in the first nine months of 2011 showed that the average time spent watching TV each month was up versus the same period in 2010.
Nielsen also reported quarterly declines in year-over-year television viewership once in 2009 and once in 2010, but those declines were not as pronounced as the ones at the end of 2011 were.
In a report to its television industry clients, Nielsen wrote of the viewership decline: ''This may be the result of leveling off after a period of sustained growth, weather and economic factors or of other viewing options.''
Nielsen defines traditional TV as consumption through a television set, either live or via a digital video recorder or video-on-demand service. The company does not count consumption on computers, phones or tablets like the iPad. That may explain, in part, why the total number of viewers slipped late last year. They may still be watching TV, even on TV sets, but not through cable or antenna connections. Nielsen has said in the past that it is assessing whether to define ''TV household'' to include these viewers.
The headline of Nielsen's report on Thursday called Americans ''voracious video viewers.''
''The average American watches nearly five hours of video each day, 98 percent of which they watch on a traditional TV set,'' the report states. ''Although this ratio is less than it was just a few years ago, and continues to change, the fact remains that Americans are not turning off. They are shifting to new technologies and devices that make it easier for them to watch the content they want whenever and wherever is most convenient for them. As such, the definition of the traditional TV home will evolve.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: For Craftsmen, Fragile Lifeline From Craigslist

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
With few places to turn, construction workers have colonized Craigslist as the cyberspace equivalent of the street corner or the Home Depot parking lot.
Some are getting more than they bargained for as they search for ad hoc jobs. One Palm Beach man who previously worked on crews renovating Walmart stores agreed to clean out an apartment after a tenant committed suicide. But he drew the line at hanging up a sex swing.
Still the plaintive pleas for work keep coming online. That is because carpenters, bricklayers, roofers, painters, electricians, plumbers and carpet installers have largely been left out of the economic recovery. Builders are not hiring, homeowners are deferring renovations and governments are postponing highway and bridge projects. Economists are forecasting that the Labor Department will announce on Friday that the nation's employers added about 165,000 net jobs last month -- few of them in the construction industry.
The jobs that construction workers find online tend to be small: painting bedrooms, replacing ceiling fans or even installing pet doors. The pay is skimpy, they say, far less than during the boom years. Mostly, though, there is simply not enough work for the large number of overqualified odd jobbers trying to cobble together a subsistence. 
''You can follow the pulse of the economy just by watching what's going on with Craigslist,'' said Jerry Patterson, a carpenter in Phoenix who once had plentiful work framing new homes and remodeling older ones. ''It's a massive amount of people going for just a few amount of calls.''
Listings across the country, typos and all, capture the desperate effort to find even a tiny scrap of work.
''Trades man in South Florida for over 44 years ... For the time being not any job is to small,'' reads one typical ad. In Las Vegas, one of the areas hardest hit by the housing collapse, a handyman writes: ''30 Years of actual hard earned construction experience. / Skilled in almost every single trade. Las vegas native & Single dad in need of work.''
Unemployed people across many occupations are seeking work on Craigslist, of course. But while other industries are starting to improve and restore more formal jobs, construction remains on its knees.
According to the Labor Department, the construction industry slashed 2.27 million jobs from its prerecession peak to the trough of construction employment in January 2011. Just 95,000 jobs have returned, or less than 5 percent of those lost. With national unemployment at 8.2 percent in March, the rate among workers in construction and excavation, including drill operators and people who remove waste from building sites, is more than twice that, at 17 percent.
Manufacturers, by contrast, have restored 470,000 of the 2.29 million jobs they lost from the start of the recession to their low point. And retailers, who cut about 1.2 million jobs, have brought back 342,000 jobs, more than a quarter of those shed during the comparable period.
When work was easy to find in 2005 and 2006, Mr. Patterson, 43, struck out on his own. He would place an ad in the Sunday newspaper and get 30 calls, yielding at least three or four jobs. Now, he said, he puts an ad on Craigslist two or three times a day and is lucky to get two calls a week.
On his last job, he said, he and an assistant installed 12 windows on a house. After paying for materials, he said they cleared about $100 a day for the eight-day project.
''Everything has been so slow that you know, when you make some money, it's just gone immediately trying to catch up on everything,'' said Mr. Patterson, who added that he can cover his bills only because he shares a rental home with his girlfriend, who works in a hospice.
Some construction workers have left the industry. But ''it's been very hard for people to give up and move to other sectors because it's not like there's been a lot of expansion in other parts of the economy,'' said Nik Theodore, an associate professor in the department of urban planning and policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ''Most of what I'm hearing is people eking it out on the edge of the construction industry.''
In Las Vegas, Paul Amyot, a union worker who once installed carpets in casinos, has solicited jobs on Craigslist for two years. He is about to exhaust his most recent stretch of unemployment benefits after completing a three-week union job last December, his first in more than a year.
To save money, Mr. Amyot, 41, has moved in with his sister. Not only are opportunities fewer, he said, customers are paying less. A month ago, an apartment building landlord hired him through Craigslist to lay tile in two bathrooms. He earned $19 an hour, down from $31 as a casino carpet layer, a job for which he spent four years as an apprentice.
''What you think you're going to get, you might as well cut 50 percent off of that,'' he said.
Workers who once built houses, offices or big-box retail complexes are now venturing into the absurd. Ken, who declined to give his last name because he said he was embarrassed by his situation, said he had been paid $250 to clean out a Palm Beach apartment where a tenant had committed suicide.
But he has rebuffed other responses to his ads, variations on ''RENT A HUSBAND ! ! ! HANDYMAN SERVICES - 25% OFF.'' Last month, he said, ''I had a guy call me 10 o'clock at night and ask me if I had a vise. And I said yeah, and he said 'Can you meet me somewhere and I want to put my hand in the vise and you crush it?' '' Ken said he demurred.
Then there was the woman from Fort Lauderdale who called wanting to hire him to rig up a sex swing while her husband was away. ''She wanted me to come hang it in her 'room of doom,' '' he said. ''She offered me a lot of money, but I said 'No, no it just doesn't seem like something I want to get involved in.' ''
After losing his assembly line job at Northrop Grumman on Long Island early last decade, Ken, 48, turned to construction and moved to Florida. His unemployment benefits dried up two years ago. Now, he said, he was lucky to get 10 hours of work a week through Craigslist and was behind on the rent.
The outlook is grim. After rising early in the year, new-home sales fell in March, and government spending on infrastructure projects remains low.
''It's going to be a slow recovery,'' said David Crowe, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. Workers ''are not going to get back into construction -- at least most of them, -- for at least another two years.''
In Florida, Ken said that he and his fellow construction workers found themselves wishing for a hurricane. ''They don't want a really bad, severe damaging one, just one that could cause a little havoc so we could have some work,'' he said. ''That's a hell of a thing to pray for.''

HEADLINE: If I Had the Cash, I Wouldn't Buy That

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
My first live encounter with ''The Scream,'' by Edvard Munch, was during a December stay in Oslo several decades ago. After a week of experiencing the sun-starved Norwegian midwinter, all dawn, dusk and oppressive darkness, I felt I knew where Munch's image of released hysteria was coming from.
Since then ''The Scream'' has been subjected to the hard glare of the public spotlight. Two of the four existing versions of it have, at different times, been stolen from Oslo museums and later recovered. On Wednesday an 1895 pastel version of the picture sold for $119.9 million at Sotheby's in New York, setting an auction record and proving, yet again, that whatever shape the economy is in, there's no limit to private cash and art is a place where people like to park it. 
And they like to park it in predictable places. What art could be more predictable than ''The Scream,'' one of the best-known images in the world? You can see why. Its essentials are readable from across a room. And with its skull head trapped under a shutting-down sky, it's the pictorial equivalent of double exclamation points.
Some see the figure as a symbol of Modern Man, others as a kind of cartoon E. T. Either way there's plenty of tasty narrative potential. Did something awful just happen? Is the shrieker nuts? Will he (or she) be leaping over the bridge rail next?
Frankly, it's an easy thing to dis, but what's the point? Pop Art and popular culture, from Andy Warhol to ''The Simpsons,'' have already done that pretty thoroughly. And despite it ''The Scream'' still holds a legitimate and complex place in the European painting tradition and in Munch's estimable and interesting career.
Is a version worth $120 million? The only way I can answer is by asking another question: If I were suddenly handed the same amount of money for art, is that the way I'd spend it?
No.
After studying and writing about art for 40 years I see too many other options, options that would allow me to put together an encyclopedic mini-museum for the same dollars. That museum, filled with art that could be bought, even in these over-the-top times, for comparative bargain prices. It would begin with early Indian Buddhist art and go on to French illuminated manuscripts, African sculpture, tons of old master paintings and drawings -- art that a new generation of collectors, fixated on thoroughly branded modern and contemporary art, doesn't even know exists.
But even if I focused on modern and contemporary, I know where I'd spend. My museum would focus on, for starters, work produced by women, internationally, over the past 50 years. Some of the artists I'm thinking about call or called themselves feminists, though many don't or didn't. A huge percentage of current art comes right out of their work. Together it would be more than a collection; it would be a force. And given the low interest in and low prices of such art, I could probably pick up most of the work straight from studios and estates -- no Sotheby's commissions, thank you -- and touch only a fraction of my $120 million museum fund.
Of course I never will start a museum, or, apart from an odd or end, an art collection. Part of me doesn't warm to owning precious things. I'm glad there are museums where art can be kept, dusted and safe and out of my apartment. Personally I love ideas as much as objects, not that I can separate them: I feel ideas are as sensuous as things.
What I collect are experiences -- traveling, seeing, being there, anywhere. For me ''The Scream'' will always mean the memory of a moody Oslo twilight from decades ago. The value of that experience to me is beyond price. When I hear $120 million, I think of how many experiences, for how many people, that might have bought.

HEADLINE: Two Legislators Strive to Out-Conservative Each Other for a State Senate Seat

BYLINE: By AMAN BATHEJA. 
abatheja@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Three years ago, State Representatives Todd Smith and Kelly Hancock, both Republicans, were on opposite sides of a fight over how to dig the Dallas-Fort Worth area out of gridlock.
Now, as the two men vie for a rare open state Senate seat covering portions of Tarrant and Dallas Counties, that disagreement has hardened into a key philosophical divide that supporters on both sides say paints their candidate as the true conservative in the primary race.
Both men have longstanding ties to their districts. Mr. Smith, of Euless, cut his teeth serving on his hometown City Council before advancing to the House in 1996. Mr. Hancock, of North Richland Hills, was elected to the House a decade later, after 13 years on the Birdville school board. 
Both hope to succeed Senator Chris Harris, Republican of Arlington, who is retiring after 21 years in the upper chamber. The winner of the primary in District 9, which leans Republican, will face Pete Martinez, a Democrat, and Dave McElwee, a Libertarian, in the general election in November.
''You've got two experienced campaigners with a following and the ability to raise money,'' said District Clerk Tom Wilder of Tarrant County, a Republican. ''It's just a shame they decided to run against each other. They're both pretty conservative people.''
In 2009, Mr. Smith supported the Texas Local Option Transportation Act bill, which would have given some urban counties the option to ask voters to approve raising local taxes or fees to pay for new transportation projects. The measure failed amid opposition from antitax groups.
Years ago, Mr. Smith differentiated himself from other Republicans, including Mr. Hancock, when he proposed increasing the gas tax to keep pace more effectively with the state's transportation needs. He frames both stances as proof of his courage to make tough decisions despite the political costs.
''It's always a can that can be endlessly kicked down the road, at least past the next election, and there's always another election,'' Mr. Smith said. ''I feel a moral responsibility to propose real solutions to these problems.''
Mr. Smith said he no longer supports an increase in the gas tax because the area is now covered in toll road projects, and increasing the gas tax would be like taxing his constituents twice.
Mr. Hancock opposed the local option measure, drawing rebukes from some area officials, but he received praise from statewide conservative groups.
That same dynamic is emerging in the primary race, as conservative leaders including Gov. Rick Perry and Attorney General Greg Abbott are backing Mr. Hancock. Meanwhile, Mr. Smith has drawn support from dozens of local school board and city officials, including 12 mayors representing nearly the entire district.
Mr. Hancock dismissed Mr. Smith's backers as not representative of the district's voters.
''There's obviously a connection with those who were looking to raise taxes with some of his endorsements,'' Mr. Hancock said.
At a forum at a Grand Prairie church last month, the back-and-forth between the two candidates largely pivoted on how Texas should finance big-ticket needs like transportation.
Mr. Hancock said there is a reason he has received endorsements from the Texas Association of Business and major grass-roots conservative groups.
''There is a belief of mine that government needs to be run much more like a business,'' he said.
Mr. Smith said that he did not support raising taxes during a recession but that the state needs lawmakers who have the will to invest a future surplus in infrastructure rather than in tax cuts.
''I am a conservative, but I am not someone who takes instructions from anyone else other than my own conscience,'' Mr. Smith said.
The last word came from Mr. Hancock, who encouraged attendees to research both candidates online.
''I hope that you will become informed,'' he said. ''Find out that there are different definitions of conservative.''

HEADLINE: How to Get Business to Pay Its Share

BYLINE: By ALEX MARSHALL. 
Alex Marshall is a senior fellow at the Regional Plan Association, an urban research and advocacy group, and the author of the forthcoming book ''The Surprising Design of Market Economies.''

 BODY:
JAMES MADISON never played with an iPhone, but he might have had something to say about the news last weekend about Apple. Over the last few years, the company has avoided paying billions of dollars in state and federal taxes by routing profits through subsidiaries based in tax havens from Reno, Nev., to the Caribbean.
This is a common practice among major American businesses, and back in 1787, Madison saw it coming. Someday, he warned, companies could grow so large they ''would pass beyond the authority of a single state, and would do business in other states.'' To make sure the companies remained accountable to government, he said the federal government should ''grant charters of incorporation in cases where the public good may require them, and the authority of a single state may be incompetent.'' 
In other words, a National Companies Act.
Such an act would create a common corporate architecture for all American companies doing business across state lines and internationally. It would establish not only uniform tax policies but also national standards for the structure of corporate boards, the power of chief executives, the relations of management with workers and shareholders and the interaction of American companies with other nations. National companies would have to abide by national rules, and the option of shopping around for the most favorable laws or tax policies simply wouldn't exist.
It's an idea that has been proposed and pursued many times, particularly during the early 1900s, when companies like Standard Oil, which was a collection of companies incorporated in various states and assembled into a national ''trust,'' were becoming increasingly powerful. Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson and, later, Franklin D. Roosevelt all supported the creation of a national companies law, but the measures were consistently opposed by the business community and eventually defeated.
Today, however, considering how much effort and money American companies expend on keeping a competitive advantage by figuring out which loopholes to exploit from the bewildering array of rules now in effect, they might not entirely oppose reform. In an era of global competition, it could help to have a clear set of standards. It's certainly what other nations have. In Germany, for example, national legislation established rules for the structure of corporate boards. Britain's Parliament establishes how a corporation can be created and what its rights and responsibilities are.
Legally, there is little doubt that the United States Congress could impose similar rules under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. Although the states have traditionally been the main arena for corporate rules, the federal government has long created national corporations, from the First Bank of the United States in 1791 to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in 1967. Congress could use this same power to require that companies doing business across state lines have national corporate charters, which would subject them to federal rules. Alternatively, it could simply set rules for corporate organization and conduct that would apply to all interstate companies of a certain size.
Passing a National Companies Act won't be easy. Companies would hire lobbyists to push for favorable rules. And some states with particularly easy incorporation terms, like Delaware, might resist. Around 60 percent of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated in Delaware, and the state earns a great deal in fees and tax revenues as a result.
But the Apple controversy shows that the nation is ready for reform. While the company is a symbol of private enterprise, its existence is made possible by a charter that some government writes and grants. It should serve public as well as private ends -- and pay its rightful share in taxes -- or it should not exist at all.

HEADLINE: Making a Case to Remember Burr

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN

 BODY:
Brian D. Hardison, a lawyer and judge on the outskirts of Atlanta, has built a persuasive case in defense of Aaron Burr. Since the 1990s he has been acquiring mounds of paperwork showing this politician's sympathetic sides.
Much of the collection goes on view May 16 to July 28 at the Grolier Club in Manhattan. The exhibition, ''Aaron Burr Returns to New York: An Exhibit of Burr and His Contemporaries,'' spans his career: from his heroism under fire during the Revolutionary War, through his remorse for his killing of Alexander Hamilton, to his stoic reactions to family tragedy and his persistent ability to earn a living.
''I'm not at all trying to say this man was an angel, but I'm certainly saying he wasn't a demon,'' Mr. Hardison said in a recent phone interview.
The Grolier has published his book, ''Burriana: A Catalogue of Rare Books, Pamphlets, Letters, Manuscripts, Documents, & Objects by, About, or Relating to Aaron Burr.'' Its 523 entries are full of poignant tributes to dead loved ones. 
Burr was orphaned as a toddler, and during the American Revolution, when his commander Maj. Gen. Richard Montgomery was killed before his eyes at the Battle of Quebec, he ventured into gunfire and futilely tried to drag the corpse off the battlefield. His wife, Theodosia, died in 1794, at 47, and in 1812 the couple's only grandchild died.
Then their daughter, also named Theodosia, disappeared aboard a schooner in the Atlantic en route from South Carolina to visit her father in New York. She had already been in failing health; historians speculate she had uterine cancer. Mr. Hardison owns a letter she wrote in 1808, worrying about spending too much on mineral spa treatments in upstate New York and desperate for other medical options.
''My only hope is a course of mercury,'' she wrote.
Because Burr's progeny died off, Mr. Hardison said, ''he had nobody left to put up his shield, to tell his story.''
Gossipmongers told the story instead. Mr. Hardison owns scurrilous pamphlets accusing Burr of corruption and warning, ''the malady will spread like a pestilence.''
Burr was also suspected of having knowingly chosen pistols with a hidden advantage, a hair trigger, for the 1804 duel with Hamilton. But Hamilton probably knew all about the weapons' engineering: they belonged to his family and were used in the 1801 duel that had killed his eldest son, Philip. Mr. Hardison has brought 1970s copies of the pistols to the Grolier show.
By the 1820s Burr was shaken by grief and scandal but still practicing law, with a busy Manhattan office. ''New Yorkers did not forget that he was a good lawyer,'' Mr. Hardison said. ''They kept marching back to him.''
Researchers, including Nancy Isenberg, author of ''Fallen Founder: The Life of Aaron Burr'' (2007), have pored through Mr. Hardison's memorabilia. Ms. Isenberg illustrated her book with one of Mr. Hardison's prize possessions: Burr's French pocket watch, with face-to-face portraits of his wife and daughter.
''The pocket watch offers a rare glimpse of Burr's private world,'' Ms. Isenberg wrote in an e-mail.
Mr. Hardison has paid up to five figures per item through dealers, including William Reese and at auction houses. Burr's questionable reputation has kept the price range under six figures.
''Fortunately his name is not Alexander Hamilton, George Washington or Thomas Jefferson,'' he said. ''That's helped my budget.''
TRIBAL ART SALE
Dealers and auction house experts have been sifting through the inventory of Joseph G. Gerena, a New York tribal-art dealer with omnivorous interests who died in January at 62.
''You never once left here without learning about something completely, unexpectedly new,'' said Frederick Schultz, a dealer who is helping to empty the Gerena estate, while giving a recent tour of his friend's Manhattan gallery at 12 East 86th Street.
Mr. Gerena had packed the shelves, drawers and floors with oddities like Eskimo beads, Chinese children's chairs, fencing and diving masks, Taino stone tools, Nepalese daggers and Central Asian horse trappings. He wanted one cluster of objects kept together: about 50 pieces made by Ainu (pronounced EYE-new) villagers in northern Japan and Siberia. His family is hoping to sell that collection for $150,000.
The Ainu patterned almost everything they owned with spirals meant to ward off evil spirits. Mr. Gerena spent a decade acquiring the tribe's bone amulets, lacquered wood scabbards and prayer sticks, woven-grass purses and clothing made from chewed elm-bark fibers. He also bought 40 century-old postcards of Ainu posing for ethnologists and tourists in front of reed huts.
The collection has come on the market in time for NYC Tribal Art Week, which starts Monday. (Appointments for viewings can be made through estateofjosephgerena@gmail.com) In June, it will be displayed at the Patrick and Ondine Mestdagh gallery in Brussels.
Institutions are the target market. ''It's an instant Ainu museum department,'' Mr. Schultz said.
READY TO RIDE AGAIN
A dappled gray carousel horse has been improbably posted behind the receptionist's desk in the otherwise bland offices at 110 William Street in Lower Manhattan for the New York City Economic Development Corporation. Its black mane and forelock are mussed, an orange bridle tugs at its glossy white teeth, and one sinewy foreleg is kicked up high.
The corporation has brought out the horse as a teaser for the 1906 B&B Carousell (the misspelling is original), now undergoing restoration. (It is one of 40 sites in New York vying for votes to receive newly announced grants from Partners in Preservation.) The B&B, which the city bought for $1.8 million in 2005, is slated to spin again next year. Its shelter, a drum-shaped pavilion designed by the Rockwell Group, is under construction below the Parachute Jump at Coney Island.
Todd Goings, who runs Carousels and Carvings in Marion, Ohio, has been restoring the B&B on and off for four years. Some of the old paint layers were slopped on thickly. ''That nearly changed the size of the horse,'' he said in a recent phone interview.
Restoration has revealed a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, carved by the Lithuanian immigrant woodworker M. C. Illions, and ghostly hoof prints showing where horses had been repositioned around the carousel platform over the years. Carousels and Carvings will preserve that evidence, and the company is also reinstalling original landscape murals around the ride.
Perhaps the pavilion's only dramatic concession to modernity will be safety belts on every horse, as required by city inspectors. The belts have Velcro clasps, Mr. Goings said, rather than metal, which could chip the paint.

HEADLINE: What Apple Pays in Taxes, and Doesn't

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''How Apple Sidesteps Billions in Taxes'' (''The iEconomy'' series, front page, April 29) was enlightening, but incomplete. 
In its latest annual report, Apple said that as of last September it had a staggering $54 billion parked offshore (since grown, as The Times points out, to $74 billion). Almost all of this huge hoard is accumulated in tax havens and has never been taxed by any government. More to the point, most of these untaxed profits are almost certainly United States profits that Apple has artificially shifted offshore to avoid its United States tax responsibilities.
There's a simple way to curb this kind of corporate tax dodging, of which Apple is only one prominent example: repeal the tax rule that indefinitely exempts offshore profits from United States corporate income tax. If those profits were taxable (with a credit for any foreign taxes paid), then Apple alone would have paid an additional $17 billion in federal income taxes over the past decade. That would have tripled the federal income taxes that Apple actually paid.
Congressional scorekeepers estimate that ending the offshore corporate tax exemption would increase overall federal revenues by about $600 billion over the next decade. That's money that could be put to good use in these times of strained budgets.
ROBERT S. McINTYRE Director, Citizens for Tax Justice Washington, May 1, 2012
To the Editor:
As a shareholder of Apple, I'm very happy that it uses the tax code to reduce the taxes it pays to the United States, California and wherever. However, as an American citizen, I'm disappointed that our government provides so many opportunities for it to do so.
This story is really about the tax code, and how it needs to be amended, and not about Apple. Nor should any company be reprimanded or singled out for using all the legal opportunities to reduce taxes paid.
DICK ORENSTEIN Sarasota, Fla., April 29, 2012
To the Editor:
No way is the Apple rotten. Apple paid all its legally owed taxes. It also created a great many jobs and opportunities. It stimulated the young to pursue careers in a growing industry.
This company has picked up the torch that Steve Jobs left it, turning the world of technology on its head with its innovations.
Through this horrible recession and political polarization, Apple has been a truly bright spot for our country and the American brand. If you need to go on the attack, there are many bad actor companies that will fit the bill. Apple is not one of them.
ROBERT BOEHLKE Phoenix, April 30, 2012
To the Editor:
While it minimizes its own taxes, Apple is creating another crisis by helping to defund the infrastructure that serves the public. Consider the University of California system -- and especially the Berkeley campus in Apple's own backyard -- that produces technologies and graduates central to Apple's success.
Apple appears to care little about addressing the budget shortfalls it helps create at an exceptional but endangered public university system that serves key civic needs.
This is Apple's choice, but as a University of California alumnus, I feel that such decisions will make me carefully consider from which manufacturer I will buy my next tablet or smartphone.

HEADLINE: Plutocracy, Paralysis, Perplexity

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Before the Great Recession, I would sometimes give public lectures in which I would talk about rising inequality, making the point that the concentration of income at the top had reached levels not seen since 1929. Often, someone in the audience would ask whether this meant that another depression was imminent.
Well, whaddya know? 
Did the rise of the 1 percent (or, better yet, the 0.01 percent) cause the Lesser Depression we're now living through? It probably contributed. But the more important point is that inequality is a major reason the economy is still so depressed and unemployment so high. For we have responded to crisis with a mix of paralysis and confusion -- both of which have a lot to do with the distorting effects of great wealth on our society.
Put it this way: If something like the financial crisis of 2008 had occurred in, say, 1971 -- the year Richard Nixon declared that ''I am now a Keynesian in economic policy'' -- Washington would probably have responded fairly effectively. There would have been a broad bipartisan consensus in favor of strong action, and there would also have been wide agreement about what kind of action was needed.
But that was then. Today, Washington is marked by a combination of bitter partisanship and intellectual confusion -- and both are, I would argue, largely the result of extreme income inequality.
On partisanship: The Congressional scholars Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein have been making waves with a new book acknowledging a truth that, until now, was unmentionable in polite circles. They say our political dysfunction is largely because of the transformation of the Republican Party into an extremist force that is ''dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.'' You can't get cooperation to serve the national interest when one side of the divide sees no distinction between the national interest and its own partisan triumph.
So how did that happen? For the past century, political polarization has closely tracked income inequality, and there's every reason to believe that the relationship is causal. Specifically, money buys power, and the increasing wealth of a tiny minority has effectively bought the allegiance of one of our two major political parties, in the process destroying any prospect for cooperation.
And the takeover of half our political spectrum by the 0.01 percent is, I'd argue, also responsible for the degradation of our economic discourse, which has made any sensible discussion of what we should be doing impossible.
Disputes in economics used to be bounded by a shared understanding of the evidence, creating a broad range of agreement about economic policy. To take the most prominent example, Milton Friedman may have opposed fiscal activism, but he very much supported monetary activism to fight deep economic slumps, to an extent that would have put him well to the left of center in many current debates.
Now, however, the Republican Party is dominated by doctrines formerly on the political fringe. Friedman called for monetary flexibility; today, much of the G.O.P. is fanatically devoted to the gold standard. N. Gregory Mankiw of Harvard University, a Romney economic adviser, once dismissed those claiming that tax cuts pay for themselves as ''charlatans and cranks''; today, that notion is very close to being official Republican doctrine.
As it happens, these doctrines have overwhelmingly failed in practice. For example, conservative goldbugs have been predicting vast inflation and soaring interest rates for three years, and have been wrong every step of the way. But this failure has done nothing to dent their influence on a party that, as Mr. Mann and Mr. Ornstein note, is ''unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts, evidence, and science.''
And why is the G.O.P. so devoted to these doctrines regardless of facts and evidence? It surely has a lot to do with the fact that billionaires have always loved the doctrines in question, which offer a rationale for policies that serve their interests. Indeed, support from billionaires has always been the main thing keeping those charlatans and cranks in business. And now the same people effectively own a whole political party.
Which brings us to the question of what it will take to end this depression we're in.
Many pundits assert that the U.S. economy has big structural problems that will prevent any quick recovery. All the evidence, however, points to a simple lack of demand, which could and should be cured very quickly through a combination of fiscal and monetary stimulus.
No, the real structural problem is in our political system, which has been warped and paralyzed by the power of a small, wealthy minority. And the key to economic recovery lies in finding a way to get past that minority's malign influence.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Decline Ahead of Friday's April Employment Report

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless aid dropped by the most in nearly a year last week, easing concerns that the recovery in the labor market was stalling. 
That relief was tempered, however, by other data on Thursday showing that employment in the services sector declined in April to its lowest level since December. The report indicated that American companies were still hiring, though not as fast as they did early in the year.
''It's consistent with the idea that we're seeing moderate job growth overall,'' said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Fla.
The mixed labor market indicators came out ahead of Friday's employment report for April in which analysts expect to see a rebound in hiring during the month.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 27,000 to a seasonally adjusted 365,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday. It was the biggest weekly fall in claims since early May last year and exceeded expectations for a fall to 380,000.
Separately, the Institute for Supply Management said its services employment gauge slipped to 54.2 from 56.7 in March.
The bigger-than-expected decline in new jobless claims lifted some of the dark cloud cast on Wednesday by data from the payroll processor ADP that showed that private employers in April created the fewest jobs in seven months.
The jobless claims data falls outside the survey week for April payrolls and thus has no direct bearing on the jobs number. Economists surveyed by Reuters forecast on average that employers added 170,000 new jobs last month, an improvement over March's disappointing 120,000.
But there is a downside risk to this forecast. Initial claims were elevated for much of April and the ADP survey showed that private employers added only 119,000 jobs last month. The drop in the service sector employment gauge also adds to that risk.
The Institute for Supply Management said its index of economic activity in the services sector fell to 53.5 last month from 56.0 in March, missing economists' forecasts for a modest decline to 55.5. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for about two-thirds of American economic activity.
The forward-looking new-orders index dropped to 53.5 from 58.8. However, companies reported an increase in orders and export orders, suggesting they will need to increase production.
A report from the Labor Department showed that productivity among nonfarm workers fell in the first quarter as companies hired more people to maintain output. A moderate rise in wages suggested little pressure on company profits and inflation.
Productivity slipped at a 0.5 percent annual rate after rising at an upwardly revised 1.2 percent rate in the last three months of 2011.

HEADLINE: Wastewater Becomes Issue In Debate on Gas Drilling

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Vexed by declining revenue, officials of the Niagara Falls water utility seized on a new moneymaking idea last year: treat toxic waste from natural-gas drilling at its sewage-treatment plant once hydrofracking gets under way in New York State.
Accepting the waste would both offset the drop in revenue and help keep water rates down for customers in the economically strapped region, they reasoned. 
But the thought of having fracking fluids trucked into the city, treated and discharged into the Niagara River frightened local residents, many of whom still recall the Love Canal environmental crisis of the 1970s. In a unanimous vote, the Niagara Falls City Council blocked the plan this spring by banning the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of drilling fluids within city limits.
''We're not going to deal with this again -- a chemical disaster,'' said the council chairman, Samuel Fruscione.
As New York State environmental regulators fine-tune proposed rules governing horizontal hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a controversial natural-gas extraction process, wastewater has emerged as a challenging issue for the industry and regulators.
The drilling involves injecting vast amounts of water and chemicals into underground shale to release the gas. Should it begin in New York, the gas wells could generate hundreds of millions of gallons of toxic wastewater annually, and it is not clear where it could go.
Federal officials have warned that New York should not count on the disposal options that it now uses for salty wastewater from conventional gas wells, which produce far less waste than fracking. Most of the state's conventional drilling waste stays in New York and is sent to sewage-treatment plants like one in Auburn, N.Y., near Syracuse or is used to de-ice roads or tamp down dust on them, state regulators said. The state also sends waste to privately owned treatment plants in Pennsylvania and Ohio. In written comments on New York's proposed fracking rules, the federal Environmental Protection Agency has said that the state should ban the use of fracking brine on roads because pollutants could make their way into aquifers and waterways through infiltration and storm runoff.
The agency also warned that there was probably not enough capacity at out-of-state treatment plants to handle polluted water from New York.
The E.P.A. is currently working on national pretreatment standards for waste headed for municipal sewage-treatment plants or private treatment plants, after finding that many of them are not properly equipped to treat this type of wastewater and may be discharging pollutants to rivers and other streams.
Building new treatment plants for the fracking industry is another option, but industry representatives say that doing so would depend on whether the investment makes economic sense. Complicating matters, antifracking sentiment has already led to dozens of bans or limits on fracking-related operations, like the measure in Niagara Falls.
''Wastewater management represents a challenge to the industry,'' said John Conrad, a co-owner of P. V. E. Sheffler, an engineering and environmental consultant to energy companies that are already drilling in Pennsylvania and other states. ''A lot of treatment capacity still remains to be built.''
Environmental groups, arguing that the state is already lax in policing wastewater disposal, say that the State Environmental Conservation Department, which would issue drilling permits, must come up with an exhaustive plan to make sure that it is handled safely.
''For the D.E.C. to sidestep this issue would be an abdication of its responsibility,'' said Eric A. Goldstein, a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council and a member of a panel advising Joe Martens, the commissioner of the Environmental Conservation Department, on the fracking proposal. ''The industry's environmental track record in other states does not inspire confidence.''
The state environmental agency has already made clear that specific disposal plans must be in place before any drilling permits will be issued -- and that finding sites will be up to the gas industry.
''This is the industry's problem,'' Mr. Martens said in an interview. ''It's not the state's responsibility to identify disposal sites.''
Some industry officials played down the challenges, saying that technological advances are allowing them to recycle most of the waste. Along with more traditional methods like injection wells, which involve pumping waste into underground rock formations, new treatment plants are already coming online in Pennsylvania.
''As the development moves to New York, the infrastructure will be developed here,'' said John Holko, president of Lanape Resources, a company with interests in 500 conventional gas wells in New York, who is a spokesman for the Independent Oil and Gas Association of New York.
Casella Waste Systems, a landfill operator that is building a recycling and disposal plant for fracking waste in McKean County, in Pennsylvania, said it could easily build similar plants at two of its landfills in New York if there is sufficient demand for treatment.
Some environmental groups argue that, based on how New York now handles waste from conventional drilling, the state would be ill-prepared to deal with the enormous amount of wastewater produced by thousands of fracked wells.
Environmental Advocates of New York, a group based in Albany, plans to release a report on Friday asserting that the state does not adequately track where the waste from more than 6,800 conventional wells now operating goes. In a review of nearly 100 drilling permits, the group found that New York requests minimal information on waste disposal.
Asked about disposal plans, companies in many cases replied in vague terms, like ''hauled to an approved disposal facility,'' Environmental Advocates said.
''Following the waste stream from a well to ultimate disposal is nearly impossible,'' the group said.
State officials counter that their proposed drilling rules will impose a stringent waste tracking system.
Stuart Gruskin, a former deputy commissioner of the Environmental Conservation Department, who worked on the first draft of the rules and now does consulting work, said he had no doubt that fracking waste could in principle be disposed of safely. But finding adequate treatment capacity will be a challenge, he said.
''This is going to be a limiting factor in New York,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Stresses Concessions From China

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- American officials said early Friday that their annual summit meeting on strategic and economic issues with China had resulted in tangible economic concessions, despite the unprecedented diplomatic furor over a Chinese human-rights advocate seeking aid from American officials.
The case of the Chinese dissident, Chen Guangcheng, has overshadowed the annual strategic and economic dialogue between Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and their high-ranking Chinese counterparts. However, a senior administration official said in a telephone briefing from Beijing that China has gone further than ever in allowing competition with its powerful state-owned enterprises and creating consumption-led growth in its export-focused economy. 
The comments from Obama administration officials were aimed at showcasing the progress of the economic talks in the eyes of United States officials as separate diplomatic negotiations continued to resolve the matter of Mr. Chen. Further comments from Chinese economic negotiators are expected later on Friday in Beijing.
''Our countries have become thoroughly, inescapably interdependent,'' said Ms. Clinton as talks opened, heralding the two countries' continuing economic cooperation. ''The United States believes that a thriving China is good for America, and a thriving America is good for China.''
For the first time, according to senior American officials, Chinese policy makers said they would commit to removing advantageous financing and regulatory conditions to state-owned enterprises, a significant step forward in the eyes of the Obama administration, the official said, even though such changes might take years to implement.
''China must rely more on domestic consumption rather than exports, and more on innovation by private companies rather than capacity expansion by state-owned enterprises,'' Mr. Geithner said as the dialogue started.
China said it would review its policy of providing attractive -- and some companies say unfair -- financing for its exports. China is the biggest provider of export-credit financing, offering subsidized deals for firms buying goods from Chinese companies.
The United States, European Union, Japan and numerous other developed economies have a deal limiting the export credits a country can provide -- an agreement that China is not party to, and a point of contention for many manufacturers and servicers.
The senior administration official, speaking privately before the talks formally concluded, also said that Chinese officials had indicated a willingness to require China's state-owned enterprises to pay out more of their earnings as dividends.
The official also said that Chinese officials had agreed to allow foreign firms to take up to a 49 percent stake in joint securities ventures, up from the current limit of 33 percent, giving American financial firms great ability to invest in the country. China also agreed to make it easier for American firms to offer financing for car loans.
In return, American officials agreed to start longer-term talks on allowing Chinese firms to invest in American assets and industries, and agreed to begin negotiating a bilateral investment treaty between the two countries.
American officials in Beijing also raised the issue of China's efforts to keep its currency, the renminbi, cheap in comparison with the dollar -- making its goods relatively cheap and American goods relatively expensive.
Chinese officials in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comments.
On Thursday, the head of China's central bank said that the two countries agreed that exchange rates should ultimately be market-determined. ''The two sides have some views in common,'' said Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People's Bank of China. ''They both think that exchange rates should be determined by a market system.''
The official also praised recent Chinese policy changes to allow more foreign investment and liberalize markets, an outgrowth of closer talks, the official said.

HEADLINE: A Weight Hobbling G.M.

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- General Motors posted its ninth consecutive profitable quarter on Thursday. But almost three years after its taxpayer bailout and bankruptcy, the nation's biggest automaker still can't shed the stigma of being ''Government Motors.''
Because the Treasury Department still owns a 26 percent stake in the company, G.M. remains saddled with pay restrictions that limit its ability to recruit new talent, a ban on corporate jets, and lingering image problems in the eyes of some consumers.
Company executives usually deflect questions about the effect of government ownership on their business, or their frustration with it. But in a rare interview on the topic, G.M.'s chief executive, Daniel F. Akerson, said he longs for the day that G.M. can finally say goodbye to its biggest shareholder.
''I try not to let it bother me,'' Mr. Akerson said. ''But the fact is it does bother me.'' 
The farewell celebration won't be happening anytime soon. Based on G.M.'s current stock price of $22.37, taxpayers would lose an estimated $15 billion if the government's shares were sold today. Unless the stock rose quite significantly, the chances are slim that the Obama administration would sell its 500 million shares before the November election and invite criticism from Republicans about the wisdom of the auto industry bailout.
Mr. Akerson said he has regular conversations with Treasury officials, but has never gotten guidance on when they intend to divest. ''I don't know what the government's plan is,'' he said. ''I think it would be helpful if they would publicly state it.''
After pumping in nearly $50 billion to save G.M., American taxpayers owned about 60 percent of the company when it emerged from Chapter 11 in the summer of 2009. The government sold the bulk of its holdings at $33 a share in the company's public stock offering a year later.
But the administration is not eager to sell the rest at a loss. ''As with all of our investments, we try to balance the goals of maximizing taxpayer recoveries and exiting as soon as practicable,'' said Timothy G. Massad, the assistant Treasury secretary overseeing the Troubled Asset Relief Program. ''We don't have a specific timetable, but we'll continue to watch the market closely.''
Like partners in a three-legged foot race, both the company and the government are hobbled by their connection. Unless G.M. improves its performance and gets the stock price up, the government can't sell without losing billions. At the same time, uncertainty about the government's stake worries some investors and hurts consumer perceptions of G.M. cars.
In a survey last quarter of 30,000 Americans shopping for new vehicles, 32 percent of those who rejected a G.M. model said they would not consider buying from the carmaker because of the bailout.
While that is down from 59 percent in 2009, ''G.M. still has quite a hangover,'' said Art Spinella, president of the firm that conducted the survey, CNW Marketing Research of Bandon, Ore. ''That's a significant number of people who will buy something else because of the bailout.''
Chrysler, the other Detroit automaker to receive government aid, fared better in the most recent survey. The company paid off its federal loans last year, and just 22 percent of shoppers said they had avoided a Chrysler product because of the bailout.
Mr. Akerson said the negative feelings about G.M. were an unfortunate byproduct of the past struggles that led the company to seek government assistance.
''All we can do is put numbers on the board and hope people start to believe in our story,'' he said.
Government ownership is also affecting G.M. internally. Mr. Akerson said the company has lost a half-dozen candidates for management jobs because of salary restrictions on companies getting TARP financing. G.M.'s search for a new head of human resources lasted months because several promising contenders balked at the uncertain time frame for the government's exit.
The government's ban on corporate aircraft is mostly a matter of inconvenience for Mr. Akerson and his senior staff members. He was stuck in a Paris airport for five hours last year after missing a connecting flight to China, and often spends an entire day traveling to remote factories for visits that last two or three hours.
''It is part of the deal,'' Mr. Akerson said. ''There's no use complaining about it.''
He was more troubled by how G.M. had become, in his words, ''a political football.'' He still seethes about being called to testify before Congress in January about the safety of the Chevrolet Volt, which experienced battery fires after government crash tests. ''I think the whole thing was politically driven,'' he said.
Mr. Akerson also said he believed that politics were affecting the government's decision to hang on to its G.M. stock. President Obama has been pointing to the turnaround at G.M. as a bright spot in the nation's economy. But if Washington were to sell G.M. shares at a loss, the comeback story would be eclipsed by the cost to taxpayers for its rescue, he said.
''That's why I don't think they are going to sell in an election year,'' Mr. Akerson said. ''Right now, this is a positive for the current administration. If they sell it this year and don't get all the money back, it's not a positive.''
The presumed Republican presidential nominee, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, said in a Feb. 14 opinion article in The Detroit News that the Obama administration needed to ''act now to divest itself of its ownership position in G.M.'' But in the same article, he said the shares should be ''sold in a responsible fashion,'' without elaborating.
G.M. is not the only automaker with a lagging stock price. Shares in Ford, which weathered the recession without a bailout, have dropped almost as much as G.M.'s in the last year because of increased competition in the domestic auto market and economic troubles in Europe.
Still, if G.M. improved its sales and earnings, its share price might rise and hasten the government's exit.
The company said Thursday that it earned $1 billion in the first quarter, a 69 percent decline from the year-ago period, when it benefited from one-time gains from asset sales.
Its earnings in North America improved 30 percent during the quarter, but continued struggles in Europe dragged down overall results. While the company is introducing 20 new models worldwide this year, industry analysts say G.M. has yet to match Ford's pace in globalizing vehicle platforms to save money on product development, parts and manufacturing costs.
''It's important for people to realize that they are not done transforming themselves,'' said David Whiston, an analyst with the Morningstar investment firm. ''It is going to take more time to right the ship.''
The skepticism is not lost on Mr. Akerson, a former executive with the Carlyle Group private equity firm who took over as G.M.'s chief in mid-2010.
''We have a good company,'' he said. ''It's our job to make it great again. We know we have a lot of work to do.''
Losing the distinction of Government Motors could help it get there faster. ''But we're in a situation we can't control,'' Mr. Akerson said. ''So we have to wait.''

HEADLINE: Endorsing Romney: Bachmann's 'Easy' Choice

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
PORTSMOUTH, Va. - Since running against Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination, Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota has slowly been changing her tune about the man who has become their party's presumptive nominee. And at a rally here on Thursday with Gov. Bob McDonnell, Mrs. Bachmann officially threw her support behind Mr. Romney, calling the choice in November between him and President Obama ''very easy.'' 
''We're all here together to have a welcome party here in the Tidewater area for the next president of the United States, President Mitt Romney,'' Mrs. Bachmann said, giving her endorsement three months after quitting the race. ''I am honored to be able to be here to introduce not only Gov. Bob McDonnell, the fabulous governor of the state of Virginia, but also to lend my voice and my endorsement to Mitt Romney as our president and take the country back.''
Standing by her side, Mr. Romney said, with a smile, ''Thank you.''
Mrs. Bachmann explained her decision in simple terms.
''You see, I think for all of America, this is a very simple proposition this November - President Barack Obama, President Mitt Romney,'' said Mrs. Bachmann, who also noted that the three politicians onstage - herself, Mr. McDonnell and Mr. Romney - each have five children. ''You decide. Very easy.''
In late 2011, when she was still running against Mr. Romney, Mrs. Bachmann said that ''he has been very inconsistent in his positions.''
But in April, when it became clear that Mr. Romney would be the likely nominee, she stopped short of an endorsement, saying on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' that she was ''very seriously looking at an endorsement for Mitt Romney.''
''Mitt Romney is an extremely smart guy,'' Mrs. Bachmann said at the time. ''He's been extremely successful in creating jobs in the private economy.''
And on Thursday, Mrs. Bachmann, who has disagreed with Mr. Romney in the past on social issues like abortion, stood onstage with him against the backdrop of an enormous Virginia state flag, and said the race against Mr. Obama ''isn't personal.''
''This is about having a performance review after three and a half years,'' she said. ''When you look at 38-plus months of unemployment above 8 percent, when you look at a doubling of America's energy prices at the pump, when you look at debt accumulation in excess of $5 trillion under his watch, there is no question in my mind: Americans will go to the polls, and they'll be saying, 'Mr. President, you're fired,' and instead, we will soundly stand for someone who believes in America, who believes in our children, who believes in the hope of opportunities for this next generation.''
Mrs. Bachmann joins at least three other former Republican contenders, including Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, Tim Pawlenty, and Jon M. Huntsman Jr., in endorsing Mr. Romney. Others, including Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, have yet to formally endorse.

HEADLINE: U.S. Chose Better Path To Recovery

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Last summer, things looked bad on both sides of the Atlantic. There were fears of double-dip recessions, and stubbornly high unemployment rates. Stock markets swooned.
Now, the pictures appear very different. The unemployment rate in the United States has been steadily falling, while the unemployment rate in the euro zone has climbed to its highest level since the currency was introduced more than a decade ago. There is still some double-dip talk in the United States, but in many European countries it is a reality.
In the United States, the Institute for Supply Management said this week that its survey of manufacturers showed continued improvement. As a group, companies say that overall business is better and that new orders are doing very well. They say they expect to continue adding workers. In the euro zone, a similar purchasing managers survey indicated that conditions were deteriorating. 
In Europe this week, a meeting of finance ministers trying to negotiate details of how banks will be forced to raise capital -- and whether some countries can require their banks to have more capital -- produced no agreement but provided more reasons to doubt whether the banks are safe. In the United States, the Federal Reserve's quarterly survey of lending officers indicated that lending conditions were improving.
No one factor made the difference in the divergent paths the two continents have taken. But there are two -- both related to financial conditions -- that were very important. In each case, it appears that the United States did a much better job.
The first one concerns the banks. The huge bailouts, started in the administration of George W. Bush and continued by President Obama, worked. The banks were bailed out, and the survivors were forced to recapitalize.
The bailouts have become generally unpopular, in no small part because many banks seem to still view themselves as masters of the universe. There is nothing more grating than an ungrateful welfare recipient riding around in a chauffeured Mercedes complaining that he is not being treated fairly. But the reality then -- and now -- was that a modern economy must have a decently functioning financial system.
It was also necessary to bail out the lenders at the center of the American home mortgage system, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That, too, is unpopular in many circles, especially since there are politicians proclaiming that those two government-sponsored enterprises were the sole cause of the financial crisis. They were not, of course. Most of the really bad loans were made by privately financed lenders who believed they had little reason to care if the loans were good, since they planned to sell them immediately to investors. But Fannie and Freddie also reduced their standards in a foolish effort to maintain market share.
There is a fundamental dispute when it comes to setting bank capital standards. Requirements for high capital are often seen as discouraging lending, thus damaging an already weak economy. Too many regulators in Europe accepted that argument and delayed efforts to force banks to raise more capital. Unfortunately, whatever window of opportunity was there for them to raise capital at anything like acceptable cost has vanished with the spread of the sovereign debt crisis.
It turns out that forcing banks to raise capital can be critically important. If they turn out to need that capital, and don't have it, then lending will dry up. The American regulators applied stress tests that appear to have been adequate, while the first European round of stress tests assumed that sovereign debt was safe. If you want to destroy public confidence, solemnly asserting something that is obviously untrue is a good way to start.
That is a lesson that Europe seems to have not learned very well. In the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, bank regulators around the world agreed on an outline for new capital rules, known as Basel III. It is up to each country to adopt those rules, and that process is not going smoothly. The proposed rules in Europe call for long delays in imposition and ignore the idea that higher-than-minimum standards may be appropriate for some countries and some large banks.
The meeting of European finance ministers this week failed to get an agreement on those rules. Britain wants to be able to impose tougher rules on its own banks, but countries such as France fear that would make their own banks look bad.
''We're not implementing the Basel agreement, as anyone who takes a look at this text will be able to tell you,'' said George Osborne, the British chancellor of the exchequer. ''Every bank analyst, every financial journalist, every other finance ministry in the world would say that.'' He added, ''I am not prepared to go out there and say something that would make me look like an idiot five minutes later.''
Rather than argue with him on details, one finance minister simply asserted that looking like an idiot was standard procedure for ministers.
The other area where American policy seems to have worked better is monetary policy. The Federal Reserve's purchase of large amounts of securities -- known to some as quantitative easing -- was critical in restoring liquidity to American banks and making it possible for them to continue lending. The European Central Bank avoided disaster with its own program to pump cash into banks but, as two Morgan Stanley economists, Joachim Fels and Elga Bartsch, noted this week, that move was ''not a circuit breaker that transferred risk from the private sector to the central bank's balance sheet.'' It has bought time, but fundamental problems remain.
Of course a new crisis could reveal American banks are still undercapitalized, but they certainly are in better shape than they were. And a severe European downturn conceivably could stop the American recovery in its tracks. The Conference Board survey of consumers indicates that a plurality of Americans expects there will be fewer jobs six months from now. The disappointing jobs report that came out a month ago has revived some talk of renewed recession, even if corporate profits are booming. And the continued shrinkage of government spending, particularly at the state and local level, is obscuring the growing strength of the private sector.
The consensus forecast for the April jobs number, to be released Friday morning, is for a respectable 160,000 jobs, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. The distribution of predictions indicates that there is much more fear of a negative surprise than there is hope for a positive one.
Perhaps such fears are inevitable after a financial crisis. But as of now, there can be little doubt that the American government handled the problems of the last year far better than did its European counterparts.

HEADLINE: The Swing States: Polling Neck and Neck

BYLINE: By ALLISON KOPICKI

 BODY:
A new poll of key swing states shows a very competitive contest for President Obama and Mitt Romney in the months ahead, with the candidates tied in Ohio and Florida, and Mr. Obama leading in Pennsylvania. 
In the survey conducted by Quinnipiac University from April 25 through Tuesday, voters in the three states say the country is still in a recession, but a majority think the economy has begun to recover.
With the campaigns beginning to focus on the general election, the Quinnipiac poll asked voters about a number of potential running mates for Mr. Romney. Not surprisingly, voters in each state favored their native son, so to speak. In Florida, more than half of Republican voters said they supported the state's Senator Marco Rubio. Ohio Senator Rob Portman had the support of 3 in 10 Republicans in Ohio. Nearly 3 in 10 Pennsylvania Republicans supported Chris Christie, the governor of neighboring New Jersey, and about the same number also supported Mr. Rubio.
In Florida, support for the presidential candidates is almost evenly divided, with 43 percent supporting Mr. Obama and 44 percent supporting Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor. In late March, Mr. Obama had a lead of seven points. At 40 percent, Mr. Romney's favorability is highest in Florida, but about a quarter of voters in all three states say they have not heard enough.
Nearly half of Florida voters say Mr. Romney would do a better job on the economy, compared with 4 in 10 who say Mr. Obama would.
Ohio voters are also split over the two candidates: 44 percent support Mr. Obama and 42 percent support Mr. Romney. A March Quinnipiac poll had Mr. Obama up by six points in the state. Mr. Obama's favorable rating is higher, 46 percent to Mr. Romney's 36 percent.
A gender gap emerges in Ohio, with half of women supporting the president and 37 percent supporting Mr. Romney, and men backing Mr. Romney by a 10-point margin.
In Pennsylvania, Mr. Obama has an 8-point lead over Mr. Romney, and an even wider margin among women. Women in Pennsylvania support the president by 17 points over Mr. Romney, while men are divided: 44 percent for Mr. Romney to 41 percent for Mr. Obama.
In all three states, more voters approved than disapproved of Mr. Obama's handling of the situation in Afghanistan, and about 6 in 10 voters in each state said the United States should not be involved there.
In Florida and Ohio, about half of voters said the Supreme Court should overturn the health care law, while about 4 in 10 said it should be upheld. In Pennsylvania, voters were more closely divided, 46 to 41 percent for overturning it.
From April 25 to May 1, Quinnipiac University conducted a telephone survey of 1,169 Florida voters; 1,130 Ohio voters; and 1,168 Pennsylvania voters, all with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

HEADLINE: Mixed Signs on Recovery Send Shares Down

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks fell Thursday as economic data sent mixed signals on the recovery a day before the employment report for April.
Slower-than-expected growth in the dominant services sector drove trading. The retail sector dragged the market lower after several chains, including Target and Gap, fell when they missed April sales estimates.
Market expectations for Friday's nonfarm payroll report have fallen this week. Traders now say they suspect the economy added 125,000 to 150,000 jobs in April, less than a consensus forecast by economists of 170,000 jobs. One trader reported some talk of a number less than 100,000. 
Still, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has been flirting with new four-year highs recently, although it has struggled to rise above resistance at the 1,400 level.
Ryan Larson, head of equity trading at RBC Capital Management, said muted reactions to recent signs of economic weakness suggest some investors were counting on more monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve if the figures got worse.
''You are going back to 'bad numbers are good numbers,' '' he said, referring to the latest change in Wall Street's perception of discouraging data. ''The market will believe that Bernanke and company will have to step in,'' he added, referring to Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman
Shares of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters lost 48 percent to close at $25.87 a day after the company badly missed sales estimates for the second time in three quarters. The stock was the second-biggest drag on the Nasdaq composite index.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 61.98 points, or 0.47 percent, to close at 13,206.59. The S.& P. 500 fell 10.74 points, or 0.77 percent, to close at 1,391.57. The Nasdaq composite index lost 35.55 points, or 1.16 percent, to close at 3,024.30.
With Thursday's decline, the S.& P. 500 has fallen close to its 50-day moving average of 1,386.48. The benchmark index has retraced about 50 percent of its move off its closing low of 1,358.59 on April 10.
The S.& P. 500 slipped in April, the first monthly decline since November, as data showed signs of a slowdown in the American economy, coupled with flare-ups in the euro zone debt crisis.
In Thursday's session, retail stocks fell after several large chains missed sales estimates in April. The results were a troubling sign for consumer spending. Gap Inc. fell 1.6 percent to $28.67 while Target dropped 2.5 percent to $56.55. The S.& P. retail index lost 0.9 percent.
Initial jobless claims posted their biggest weekly drop since May 2011 and countered Wednesday's weaker report on private sector hiring.
The Institute for Supply Management's report on Thursday showed the pace of growth in the large services sector slowed more than expected in April, with drops in new orders and employment. That was in contrast to the institute's report on Tuesday, which showed manufacturing activity picked up in April.
''This is a continuation of the volatility and fits and starts we've seen in economic data, and that's causing investors to take a wait-and-see attitude,'' said Chuck Carlson, chief executive of Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Ind.
General Motors lost 2.4 percent to $22.37 after analysts said the company's North America outlook suggested that results for the first nine months of the year would fall short of expectations.
Health Net, the insurer, slid 24.9 percent to $27.26 after its profit missed expectations and it cut its forecast.
Of the 391 companies in the S.& P. 500 index reporting results, 68.3 percent have exceeded expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data through Thursday morning.
Royal DSM, a Dutch food and chemicals group, agreed to buy Kensey Nash, a medical device maker, for $360 million. News of the deal drove Kensey Nash shares up 32.1 percent to $38.33.
In the bond market, the price of the Treasury's 10-year note slipped 2/32, to 100 19/32, while its yield remained unchanged at 1.93 percent.

HEADLINE: Once Remote, Goldman Sachs Puts on a Friendly Public Face

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
After a steady stream of criticism since the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs is trying to burnish its image.
Last week, the company's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, gave rare back-to-back televised interviews to CNBC and Bloomberg Television, in which he emphasized the company's focus on clients. And on Wednesday, he spoke at a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender conference called ''Out on the Street,'' explaining the company's support for gay rights. In recent weeks, Goldman executives have been more talkative with reporters.
By stepping into the spotlight even a little, Goldman appears to be embarking on a subtle campaign to repair its reputation. The bank's message is simple: Goldman cares about its clients and its community. 
It is unclear whether such moves will change public perception, in large part because Goldman does not have a new story to tell. The financial company made a another public relations push a couple of years ago, with little success. In 2010, Goldman - still reeling from Congressional hearings, a government lawsuit and a less-than-flattering portrayal as a ''vampire squid'' in a Rolling Stone article - rolled out a series of national advertisements aimed at improving its public standing.
But with its latest effort, Goldman is taking a different tack by reaching out even though there is no blowup.
''Any time that you're engaging proactively is a good thing,'' said Michael W. Robinson, an executive vice president at Levick Strategic Communications, a public relations firm. ''The press around Goldman is never going to go down to zero, but the goal is to be less interesting and less attractive as a target.''
Goldman has long been wary of courting the public. Goldman was a private partnership until 1999. Its first public relations executive worked from his apartment in Manhattan, laboring under the principle that most press was bad press, according to a book about Goldman Sachs, ''Money and Power,'' by William D. Cohan.
In the aftermath of the financial crisis, Goldman hunkered down, as the company became the poster child for Wall Street excess. While other banking chiefs vocally defended their companies, Mr. Blankfein largely remained quiet. The company even pulled back on granting interviews for noncontentious events like quarterly earnings.
The company's top public relations official at the time, Lucas van Praag, was alternately admired and scorned for couching withering dismissals of critics in elegant phrases. Among Mr. van Praag's greatest hits were his dismissals of news articles as ''effluent,'' ''frankly, pretty stupid'' and ''chimera produced by a febrile mind.''
Now Goldman is taking its communication cues from a new executive. In March, the company hired Richard Siewert Jr., a former Clinton press secretary who was a senior adviser to Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner until last year, to head public relations.
Mr. Siewert, known as Jake, immediately faced a trial by fire.
Just before Mr. Siewert joined Goldman, the company was rebuked by a Delaware state judge for its conduct in the sale of a client, the El Paso Corporation. The judge, Chancellor Leo E. Strine Jr., criticized the investment bank for playing both sides of the deal, given that it owned a stake in El Paso's acquirer, Kinder Morgan.
Mr. Siewert's first official day on the job coincided with the publication of an article on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times by Greg Smith, a former Goldman executive who denounced a ''toxic and destructive'' environment in which some colleagues belittled clients as ''muppets.'' The piece helped rekindle the continuing debate about Goldman's practices, while stirring up strong defenses of the company within its ranks of executives and alumni.
Since then, Goldman seems to have begun a low-key charm offensive. In late April, Mr. Blankfein, appearing relaxed without a suit jacket, sat down with CNBC and Bloomberg at a company conference on emerging markets. Buoyant and smiling, he reiterated the company's client-centric philosophy, while acknowledging that the company had some work to do.
''Obviously, it has occurred to us that we haven't gotten everything right,'' he told CNBC.
Mr. Blankfein's higher profile has extended beyond television interviews. In February, he became the Human Rights Campaign's first national corporate spokesman for same-sex marriage, saying publicly what he had advocated more privately for years. On Wednesday, he elaborated on his views, telling a crowd in Midtown Manhattan that Goldman's support of gay marriage had cost it at least one prominent client.
''They didn't want to continue a relationship that they had with us in money management,'' he told the ''Out on the Street'' audience, according to news reports. He declined to name the company, but added, ''If you heard the name, it wouldn't surprise you.''
Even client-focused events, independent of public relations efforts, may engender good will. Goldman is planning a new conference, the ''Builders and Innovators Summit,'' a salon of sorts where established entrepreneurs can meet and mentor up-and-comers. The conference, scheduled for late October in Newport Beach, Calif., arose from two years of discussions with senior management about how to better engage entrepreneurs. In many ways, it harks back to Goldman's roots in helping nascent companies, including working years ago with Sears, Roebuck and Ford Motor on their public stock offerings.
''The more of this that they do, the more that they reduce anxiety about the firm,'' Mr. Robinson said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: 4 Years Later, Race Is Still Issue for Some Voters

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
STEUBENVILLE, Ohio -- This is the land of die-hard Democrats -- mill workers, coal miners and union members. They have voted party line for generations, forming a reliable constituency for just about any Democrat who decides to run for office.
But when it comes to President Obama, a small part of this constituency balks.
''Certain precincts in this county are not going to vote for Obama,'' said John Corrigan, clerk of courts for Jefferson County, who was drinking coffee in a furniture shop downtown one morning last week with a small group of friends, retired judges and civil servants. ''I don't want to say it, but we all know why.''
A retired state employee, Jason Foreman, interjected, ''I'll say it: it's because he's black.'' 
For nearly three and a half years, a black family has occupied the White House, and much of the time what has been most remarkable about that fact is how unremarkable it has become to the country. While Mr. Obama will always be known to the history books as the country's first black president, his mixed-race heritage has only rarely surfaced in visible and explicit ways amid the tumult of a deep recession, two wars and shifting political currents.
But as Mr. Obama braces for what most signs suggest will be a close re-election battle, race remains a powerful factor among a small minority of voters -- especially, research suggests, those in economically distressed regions with high proportions of white working-class residents, like this one.
Mr. Obama barely won this county in 2008 -- 48.9 percent to John McCain's 48.7 percent. Four years earlier, John Kerry had an easier time here, winning 52.3 percent to 47.2 percent over George W. Bush. Given Ohio's critical importance as a swing state that will most likely be won or lost by the narrowest of margins, the fact that Mr. Obama's race is a deal-breaker for even a small number of otherwise loyal Democrats could have implications for the final results.
Obama advisers acknowledged that some areas of the state presented more political challenges than others, but said that the racial sentiment was not a major source of worry. The campaign's strategy relies in large part on a strong performance in cities and suburban areas to make up for any falloff elsewhere among Democrats in this or other corners of Ohio.
The Obama campaign aggressively monitors any racial remarks made against the president, but officials rarely openly discuss Mr. Obama's race. The president released his birth certificate last year in an effort to quell a growing controversy about whether he is a United States citizen. He said last month that race in America was still ''complicated.''
''I never bought into the notion that by electing me, somehow we were entering into a post-racial period,'' Mr. Obama said in an interview with Rolling Stone.
''I've seen in my own lifetime how racial attitudes have changed and improved, and anybody who suggests that they haven't isn't paying attention or is trying to make a rhetorical point,'' he said. ''Because we all see it every day, and me being in this Oval Office is a testimony to changes that have been taking place.''
Researchers have long struggled to quantify racial bias in electoral politics, in part because of the reliance on surveys, a forum in which respondents rarely admit to prejudice. In 50 interviews in this county over three days last week, 5 people raised race directly as a reason they would not vote for Mr. Obama. In those conversations, voters were not asked specifically about race, but about their views on the candidates generally. Those who raised the issue did so of their own accord.
''I'll just come right out and say it: he was elected because of his race,'' said Sara Reese, a bank employee who said she voted for Ralph Nader in 2008, even though she usually votes Democrat.
Did her father, a staunch Democrat and retired mill worker, vote for Mr. Obama? ''I'd have to say no. I don't think he could do it,'' she said.
But the main quarrels Democratic voters here have with Mr. Obama have nothing to do with race. They include his rejection of one proposed route for the Keystone pipeline, a stance they say will harm this area, whose backbone, the Ohio River, is lined with metal mills and coal mines.
And the economy, on the rise nationally, is still stuck here. About one in three residents in Steubenville live in poverty, double the national rate. Shale gas, which has begun to bring profits to some counties in Ohio, has yet to take off here, and downtown is a grid of empty storefronts behind dusty glass.
''The big word was 'change,' but there's not been much of that,'' said Christopher Brown, a union leader in Steubenville, who said more than 200 of his members were still out of work. ''Members are saying, 'What has President Obama done for us?' ''
As for race, he said, ''It's not on the front table, it's in the back seat.''
Just how far back is a question no one can definitively answer. ''Race in America is always a work in progress,'' said Clement A. Price, a professor of history at Rutgers-Newark. ''It's often a proxy for social anxieties, such as this long recession, joblessness and the war abroad.''
Stephanie Montgomery, who is black and a graduate of Franciscan University in Steubenville, said her race came up so often in her job search in this area that she developed a technique for recognizing when it was happening. The sign: when warmth on the phone turns cool in person, and ''they lose eye contact with you.''
''You almost need a corporate environment to get a fair shot,'' she said while standing at a job fair in the Steubenville mall. She said that she did not vote for Mr. Obama in 2008 because she preferred Mr. McCain's more conservative platform, but that Mr. Obama seemed to be a lightning rod for criticism, in part because of his race.
''He's everything they hate,'' she said, referring to ultraconservatives. ''An affirmative-action baby. Got the Nobel Prize without deserving it.''
Many who raised race as a concern cast Mr. Obama as a flawed candidate carried to victory by blacks voting for the first time. Others expressed concerns indirectly, through suspicions about Mr. Obama's background and questions about his faith.
''He was like, 'Here I am, I'm black and I'm proud,' '' said Lesia Felsoci, a bank employee drinking a beer in an Applebee's. ''To me, he didn't have a platform. Black people voted him in, that's why he won. It was black ignorance.''
Louis Tripodi, a baker in Steubenville who voted for Mr. Obama, blames talk radio and Republican rhetoric for encouraging such attitudes. '' 'He's a Muslim, he's a socialist, he's not born in this country,' '' he said. ''It's got a lot to do with race.''
Race has also helped Mr. Obama. It increased voter turnout among blacks in 2008, and some younger voters said it was part of why they voted for him. But now that history has been made, it is less of a pull.
''It was kind of like a bandwagon that a lot of young people jumped on because it was history,'' said Dee Kirkland, a 22-year-old working in a pizza shop in nearby Yorkville. ''It was a fad to like him,'' she said, adding that ''race shouldn't hinder you, but it also shouldn't help you.''
Mr. Obama still has a number of enthusiastic supporters here. Diane Woods, the owner of Pee Dee's Brunch and Bar, a diner in downtown Steubenville, described him as ''regal, and presidential,'' and said she would vote for him again because ''when he talks, it makes sense to me.''
The fact that race came up at all in 2008 ''really showed how divided we still are,'' she said, cooking eggs one gray morning last week. ''Blacks came out to vote for the first time because he was black, and you had all these whites saying, 'Oh, there's another vote from some drug addict.' ''
Mr. Corrigan, who supports Mr. Obama, said he believed that the president would ultimately win this mostly Democratic county but that it would be very close, a prediction he said was underscored by a recent flurry of Republican visits. Rick Santorum came here twice during his campaign, and Gov. John R. Kasich, a Republican, gave his annual address here this winter.
''It's going to be a nail-biter,'' said Mr. Brown, the union official.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about President Obama's race as a continuing issue for some voters referred imprecisely to his position on the Keystone pipeline, one of the main quarrels that some Democrats have with him. While the president rejected TransCanada's earlier application to build the full pipeline from Canada to the gulf coast, he has made no final decision on whether the project will go forward. (The president, who has invited the company to submit another plan, said he rejected the earlier plan because a Congressional mandate that called for him to decide by mid-February did not allow adequate time to complete environmental reviews.)

HEADLINE: Dissident's Plea For Protection Deepens a Crisis

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER, JANE PERLEZ and STEVEN LEE MYERS; Mark Landler and Steven Lee Myers reported from Washington, and Jane Perlez from Beijing. Reporting was contributed by Sharon LaFraniere and Michael Wines from Beijing, Andrew Jacobs from New York, and Ashley Parker from Portsmouth, Va. Edy Yin, Li Bibo and Mia Li contributed research from Beijing.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng's abrupt reversal and plea for protection from the United States has deepened a diplomatic crisis and exposed the Obama administration to withering criticism that its diplomats miscalculated when they negotiated his departure from the American Embassy in Beijing.
Mr. Chen's request for help from Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton -- repeated in an urgent telephone call played on speaker during an emergency Congressional hearing on Thursday -- frayed a fragile deal American officials negotiated a day before the start of high-level talks between China and the United States.
Mr. Chen has now proposed that he and his family be allowed to visit the United States temporarily, rather than request permanent asylum there, according to an American lawyer, Jerome A. Cohen, who has advised him this week. The proposal, Mr. Cohen said, could be a face-saving solution for China, defusing a situation that threatens relations between the two countries. 
As the State Department tried frantically to reassess the options for Mr. Chen, who is now at a hospital in Beijing being treated for an injured foot, senior American officials privately acknowledged missteps in the handling of the case. The United States failed to guarantee access to Mr. Chen at the hospital, they said, leaving him isolated and fearful that China would renege on its pledge not to harass him and to allow him to resume his legal studies.
The diplomats also rushed their negotiations with the Chinese government to try to resolve the situation before the start of two days of talks with China on economic and security issues, led by Mrs. Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, these officials said. That left no time to obtain firm, detailed assurances from Chinese officials on how they would treat Mr. Chen, a blind lawyer and activist who had been exposed to years of house arrest and beatings in his home village in eastern China and last month escaped to the United States Embassy in Beijing.
With Mr. Chen expressing fears for his safety and pleading for President Obama to intercede on his behalf, the administration faced a barrage of criticism from Republican lawmakers and human rights activists that its bungled handling of the case had left one of China's most prominent dissidents at the mercy of the Chinese police.
The Chen case has rapidly become an issue on the campaign trail, with Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, accusing the American diplomats of racing to reach an agreement with China and then failing to verify it.
''We've heard some disturbing things from across the world that suggest that, potentially, if the reports are true, some very troubling developments there,'' he said on Thursday in Portsmouth, Va. ''If these reports are true, this is a dark day for freedom and it's a day of shame for the Obama administration.''
The administration defended its actions, saying it had made extraordinary efforts to bring Mr. Chen to safety inside the embassy and honor his wishes once there. Mr. Chen, officials said, had left of his own free will after a plan had been worked out with the Chinese government that he and his family could relocate to a city close to Beijing where he would pursue his law studies.
''At no point during his time in the embassy did Mr. Chen ever request political asylum in the U.S.,'' said the White House press secretary, Jay Carney. ''And at every opportunity, he expressed his desire to stay in China, reunify with his family, continue his education and work for reforming his country. All of our diplomacy was directed at putting him in the best possible position to achieve his objectives.''
Guo Yushan, a friend of Mr. Chen's who spoke to him by phone Thursday night, said Mr. Chen was not interested in seeking asylum outside the country; his desire, he said, was to go to the United States for a few months and then return to China. ''He never complained, either directly or indirectly, that the American Embassy had 'forced' or induced him to leave the embassy,'' Mr. Guo wrote on Twitter and Weibo, a Chinese microblog service. ''He left the embassy voluntarily and appreciates from his heart the American Embassy's help during the past week.''
The messy fraying of the diplomacy has put the administration's top China advisers under scrutiny -- as well as its broader policy, which has treated human rights concerns as one issue among many in the complex relationship between the United States and China.
The two Americans who led the negotiations -- Kurt M. Campbell, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, and Harold H. Koh, the State Department's legal adviser -- are seasoned diplomats. Mr. Koh, a former dean of Yale Law School, is a prominent legal scholar on human rights issues. Mr. Campbell has deep Asian experience, though he is viewed as more of an expert on Japan than China.
Gary Locke, the American ambassador to China who was also a crucial negotiator, is a Chinese-American lawyer, former Commerce secretary and governor of Washington. But he is working in China for the first time.
In Washington, the Obama administration lost two of its most experienced China experts with the departure this year of Jeffrey A. Bader as senior director for Asia at the National Security Council, and James B. Steinberg as deputy secretary of state.
By contrast, the lead negotiator for China, Cui Tiankai, the vice minister for foreign affairs, has worked on the United States for more than three decades.
On Capitol Hill, lawmakers and human-rights activists questioned the administration's actions and assailed China's record of human-rights abuses. Speaking at a hearing of a commission on China, Representative Frank R. Wolf, Republican of Virginia, said, ''it is hard to comprehend why the administration would accept at face value assurances that Chen would be safe upon exiting U.S. protection.''
At one point, the commission's chairman, Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey, left the room and returned to announce that Mr. Chen was on the phone from his hospital room in Beijing.
Mr. Chen reiterated his desire to travel to the United States, though not necessarily to seek asylum. ''I want to meet with the Secretary Clinton,'' he said in remarks translated by Bo Fu, a Christian pastor who has championed Mr. Chen and others facing repression in China. ''I hope I can get more help from her.''
Several China experts noted that the State Department team also could have anticipated that a verbal agreement with China's Foreign Ministry, which is not considered among the most powerful organizations inside the Chinese bureaucracy, would not necessarily constrain the actions of security forces. Plainclothes security officers moved in and restricted access to Mr. Chen shortly after he left the American Embassy and entered a Beijing hospital, causing him to worry for his safety soon after he gave up American protection.
Privately, administration officials acknowledged they had not followed through at the hospital, where Mr. Chen, after talking to his wife, began to fear for the safety of his family, and where their access to him remained restricted on Thursday.
In retrospect, the officials said, the American negotiators could also have paid more attention to Mr. Chen's wife, Yuan Weijing, and the effects of her reunification with her husband in the hospital, American officials said.
Mr. Chen told reporters and friends in telephone calls from the hospital that he was outraged by threats his wife had received from security guards at their house after he escaped.
''The opportunity for a tactical victory was very powerful,'' said Christopher K. Johnson of the Center for Strategic and International Studies who until recently was a senior China analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency. ''Looking at the possible strategic downside didn't occur to them.''
Mr. Cohen, the lawyer and an expert in Chinese law, said Mr. Chen's mood swung wildly at the hospital, something the Americans failed to anticipate. ''They may have relied too much on his emotional stability,'' he said. ''And they should have at least negotiated to have stayed with him at the hospital overnight.''
One person who knows Mr. Chen said it was not surprising that he became unnerved once American officials left, after days of marathon negotiations, all conducted through translators.
After years of living in semi-solitary confinement, his fears appeared to have been magnified in the unfamiliar environment. He was also upset that his dinner was not delivered by 9 p.m. Wednesday, telling a friend that ''retaliation'' had begun.
On Thursday night, Mr. Chen appeared to temper some of his earlier statements, in particular his assertion that American diplomats had pressured him into leaving the embassy. The comments suggested that Mr. Chen was not fully aware of the crisis his comments caused the day before. ''He was totally astonished by this and felt very sorry for the pressure on the American Embassy created by these reports,'' Mr. Guo wrote.

HEADLINE: Structural Unemployment and Good Jobs

BYLINE: LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON


HIGHLIGHT: Inadequate demand -- rather than mismatches between job requirements and skills -- is the major reason for the elevated unemployment rate, an economist writes. But even as the jobless rate declines, skill requirements for good jobs will continue to rise. 

 BODY:
Despite several quarters of growth in private-sector employment, the American economy is still far from full employment. The primary reason is weak aggregate demand, the painful and predictable consequence of a deep balance-sheet recession. 
The number of private-sector jobs remains nearly five million below the pre-recession peak, and the unemployment rate remains well above the 5 to 6 percent range that most economists judge as "normal" or "structural" when the economy is operating near capacity. 
The unemployment rate would be even higher if labor force participation rates were not hovering near historic lows, and if more workers were not settling for part-time jobs because full-time jobs are unavailable.

Yet as the labor market continues its agonizingly slow recovery, there are numerous reports that job openings are going unfilled because of mismatches between the skill requirements of employers and the skills of unemployed workers. 
These reports have led to a debate about whether such mismatches, rather than a shortfall of demand, explain both the outsize increase in unemployment in the Great Recession and the disappointing pace of recovery. 
This debate is not just of academic interest; it has significant implications for policy - both macroeconomic policy and labor market policy. 
Recent assessments of the evidence by Janet Yellen, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, and by Jesse Rothstein and experts at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco conclude that cyclical rather than structural forces are the main reason for the loss of jobs during the recession and the elevated unemployment rate since then. 
Large job losses in 2008-9 were widespread across industries, locations, occupations and skills, and in keeping with the standard pattern of recessions, highly cyclical industries were particularly hard hit. 
Moreover, the relationship between the unemployment rate and the job vacancy rate - the so-called Beveridge curve - has been consistent with patterns in previous recoveries. 
Nor is there evidence of a larger-than-usual increase in mismatches between employer needs and worker skills. Such mismatches constrain output and employment even when the economy is operating at full employment, and they become larger during recessions, reflecting greater churn in the labor market as workers move between shrinking and expanding sectors. 
That said, even if the overall structural unemployment rate is not much higher today than it was before the recession, at 5 to 6 percent, significant costs remain in terms of forgone employment and output. And the structural unemployment problem is a more severe problem for workers with low levels of education and skills. 
Although workers of all education and skill levels were hit by the recession, those with less education and fewer job-related skills experienced especially high rates of job loss and much higher unemployment rates. The unemployment rate for workers over the age of 25 who do not have a high-school diploma is about 13 percent, compared with about 4 percent for workers in the same age group with a college degree or higher. 
Even before the recession, rapid technological change and globalization were making it more difficult for many workers, especially those with low levels of educational attainment and skills, to find good jobs. 
These long-term shifts were apparent not in the overall unemployment rate but in the quality of jobs and in the polarization of job opportunities. When aggregate demand was stronger, more Americans were getting jobs. 
But good jobs that did not require at least some post-secondary education or specialized training were becoming increasingly scarce, driving workers without the requisite skills into lower-wage jobs or out of the labor force altogether. 
The decline in middle-skill jobs was especially harmful to the earnings and labor force participation of workers without a college degree, especially men. Over the last four decades, the annual earnings of the median man with only a high-school diploma declined by 46 percent - a decline unprecedented in duration and size. 
As the economy recovers, global competition and skill-biased technological change will drive the skill requirements of good jobs even higher. And if the level of educational attainment does not keep pace (a disturbing trend since the late 1970s), the median wage will continue to decline; wage inequality, a major source of income inequality, will widen further; and the structural unemployment rate may well increase. 
Moreover, the shortage of workers with the requisite skills will undermine the competitiveness of the American economy as a location for high-value-added activities.
To counter these adverse trends, it is essential to invest more in education and training to bolster the skills, productivity and mobility of the labor force both to meet the needs of employers and to provide more workers with good job opportunities. 
The integration of poorly educated workers - particularly those with a high school education or less - into the work force will be an increasing challenge. Sector-specific programs that link the training of participants to the needs of employers are proving to be an effective way to provide relevant postsecondary education for such workers.
Successful programs often rely on input from or partnerships with company and industry partners to design courses, to provide internships and apprenticeships, and to encourage workers to invest in courses and fields of study required by available jobs.
Cooperating with local business leaders, community colleges, which account for nearly half of all college enrollments, can play a major role in the design and delivery of such programs. 
The "Right Skills Now" program championed by President Obama's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness (on which I served) is an example of such a business-community college partnership. The training program was designed in partnership with the National Association of Manufacturers and allows individuals to earn college credit along with a nationally portable industry certification in manufacturing skills. 
Unfortunately, projected steep cuts in federal, state and local funds for education and training threaten the future of such programs. 
Finally, it is important to note that the skills of the new workers entering the labor force during the next decade will depend on the education of today's children and youth. And there are some very worrisome trends. 
The fraction of Americans with more education than their parents of the same sex is falling. The United States ranks 23rd out of 28 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in high school graduation rates and 14th in college graduation rates.
The percentage of children living in poverty in the United States has increased to about 22 percent, and the gap between the educational attainment of children raised in rich and poor families is large. Children raised in poverty are more likely to drop out of high school and less likely to complete college. 
The inequality in the educational opportunities of children is stark: the best 10 percent of American students do at least as well on international test scores as students from top-ranked Singapore, while students from poor schools with high concentrations of poverty perform as poorly as students from low-income countries like Indonesia. 
As a recent McKinsey report said, "The gaps in education by income in the U.S. impose the economic equivalent of a permanent national recession." Even if the economy recovers fully from the Great Recession, this long-term economic slowdown will persist and worsen over time unless the glaring inequalities in educational and training opportunities are addressed.

HEADLINE: Where Do We Go From Here?

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: It's tempting to look at Friday's weak jobs report and conclude that the economy has entered a significant new slowdown. But it may not be correct. 

 BODY:
 It's tempting to look at Friday's weak jobs report and conclude that the economy has entered a significant new slowdown. But it may not be correct.
 Just as sober economists understood that the burst of economic growth and hiring at the end of late 2011 and start of 2012 was probably fleeting, there is reason to think the weak growth of the last two months may not last, either. The true underlying trend may be somewhere between the good news of January and February (caused in part by warm weather, which pulled forward various spending) and the disappointing news of March and April (because some spending that would normally have happened then instead happened earlier). 
 If so, the coming months would bring roughly 175,000 net new jobs per month, on average. A pace of 175,000 would be fast enough to reduce unemployment, though not very quickly. The economy would remain years away from a full recovery from the financial crisis.
 Politically, a pace of 175,000 jobs a month would probably be a modest help to President Obama, based on historical patterns. Job growth of more than 200,000 a month, by comparison, would seem to make him a true favorite, while job growth of around 100,000 - like in today's report - would seem to make Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, the favorite.

These political thresholds are based on work by my colleagueNate Silver, who suggests that 150,000 jobs a month is the rough dividing line between the pace that helps and hurts an incumbent.
 There is obviously some chance the recent slowdown is more than just a blip and that the economy has entered a new weak phase. But it is harder to make that argument based on the recent data, like a sharp drop in initial jobless claims in late April (after the period covered by Friday's jobs report). A new slowdown would instead probably be caused by another round of bad news, like a rise in gas prices, or a vicious cycle in which the recent weak news spooks consumers and businesses.
 It's also possible, of course, that the economy will accelerate fairly rapidly in coming weeks. The best evidence for the optimistic case would combine this week's strong report on jobless claims with the fact that the average monthly job growth over the last six months, even after Friday's disappointment, is still almost 200,000.
 But perhaps the best reason to assume the middle course is that it fits the same narrative about the economy that has applied to the last several months.
 Here's Annie Lowrey of The New York Times, writing in late December, after a spate of strong economic data:
As the fourth quarter draws to a close, a spate of unexpectedly good economic data suggests that it will have some of the fastest and strongest economic growth since the recovery started in 2009, causing a surge in the stock market and cheering economists, investors and policy makers 
But the good news also comes with a significant caveat. Many forecasters say the recent uptick probably does not represent the long-awaited start to a strong, sustainable recovery. Much of the current strength is caused by temporary factors.
 And here's Ms. Lowrey last month:
Some of the same spoilers that interrupted the recovery in 2010 and 2011 have emerged again, raising fears that the winter's economic strength might dissipate in the spring .
Forecasters have said that the trends point to a moderation of economic growth in the United States, but they still expect the recovery to continue this year. The slowdown in part reflects an unusually warm winter, which pulled forward economic activity, making January and February seem artificially good and perhaps making recent weeks look worse than they truly were.

Grade Level of Students: Secondary (ages 14-18)
Idea: Current Event Fridays, one period a week devoted to using New York Times articles to spark interest in staying informed and using different sources for information.
Why We Chose It: Any use of Times content that makes students so eager for school that they lament a day off is worth sharing.
What Ms. McAninch Did and Why, in Her Own Words
Knowing what is going on in the world is critical. My students, like most their age, are experts at playing games and using social media, but I want them to learn how to use technology to stay informed about the world around them. I want it to become second nature, just like checking their e-mails and Facebook accounts. But the local paper runs once a week and contains only local news and issues.
While keeping up with the local news is important, we live in an instantaneously updating global world. The advances in technology have allowed for us to learn of breaking news and stories within minutes, instead of days or weeks - the norm only a few generations ago. I want my students to get in the habit of using the Internet and various media outlets to keep up with current events and learn how incidents that happen in other states and countries affect them here in Saint Jo, Tex. (population less than 1,000).
I want my students to learn early on how the economy in Europe can affect the economy in America, or why it is important to have a vested interest in politics, no matter what side of the aisle you are on. I want them to see both the macro and micro picture of the world and how the world is becoming smaller every day with the advances in technology - as my students saw in the article, "Many U.S. Immigrants' Children Seek American Dream Abroad."
Two stories were standouts in my class this year: One about universities screening athletes' social media and the other the obituary for Steve Jobs.
Why Choose The New York Times?
I chose The New York Times because I want my students to habitually check creditable information, and because the free access to online content in The Times, via The Learning Network, makes it easy. Many other media outlets require you to be a paying member to access information.
How We Analyze Articles
The students must answer the standard journalistic questions about their article:

        
Who is the article about?
        
What is the article about?
        
When did the event in the article take place?
        
Where did the event in the article take place?
        
Why is the event in the article in the event important?
        
How does the event in the article affect you?
While the questions seem pretty simple and basic, they make the students engage in topics they generally wouldn't be exposed to. The Times has helped the students learn how to digest higher-level reading material. With Texas having new state testing (Staar) and new regulations (timed test and limited writing length), the weekly Times assignment has helped the students prepare for the new test.
[Editor's note: Our 6 Q's About the News feature asks these same basic questions about a new article each weekday.]
The Results
When we first began our Current Events Friday it was like pulling teeth. 
Once my students began to realize that some of the events in the articles are important to them and there is information in it they care about (as they did with this article about biofuels), they have become more excited about the day. They come in and immediately get on The Times's Web site and search for the perfect article.
I knew the project was successful when I had a student tell me she was disappointed we would not do the Times article since we didn't have school on a Friday. Another student told me the highlight of his weekend was adding the Times application to his smart phone. He now comes in and regularly tells me what he has read in The Times.
My students have also begun to lead class discussions over the issues in their articles. They are learning to form opinions based on facts, not on opinions they saw on television. They are also learning that others in the classroom, including their best friends, may disagree with them. They are also learning through these classroom discussions why it is so great to live in America and to be able to express your opinion. 
I have tried to emphasize that they should choose articles that are out of their comfort zones since as a teacher, my goal is for my students to leave my classroom with new knowledge on a daily basis. I know that on Fridays they are leaving with knowledge that will help them for the rest of their lives.
Other Uses for Times Content
The Times has also become a staple in my classroom for my freshman Business Information Management classes. We use it every Friday.
The first couple of weeks of the project, I chose five Times articles on a variety of subjects, wrote their titles on the blackboard and summarized them to help the students choose. The students have one complete class period (48 minutes) to choose an article, then to type a one page summary of the article. 
After a couple of weeks one of my students asked if she could choose her own article. I was worried my students would just search for the shortest article possible, but they have gone above and beyond with our weekly Times articles. Not only do they not search for the shortest article, some of them have had issues choosing just one. As an educator, I must say it is a great problem to have.
Do you want your students to choose their own Times articles to read and respond to, just as Shelly McAninch's students did? If so, you might be interested in our Third Annual Summer Reading Contest, which is scheduled from June 15 to Aug. 17. Each week students 13-25 are invited to write in and tell us what article interested them most in The Times that week. Each week we also choose a favorite response to feature on the blog. Spread the word!

HEADLINE: Unemployment, Beyond the Rate

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: By a broad measure of unemployment, including discouraged and underemployed workers, 23 million Americans are looking for jobs. 

 BODY:
The unemployment rate is a measuring stick with many problems, one of which is that it tends to shift our focus from a human tragedy to the measuring stick itself, as if we were discussing the level of water in a reservoir.
It is important to remember that we're talking about people: almost 23 million Americans couldn't find full-time work in April.
The widely quoted "unemployment rate" of 8.1 percent reflects only the red portion of this chart, the 12.5 million people who did not work in April, and actively searched for new work. A broader "unemployment rate," which carries the catchy name U6, includes all the people in this chart, and stands at 14.5 percent.
That is a much more accurate measure of unemployment, but it too has defects. One technical caveat is that the count of people who looked for work in the last year but not in the last month, shown on this chart in green and known to labor experts as "marginally attached," is not seasonally adjusted.
(Seasonal adjustments seek to exclude recurring fluctuations, like holiday hiring or the surge of summer interns, to highlight underlying trends.)
So the margin of error is slightly larger, and you won't find this particular mash-up on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Web site. I made it myself. You're welcome.

HEADLINE: Marine Ecosystem Pledges Unmet, Data Shows

BYLINE: DAVID JOLLY


HIGHLIGHT: Despite a 10 percent goal for 2020, just 1.6 percent of marine areas have been set aside for protection. 

 BODY:
Countries have made little progress in meeting their obligations to protect fragile marine ecosystems under the international Convention on Biological Diversity, new United Nations data shows.
Just 1.6 percent of the oceans has been set aside for marine protected areas, according to new data provided to The Times by the World Conservation Monitoring Center, part of the United Nations Environment Program. That is far below the 10 percent that nations had agreed to set aside by 2020 at a meeting in Japan in October 2010.
The latest data, while disappointing, could help to shape the debate next month at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, known as Rio+20, in Rio de Janeiro. Ocean conservation will be an important topic at the conference, whose two main themes are ''a green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication" and an "institutional framework for sustainable development.''
If nations are going to keep their promises and the needs of a booming global population are to be met, the statistics ''point to an urgency of decisive and defining action now rather than in a few years' time," said Nick Nuttall, a spokesman for the United Nations Environment Program. The world population is expected to expand from seven billion now to nine billion by 2050.
Marine protected areas and other such reserves provide relief to ecosystems threatened by overfishing, habitat destruction, pollution and global warming. But creating them is a political challenge; closing an area to activities like fishing and oil exploration can have immediate effects on jobs and investment, even when the longer-term environmental argument is compelling.
Just three-hundredths of 1 percent of the high seas, which make up 61 percent of the world oceans, have so far been set aside, the new data show. Since nations do not actually control that space, they must work cooperatively to assure its protection, and there has been little progress to date.
Among the world's maritime states, the United States has been relatively aggressive, creating about 1,600 marine protected areas.
One initiative currently under way aims to create what would be the world's largest network of marine reserves in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica. Currently, the largest such area is the 210,000-square-mile Chagos Islands marine reserve in the Indian Ocean.
For now, the World Conservation Monitoring Center says, just 4 percent of the marine areas under national jurisdictions (stretching 200 nautical miles from their coasts) are covered. That includes 3.5 percent of nations' exclusive economic zones, which stretch 12 to 200 nautical miles offshore. The picture is slightly better for coastal waters, those stretching to 12 nautical miles offshore, with about 7.2 percent protected.
A breakdown of 232 marine ecoregions showed that by 2010, only 30 such areas had 10 percent set aside for protection, the 2020 target of the biodiversity convention, while the majority, 137, had less than 1 percent of their area set aside for protection.
 ''Although the proportion of marine ecoregions that meet the 10 percent target has increased from 3 percent to 13 percent within 20 years, it seems unlikely that the 10 percent target can be met in all ecoregions by 2020,'' the World Conservation Monitoring Center said.

HEADLINE: An Indie Impresario, Who Made His Mark Fast and Memorably

BYLINE: MANOHLA DARGIS


HIGHLIGHT: Adam Yauch's slate at Oscilloscope Pictures felt less bought and more curated and very quickly, the company became synonymous with smart, interesting work. 

 BODY:
Adam Yauch, who died Friday of cancer at 47, was one of the best things to happen to American independent cinema in years. In February 2008, when Mr. Yauch announced the arrival of his distribution company, Oscilloscope Pictures, which he founded with David Fenkel, it sent a jolt through the indie world. An offshoot of Mr. Yauch's Oscilloscope Laboratories, his and Mr. Fenkel's new film division entered the fray right on the heels of a very strong Sundance Film Festival, when to many of us everything still looked so right in the indie business.
At the time, studio divisions like Paramount Vantage were releasing titles like "There Will Be Blood," which along with independent films like Todd Haynes's fractured ode to Bob Dylan "I'm Not There," had been nominated for numerous Academy Awards. The lunatics had taken over the asylum or so it seemed. Not long after Oscilloscope Pictures came on the scene, though, Warner Brothers shut down the first of several of its specialty divisions and the indie world began to shrink as one after another studio dependents (Warner Independent Pictures, Paramount Vantage) disappeared or withered away. Oscilloscope, though, was operating on a different frequency, far from the Hollywood hum, which showed as it started to pick off-Hollywood titles like the documentaries "Flow" (about the water crisis) and "Frontrunners" (about a student union race at Stuyvesant High School in New York).
The titles kept getting better and in 2008 Oscilloscope bought one of its finest films, Kelly Reichardt's "Wendy and Lucy," about a young woman (Michelle Williams) struggling to hang on to hope and her dog, Lucy, in hard economic times. In May 2009, Mr. Yauch traveled to the Cannes Film Festival for the first time with the movie. "I was glad to see everyone in tuxes and ball gowns going up the red carpet," he wrote in an email at the time. "I was afraid that the photos I've seen of Grace Kelly and Cary Grant would have faded into history like everything else, and that people would be walking into premieres in shorts, T-shirts and Crocs. So I was impressed when I saw a man in a suit turned away because he was wearing sneakers. Perhaps Cannes is the last bastion of dignified decadence."

Certainly Oscilloscope seemed a model of the serious if not self-serious film company. Its titles were far flung, originating from across the globe - fiction films like "The Maid" and "The Messenger," documentaries like "Scott Walker: 30 Century Man" and "Youssou N'Dour: I Bring What I Love" - and consistently if not fetishistically nonmainstream. Whenever Mr. Yauch attended Sundance, it was common to see him emerge from screenings of some of the decidedly less commercial offerings, foreign language films and unconventional work that Oscilloscope would sometimes later pick up. Its slate felt less bought and more curated and very quickly, the company became synonymous with smart, interesting cinema. When you saw its name, you knew that you wanted to see the film, too.
Mr. Yauch's enthusiasm about film along with all those titles were part of why so many in independent cinema, even nominal rivals, embraced his entrance into this difficult, sometimes fractious world. Later in 2009, when my colleague A.O. Scott and I asked him about the momentous change that were rocking this world, and whether independent cinema had any kind of future to speak of, Mr. Yauch wrote another e-mail: "I believe that there is some middle ground. That you can make interesting, creative, informative films that will appeal to a wide audience. Maybe I'm an idealist, but I don't think you need to feed people these lowest common denominator films to get them out of the house. There are people who are interested in going out to the movie theater to see 'Moon' or 'Wendy and Lucy.'
"That being said, we are hoping to get the rights to make 'Coyote Ugly 4, this time they're in the Marines."

HEADLINE: Answering Questions About Clouds and Climate

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: A reporter responds to queries about climate change, scientific research, policy action or lack thereof, and a minority that firmly argues that clouds will protect the planet. 

 BODY:
This week The Times invited readers' questions on a long article exploring the possibility that clouds will offset some of the global warming being caused by the human release of greenhouse gases. The author of the article, Justin Gillis, responds to a sampling below. (Some of the questions have been combined or edited slightly for clarity.)
Q.
A.
It's an interesting question and gets at an issue I didn't have room to cover in the article. The earth has in fact been considerably warmer in the past, and the best evidence suggests that higher levels of carbon dioxide were a central reason. Go back in time far enough and you can find eras when palm trees grew in what is now the Arctic.

Much more recently, during the Pliocene about three million years ago, carbon dioxide was roughly at the level humans are now putting into the air, and that climate was considerably warmer than today, with virtually no land ice in the Northern Hemisphere and sea levels at least 15 feet higher than the modern level. 
As you seem to have guessed, many scientists do in fact think these past climates rule out the possibility that the earth could be as insensitive to greenhouse gases as Richard Lindzen and other skeptics believe. But, even if you accept that, it doesn't necessarily tell us much about the time scale on which the earth adjusts to higher carbon dioxide. Are we going to have a sea-level crisis in 50 years, or 3,000 years? That's a pretty big difference for somebody trying to create government policy.
Q.
A.
 This is another excellent question, and it's somewhat related to the question above. What we know is that the modest warming of the planet that has already occurred has started to melt land ice in Greenland, West Antarctica and a large majority of the world's high mountain glaciers. Scientists think the Arctic is especially sensitive, and many of them are not sure the Greenland ice sheet can survive much additional warming. 
If the Greenland ice sheet goes, that's more than 20 feet of global sea-level rise. But again, we do not know the time scale on which it would happen. Many scientists have told me it would have to be hundreds of years, if not thousands. But they are nervous about Greenland, and getting more so as the melting seems to accelerate.
Q.
A.
As I pointed out in the article, skeptical scientists are having a big influence on the political discussion of global warming in the United States, even if they are few in number and even if the published science supporting their case is not voluminous. 
Given that political influence, we thought it was important to give readers the best sense we could of the evidence behind their arguments as well as the reaction to that evidence by the scientific majority. We invite readers to draw their own conclusions, as you have clearly done, about how much stock to put in the skeptics' evidence.
Q.
A.
 I know this is a rhetorical question, but I can't help pointing out that Kerry Emanuel, a scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, tackled it directly in a post I wrote earlier in the week. He thinks the average person has a hard time caring about the future two or more generations downstream, and experience so far may suggest he is right.
Q.
A.
The article didn't mention the source of funding for any of the scientists who were quoted, including those holding up the mainstream side of the argument over climate change. I'm not a big believer in the idea that scientists tailor their research to suit their funders. I've met a lot of them over the years, and even on controversial issues like climate change, they generally strike me as well-motivated people who are searching for the truth, not puppets. 
But that said, I'm not entirely nave about the role of fossil-fuel money in the climate debate. Since you ask specifically about Dr. Lindzen, he told me that he needs, and gets, no funding these days beyond his M.I.T. salary. 
He does acknowledge accepting some small lecture fees and expense payments from coal and oil companies in the 1990s (a history that he says has been misrepresented in some past articles and blogs). As with other scientists in his field, he says that almost all his research money over the years came from the science-funding agencies of the federal government. Here is a more complete statement from Dr. Lindzen on the issue.
Q.
A.
 This question seems fairly unrelated to clouds and climate, but the vineyards-in-Britain meme comes up so often in climate-skeptic literature that I will bite and answer you. The idea of vineyards as a proxy for climate has always struck me as strange, given that their location is influenced at least as much by economics, social custom and changing technology for producing wine as it is by climate. 
But, if vineyards in Britain are as good a climate proxy as you seem to believe, then the evidence would suggest we have entered into an unprecedented period of warming. Gavin Schmidt of NASA dissects the issue here.
Q.
A.
 For the uninitiated, Dr. Svensmark is a Danish scientist who is trying to make a case that the earth's climate is strongly influenced by cosmic rays through the effect that those rays may have on cloud formation. I didn't mention him for the simple reason that even though some of his evidence is interesting, the case that modern-day climate change has anything to do with cosmic rays is a long, long way from proven. 
Once again, Gavin Schmidt dissects the argument here, with an update here. And on the same blog, RealClimate, Jeffrey Pierce of Dalhousie University got way above the clouds, so to speak, in this post seeking to explain the basics of this issue.
Q.
A.
The oddest thing about this situation is that we have already decided, by formal international treaty, what our policy is supposed to be. 
The administration of the first George Bush committed the United States to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, pledging to join other countries in adopting policies that would stabilize greenhouse gases in the atmosphere "at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system." 
But in 20 years of effort, the United States has not adopted emissions limits that would actually put that policy into effect, beyond some modest recent efforts by the Obama administration. And global negotiations haven't gone so well either.

HEADLINE: Elizabeth Warren's Birther Moment

BYLINE: KEVIN NOBLE MAILLARD


HIGHLIGHT: The Republican approach to race is to feign that it is irrelevant - until it becomes politically advantageous to bring it up. 

 BODY:
If you are 1/32 Cherokee and your grandfather has high cheekbones, does that make you Native American? It depends. Last Friday, Republicans in Massachusetts questioned the racial ancestry of Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic Senate candidate. Her opponent, Senator Scott Brown, has accused her of using minority status as an American Indian to advance her career as a law professor at Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Texas. The Brown campaign calls her ties to the Cherokee and Delaware nations a "hypocritical sham."
In a press conference on Wednesday, Warren defended herself, saying, "Native American has been a part of my story, I guess since the day I was born, I don't know any other way to describe it." Despite her personal belief in her origins, her opponents have seized this moment in an unnecessary fire drill that guarantees media attention and forestalls real debate.
This tactic is straight from the Republican cookbook of fake controversy. First, you need a rarefied elected office typically occupied by a certain breed of privileged men. Both the Presidency and the Senate fit this bill. Second, add a bit of interracial intrigue. It could be Kenyan economists eloping with Midwestern anthropologists, or white frontiersmen pairing with indigenous women. Third, throw in some suspicion about their qualifications and ambitions. Last but not least, demand documentation of ancestry and be dissatisfied upon its receipt. Voila! You have a genuine birther movement.
The Republican approach to race is to feign that it is irrelevant - until it becomes politically advantageous to bring it up. Birthers question Obama's state of origin (and implicitly his multiracial heritage) in efforts to disqualify him from the presidency. They characterize him as "other." For Warren, Massachusetts Republicans place doubts on her racial claims to portray her as an opportunistic academic seeking special treatment. In both birther camps, opponents look to ancestral origins as the smoking gun, and ride the ambiguity for the duration.
Proving Native American ancestry is a complex, bureaucratic process. It's more than showing up at the tribal enrollment office with a family bible and some black and white pictures. Many people are rejected, even when family lore tells them otherwise. Tribal citizenship depends on descent from an enrolled ancestor, and every tribe has its own requirements. 
In the Cherokee Nation, there is no minimum blood requirement, which would allow someone with as little as 1/128 Cherokee blood to enroll (that would be a great-great-great-great-great grandparent). Finding that remote relative is not conclusive, however. The ancestor may not have enrolled himself. Or he could have favored assimilation and counted himself as white. Or her application was rejected or she became ineligible for citizenship.
Like Elizabeth Warren, I am a law professor who was born in Oklahoma. I am enrolled as a member of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, which, along with the Cherokee Nation, has recently experienced great strife in defining what it means to be Native. In the past year, the arguments have escalated nationwide. Some members say that tribes should be composed only of members with high degrees of Indian blood. Others say it should be geographically based. And some others say citizenship should be based on history and culture, regardless of blood or residence. In my personal opinion, it's whether you have a fry bread chef-lady as a relative. (In my family, I'm that "lady.")
Even within Indian Country, the meaning of race and citizenship is contested. And now the Brown campaign wants to dictate Warren's own belief in her identity. According to the Brown campaign, Warren could not be Indian because she is blonde, rich and most of all, a Harvard law professor. Her 1/32 Cherokee ancestry, sufficient for tribal citizenship, is not enough for the Republican party. To most people, she appears as white as, well, Betty White, but to the Scott Brown campaign, she is just Dancing With Wolves.
The Brown campaign asserts that Warren knowingly classified herself as Native American in the 1990s when Harvard weathered sharp criticism for its lack of faculty diversity. During this time, they argue, Warren relied upon this classification to enhance her employment opportunities and to improve Harvard's numbers. Her faculty mentors at Harvard deny this and assert that the law school hired Warren without any knowledge of her ancestry.
Admittedly, news of Elizabeth Warren's Cherokee and Delaware ancestry comes as a surprise. There simply are not enough places in legal academia for Native American professors to hide. The community is tight and small. It's like "Peyton Place," but with academic arguments over subject matter jurisdiction. According to the Association of American Law Schools, Native law professors are only .5% of all law faculty - about fifty people out of 11,000.
Native faculty are familiar with "box checkers": those students and faculty who become Native for the temporary moment of admissions or employment. As soon as the application is mailed or the interview completed, the candidate returns to life as usual. The Cherokee Princess Grandmother served her purpose, and her memory is revived at convenient times.
This merits a reexamination of the difficult question of what it means to be Native. Does that make the Chickasaw kid from Buckhead in Atlanta any less Native than the Navajo faculty candidate from Windy Gap? What does a Native even look like? It's more than long black hair, feathers and beads. At the same time, it is more than checking a box.
Someone's subjective opinion about her heritage may conflict with tribal requirements for membership. The standards are not constant, and they may change with new tribal governments. This happened in my tribe in 2002, when the new chief decided that some members were not "Indian enough." Even at home, the tribal government falls into stereotypes.
For the Cherokee Nation, Warren is "Indian enough"; she has the same blood quantum as Cherokee Nation Chief Bill John Baker. For non-Natives, this may be surprising. They expect to see "high cheekbones," as Warren described her grandfather as having, or tan skin. They want to know of pow wows, dusty reservations, sweat lodges, peyote and cheap cigarettes. When outsiders look at these ostensibly white people as members of Native America, they don't see minorities. As a result, Warren feels she must satisfy these new birthers and justify her existence.
Looked at from the inside, however, the Warren controversy is all new. When the Brown campaign accused Elizabeth Warren of touting herself as American Indian to advance her career, this was news to Native law professors. We have a good eye for welcoming faculty to the community and identifying promising scholars. We know where people teach, what they have published and we honor them when they die. Harvard Law School named its first Native American tenured professor? Really? In our small indigenous faculty town, we would have heard about it already.

And research suggests that is particularly true in economically troubled areas dominated by white, working-class residents, where it could present a political challenge, Sabrina Tavernise reports.

        
Embracing pro bono work, ethics training and tightened disclosure requirements, lobbyists - one of Washington's most disdained groups - are seeking respectability, with more and more saying they can't afford not to, Eric Lichtblau reports.

        
Responding to a survey on preparedness, state and local officials said they were most concerned about whether agencies could respond to cyberattacks. Michael S. Schmidt reports on a study from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

HEADLINE: Romney Calls Jobs Report 'Very, Very Disappointing'

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: "We should be seeing numbers in the 500,000 jobs created per month," Mr. Romney said. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney seized on the tepid jobs report Friday morning as "very, very disappointing" news and proof that President Obama is presiding over an anemic economic recovery that is happening more slowly than it should.
Speaking on Fox News just moments after the government reported that the economy added 115,000 jobs, Mr. Romney said growth should be triple that amount.
"We should be seeing numbers in the 500,000 jobs created per month," Mr. Romney said. "This is way, way, way off from what should happen in a normal recovery."
The central message of Mr. Romney's campaign is that Mr. Obama's policies have blocked a robust economic recovery, prevented small businesses from expanding and caused pain for millions of people who are unable to find work.
He has had to adapt his message as the economic recovery began to pick up some steam over the last year. But in the face of a slowly dropping unemployment rate - the government said it stands at 8.1 percent - Mr. Romney has focused on the pace of the recovery.
"Clearly the American people are wondering why this recovery isn't happening faster, why it's taking years and years for the recovery to occur," Mr. Romney said. "And we seem to be slowing down not speeding up. This is not progress. This is very, very disappointing."
Mr. Romney has mocked the president on the campaign trail for months by citing the fact that the unemployment rate has remained above 8 percent for most of Mr. Obama's presidency. As it approaches that rate, he points to the number of people who have stopped looking for work.
"The reason that you're seeing the unemployment rate going down is because you had more people dropping out of the work force than you had getting jobs," Mr. Romney said on Fox News.
Before the jobs numbers were announced, Mr. Romney offered a fuller critique of the president's economic policies in an open letter to Mr. Obama published in the Cleveland Plain Dealer newspaper Friday morning. 
In the letter, Mr. Romney welcomed Mr. Obama to the state ahead of a campaign rally the president is holding in Columbus on Saturday.
"I have a simple question for you," Mr. Romney wrote. "Where are the jobs?"
Mr. Romney accused the president of being "out of your depth" when it comes to economic matters. And he chastised the president for making promises during his campaign four years ago that he has not kept while in office.
"Mr. President, your promises now ring hollow. If you have brought new ideas to Ohio for creating jobs, why have you waited three years to unveil them?" he wrote. "Have you suddenly had a revelation, or is it because 2012 is an election year?"

HEADLINE: Santorum Has a Private Meeting With Romney

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Santorum does not plan to formally endorse Mr. Romney today, but will offer a basic message of support. 

 BODY:
PITTSBURGH - Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum met Friday morning in Pittsburgh before Mr. Romney's campaign event here, their first private meeting since Mr. Santorum dropped out of the Republican primary last month. 
Though aides to Mr. Santorum said that Mr. Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, does not plan to formally endorse Mr. Romney on Friday, he will offer a basic message of support: "Congratulations - now tell me what I can do to help you beat President Obama." 
An aide to Mr. Santorum also said that Mr. Santorum does not plan to ask Mr. Romney for any assurances - about his positions on social issues, help to retire his campaign debt or a post in a potential Romney White House. The aide added that Mr. Santorum is a political operative at heart, who understands that the spoils go the victor, and that Mr. Romney is now his party's presumptive nominee.
Though Mr. Santorum endorsed Mr. Romney in 2008, the two were often at odds during the 2012 campaign, in which Mr. Santorum eventually emerged as Mr. Romney's main obstacle in securing his party's nomination. In March, Mr. Santorum said, "If Mitt Romney is an economic heavyweight, we're in trouble," citing Massachusetts's poor job creation record - 47th out of 50 - when Mr. Romney was the state's governor.
The Democratic National Committee has already pounced on Mr. Santorum's critical remarks, blasting them out in e-mails to reporters, and releasing a video compilation of some of Mr. Santorum's statements attacking Mr. Romney.

HEADLINE: Romney May Come to Regret Comment on Job Creation

BYLINE: PETER BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: Every president makes statements as a candidate that he later comes to regret once he is in the White House. If Mitt Romney is elected this fall, he may look back at his comment Friday as one of those. 

 BODY:
Every president makes statements as a candidate that he later comes to regret once he is in the White House. He finds himself held to a standard that sounded good on the campaign trail, but may not be realistic in office.
If Mitt Romney is elected this fall, he may look back at his comment Friday as one of those.
Responding to the latest disappointing employment report showing that the American economy added just 115,000 jobs in April, Mr. Romney said, "We should be seeing numbers in the 500,000 jobs created per month."
That would certainly be a welcome tonic for a still-troubled economy, but it would also be a historic aberration. 
In the last 50 years, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the economy added that many jobs in a single month just five times. Presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush all spent their entire time in office without ever seeing a month where the country added 500,000 or more jobs.
Only three presidents in the last half century ever saw the kind of growth Mr. Romney envisioned, and even then it was never sustained at that level. The country added more than 500,000 jobs a month just twice under Jimmy Carter and just once each during the eight-year presidencies of Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. President Obama saw growth that large once in 2010 before it tapered off again.
Mr. Romney could have taken a lesson from Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who in 2010 predicted that the economy would be adding up to 500,000 jobs a month "some time in the next couple of months." Mr. Biden later said he "got in trouble" and that "even some in the White House said, 'Hey, don't get ahead of yourself.'"
He went on to revise his forecast: "I'm here to tell you, sometime in the next couple of months, we're going to be creating between 250,000 jobs a month and 500,000 jobs a month." Of course, 250,000 jobs a month is far more manageable. In the 23 months since the one over-500,000 month under Mr. Obama, the economy reached the Biden standard just three times.

HEADLINE: At Campaign Stop, Romney Tries to Capitalize on Weak Jobs Report

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: In Pennsylvania, Mitt Romney says job-creation numbers should be much higher than they are and the unemployment rate should be lower. 

 BODY:
O'HARA, Penn. - Following a television appearance Friday morning, Mitt Romney used a campaign stop here to again capitalize on the disappointing job growth in April and criticize President Obama for what he called "a sad time in America."
"Just this morning there was some news that came across the wire that said that the unemployment rate has dropped to 8.1 percent," Mr. Romney said, speaking at a corrosion prevention materials factory. "And normally that would be cause for celebration. But in fact anything over 8 percent, anything near 8 percent, anything over 4 percent is not cause for celebration. "
Mr. Romney frequently cites the fact that unemployment has remained at above 8 percent for most of Mr. Obama's presidency. Four percent unemployment is considered the mark of full-employment. The Labor Department said Friday that in April there was a net gain of 115,000 jobs, which was less job growth than economists had been predicting.
Mr. Romney also made sure to explain why the rate had dropped to 8.1 percent from 8.2.
"The reason the rate came down was because about 340,000 people dropped out of the work force," he said. "So many became discouraged that they stopped looking for work. And if they stop looking for work, the statisticians are able to say, 'Oh, the unemployment rate's lower now, because not so many people want to work.'"
In an interview with Fox News Friday morning, Mr. Romney called the day's jobs report "very, very disappointing," and said, "We should be seeing numbers in the 500,000 jobs created per month. This is way, way, way off from what should happen in a normal recovery."
However, the 500,000 jobs per month figure Mr. Romney cited was roundly criticized as being a historically unrealistic number for monthly job growth. In fact, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, .
At his noon event here, Mr. Romney did not repeat the 500,000 number, instead saying: "As a matter of fact, only 115,000 net new jobs were created, that was well beneath what it was expected to be. It should have been in the hundreds of thousands, but it wasn't."
He also criticized Mr. Obama for creating an economy that he said was becoming government-controlled in "a deeper and deeper way, whether it's energy or financial services or health care or automotive."
"Government will control directly or indirectly over half the economy if this president is re-elected," Mr. Romney said. "And we will cease being a free economy. We have to ask ourselves, is that what America is? An economy governed by government, an economy run by government? In my view, we must be an economy, a people run by free people pursuing happiness in the way they believe is best for them and their families."

HEADLINE: Elite Colleges and Wall Street's Recruiting Machine

BYLINE: LILY ALTAVENA


HIGHLIGHT: Despite Wall Street's reported recruiting problems, the nation's financial firms are still drawing top graduates with six-figure incomes that can relieve the financial burden of student loans, a recent college graduate writes. 

 BODY:
Despite Wall Street's reported recruiting problems, which made headlines after the resignation of Greg Smith, a Goldman Sachs executive, the nation's financial firms are still drawing top graduates with six-figure incomes that can relieve the financial burden of student loans, a recent college graduate writes.
Laura Newland, a 2010 graduate of Duke University, discussed her recruiting experience with financial firms in a post on DealBook. She said that the students who excelled in the recruitment process were those who were "ruthless and cunning."
Ms. Newland writes:
The financial pressures manifest themselves in different ways on different campuses, but at the country's most-esteemed schools, the economy has precipitated Wall Street's recruiting supremacy. When a six-figure income, including bonus, is dangled in front of a 22-year-old's nose, it's tough to stomach the thought of taking on the average $158,000 debt-load of today's medical student, or shelling out $50,000 a year for a master's degree.
So we head to Wall Street, rationalizing that we will stay for "just a year or two." Once there, it's tough to leave. A 2011 Bloomberg article reported that a banker with 10 years' experience specializing in mergers will earn $2 million a year - more than 10 times the salary of an equally experienced cancer researcher or aerospace engineer. 
But to attribute the industry's appeal solely to our financial predicament is simplistic. We've been deemed the "Me Generation" for good reason. And Wall Street recruiters are more than happy to cater to our sense of entitlement.
They and their Ivy-pedigreed employees bombard campuses for weeks to shower us with fancy dinners, lavish trips to Manhattan and promises of a challenging, rewarding career. They tap into our competitiveness, so their internship programs begin recruiting us as sophomores, knowing that if we are offered opportunities to build our rsums, we won't just apply, but we'll commit ourselves so fully that we'll mistake our desire to win the race with a desire for what it is we're chasing.
I navigated a salacious recruiting process. I watched ruthless and cunning peers excel, and the more good-hearted crumble. I saw that being popular, good-looking and able to drink hard seemed to matter more than being smart. And as I began my internship search in the midst of the financial crisis, while the industry and our economy crumbled around us, not a single banker I met acknowledged blame on Wall Street's part.
Ms. Newland turned down a "coveted offer" from one firm, she said, because the culture was "toxic."

HEADLINE: I Promise That if Elected, Everyone Will Win the Lottery

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: On Fox News, Mitt Romney says the economy should be adding 500,000 jobs per month. 

 BODY:
Henry IV of France guaranteed a chicken in every pot in the 16th Century. So did the Republicans in 1928. Neither party succeeded, but the potted-chicken notion seems positively modest by the standards of today's political promises.
On Fox & Friends this morning, Mitt Romney knew he had to say something negative about the economy, since the U.S. added only 115,000 jobs in April, and the unemployment rate declined by only .1 percent. That's nothing to write home about, but Mr. Romney's response was just bizarre.
"We should be seeing numbers in the 500,000 jobs created per month," he said. "This is way, way off from what should happen in a normal recovery."

We should? It is? Does President Obama know this? Someone should alert the Council of Economic Advisers immediately.
Actually, half a million jobs per month is nowhere near normal. Think Progress points out that, since 1939, there have only been 16 months when job growth reached 500,000 and quite of few of those were during World War 2. In the last 50 years, there have been only four such months, and only one under a Republican president.
There's nothing unusual about a politician exaggerating wildly-especially if he's on Fox News, especially during a campaign-but Mr. Romney certainly makes a habit of it.
As Think Progress notes, he released a tax plan in March that offers gigantic cuts for the wealthy and for corporations, worth about $6 billion. Mr. Romney said it wouldn't add to the deficit, which means the economy would have to grow at 6.8 percent a year for five years.
Would 6.8 percent growth be more, or less impressive than single-handedly neutralizing Iran? He said during one of the hundreds of G.O.P. primary debates that "If we re-elect Barack Obama, Iran will have a nuclear weapon. And if you elect Mitt Romney, Iran will not have a nuclear weapon."
Savvy voters will dismiss Mr. Romney's claims about Iran and G.D.P. growth and jobs numbers as boasts, and little more. What they should really worry about are his incredibly bad ideas, like passing a balanced-budget amendment that would limit federal spending to 20 percent of the economy; converting Medicaid into a block grant; and converting Medicare into a voucher system.

HEADLINE: Lugar Behind in Indiana Senate Race, Poll Shows

BYLINE: MONICA DAVEY


HIGHLIGHT: Richard E. Mourdock, the state treasurer, leads Senator Richard G. Lugar in the latest poll of likely Republican primary voters, 48 percent to 38 percent. 

 BODY:
Richard G. Lugar, one of the longest-serving members of the United States Senate, is trailing his challenger among likely voters in Indiana's Republican primary, a poll released Friday said. 
The Howey/DePauw Indiana Battleground Poll, conducted this week, showed Richard E. Mourdock, the state treasurer, with the support of 48 percent of likely voters, to Mr. Lugar's 38 percent. The results, a significant slip for Mr. Lugar since a similar poll in March, were made public in the final days of what has been a frenzied and expensive campaign. The primary is Tuesday.
At a news conference, Mr. Lugar, who is 80 and in his sixth term, reminded supporters that only a handful of votes in each precinct would be enough to sway the outcome. 
An aide, Andy Fisher, described the task as "very doable" and more within reach than the new poll results might suggest; the Lugar campaign has five phone-bank operations running, Mr. Fisher said, and Mr. Lugar has a continuous lineup of events planned around the state through Tuesday. 
"I believe it's very important that Hoosiers take back our primary election from the outside world," Mr. Lugar said in the news conference, alluding to spending on the race by national groups like the Club for Growth, the National Rifle Association and FreedomWorks, a group affiliated with the Tea Party movement. The winner of the primary on Tuesday will face Representative Joe Donnelly, a Democrat, in November. 
"At least somebody ought to say Mr. Mourdock simply is unqualified to handle the complex situations in our world today, foreign policy or complex economic problems or -- as a matter of fact, until he builds a staff, and that will take some time -- even regular problems of ordinary Hoosiers," Mr. Lugar said, later adding, "Do not elect an unqualified person to serve in the Senate." 
The Howey/DePauw Indiana Battleground Poll was conducted Monday and Tuesday by telephone among 700 likely Indiana Republican primary voters, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. In late March, the Battleground Poll showed Mr. Lugar leading Mr. Mourdock 42 percent to 35 percent among likely primary voters, an advantage that was within the poll's margin of sampling error of plus or minus five points.

HEADLINE: The Weekend Word: Strategies

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at the president's weekly address and happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
The disparity in reactions to Friday's weaker-than-expected job growth numbers speaks to the very different ways in which President Obama and Mitt Romney are talking about the economy, as a robust recovery continues to elude the White House, Mark Landler writes. The second consecutive month of anemic job growth virtually guarantees that the economy will remain the dominant issue in the campaign, making it harder for the president to shift the focus to issues where he has been able to stake out a stronger position.

        
The Obama campaign desperately wants to reprise its Virginia win of four years ago, but analysts say he will have to extend his 2008 inroads to the rapidly growing suburbs in the southern parts of the state, Helene Cooper reports. Virginia only has 13 electoral votes, but pathways to Mr. Obama's re-election get a whole lot steeper if the state is taken out of the blue column.

        
President Obama has been holding confidential Sunday meetings with a tight circle of advisers who gather for a briefing on his re-election, Jeff Zeleny reports. With Mr. Obama set to formally open his re-election campaign on Saturday, the meetings are intended to bridge a divide between his campaign headquarters in Chicago and his aides in Washington in preparing for what Mr. Obama and his team anticipate will be a grueling race against Mr. Romney.
Weekly Address

        
President Obama returned from his trip to Afghanistan and discussed the progress he made there in his weekly address. He thanked the troops at Bagram Air Base for their service, and signed a new agreement between the United States and Afghanistan that will "help us complete our mission and end the war," he said. "As our coalition agreed, by the end of 2014, the Afghans will be fully responsible for the security of their country. And this is as it should be. Because after more than a decade of war, it is time to focus on nation-building here at home." He is asking Congress to take the money the country is no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down the nation's debt, and use the other half to "rebuild" America. "As a new greatest generation returns from overseas, we must ask ourselves, what kind of country will they come back to?" he said.
Around the Web

        
Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, who was censured by the House for ethics violations after the 2010 midterm elections, dodged a question when reporters asked if the president supports his campaign for a 22nd term in office, Capital New York reports. "Damn, that's a good question," Mr. Rangel said.
Happenings in Washington

        
President Obama and Michelle Obama will depart Washington on Saturday for Columbus, Ohio, and Richmond, Va., for events marking the formal opening of his re-election campaign.

HEADLINE: Third Point Demands Yahoo C.E.O. Be Fired by Monday

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: On Friday, Third Point called for the dismissal of the technology company's chief executive, Scott Thompson, after revealing that the Yahoo leader had inaccurately stated his academic credentials. 

 BODY:
It appears that Third Point's Daniel S. Loeb senses a lot of blood in the water after his latest attack on Yahoo.
On Friday, the hedge fund called for the dismissal of the technology company's chief executive, Scott Thompson, after revealing that the Yahoo leader had inaccurately stated his academic credentials.
Third Point, which is waging a proxy fight against the company, also called for the dismissal of Patti Hart, a director who also had an error in her rsum. 
 The hedge fund is demanding that Mr. Thompson be fired and that Ms. Hart resign by noon on Monday. It is also asking that Yahoo disclose how it vetted its chief executive's credentials during its search process.
Third Point's missive to shareholders is the latest in a seemingly unending string of blows to Yahoo. The hedge fund executive, who is seeking four board seats, managed to elicit an admission from the company on Thursday that Mr. Thompson incorrectly claimed degrees in both accounting and computer science from Stonehill College in Boston. 
In fact, the executive earned only an accounting degree, since Stonehill did not offer degrees in computer science by the time Mr. Thompson graduated.
"To assert that years of inaccurate S.E.C. filings, website biographies and, most likely, D&O questionnaires and curriculum vitae (including, presumably, the CV provided to Yahoo! when Mr. Thompson reached out for the job) were 'inadvertent' is, in our view, the height of arrogance," Mr. Loeb wrote in his letter to shareholders.
Ms. Hart's biographical information had said that she had a degree in marketing and economics from Illinois State University. Yahoo conceded on Thursday that the director earned a degree in business administration, with "specialties" in marketing and economics.
A Yahoo spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment.

Mr. Loeb's full letter is below:
Dear Board of Directors:
Yahoo!'s initial response yesterday to Third Point's identification of material inaccuracies in both CEO Scott Thompson's and Director Patti Hart's educational record was insulting to shareholders. We assume that these initial statements were attributable to Mr. Thompson and were not made with the Board's approval. While we appreciate the Board's statement late last night that it would conduct an investigation, unfortunately, for this Board and this Company, it is too little and months too late.
To assert that years of inaccurate SEC filings, website biographies and, most likely, D&O questionnaires and curriculum vitae (including, presumably, the CV provided to Yahoo! when Mr. Thompson reached out for the job) were "inadvertent" is, in our view, the height of arrogance. Mr. Thompson and the Board should make no mistake: this is a big deal. CEO's have been terminated for less at other companies. The Company's Preliminary Proxy Statement filed on April 27, 2012 (at page 22) states that the "minimum qualification for service as a director of the Company are that a nominee possess. . . an impeccable reputation of integrity and competence in his or her personal and professional activities."
Furthermore, Yahoo!'s response "confirming" that Ms. Hart "specialized" in Marketing and Economics, rather than having earned her degree in such subjects (as Ms. Hart has asserted in filings for years) is a similar canard. A "specialty" is not a major. It is not a "minor". We don't know what it is, but we do know that like Mr. Thompson, Ms. Hart has been misrepresenting her actual degree to the investing public for years. Again, we hope that the Board does not accept this feeble attempt at "spin" as a justification for Ms. Hart's misrepresentations.
Irreparable damage to Yahoo!'s culture will continue every day that the Board allows Mr. Thompson and Ms. Hart to remain at the helm of the Company after having clearly demonstrated that they lack even the "minimum qualifications for service as a director of the Company." Mr. Thompson, in particular, cannot possibly have any credibility remaining with the all-important Yahoo! engineers, many of which earned real - not invented - degrees in computer science. Moreover, permitting Mr. Thompson and Ms. Hart to stay with the Company after apparently violating the Code of Ethics sends a message to all Yahoo! employees that a different set of rules applies at the top.
Third Point, Yahoo!'s largest outside shareholder with over $1 billion invested, called yesterday for an immediate investigation if our assertions were true. The Board appears to have acceded to this demand. Its response must be swift and decisive. In that regard, Third Point will consider it grounds for further action if the Board does not take the following steps by Noon EDT on Monday, May 7th:
1) Publicly reveal the process by which it vetted Mr. Thompson as a potential CEO candidate. This disclosure should include the release of all minutes of any meeting at which Mr. Thompson's candidacy was discussed and any reports or other materials upon which directors relied to evaluate Mr. Thompson's candidacy.
2) Disclose whether any Board member, including Maynard Webb, who has long-standing ties to Mr. Thompson, and Ms. Hart, who headed the Search Committee, was aware of Mr. Thompson's deception prior to receipt of Third Point's letter yesterday.
3) Provide shareholders with all information regarding the director nomination process, including the so-called "skills matrix" referred to in the Company's preliminary proxy statement, which the Board purportedly used to determine the qualifications of various candidates, including Third Point's nominees.
4) Terminate Mr. Thompson for cause immediately given his demonstrable unsuitability to remain Chief Executive Officer and a director of Yahoo! and accept the resignation of Ms. Hart for similar reasons.
Finally, we urge the Board to stop wasting valuable company resources and drop its resistance to placing the Third Point nominees on the Board. We are prepared to join immediately. Once on the Board, our first tasks will be to work with the remaining Board members to find Yahoo! a new leader with the qualifications and integrity to lead the Company and install best practices of corporate governance. The Company can ill afford to continue this misguided fight with its largest outside shareholder while it has so many other fires to put out. There has been enough damage already.
Sincerely,
Daniel S. Loeb
Chief Executive Officer

HEADLINE: Treasury to Sell A.I.G. Shares

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: The Treasury Department announced on Friday that it would sell more of its stake in A.I.G., an offering that comes after a recent surge in the insurer's common stock. 

 BODY:
The government is loosening its grip on the American International Group, the insurer bailed out by taxpayers during the financial crisis.
On Friday, the Treasury Department announced that it would sell more of its stake in A.I.G., an offering that comes after a recent surge in the insurer's common stock.
Since the beginning of the year, shares of A.I.G. have jumped more than 40 percent, to nearly $33, although the stock dipped in after-hours trading on Friday. The Treasury Department has said it considers $28.73 the break-even price for the government.
The Treasury Department, which currently has a 70 percent stake in the insurer, did not disclose the size or price of the offering. A.I.G. said it intended to buy back as much as $2 billion of its own stock at the public offering price.
In 2008 at the height of the crisis, the government devised a bailout for A.I.G., eventually pouring $182 billion into the failed insurer to help stabilize the broader financial system.
As the insurer's profits and the markets have improved, the government has been moving to unwind its A.I.G.-related holdings.
Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began selling the troubled mortgage-backed securities that the government inherited as part of the A.I.G. bailout. In three separate sales, the New York Fed sold bonds with a face value of $6.2 billion to Goldman Sachs, and about $13 billion to Credit Suisse.
In March, A.I.G. repaid an investment of $1.5 billion the Treasury Department made in AIA Aurora, an entity that was set up in 2009 to hold shares of the AIA Group, which was spun off from the insurer in 2010. That payment was made a year ahead of schedule.
This will be the third common stock offering by the government. In March, the Treasury Department sold $6 billion of A.I.G. shares at $29 apiece, trimming its stake to 70 percent from 77 percent. A.I.G. bought $3 billion worth of shares in that sale. That followed a 2011 sale of roughly 200 million shares.
"Today we are announcing further progress in our efforts to reach our goal of having the taxpayers recoup their investment in A.I.G. at a profit," Robert H. Benmosche, the insurer's chief executive, said in a statement on Friday. "This is another tremendous step forward for our company, our shareholders and the American taxpayer."
A.I.G. has been slowly healing from its crisis-era wounds. On Thursday, A.I.G. reported $3.2 billion in first-quarter profits, a healthy increase from $1.3 billion in the first quarter of last year. In a statement accompanying the results, Mr. Benmosche said the firm was "rebuilding A.I.G.'s legacy of excellence."
A date has not been announced for the offering, which is being run by Bank of America, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.

HEADLINE: Hedge Fund Intensifies Attack on Yahoo Amid Storm Over Padded Rsums

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: On Friday, the hedge fund Third Point, which is in the middle of a contentious proxy battle with Yahoo, called for the dismissal of the technology company's chief executive, Scott Thompson, after revealing that he had inaccurately stated his credentials. 

 BODY:
Third Point has intensified its assault against Yahoo.
On Friday, the hedge fund, which is in the middle of a contentious proxy battle with Yahoo, called for the dismissal of the technology company's chief executive, Scott Thompson, after revealing that he had inaccurately stated his credentials.
Mr. Thompson had previously claimed to have earned degrees in both accounting and computer science from Stonehill College. After prodding by Third Point, Yahoo conceded that Mr. Thompson had only an accounting degree, calling it an "inadvertent error."
 Yahoo also said that Patti S. Hart, the director who led the company's chief executive search, did not graduate with a degree in marketing and economics from Illinois State University. Instead, she earned a degree in business administration.
In a letter to shareholders on Friday, Third Point's founder, Daniel S. Loeb, called for Mr. Thompson to be fired and for Ms. Hart to resign. Mr. Loeb also raised concerns about whether Yahoo had filed erroneous information in securities filings and other documents.
"Irreparable damage to Yahoo's culture will continue every day that the board allows Mr. Thompson and Ms. Hart to remain at the helm of the company after having clearly demonstrated that they lack even the 'minimum qualifications for service as a director of the company,' " Mr. Loeb wrote.
A spokeswoman for Yahoo, Amanda Pires, said in a statement: "As we have previously said, the board is reviewing this matter and, upon completion of its review, will make an appropriate disclosure to shareholders."
Earlier this year, Third Point started an aggressive battle against Yahoo, questioning the company's strategic direction and its choice of new directors, who Mr. Loeb said lacked advertising and media expertise. The hedge fund is seeking four board seats at Yahoo.
The revelations about Mr. Thompson and Ms. Hart are the latest blow to Yahoo, which has been under pressure from shareholders to redefine itself in a world where Facebook and Google dominate. The struggling Web pioneer had staked its latest turnaround campaign on Mr. Thompson, who was hired in January from eBay's PayPal unit.
Mr. Thompson sent an e-mail to Yahoo's employees on Friday, acknowledging the reports and urging them to stay focused on the mission, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
 "I'm doing what I hope all of you are doing - staying focused on our customers, our shareholders, our team and moving Yahoo forward, fast," Mr. Thompson said in the note.
Some corporate governance experts say that the errors in Mr. Thompson's academic record are unsettling. At a time of uncertainty for Yahoo shareholders, any questions about the integrity of the company's chief executive may cast doubt on investors' faith in its turnaround plans.
"It really diminishes his credibility," said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, the senior associate dean for executive programs at Yale School of Management.
F. Daniel Siciliano, a professor at Stanford Law School, noted that Mr. Thompson and Ms. Hart seemingly had run afoul of Yahoo's own code of ethics. But he added that the code appeared to allow for some leeway in the board's response, and that the company's directors must carefully weigh their next steps.
"The real duty the board has is to ask what is in the best interest of the shareholders," he said. "If they don't have a succession plan in place, it might be a costly move to fire him."
Executives who inflate their credentials have previously found themselves in a tenuous positions. David Edmondson, who became RadioShack's chief executive in 2005, claimed to have graduated from Pacific Coast Baptist College with bachelor's degrees in theology and psychology. He later admitted that he did not have either degree, and resigned in early 2006. 
Not all executives caught with padded rsums are forced to resign, however. In 2002, Ronald Zarrella, then the chief executive of Bausch & Lomb, admitted that while he attended New York University's Stern School of Business at night, he did not graduate. Mr. Zarrella retired from Bausch & Lomb in 2008.
Professor Siciliano said the Yahoo board faced a difficult decision. "There are omissions, and there are complete misrepresentations of your fundamental credentials," he said of Mr. Thompson. "His misrepresentation is to the left of that, but it's still pretty bad."

HEADLINE: Willy Loman and the Middle Class

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Death of a Salesman's Dreams'' (Op-Ed, May 3):
In Lee Siegel's poignant article about work and class in 1949 and 2012, a point is missing about the human drama of capitalist transformation over the last half-century: How less tragic Willy Loman's life would have been if he had worked, say, in an auto plant and belonged to the United Auto Workers union. 
Then his middle-class dreams -- a paid-up mortgage, a nice refrigerator, a pension -- would have been built on the bedrock of the union movement and a vital manufacturing economy rather than on the competition that ate into his heart and soul as a salesman, the figure of Everyman.
AMY DRU STANLEY Washington, May 3, 2012
The writer is an associate professor of history at the University of Chicago.
To the Editor:
Lee Siegel writes compellingly about the ravages of our current economic and cultural climate. Yet he writes about the destruction of the American middle class as if he can discern its collective voice by simply noting the trend toward Darwinian reality television. To be sure, most middle-class Americans can no longer afford to see ''Death of a Salesman'' on Broadway. That does not mean, however, the death of the middle class, something that intellectuals have been proclaiming fairly consistently, and incorrectly, for more than a century.
Instead, the repeated invocations of the ''middle class'' in this political campaign, while frequently full of disingenuous rhetoric, point toward the continued vitality of complex middle-class realities. Millions of middle-class Americans, combining despair and hope, cynicism and dreams of democracy, will likely demonstrate the (admittedly constrained) power of the middle class in November and well beyond.
ROBERT D. JOHNSTON Chicago, May 3, 2012
The writer, an associate professor of history at the University of Illinois at Chicago, is co-editor of ''The Middling Sorts: Explorations in the History of the American Middle Class.''
To the Editor:
I saw the current revival of ''Death of a Salesman.'' I am successful, I identify my father with Willy, and I always cry during its performance. What I didn't feel was superior. I am outraged by the thought.
I was able to afford that ticket through hard work. No tax rate would have been low enough without that effort. I don't have a jump shot, and I can't write music.
It is time that we stopped equating every successful person with Warren Buffett or the relatively small number of miscreants on Wall Street. Instead, we should look at the financial regulations and tax code put in place by people for whom we voted and keep in office, and the steady deterioration in national values that began almost half a century ago.

HEADLINE: Rate Of Growth In Jobs Slowed For U.S. In April

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
The nation's employers are creating jobs at less than half the pace they were when this year began, according to a government report released Friday.
The addition of just 115,000 jobs in April was disappointing, but economists urged no panic just yet. Maybe the unusually warm winter had encouraged companies to do their spring hiring a little early, they offered in one of several theories. Maybe high gas prices, now falling, temporarily discouraged job growth. Better yet, maybe this latest report understates how many jobs were added, since the initial estimates for earlier months have been revised upward.
But no matter which hopeful explanation you choose, America's 13.7 million jobless workers still look pretty discouraged. 
Many economists had been predicting that strong job growth early this year would persuade many people sitting on the sidelines to re-enter the job market.
Instead, for reasons that are unclear, workers continue to peel off the labor force. An estimated 342,000 Americans dropped out of the job market altogether in April. That is why the unemployment rate fell to 8.1 percent from 8.2 percent -- not because more workers found jobs, but because so many people left the work force.
It's just one month of data, and the survey numbers are not precise. Still, the figures fit into a longer-term trend.
The share of working-age Americans who are either working or actively looking for a job is now at its lowest level since 1981, when far fewer women chose to do paid work. The share of men taking part in the labor force fell in April to 70 percent, the lowest figure since the Labor Department began collecting these data in 1948.
The decline in labor force participation is partly because baby boomers are hitting retirement age. But economists had expected the wave of retirements to be at least partly offset by the number of workers rejoining the labor force as the economy improved.
''There were a lot of younger people who had gone back to school to get more education and training, and we thought we'd see more of them joining the work force now,'' said Andrew Tilton, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs. Instead, the number of young people in the labor force also fell.
''May, June and July -- the months when people are typically coming out of schooling -- will be the big test,'' he said.
College enrollment, particularly among young women, has indeed been growing quickly, which bodes well for the economy in the years ahead. But of course not everyone dropping out of the labor force is doing so to collect more credentials.
With the average duration of unemployment now at an interminable 39.1 weeks, many people have simply given up looking for work. Many of them might have given up months ago, but had clung to the job search because doing so kept them eligible for extended unemployment benefits. As more and more workers roll off those benefits, they are officially stopping their job searches and dropping out.
It's unclear whether workers will continue dropping out, said Alan B. Krueger, chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.
''I think you're going to have crosscurrents,'' he said. ''One factor is that extended benefits have kept people in the labor force. But then some of the reforms that the president proposed and that Congress has passed will encourage the unemployed to search for a job.''
He cited as an example a federal program granting funds to 10 states that are experimenting with subsidized training and private sector jobs, modeled in part on a pilot program in Georgia.
Other job-training and placement programs have been strained by government shortfalls, however. Washington also seems unlikely to engage in additional significant job-creation programs before the November elections. The Federal Reserve, which had helped stimulate the economy in the past when Congress deadlocked, does not seem to be gearing up for more monetary easing, either.
''This keeps the Fed where they've been,'' Jay Feldman, an economist at Credit Suisse, said of the April jobs report, which the Labor Department released Friday. ''There could be more stimulus if April turns out to be a new trend, but by itself it's no provocation for a quick ease.''
Rather than prodding employment growth, the government is actually providing a drag on the economy.
Government spending has fallen for six straight quarters as Recovery Act funds have been exhausted and state and local governments have struggled with tax revenue shortfalls. Accordingly, the public sector has been shedding workers relatively consistently since the recovery officially began in mid-2009, with the exception of a brief spike of temporary hiring during the decennial census. Last month, governments eliminated 15,000 jobs.
Private companies added 130,000 jobs over all, with professional and business services, retail trade and health care doing the most hiring.
''My guess is the weather made job growth look too strong in the first couple of months, and now it looks too weak as payback for the warm winter weather,'' said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist for Capital Economics. ''It'll probably settle somewhere in between.''
Averaging the strong months of total job growth in January and February with the weaker ones in March and April, the economy has been adding about 200,000 jobs a month this year.
Job growth of any kind is obviously welcome. That pace, however, is not nearly fast enough to recover the losses from the Great Recession and its aftermath in the foreseeable future. At this rate, it would take more than two more years just to return to the prerecession peak in employment, though the country should actually have even more jobs given population growth and the current size of the economy.
Today the United States economy is producing more goods and services than it did when the recession officially began in December 2007, but with about five million fewer workers.
Because employers have learned how to produce more with fewer workers, there is also debate about what exactly ''healthy'' employment would look like in the current economy, and whether it makes sense to use the data from before the financial crisis as a benchmark.
Productivity fell last quarter, though, which could be an encouraging sign for unemployed Americans, if not necessarily for the employers trying to squeeze more profits out of their existing work forces.
''We have to reserve judgment until we get the final revisions on these numbers,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics. ''I'm not trying to be Pollyannaish, but there is enough in this report to suggest that the economy isn't necessarily slowing.''

HEADLINE: Court Reverses $2 Billion Ruling Against Ford and Orders a New Trial

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- The Ohio Court of Appeals has overturned a judge's ruling last year that the Ford Motor Company must pay $2 billion to commercial truck dealers who claim they were overcharged by the company for more than a decade, Ford said Friday. 
The appellate court ordered a new trial for the class-action case, ruling that Judge Peter J. Corrigan of Cuyahoga County erred in excluding evidence presented by Ford.
The dealers can appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. Their lawyer, James A. Lowe, declined to comment Friday through his secretary because he had not finished reviewing the ruling.
The lawsuit, filed in 2002, contended that Ford cheated the dealers out of some $800 million in profits from 1987 through 1998 by offering secret discounts in violation of its agreements to sell commercial trucks at published prices. Last June, Judge Corrigan upheld a $4.5 million verdict that a Cleveland jury awarded to one Ohio dealer and ruled that Ford also must pay damages and interest to about 3,100 other dealers.
''Ford was entitled to show that offering all dealers across-the-board discounts on every truck it sold would have been economically unfeasible,'' Court of Appeals Judge Kenneth A. Rocco wrote in Thursday's decision. The opinion also described the contract that the dealers said Ford had breached as ''ambiguous.''
The trial judge's award, which included $1.2 billion in interest, was the largest ever against Ford, which sold its medium- and heavy-duty truck business in 1998. It disclosed the appeals court ruling in a regulatory filing.
''We look forward to trying the case before a jury that will now be able to consider all of the evidence that was improperly excluded in the first trial,'' said a Ford spokeswoman, Marcey Evans.
The plaintiffs hired experts who examined 475,000 transactions and calculated that dealers paid an average of $1,650 more than the price that Ford should have charged them. In some cases, the dealers were overcharged by up to $15,000, while in others they paid less than the experts said they should have, they argued.
The dealers said Ford set wholesale prices on the trucks, which included tractor-trailers, that were higher than what buyers were willing to pay for them. Through a program known as Competitive Price Assistance, the dealers could request discounts from Ford, but each dealer was unaware of how much Ford was discounting the trucks to other dealers. As a result, the prices that dealers paid for identical trucks varied widely.
Ford maintained that the discount program ''brought significant benefit to the dealers.''

HEADLINE: A Medical Debt's Stain

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
When Ray White's son was about 9 years old, he struck a tree branch while riding his bike. Within minutes, an ambulance whisked him off to the emergency room. The boy recovered, but many months and phone calls later, Mr. White's insurance company still had not paid the $200 ambulance bill, even though the insurer had assured him it was covered. He finally decided it was easier to pay it himself.
But by then, it was already too late. Unbeknown to Mr. White, the debt had been reported to the credit bureaus. It was only when he and his wife went to refinance the $240,000 mortgage on their home in Lewisville, Tex., last month -- nearly six years after the accident -- that he learned the bill had shaved about 100 points from his credit score. Even with no other debts, a healthy income and otherwise pristine credit, the couple had to pay an extra $4,000 to secure a lower interest rate.
''It wasn't like I ignored it,'' said Mr. White, 47, an executive in Internet advertising. ''It's not like I'm a credit risk in any way, shape or form.'' 
Even people with good insurance coverage know how hard it can be to figure out how much they owe after a visit to the doctor or, even worse, the emergency room, which can generate multiple bills. But as patients become responsible for a growing share of costs -- not just co-payments, but also deductibles and coinsurance -- bill paying is becoming ever more complex.
On top of that, more medical providers are using collection services and turning to them more quickly than they have in the past, some experts say.
''It used to be that the mantra was 'gentlemen and physicians rarely discuss matters of money,' '' said Dr. Jeffrey Hausfeld, an otolaryngologist and plastic surgeon who now co-owns FMS Financial Solutions, a collection agency that specializes in medical debts. ''But that has changed now.''
The reason is that the portion of the bill that patients owe has become a larger percentage of medical practices' and hospitals' revenue, said Mark Rieger, chief executive of National Healthcare Exchange Services, which offers software to help providers manage billing. ''They are getting increases in their fee schedule amounts, but their revenue is declining because more of the responsibility is being shifted to patients,'' he said.
Medical providers collected no more than 8 percent of their revenue from patients about 10 years ago, he said. Now, it is closer to 20 percent, or even 30 percent, in some markets.
Like Mr. White, people who fail to pay or respond to a medical collection agency in time -- whether intentionally or not -- may be surprised to learn, often much later, that it left a black mark on their credit record.
FICO, which produces one of the most popular credit scores used by lenders, said it viewed different types of collection agency accounts -- medical-related or otherwise -- as equally damaging. For someone with a spotless credit history, ''it wouldn't surprise me if their score dropped by 100 points or more,'' said Frederic Huynh, a principal analytic scientist at FICO. And the blemish does not entirely disappear for seven years.
Consumer advocates argue that this is unfair. After all, medical debt is usually something people do not volunteer for, and billing errors and figuring out who owes what can often take months. According to the American Medical Association's 2011 National Health Insurer Report Card, commercial health insurers processed 19.3 percent of claims erroneously in 2011, up from 17.3 percent in 2010.
In 2010, an estimated 9.2 million people aged 19 to 64 were contacted by a collection agency because of a billing mistake, according to research by the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit research group, while 30 million were contacted by a collection agency because of an unpaid medical bill.
''There is enormous room for errors, whether they are intentional or unintentional,'' said Pat Palmer, founder of Medical Billing Advocates of America.
Rodney Anderson, a mortgage banker in Plano, Tex., said he started to notice in 2008 that more of his customers were being hurt by these medical delinquencies. So he kept notes on 5,100 loan applicants over 10 months. He found that 2,200 had at least one medical debt that lowered their credit score, and many of them were unaware of the damage.
''It's the same thing over and over,'' said Mr. Anderson, executive director of Supreme Lending. ''You just don't let $100 go to collections to ruin your credit.''
That prompted him to take the issue to Congress. He said he had spent $1.5 million of his own money on consultants and on lobbying to change the rules. And his efforts, along with those of consumer groups and others, have gotten lawmakers' attention.
A version of the Medical Debt Responsibility Act, which would erase medical debts from credit reports within 45 days of being settled or paid, was approved by the House with bipartisan support in 2010. The bill was reintroduced in the Senate by Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, in March.
Interestingly, support for the bill comes from a varied group, including nearly 20 organizations -- from consumer groups and the Mortgage Bankers Association to the American Medical Association. ''The current system punishes consumers regardless of the underlying facts,'' the supporters said in an April 16 letter to lawmakers.
Gerri Detweiler, a credit expert with Credit.com who supports the bill, said, ''Consumers have more rights when it comes to disputing a $10 credit card charge than they do a $1,000 medical bill.'' She was referring to the Fair Credit Billing Act, which gives consumers the right to dispute a credit card charge while withholding payment and protects the consumer's credit report during the card issuer's 30-day investigation period.
When a bill is sent to collections, Ms. Detweiler said, there is nothing specifically in the law to stop it from being immediately reported. Ultimately, it is up to the medical provider to sign off when bills go to collections and when the collection agencies should report to the credit bureaus, according to ACA International, a collections trade group.
Still, critics of the bill say that reporting the collection information is important because it can predict consumers' future payment behavior. The Consumer Data Industry Association, which represents the big credit bureaus, said that it had ''deep concerns about deleting any type of accurate, predictive data'' before the end of the seven-year period.
''Broadly speaking, a precedent of deleting adverse information once a delinquent debt is paid would seriously impinge on the quality of data,'' a spokesman said.
John Ulzheimer, president of consumer education at SmartCredit.com, also has concerns about deleting data because it does not distinguish between late payments that resulted from errors and those that were truly late.
''If paid or settled delinquencies were simply removed from credit reports as if they never happened, it would severely undermine the integrity of a credit report and the resultant credit score,'' he said. ''That is why it is called a history.''
Consumer advocates said they believed there should be some sort of mechanism to differentiate between true delinquencies and billing errors.
The House's version of the bill would erase only debts up to $2,500. Supporters of the bill said they thought that amount would help a wide swath of people because many errors are below that level. Still, the bill would not help everyone, particularly as Americans continue to spend an increasing share of their income on medical expenses. The tens of millions of uninsured and underinsured people are in a particularly hard spot.
''You can't afford to buy a policy, you can't afford to buy coverage through your job, and you end up in the E.R., and you have to pay for that visit, and even more you have to pay at non-negotiated prices,'' said Sara Collins, a vice president at Commonwealth, referring to the fact that the uninsured often pay much more than the rates that insurers negotiate. ''So if it becomes part of your credit history, it strikes me as really unfair.''
The Affordable Care Act, a law pushed by President Obama that overhauled the health care system, may help because more people would have insurance and many would have to pay no more than a certain percentage of their income on premiums and out-of-pocket costs, said Mark Rukavina, executive director of the Access Project, a nonprofit group that helps people with large medical debts.
Still, he said, ''even with the expansion of coverage, the out-of-pocket costs will be challenging for many American families.'' He added, ''Those struggling to pay their share of the costs, and doing so, should not be penalized.''

HEADLINE: 'The Scream' on the Block

 BODY:
Looking at Edvard Munch's 1895 pastel ''The Scream,'' it's hard not to see it as a commentary on the price it brought at Sotheby's in New York this week -- $119,922,500, the highest auction price ever paid for a work of art. In a pose treasured by winners of beauty pageants (as well as trick-or-treaters and many others), Munch's figure on a bridge seems to be shrieking with -- you decide. 
Elation at such a fantastic figure? Horror at anyone -- it was sold to an unidentified telephone bidder -- spending so much money on a single object? Now that ''The Scream'' has moved to the top of art's 10-most-wanted list, it will be a while before we can look at the work and see only the old, familiar existential dread.
One of Munch's other works, a landscape called ''Summer Night,'' went unsold. Sotheby's had set the opening bid at $700,000, but no offers came in. ''The Scream'' sold for what it did not because Munch's work is being revalued, but because ''The Scream'' is a brand unto itself, one of the most replicated images on the planet. The pastel sold this week is itself a replication, one of four versions that Munch created. That fact alone makes the sale price very strange. But then this version of ''The Scream'' was the last one left in the wild. All the rest are captive in Norwegian museums.
Bringing a record-breaking price doesn't always change our perception of a work of art. Van Gogh's ''Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' looks no worse for being the auction record-breaker of 1990, at $82.5 million, which adjusted for inflation would handily beat ''The Scream.'' But most of us can easily visualize a dozen other van Gogh paintings at least as good. Not for Munch. He is known for four paintings, all of them called ''The Scream.''

HEADLINE: Serbian Socialist Leader May Be Crucial to Forming a Government After Election

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

 BODY:
PETROVAC NA MLAVI, Serbia -- Looking eerily like the Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic, a stout and stern-faced Ivica Dacic roused supporters crowded in a sports arena here this past week, promising to protect Serbs from the ravages of capitalism and warning that violence against Serbs in Kosovo was tantamount to an assault on Belgrade.
''This may be a small town but the red color lives on here,'' Mr. Dacic, the leader of the Socialist Party, said Wednesday, alluding to the town's proud working-class roots. ''We speak Serbian so the whole world can understand you.'' The audience of teens, retirees and coal miners roared approvingly. A loudspeaker blared the nationalist lyrics: ''All you heroes, get ready for battle!'' 
As Serbs prepare to vote in presidential and parliamentary elections here Sunday, the charismatic Mr. Dacic, 46, who croons Frank Sinatra tunes and has invoked Barack Obama, Vladimir V. Putin and former President Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia as his role models, has gained wide support by mixing patriotism, pragmatism and an appeal to social justice. In response to visceral public anger against the country's crony politics, he has cannily upgraded Mr. Milosevic's former slogan, ''No one is allowed to beat you'' to ''No one is allowed to lie to you.''
Mr. Dacic, a tough-talking interior minister in the current coalition government of the country's pro-Western president, Boris Tadic, is expected to be kingmaker in elections Sunday, and a possible next prime minister. Neither of the top two leading parties, Mr. Tadic's Democrats or the Progressive Party of Tomislav Nikolic, a former ultranationalist funeral parlor chief who has refashioned himself as pro-European, will likely be able to form a government without him. The latest polls show them neck-in-neck in the presidential race, which is expected to go to a run-off on May 20.
Mr. Dacic's soaring popularity, analysts say, reflects widespread disenchantment with the current government of Mr. Tadic, a George Clooney look-a-like and darling of Brussels and Washington who has successfully shepherded the country toward the European Union during his eight years as president. Nevertheless, he has come under intensifying criticism at home for Serbia's weak economy, 24 percent unemployment rate, accusations of corruption and patronage, and an authoritarian stranglehold over the media the likes of which critics say the country has not experienced since Mr. Milosevic's times.
Mr. Dacic, a former spokesman for Mr. Milosevic, has sought to transform his former mentor's party into a mainstream social democratic party, firmly abandoning its old warmongering ideology, if not its old appeals to Serbian pride. He insisted in an interview that he was not the reincarnation of the former ruler. ''We can never return to that era,'' he said.
As evidence, he advocated Serbia's E.U. membership and strong relations with the United States. But he also warned that Serbia could turn toward Russia if the bloc insisted that Belgrade recognize Kosovo as a condition of joining. In another salvo unlikely to be greeted warmly in Brussels or Washington, he suggested that partitioning Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008, could be a solution for solving divisions there.
NATO said Friday that its peacekeeping force would seek to maintain the uneasy peace in the Serb-dominated North of Kosovo, where Serbs, who do not recognize Kosovo's authority, plan to vote. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has agreed to oversee parliamentary and presidential elections in Kosovo but not local elections, which some Serbs have vowed to hold and which Kosovo has warned it will use force to curtail.
The elections come at a seminal moment for Serbia.
Thirteen years after NATO bombed Belgrade to halt the killing of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, the poor Balkan country was invited to become a candidate for E.U. membership in March. The move marked a final end to more than two decades as a pariah nation following the bloody break-up of the former Yugoslavia. The accession of Serbia and the Balkan states to the European Union is seen by the West as the best means to overcome the ethnic enmities that provoked the Balkan wars of the 1990s that left at least 125,000 people dead.
In order clinch its E.U. candidacy status, Serbia stepped up cooperation on tracking down war-crime suspects, including handing over Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb general accused of war crimes, to The Hague last year. In February it signed an agreement to improve contacts with Kosovo, a condition to it attaining candidacy status and a bitter medicine for many Serbs.
But for all the jubilation at finally getting an invitation to the European club, many Serbs say they feel hopeless. In a recent poll by Ipsos, a marketing research firm, 64 percent of Serbs said the country was on the wrong track, citing unemployment and corruption as their chief concerns. While 73 percent of Serbs favored E.U. membership in 2009, today that number has dropped to 50 percent.
With the financial crisis roiling Europe, the European Union is suffering from expansion exhaustion and analysts say it will likely take at least 10 years before Serbia will join the bloc. Many Serbs say they are fed up with waiting. Moreover, with an average monthly wage here of about 400, or $525, Serbs complain that their hard-fought progress toward Europe, including being granted visa-free travel across the bloc in December 2009, is meaningless, since they cannot afford a plane ticket.
Srecko Skeljic, 33, a pro-European blogger and social media activist, said that four years ago, he proudly voted for Mr. Tadic's Democrats, determined for Serbia to finally put the past behind it. Today, he says he is so disappointed by economic doldrums and endemic graft that he plans to draw a sad face on his ballot and throw it into the Sava River. Up to a 100,000 Serbs -- or 4 percent of voters -- have indicated they will spoil their ballots on election day, according to the Center for Free Elections and Democracy, a research group that monitors the elections.
''Forced to choose between a corrupted Democratic Party and an army of darkness,'' Mr. Skeljic said, referring to the other political parties contesting the election, ''I would rather vote for no one.''
On a positive note, many analysts credit Mr. Tadic, who has apologized to victims of Serbian atrocities during the Balkan wars, for helping to facilitate reconciliation in the region.
In a sign of the historic reckoning under way, 20 years after the start of the war in Bosnia, a new thriller about the valiant hunt for accused Serbian war criminals, including Mr. Mladic -- still a hero to many here -- is plastered on billboards with its title, Ustanicka Street, the location of Serbia's war-crimes court.
But there are also less optimistic signs. The Belgrade opening of Angelina Jolie's recent film, ''In the Land of Blood and Honey,'' chronicling the horrors committed by Serbs in Bosnia, was boycotted and vilified by many Serbs. Only a handful of people showed up and several walked out, midway through, according to Serb media reports. Ms. Jolie did not attend.
As in much of the rest of Europe, analysts say that Serbia's struggling economy is the main driver behind its current malaise. Growth is flat and forecast to grow by just 0.5 percent this year. Since October 2009, 250,000 jobs have been lost.
One of the biggest beneficiaries of voter discontent could be Mr. Dacic. He said in an interview that after the election, he would first hold coalition talks with Mr. Tadic's Democrats, making it likely that Mr. Tadic will be able to mobilize enough support to hold on to power. But Mr. Tadic could also turn to Mr. Nikolic, a populist, who abandoned the far-right Radical party in 2008 and whose Progressive Party could win the most votes. Either way, Mr. Dacic was clearly giddy with the idea of breaking the status quo.
''Both Tadic and Nikolic say don't vote for small parties but in the end both of them will have to come to me,'' he said. ''Nothing will ever be the same again.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Vocation or Exploration? Pondering the Purpose of College

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND

 BODY:
OUR oldest son is finishing up his junior year in high school, and we're already overwhelmed by what I've been calling the college challenge -- trying to figure out what college he can get into and what we can afford.
But there's also a bigger debate raging that hovers over all our concerns. What exactly is a university education for?
Is it, narrowly, to ensure a good job after graduation? That's how Rick Scott, the governor of Florida, views it. He has made waves by wanting to shift state financing of public colleges to majors that have the best job prospects. Hello science, technology, engineering and math; goodbye psychology and anthropology.
And Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, has introduced the Student Right to Know Before You Go Act, which would require, among other things, that students have access to data on university graduates' average annual earnings. 
Or is the point of a university degree to give students a broad and deep humanities education that teaches them how to think and write critically? Or can a college education do both?
A little background: Before 1983, receiving a bachelor of arts degree in just about any subject ''opened up lots of jobs,'' said Anthony P. Carnevale, director of Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce. ''You could get a B.A. in history and become an accountant. Then the economy underwent a cultural shift.''
Why the early 1980s? It was a combination of the deep recession of 1980-82 and the growth of computer-based technology.
''We started to see a widening distribution of earnings by majors,'' said Professor Carnevale, who also served as chairman of the National Commission on Employment Policy under President Bill Clinton.
And that trend has continued. ''I was raised to think what you needed was a college degree,'' he said. ''That's not the game anymore. It's what you major in.''
So does that mean I should urge our son to pursue a degree he doesn't have any interest in because it may provide him with a higher-paying job -- or any job, for that matter -- after college?
No, Professor Carnevale said, because if you don't like what you do, you won't do it well. The point is that ''young people now need to have a strategy,'' he said. ''If you major in art, realize you will have to get a master's degree. The economic calculus has changed.''
Alex Tabarrok, an associate professor of economics at George Mason University and author of the e-book ''Launching the Innovation Renaissance'' (TED Books), is not just worried about students finishing four years of college with no jobs, but also that they may never get to the graduation podium at all.
''At least 40 percent of students drop out of four-year universities before graduation, and it's even higher out of community colleges,'' he said. ''We have the highest college dropout rate in the industrialized world. Everyone recognizes that something is not quite right.''
Mr. Tabarrok said that we, as a country, needed to look more closely at emulating apprenticeship programs offered in European countries that turn out highly skilled workers.
''We tend to look down on vocational training in the United States, but in Europe, that's where the majority of the kids go,'' he said. ''The U.S. mind-set is that there is only one road to an education and to do anything else admits defeat.''
There are two main arguments against pushing more students into vocational training. The first is that it pigeonholes them in careers at a young age.
''We don't want a system where people are tracked from early on,'' said Andrew Delbanco, a professor of humanities at Columbia University and author of the new book ''College: What It Was, Is, and Should Be'' (Princeton University Press).
The second is that a good liberal arts degree isn't simply a luxury when economic times are good, but a necessity at all times to create an engaged citizenry, he said.
''The university should be a place for reflection for the young to explore areas of the human experience, to be fully aware of history and the arts,'' Professor Delbanco said. ''We don't want to have a population that has technical competence but is not able to think critically about the issues that face us as a society.''
Professor Tabarrok argued, however, that the way the system was set up now, ''We're denying students a hands-on education.'' A lot of high school students, he said, ''would love to be paid to work alongside adults and learn.''
Do we have to land on one side or another? Not necessarily. To Anne Colby, a consulting professor at Stanford University and author of ''Rethinking Undergraduate Business Education'' (Jossey-Bass, 2011), the idea that we have to choose between vocational training and the rich, deep learning we associate with liberal arts is a false dichotomy.
She and her colleagues studied undergraduate business programs around the country -- which more college students major in than any other field -- and discovered that the best programs combined major elements of a liberal arts education and professional training.
One example, she said, is the Pathways program at Santa Clara University in California, in which students in all majors take thematically based sequences of courses that draw together several disciplines. Sustainability, the idea that the current generation can meet its needs without sacrificing future generations', can be studied, for example, from the point of view of business, history, philosophy and politics. And at Indiana University, the Liberal Arts and Management Program offers interdisciplinary courses like ''The History of the Automobile: Economy, Politics and Culture.'' This program enables students to learn their specialty in the context of history, literature and other liberal arts.
''Universities need to be more creative in their thinking,'' she said. And while internships can help bring a practical piece, faculty members need to oversee what is being learned and connect it back to the rest of the academic learning -- something that is not done enough, she said.
Jose Luis Santos, an assistant professor of education at the University of California, Los Angeles, also said it was possible for four-year institutions to offer a solid humanities base along with specialization.
''Colleges and universities eventually respond to market needs all the time,'' he said. One example, he said, was how they stepped in to offer Arabic language training when the demand rose for it after Sept. 11.
''That's a very good example of realigning to meet market needs,'' he said. ''Colleges and universities eventually respond. It's just at a slow pace. The critique is that they don't do it in a timely manner.''
Although much of this is out of an individual student's control, a student (and his parents) can try to think strategically. That doesn't mean entering a major you have no interest in, but using all the resources your institution offers to help think about a career before graduation rolls around.
''Some colleges and universities have pretty creative career placement offices that provide events with people in the field,'' Professor Colby said. ''Take advantage of all the extracurricular activities and speakers. And look for coursework that involves the application of knowledge and real-world themes.''
And be a part of the debate. Things are changing, and that's not necessarily bad. As Professor Tabarrok said, ''Just because something worked in the past doesn't mean it's going to work in the new world we have now.''

HEADLINE: Treasury to Sell More Shares In A.I.G. as Stock Recovers

BYLINE: By KEVIN ROOSE

 BODY:
The government is loosening its grip on the American International Group, the insurer bailed out by taxpayers during the financial crisis.
On Friday, the Treasury Department announced that it would sell more of its stake in A.I.G., an offering that comes after a recent surge in the insurer's common stock. 
Since the beginning of the year, shares of A.I.G. have jumped more than 40 percent, to nearly $33, although the stock dipped in after-hours trading on Friday. The Treasury Department has said it considers $28.73 the break-even price for the government.
The Treasury Department, which currently has a 70 percent stake in the insurer, did not disclose the size or price of the offering. A.I.G. said it intended to buy back as much as $2 billion of its own stock at the public offering price.
In 2008 at the height of the crisis, the government devised a bailout for A.I.G., eventually pouring $182 billion into the failed insurer to help stabilize the broader financial system.
As the insurer's profits and the markets have improved, the government has been moving to unwind its A.I.G.-related holdings.
Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began selling the troubled mortgage-backed securities that the government inherited as part of the A.I.G. bailout. In three separate sales, the New York Fed sold bonds with a face value of $6.2 billion to Goldman Sachs, and about $13 billion to Credit Suisse.
In March, A.I.G. repaid an investment of $1.5 billion the Treasury Department made in AIA Aurora, an entity that was set up in 2009 to hold shares of the AIA Group, which was spun off from the insurer in 2010. That payment was made a year ahead of schedule.
This will be the third common stock offering by the government. In March, the Treasury Department sold $6 billion of A.I.G. shares at $29 apiece, trimming its stake to 70 percent from 77 percent. A.I.G. bought $3 billion worth of shares in that sale. That followed a 2011 sale of roughly 200 million shares.
''Today we are announcing further progress in our efforts to reach our goal of having the taxpayers recoup their investment in A.I.G. at a profit,'' Robert H. Benmosche, the insurer's chief executive, said in a statement on Friday. ''This is another tremendous step forward for our company, our shareholders and the American taxpayer.''
A.I.G. has been slowly healing from its crisis-era wounds. On Thursday, A.I.G. reported $3.2 billion in first-quarter profits, a healthy increase from $1.3 billion in the first quarter of last year. In a statement accompanying the results, Mr. Benmosche said the firm was ''rebuilding A.I.G.'s legacy of excellence.''
A date has not been announced for the offering, which is being run by Bank of America, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Dewey's Fall Underscores Law Firms' New Reality

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
When I graduated from law school in the 1970s, Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood rolled off the tongue in the same company as Sullivan & Cromwell, Davis Polk & Wardwell, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore, venerable New York firms whose place at the pinnacle of the law profession seemed unassailable. For a young lawyer, a job at any of them was the first step to the golden ring of partnership and, with it, lifetime tenure, prestige and affluence.
Maybe that's why the seemingly inevitable collapse of a firm like Dewey, since renamed Dewey & LeBoeuf as a result of a 2007 merger, has so rocked the legal profession. Dewey is hardly the first major law firm to fail. Recent years have seen the demise of once-respected names like Howrey & Simon; Coudert Brothers; Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison; and Heller Ehrman. But none had the pedigree of Dewey, named for the former New York governor and presidential candidate Thomas E. Dewey. 
As the dire plight of Dewey & LeBoeuf worsened this week, a partner, Stuart Saft, the head of the firm's global real estate practice, decamped to Holland & Knight. ''Apart from the last six weeks,'' he told me, his time at Dewey represents ''the best five years of my professional career. We worked on the largest and most complicated and interesting deals in the world. That's what practicing law is all about, not the size of your paycheck. Maybe the business model wasn't the best. But as lawyers we did fabulous work.'' Dewey's collapse ''is as crazy as Arthur Andersen going under,'' he added. ''It's a loss. We became a media sensation, and now a great firm is disappearing.''
The circumstances at Dewey may turn out to be extreme. But the firm's messy decline lays bare the harsh realities of today's law practice, and shatters the perception, still held by many members of the bar, that however transformed in recent decades by the realities of the market, law is at heart still a guild, a brotherhood (and increasingly a sisterhood) -- in short, a profession more than a business.
As dispatches from my Times colleague Peter Lattman have made abundantly clear, Dewey collapsed under the weight of a toxic combination of high leverage, lavish financial guarantees to many partners and faltering revenue. This makes it, in many ways, the Lehman Brothers of the legal profession, although perhaps that's unfair to Lehman Brothers. Though highly leveraged, Lehman Brothers had enormous assets on its balance sheet -- while Dewey, like law firms generally, had scant tangible assets. Nonetheless, that didn't stop the firm from heavy borrowing of about $225 million, both by issuing bonds and by drawing on a large line of credit.
''This absolutely falls into the category: What were they thinking?'' Bruce MacEwen, a lawyer and president of Adam Smith Esq. and an expert on law firm economics, told me this week, as Dewey suffered a new wave of partner defections and the firm's accelerating collapse appeared unstoppable. ''This was Mismanagement 101 across the board. They had a ringside seat for the collapse of Lehman and Bear Stearns. But they had the same mismatch of assets and liabilities. They took on a massive amount of long-term debt, but their assets are short term: they walk out of the firm every day and may not come back, which is what more and more of them did.''
It's not yet clear how the firm used the debt proceeds. Partners say most of the debt predated the merger with LeBoeuf, and was a rational and cost-effective way to try to manage existing debt. Still, it seems likely at least some of it went to meet the extensive guarantees the firm made to individual partners, some reaching millions of dollars and apparently extending over many years.
Other lawyers and management consultants have been shocked by the size and duration of the guarantees that appear to have prevailed at Dewey. ''The guarantees were extremely corrosive culturally because they were divorced from individual or firm performance, which shatters the whole notion of a partnership,'' Mr. MacEwen said. ''And they were promiscuously awarded.'' Although such guarantees have been spreading throughout the profession, the magnitude of those at Dewey ''is unheard-of,'' said Thomas S. Clay, a principal at Altman Weil law firm consultants. ''We recommend only one to two years for a guarantee. And those usually also have some performance component.''
Another law firm consultant, Peter Zeughauser, said that much of the onus fell on incumbent Dewey partners who insisted on their own guarantees. ''It's common to give guarantees to lateral hires,'' he said. ''But you need the existing partners to buy into the strategy. At Dewey, some of the most important partners didn't buy in. They said, 'If they're getting a guarantee, I should, too.' They weren't willing to invest in new partners. That's very unusual.''
In what appears to have been an increasingly desperate effort to hang onto its prestige and profits, Dewey violated some unwritten but still sacred rules of the profession. As the exodus of partners began last year, the firm's managers publicly disparaged their departing colleagues. In the once-collegial profession, when partners left -- no matter what the circumstances, short of embezzlement or fraud -- the firm wished them well and said nothing to disparage them.
By contrast, Dewey issued a statement saying that the firm was moving in a ''new direction'' and that departing partners ''didn't like the change'' and were part of ''firm-initiated reductions,'' implying they were asked to leave. ''Trashing your partners: How classy is that?'' Mr. MacEwen said. It was also almost surely untrue. ''It should be obvious that the partners who leave are the most mobile,'' he said.
And the firm seems to have violated another unwritten law: it inflated its revenue in the annual American Lawyer survey of law firm rankings, the AmLaw 100, the equivalent of the Fortune 500 for law firms. The annual survey, which relies on self-reporting, is indispensable to clients, other lawyers and law school graduates choosing firms. After Dewey partners provided Bloomberg News with profit numbers that differed sharply from what the firm had reported to American Lawyer, AmLaw restated Dewey's 2010 and 2011 results, which dropped Dewey's revenue per lawyer in 2011 to $750,000 from $900,000 and lowered the firm's rank based on revenue to 28th from 22nd in 2010. Dewey has defended its reporting and said the discrepancies resulted from differing methodologies.
The practices of Dewey's ousted chairman are now under investigation both by the firm itself and the Manhattan district attorney.
Of course, Dewey's managing partners may have been confronting the realities of a vastly more competitive market for professional services. When I was a young associate at Cravath, one of my tasks was to compile the detailed billing records, organize them and submit them to the senior partner. What emerged for the client was a one-sentence bill in calligraphy on beautiful stationery: ''For professional services rendered,'' followed by the time period covered and a large number with a dollar sign. So far as I know no client ever objected or asked for a more detailed explanation, and had they done so, I suspect the senior partner would have deemed it a grave breach of trust.
Today, firms bargain over rates and compete fiercely for both their own talent and for clients. Clients have figured out that much of what lawyers do is a commodity that can easily be outsourced far more cheaply. Law firms always had a few dynamic partners who wielded disproportionate influence both within and outside the firm, and another group who may have been highly skilled and specialized, but were rarely seen by clients. They were supported by a broad base of lower-paid associates who developed their skills at client expense and performed, in many instances, relatively menial and repetitive tasks. ''There's a dawning recognition that many partners don't add much value other than their legal work,'' Mr. Clay said. ''Many are being asked to leave, or to accept a nonequity, salaried partner status.''
Mr. Saft, the former Dewey partner, contended: ''The partner guarantees are symptomatic of the underlying change in the practice of law over the last several decades. Before that, law firms were partnerships. It was an institutional practice, not individuals with portable books of business. Now, everyone has become a free agent. It has changed and destabilized the nature of the legal profession. And once it takes hold, it accelerates. Other firms say they don't do it, but I wonder if that's really true.''
Mr. MacEwen was inclined to agree. ''I've been struggling with the degree to which Dewey is a lesson for other firms,'' he said. ''Everything they did was so extreme and so ill advised. But part of me has to admit that the dynamics of the practice, the eat-what-you-kill remuneration model, makes a law firm inherently fragile. And part of the lesson of Dewey is that if you put practices in place, like the guarantees, that corrode culture, then you're playing with fire.''

HEADLINE: A Down Week, Worsened by a Weak Jobs Report

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Catherine Rampell and David Jolly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks sank on Friday, with the broader market posting its biggest weekly decline this year after a disappointing report on jobs in the United States.
The jobs report, a closely scrutinized monthly gauge from the Labor Department on how the economy is faring, carried the mood over from Asia and Europe, where shares were down after a survey showed that euro zone economies contracted at an accelerating rate last month.
The monthly Labor Department report showed that the nation's employers added 115,000 jobs in April, fewer than economists had predicted. The unemployment rate ticked down to 8.1 percent in April from 8.2 percent in March, but that was because workers dropped out of the labor force. The share of working-age Americans who are in the labor force, either working or actively looking for a job, is now at its lowest level since 1981. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 22.47 points, or 1.61 percent, at 1,369.10. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 168.32 points, or 1.27 percent, to 13,038.27. The Nasdaq composite index was down 67.96 points, or 2.25 percent, at 2,956.34.
The indexes finished the week lower, with the S.& P. down 2.4 percent over the five days, making it the biggest weekly decline since the week that ended Dec. 16, when it finished 2.8 percent lower. The Dow was down 1.4 percent for the week and the Nasdaq slipped 3.6 percent, its biggest weekly decline this year.
''The labor market data confirms that the economy gained little momentum over the past six to nine months,'' said Steven Ricchiuto, the chief economist for Mizuho Securities USA, in an economic commentary. ''The economy has just not been able to build forward momentum.''
Crude oil slid below $100 for the first time since February, with Nymex futures for June delivery down to $98.49. Energy stocks and technology stocks were the biggest losers on the S.& P., with each sector declining 2 percent.
Microsoft lost 2.5 percent to $30.98, while the Oracle Corporation fell 3.3 percent to $28.41. Halliburton was down 4.5 percent to $32.53. Exxon Mobil fell 1.3 percent to $84.57. Shares in Yahoo, where one of its largest investors is calling for the firing of the company's chief executive, fell 1.6 percent to $15.15.
Financials were lower as well. Bank of America fell 3.3 percent to $7.74. Citigroup was down 2.7 percent to $31.60.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 16/32, to 101 3/32, and the yield fell to 1.88 percent, from 1.93 percent late Thursday.
The late-week decline dimmed a bright note at the start of the week when April became the seventh consecutive month that the Dow closed higher, rising more than 21 percent in that period. The S.& P. index, on the other hand, recorded its first monthly decline since November on Monday, the last day of April.
On Thursday, initial jobless claims in the United States posted their biggest weekly drop in about a year, while the rate of growth in the services sector slowed last month more than forecast, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Manufacturing activity, however, picked up, the institute said in a separate report this week.
Stocks were also lower on Wednesday as statistics showed that private sector hiring declined to a seven-month low in April, according to ADP, the payrolls company.
Still, corporate earnings have provided some bright spots. In the S.& P. 500, 67 percent of companies that have reported results have beaten their earnings estimates, according to a survey released Friday by Thomson Reuters.In Europe on Friday, the Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, was off 1.7 percent, while the FTSE 100 index in London closed 1.9 percent lower. A survey of purchasing managers by Markit Economics found that euro area services and manufacturing both declined in April. Markit's euro area composite index fell to 46.7 points from 49.1 in March, revised from the 47.4 points it estimated in a previous reading of the March data. An index level below 50 points signals contraction.
The data suggests that the euro zone economy is continuing to decline for a third consecutive quarter, shrinking at a quarterly rate of about 0.5 percent in April, according to Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist.
''Little can be said to remain of any 'core' of strength in the region,'' Mr. Williamson said in a statement. ''Growth has practically ground to a halt even in Germany, and France has joined Italy and Spain in seeing a strong rate of economic decline.''
With a majority of global equity trading now generated by computer programs run by big banks and investment funds, analysts caution against reading too much into daily stock moves as a reflection of market sentiment.

HEADLINE: Group Planning Protest at Party Convention Rankles Some With Name Change

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
What's in a name? The biggest group planning to demonstrate in September at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., has decided to change its name from the Coalition to Protest at the DNC to the Coalition to March on Wall Street South -- Building People's Power During the DNC. The change has spurred debate within the protest movement.
Organizers said they hoped the new name would capture the energy and enthusiasm of the Occupy Wall Street movement and highlight the fact that the convention was being held in a financial capital that is home to Bank of America. 
The coalition says it has endorsements from a wide variety of activists and organizations: political groups, union locals, antiwar groups and the Occupy movements in several Southern cities, including Occupy Charlotte and Occupy Durham in North Carolina. Organizers told some members in an e-mail that ''many found in our outreach that the name of our coalition had become a barrier to bringing more organizations on board.'' But some activists feared that by shifting the emphasis away from the Democrats, the new name would give the party a pass.
''It shows a real lack of integrity, I think, to let Democrats off the hook,'' said Cindy Sheehan, a well-known antiwar protester whose son, Casey, was killed in Iraq, adding that the name change was making her rethink her plans to attend protests in Charlotte. ''They are as much the party of war as the Republicans, the party of Wall Street.''
Organizers said that the new name was not intended to take the pressure off the Democratic Party. ''It's not just about the Democratic Party, it's not just about the Republican Party, it's about the whole system -- the banks, the corporations, their role in the economic crisis and the incredible influence they have in the political system,'' said Ben Carroll, a co-chairman of the coalition's media and communications working group. He said that the decision had been unanimous and that the new name would take effect soon.
To some protesters, however, the new name revived long-simmering tensions over how vigorously the left is willing to protest Democrats if it fears that the protests could end up helping Republicans. Some of those fears have their roots in the antiwar protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where the searing images of demonstrators being clubbed by the police helped bring opposition to the Vietnam War front and center, but also might have helped elect Richard M. Nixon, a Republican, that fall.
(''What had happened in the streets had destroyed any chances the Democrats might have had of holding onto the presidency,'' one of the organizers, Abbie Hoffman, later wrote, unapologetically.)
President Obama has antagonized the left over a host of issues. Some have criticized him as insufficiently cracking down on Wall Street. Others have opposed his decisions to use drone strikes overseas; order the killing of an American citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki, in Yemen; and extend some of the expanded counterterrorism and surveillance powers in the USA Patriot Act.
So when news of the new name, with its reduced emphasis on the Democratic Party, began to circulate last week, some activists were upset.
''What a sellout!'' John Penley, a veteran antiwar activist, wrote on his Facebook page, where he spread the word about the change. Mr. Penley -- who said he planned to demonstrate at next week's Bank of America shareholders' meeting in Charlotte by washing the American flag he has worn to many Occupy Wall Street protests, to cleanse it of ''corporate control and militarism'' -- said in an interview that he feared the convention protests were being co-opted by groups that ultimately want to help elect Democrats.
Mr. Carroll said that the coalition's goals remained the same. A ''Call to Action'' posted on its Web site does contain criticism of the Democrats, noting that progressives plan to converge in Charlotte ''to oppose policies of the Democratic Party and their banking cronies'' and stating that ''Democrats and Republicans are pushing austerity programs while simultaneously brokering deals that bail out and benefit banks and large corporations.''
The coalition could face challenges beyond its name: Mr. Carroll said that it was having trouble getting permits to march within sight and sound of the big banks and the convention. He pointed out that Charlotte passed new ordinances in January giving the city the power to declare an ''extraordinary event.'' That would expand the ability of the police to stop and search people and prohibit, among other things, some backpacks, masks or scarves that could hide someone's identity, and rocks or bottles that could be used as projectiles.
The group planning to hold protests this summer at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., has a less ambiguous name. It is called the Coalition to March on the RNC.

HEADLINE: Contrarian Bond Buyers Are Bullish On Greece

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
LONDON -- As Greece girds for an election on Sunday that top politicians warn could ultimately force the countryto leave the euro zone, some risk-happy investors have adopted an improbable rallying cry: buy Greek bonds now.
Among counterintuitive bets, few in Europe match this one. 
Just two months ago, foreign investors were forced to accept a 75 percent loss on their Greek debt holdings. And the widely held view is that even the newly restructured and already deeply discounted Greek bonds will face another write-down once Greece runs out of cash again.
The common wisdom holds that the new Greek government, whatever its composition, will be unable to force another round of public spending cuts on its people. That could prompt Greece to leave the euro currency union and default on its debt.
But the contrarians, who are mainly distressed-debt experts, see a buying opportunity. They favorably compare the junklike 21 percent yields on Greek bonds to the much lower returns, but comparable risks, on bonds of international renegades like Venezuela and Argentina, which now trade in the 11 to 13 percent range.
''This is the trade of the year,'' said Hans Humes, president of Greylock Capital, a New York-based hedge fund. Greylock is actively buying the debt at prices that have ranged from 19 to 25 cents on the dollar. ''It's a no-brainer,'' Mr. Humes said.
To be clear: the strategy is fraught with risk. But unlike previous and largely unsuccessful hedge fund strategies that tried to anticipate how and when Greece might pay off investors, this bet is a pure play that Greece is going to survive as a member in good standing of the euro zone nations.
Investors like Mr. Humes are betting that a new Greek government -- even if it is a coalition that includes unruly splinter parties -- will have to accept demands from Europe and the International Monetary Fund that the country adopt yet another round of to-the-bone spending cuts, to secure the money it needs to survive and make good on its debts.
Bond traders say that others now doubling down on Greece include Banco BTG Pactual, the Brazilian investment bank; Finisterre Capital, a London-based fund company that specializes in emerging markets and, in particular, Brevan Howard, one of Europe's largest hedge funds.
Mr. Humes was a member of the steering committee that negotiated the deal in March that erased 100 billion euros from Greece's still-staggering debt load, but left investors like himself with eye-watering losses. Even after that bailout deal, Greek government debt is 160 percent of its gross domestic product -- still the highest level in Europe.
But instead of selling the revamped bonds as almost certain to fail, the way many investors have done, Mr. Humes has been aggressively adding to his position.
His thesis is simple. With European governments and the I.M.F. now owning nearly three-quarters of Greek debt, there is not likely to be another restructuring that would force bondholders to take another big haircut.
That is because, according to this theory, the European Union and I.M.F., will do whatever it takes to prevent the ultimate holders of that debt -- taxpayers in Europe and the United States -- from suffering the type of losses on Greek bonds that commercial investors had to stomach.
Traders also note that the amount of Greek debt in private hands is relatively small, about 12 billion euros ($15.7 billion) -- a level that back in the heyday of Greek borrowing earlier this decade might have been the size of a single bond issue.
With so little debt in private hands, investors like Mr. Humes say, it would make little sense for Greece to force another restructuring on private investors because it would make no more than a small dent in Greece's daunting debt burden of 260 billion euros ($353 billion).
''Greece will not default on the private sector this time around,'' Mr. Humes predicted.
The investors buying Greek debt, particularly BTG Pactual and Mr. Humes's Greylock, tend to be veterans of the debt restructuring wave in Latin America in the 1990s. Then, countries like Mexico and Brazil forced bondholders to take a loss on their original securities and to accept so-called Brady bonds in return.
When these countries made good on their promises to reform their economies, the new bonds, which took the name of their intellectual father, Nicholas F. Brady, the former United States Treasury secretary, soared in value. They made a mint for those who were brave enough to load up on them at the beginning.
Now, as then, a high tolerance for risk is essential.
This week the ratings agency Fitch said a Greek exit from the euro zone was increasingly likely. And in a pre-election report on Greece, economists at UBS said that investors should be ''worried, very worried'' about the prospect that the vote will result in a government without the strength and credibility to push through the next round of spending cuts. UBS calculates that Greece still needs to come with budget trims equivalent to more than 7 percent of G.D.P.
With the Greek economy in its fifth year of recession and with unemployment more than 20 percent, even the strongest of governments would be hard pressed to ask such an additional sacrifice from its citizens -- to say nothing of the new government that, whatever the election results, is likely to be one of the most fractious in recent history.
What is more, UBS contends, even with the recent restructuring, Greece's interest payments remain too much for the country to bear over the long term, at 15 percent of government tax revenue. (Even a 10 percent figure would be considered unsustainable by credit analysts).
The Greek bond bulls are not ignoring all this. They're just saying that these many negatives are already reflected in the price.
''The politics are shambolic and the recession is massive,'' said Alex Garrard, a senior debt trader for BTG Pactual in London. ''But in the end, Europe cannot walk away from Greece.''

HEADLINE: Tighter Rules Are Issued On Municipal Bond Deals

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Federal regulators trying to prevent more debt disasters like the one in Jefferson County, Ala., tightened a rule on Friday for the brokerage firms that help cities and states raise billions of dollars every year.
The action, in the form of an interpretive guidance, is intended to rein in practices like Wall Street firms' underwriting a state's bonds while simultaneously helping other customers trade against the bonds, or taking municipal officials on lavish junkets and billing the costs to unsuspecting local taxpayers.
Underwriters will also be required for the first time to disclose specific information to municipalities on risks and potential conflicts of interest. 
There are already rules against ''deceptive practices,'' but the need for tighter controls became clear during the financial crisis of 2008, when many municipalities were left struggling to extricate themselves from costly and intricate bond deals whose risks they had not understood. Many said they signed up for the deals because they thought they were saving their residents money.
The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, a self-regulatory body for market participants, wrote the new guidance. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved it on Friday and will enforce it as federal law.
''These new rules are the biggest development in protection of the financial interests of state and local governments since the M.S.R.B. was established in 1975,'' said Alan D. Polsky, chairman of the rulemaking board.
The guidance, which takes effect in August, does not ban outright the complex and risky transactions.
Under the original rule, the underwriters were required to treat ''all persons'' fairly, which many took to mean they had only to charge a fair price to investors who bought a municipality's bonds [#x20ac]" not to pay fair prices to the states and cities that issued the debt. The board said that the new guidance was the first in which the fairness requirement was ''fully articulated.''
Many bond deals over the last decade were so complex it was hard for local officials to even understand how they worked, much less confirm that the terms were fair.
Underwriters will also be required to tell their municipal clients about any payments received from other firms, like bond insurers taking part in bond transactions, derivatives advisers, lawyers and others.
That requirement responds to episodes like the long-running bribery case in Jefferson County, Ala., now the biggest municipal bankruptcy case in United States history. Two officials of J. P. Morgan Securities, eager to underwrite a $5 billion bond and derivatives deal in 2003, paid more than $8 million to broker-dealers in Alabama who did no work on the transaction but could help steer the business to J. P. Morgan. The bankers then charged the cost of their illicit payments to the county's taxpayers by inflating the interest rate the county paid on an interest-rate swap.
The two bankers were fired. Charges against them are pending.
The rules against wining and dining officials, then sending their taxpayers the bills, grow out of the practice of flying local officials to New York to meet with the credit analysts who would rate their communities' bonds. Such meetings might take a day or two, but some underwriters invited the municipal officials to bring their wives, children and other relatives, stay on for the week and be taken to Broadway shows, sports events and expensive restaurants.
The rule-makers cited a 2009 case in which the S.E.C. fined RBC Capital Markets $125,000 for factoring the cost of such entertainment into the debt being taken on by Mesquite, Tex.
The S.E.C. has only limited authority over state and local finances, but in the last few years federal officials have sought ways to expand their oversight, saying the municipal bond market had grown too big to be so lightly regulated.
The S.E.C. could act in the municipal market only in cases of fraud, when it could prove intent. Now it will be able to act without that burden of proof.
Some of the most forceful calls for more federal involvement in municipal bond issuing came from California, which issues more bonds and debt most years than any other state.
The state treasurer there, Bill Lockyer, discovered during the turmoil of 2008 that Goldman Sachs had issued a research report telling clients how they might bet against the creditworthiness of states, including California, by using derivatives known as credit-default swaps.
The report ranked states by the degree of distress they were in, and by which appeared to have the most unsustainable public pension funds.
California was having difficulty issuing short-term debt that fall because the markets were nearly frozen. Mr. Lockyer was incensed to learn that Goldman Sachs, an important underwriter of California's debt, was telling clients how they might take a position against it.
Goldman and half a dozen other financial institutions responded to Mr. Lockyer's questions by confirming that they were dealing in credit-default swaps but arguing that the swaps had many valid uses and might even lower California's borrowing costs.
Mr. Lockyer did not believe it and began lobbying the architects of the 2010 financial reform legislation to ban the use of credit-default swaps for speculation.
The new guidance does not ban such activity but requires underwriters to give cities and states current information about their involvement in it, in time for local officials to decide whether to find a different underwriter.
''I'd like to see an outright ban against having the investment bank bet against the bond issuer with whom they're working,'' Mr. Lockyer said in an interview on Friday. ''But if we can't have that, robust disclosure is at least a good start.''

HEADLINE: New Rule Requires Disclosure of Drilling Chemicals, but Only After Their Use

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration on Friday issued a proposed rule governing hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas on public lands that will for the first time require disclosure of the chemicals used in the process.
But in a significant concession to the oil industry, companies will have to reveal the composition of fluids only after they have completed drilling -- a sharp change from the government's original proposal, which would have required disclosure of the chemicals 30 days before a well could be started.
The pullback on the rule followed a series of meetings at the White House after the original regulation was proposed in February. Lobbyists representing oil industry trade associations and individual major producers like ExxonMobil, XTO Energy, Apache, Samson Resources and Anadarko Petroleum met with officials of the Office of Management and Budget, who reworked the rule to address industry concerns about overlapping state regulations and the cost of compliance. 
Production of domestic oil and natural gas has surged in recent years as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have opened new fields and allowed renewed production from formations that had seemed depleted.
President Obama has strongly endorsed the new production as a boon to the economy and energy security. And the president, under intense criticism of his energy policies from Republicans and oil industry officials as he faces a re-election contest, has recently taken steps to ease government regulation of oil operations.
In its original proposal that oil companies disclose the chemicals they intend to use in drilling before starting a well, the Interior Department was seeking to address the concerns of landowners and communities about potential pollution of groundwater.
But the industry objected, saying that the additional paperwork would slow the permitting process and potentially jeopardize trade secrets. The government then agreed to allow companies to reveal the contents of drilling fluids after the operation had been completed.
Interior Department officials said that having a record would allow scientists to trace any future contamination and that it did not matter whether the fluids were disclosed before or after drilling.
Last month Mr. Obama ordered the creation of an interagency task force to streamline federal regulation of natural gas drilling, and the Environmental Protection Agency issued revised air quality rules for oil and gas wells that gave drillers extra time to comply and lowered their costs. Industry officials praised both moves.
The draft rule affects drilling operations on the 700 million acres of public land administered by the Bureau of Land Management, as well as 56 million acres of Indian lands. The Interior Department estimates that 90 percent of the 3,400 wells drilled each year on public and Indian lands use hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as fracking, in which large volumes of water, sand and chemicals are injected under high pressure into shale rock formations to stimulate the flow of oil and gas.
The process has raised concerns about contamination of groundwater, well integrity and the treatment of the tainted water that flows out of wells during and after fracking operations.
A majority of the 13,000 wells drilled each year by fracking are on private lands and thus fall primarily under state regulation, as they have for 60 years. Although rules and the rigor of enforcement vary from state to state, there have been efforts in recent years to standardize reporting under government and industry bodies like the Ground Water Protection Council and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission.
The federal government's rules regarding oil and gas fracturing on public lands were last revised in 1988, before many modern techniques were adopted. The states where much of the activity takes place on public and private lands -- including Arkansas, Colorado, North Dakota, Texas and Wyoming -- have updated their rules and require disclosure of fracking chemicals at a Web site called FracFocus.
The new federal rule seeks to integrate the state and federal reporting efforts, although environmental and citizen groups say the state database is difficult to use.
The new regulation also broadens the definition of waters to be protected during drilling operations from ''fresh waters'' to ''usable waters,'' encompassing water used for construction, agriculture and other purposes.
The Interior Department said that the rule imposed few new regulatory requirements that were not already being met at the state level and that it would not slow the granting of drilling permits. Barry Russell, president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, said that companies were already having trouble getting permission to drill on public land.
Referring to the Bureau of Land Management, Mr. Russell said in a statement: ''B.L.M.'s proposed regulations, which would mandate one-size-fits-all regulations on well construction and hydraulic fracturing operations on these lands, are redundant. They will undoubtedly insert an unnecessary layer of rigidity into the permitting and development process.''

HEADLINE: At Sunday Meetings, Team Obama Prepares For a Grueling Fight

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama walks into the Roosevelt Room of the White House and takes his seat around a table. The West Wing, as on most Sunday evenings, is quiet except for the tight circle of advisers who gather for a confidential briefing on his re-election.
The gathering often takes place after Mr. Obama's regular Sunday round of golf, and while the atmosphere is casual, the agenda is anything but: keeping the president immersed in what it will take to win a second term. He receives an update on how his operation is expanding in battleground states, he watches previews of television ads and he studies a presentation on his various paths to victory.
These previously undisclosed sessions, which take place nearly every other week just across the hall from the Oval Office, are designed to bridge a divide between his campaign headquarters in Chicago and his aides in Washington in preparing for what Mr. Obama and his team anticipate will be a grueling race against Mitt Romney.
The cast of top advisers -- a group limited to 10 in hopes of streamlining the meetings -- offers a revealing look at the pecking order of the hierarchy in the Obama campaign. 
Neither Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. nor any other cabinet members are on hand. Instead, the room is filled with a group of trusted confidants who were at Mr. Obama's side during the last campaign.
The attendance roster, which was confirmed by multiple people familiar with the list, reveals a mix of White House staff, including David Plouffe, a senior adviser and campaign manager from 2008; Jacob J. Lew, the chief of staff; Valerie Jarrett and Pete Rouse, senior advisers; Dan Pfeiffer, the communications director; and Alyssa Mastromonaco, a deputy chief of staff who has worked for Mr. Obama since his days in the Senate.
The campaign team includes Jim Messina, the campaign manager, who sets the agenda for the meeting; David Axelrod, a senior strategist; Stephanie Cutter, a deputy campaign manager; and Larry Grisolano, a top political adviser.
The president, who is set to open his re-election campaign formally on Saturday with back-to-back rallies in Ohio and Virginia, has been preparing to run against Mr. Romney since well before the Republican nomination was settled. Mr. Obama has been studying the statements and record of his opponent -- particularly on the Massachusetts health care law, a model for the national law -- and is well on his way to becoming a student of Mr. Romney's positions.
Mr. Obama, who three years ago became the first president to demand a BlackBerry to keep in touch with the outside world, has now become the first sitting president to rely on an iPad to stay informed. He watches campaign commercials, offering his seal of approval to the first wave of advertisements to be used against Mr. Romney, and he follows his rival through newspaper articles and blogs.
The president has already made clear that he is well acquainted with Mr. Romney's views. At a news conference this week, Mr. Obama urged people to ''take a look'' at his opponent. He reprised a comment by Mr. Romney in 2007 when he said he would not invade a country to capture or kill Osama bin Laden.
''I said that I'd go after Bin Laden if we had a clear shot at him,'' Mr. Obama said, ''and I did.''
If running for president the first time is a full-time job, running for re-election is a bit like moonlighting. For all the planning that Mr. Obama's team employs, uncertainties like the jobs report on Friday mornings often end up driving the election.
Even so, some presidents are more political than others. Mr. Obama is intensely competitive, but far from obsessive about politics in the way that former President Bill Clinton is. Mr. Obama's approach is closer to that of former President George W. Bush, who assumed a bird's-eye view of his re-election bid.
In a contest increasingly guided by factors beyond the direct control of either candidate, Mr. Obama has gradually increased the attention he has devoted to the race. Yet aides say he still spends far more time on his iPad checking scores on ESPN than obsessively reading up on Mr. Romney, or digging into the weeds of his own polls or campaign metrics.
The Sunday meeting, which participants have sworn to keep secret, was devised by his advisers to help Mr. Obama begin focusing on his re-election bid. The time is intentionally carved out to discuss big-picture themes that the president will use to challenge Mr. Romney.
''They have a candidate now, and the president is certainly paying more attention to that candidate, his arguments and his record and approach,'' said Mr. Axelrod, a senior adviser, whose cellphone rings with increasing frequency, with the president on the line hoping to talk about the campaign. ''He's homing in on the race, but unlike the other guy, he has a day job, and that is still where the bulk of his attention has to be.''
Mr. Obama has told associates that he is aware of the precariousness of the political environment for him. He asks aides about his campaign message. He craves the bullet-point summaries of polls, but he does not delve into the fine print of surveys or other campaign research.
They say he is intensely motivated to win not only because of his personal legacy and the historic nature of his presidency. He also sees a second term as essential, they said, to ensuring that key policies like his national health care law, which could be overthrown by the Supreme Court, are not wiped from the books.
''Every election is the most important election in our history,'' Mr. Obama said the other night at a fund-raising event, offering a window into his campaign message. ''But let me tell you, this one matters. This one matters. This one matters.''
The president will make his case against Mr. Romney on Saturday more forcefully than he has, aides said, hoping to define his opponent before the fall campaign.
He has met Mr. Romney only once -- they shared the stage at a 2004 Gridiron dinner in Washington -- and he has told friends that he respects Mr. Romney's intellect, but bristles at his view of government and economic fairness.
When their paths crossed eight years ago, Mr. Obama playfully mocked Mr. Romney and encouraged him to ''go for it.'' He reflected on the losing presidential campaign of Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and jabbed Mr. Romney, ''I hear that Massachusetts is a great launching pad.''
The rallies for the president on Saturday in Columbus, Ohio, and Richmond, Va., are expected to help capture the enthusiasm of students before the summer begins.
Campaign aides will register volunteers with iPads, and keep their information for the fall campaign. Aides said more than 48,000 people signed up by text message to win ''Backstage with Barack'' passes.
Six months before Election Day, Mr. Obama waxes nostalgic at the events of his presidency. He seldom talks about the Nobel Peace Prize he was awarded. The oil spill along the Gulf Coast -- once described as his Hurricane Katrina -- is rarely mentioned. But he warns Democrats that the trials of his first term are about to be unspooled in a bare-knuckle campaign.
''There's nothing more humbling, actually, than being president,'' Mr. Obama said the other day at a fund-raiser, where his words almost lapsed into past tense as he stood beside Mr. Clinton and talked about Air Force One. ''It's a great plane, and I'll miss it, too!''
''But not yet!'' a supporter shouted from the audience, trying to buck him up.
As applause rose from the crowd, Mr. Obama paused and declared, ''But not yet!''

HEADLINE: Job Numbers Become Instant Campaign Fodder

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Binyamin Appelbaum and Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting from Washington. Ashley Parker contributed reporting from Pittsburgh.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney responded to Friday's weaker-than-expected job numbers with a sweeping denunciation, declaring it a ''terrible and very disappointing report'' -- evidence of an economy that is ''slowing down, not speeding up.''
President Obama responded by telling high school seniors in Virginia that he would push Congress to take action on some ''common sense ideas,'' like not raising the borrowing rates for student loans.
The disparity in those reactions speaks not only to the natural differences between incumbent and challenger, but also to the very different ways in which Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, are talking about the economy as a robust recovery continues to elude the White House. 
The president has doggedly pushed piecemeal proposals that he says will improve the lives of middle-income Americans -- from hiring teachers and firefighters to streamlining the refinancing of home mortgages -- as a way to revive the broader job market in the face of a hostile Congress. Mr. Romney has tried to keep the focus on the big picture -- one that he contends reveals a president who has failed as a custodian of the economy.
For the White House, the second consecutive month of anemic job growth was an unwelcome portent on the eve of the first big campaign rallies of Mr. Obama's re-election bid, in Ohio and Virginia. It virtually guarantees that the economy will remain the dominant issue in the campaign, making it hard for the president to shift the focus to social issues or national security, where he has been able to stake out a stronger position.
Still, according to economists, political analysts and White House advisers, the payroll numbers were not bad enough to alter the basic narrative of an economy that is climbing, slowly but steadily, out of a historic recession.
''One month does not a trend make, and neither does two, but it gets you closer to a trend,'' said Jared Bernstein, a former chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ''Once you see three months of deceleration on payrolls, along with other economic indicators, then you have a right to be more worried.''
For Mr. Romney, who has treated previous job reports somewhat gingerly, the latest numbers elicited a searing tone, one that critics said edged into hyperbole. Speaking on the campaign trail in Pittsburgh, Mr. Romney said the economy ought to be adding 500,000 jobs a month -- a growth rate the United States has achieved only five times in the last 50 years -- and that any unemployment rate above 4 percent was a cause for concern.
In an open letter to Mr. Obama, published in The Plain Dealer a day before his rally at Ohio State University in Columbus, Mr. Romney wrote, ''I have a simple question for you: Where are the jobs?''
Mr. Obama reacted to the bad news Friday much as he absorbed the better-than-expected job reports in January and February: accentuating the positive elements while conceding it was not enough. The economy, he noted, created 130,000 private sector jobs, while the unemployment rate dropped to 8.1 percent from 8.2 percent.
''That's the good news,'' the president said at Washington-Lee High School, after meeting with college-bound seniors. ''But there are still a lot of folks out of work, which means we've got to do more.''
Then he pivoted swiftly to a looming increase in borrowing costs for student loans, which would cause interest rates on these loans to double, to 6.8 percent from 3.4 percent. Last week, the House passed a bill, 215 to 195, to maintain the rate for one year, but required that the $5.9 billion cost be offset by ending the Prevention and Public Health Fund contained in the health care law.
The president has threatened to veto the measure but he is not likely to be given the chance. Senate Democrats say they will bring their own bill to the floor for a procedural vote as early as next Tuesday. That bill would pay for the cost of the loan rate extension by closing some tax loopholes used by high-wage earners.
''My message to Congress is going to be, 'Just saying no to ideas that will create new jobs is not an option,' '' Mr. Obama said in Arlington, Va. ''There's too much at stake for us not to be all rowing in the same direction.''
White House and campaign officials said Mr. Obama spoke often about the broad economy, but filled in his canvas with concrete ideas and policy proposals. Mr. Romney, they said, has not done that, and the remedies he has proposed are the kinds of tax breaks and rollback of regulations that deepened the financial crisis of 2008.
''Romney doesn't offer specifics, except, 'let's go back to what's already failed.' '' said David Plouffe, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama. ''To the extent that Romney is offering any ideas at all, it is, 'cut taxes for people like Romney.' ''
In fact, the Romney campaign has published an 87-page plan to reinvigorate the job market and the economy, full of proposals to overhaul the tax code and strike down regulations that Mr. Romney claims strangle American business. A spokeswoman for the Romney campaign, Andrea Saul, said ''President Obama's policies have brought us fewer jobs, stagnant incomes and higher energy prices.''
On a day like this, analysts said Mr. Romney could afford to keep the spotlight firmly on Mr. Obama. He noted that even the statistic cited approvingly by the president -- the drop in the jobless rate to 8.1 percent -- was because 340,000 people left the work force, not because the economy was creating a lot of new jobs.
Mr. Obama's case, economists said, is complicated by the fact that there is not much he can do with fiscal policy that would change the economic picture between now and November. And while the Federal Reserve still has the power to jolt the economy, the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has made clear recently that it does not want to deviate from its current course of already expansive monetary policy.
White House officials argue that the overall economic trend matters more than the ups and down of the job report. ''Even though the job growth has been less than anybody wants, given the hole we were in, the trajectory is still in the right direction,'' Mr. Plouffe said.
As for Mr. Romney's assertion that the United States ought to be adding 500,000 jobs a month, Austan Goolsbee, a former senior economic adviser to Mr. Obama, said, ''I would love to see job performance like that,'' he said. But after the deepest recession in 75 years, he added, ''it's hard to see how you would generate that.''

HEADLINE: Leaders a Step Closer to Extending the Export-Import Bank

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- House Republican and Democratic leaders reached a tentative agreement Friday night on a deal to extend the life of the Export-Import Bank by three years, setting up a confrontation this month between conservatives pressing to let the institution die and business groups that say it is vital to reviving the struggling economy. 
The deal, hashed out by Representatives Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the House minority whip, and Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, would increase the bank's trade financing lending limit to $140 billion over three years. That would be a 40 percent increase from the current $100 billion limit, which the bank has almost reached. It would also mandate a series of audits and reports that critics say is needed to ensure the institution is not exposing taxpayers to great risk.
In a gesture to conservatives, the deal directs the secretary of the Treasury to initiate multilateral negotiations to first end all international subsidies for aircraft exports, then work toward ending all government export subsidies. But no deadline is set for such an ambitious treaty.
The deal sets up an 11th-hour vote to keep the government bank open before its charter expires at the end of this month. But conservative groups like Heritage Action and the Club for Growth will almost certainly press Republicans to vote no. In a break with Tea Party conservatives, Mr. Cantor and House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio ultimately threw their weight behind its preservation -- and behind mainline business groups like the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers.
''The simple truth is that action on this agreement is necessary to promote American exports and remove a threat to the creation of American jobs,'' Mr. Boehner said in a statement, encouraging his troops to support the deal.
Mr. Hoyer said the deal ''ends the uncertainty so many of our businesses have faced as the deadline for Congress to act approaches.''
Business groups were open about their frustration with the ideological stance the most conservative Republicans had taken against a government program, financed by its beneficiaries, that has produced $3.4 billion in profits for the government over the last five years.
But critics say the biggest beneficiaries have been giant corporations like Boeing and Caterpillar that should be able to get private banks to finance their sales.

HEADLINE: Government Getting Smaller in the U.S.

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
FOR the first time in 40 years, the government sector of the American economy has shrunk during the first three years of a presidential administration.
Spending by the federal government, adjusted for inflation, has risen at a slow rate under President Obama. But that increase has been more than offset by a fall in spending by state and local governments, which have been squeezed by weak tax receipts. 
In the first quarter of this year, the real gross domestic product for the government -- including state and local governments as well as federal -- was 2 percent lower than it was three years earlier, when Barack Obama took office in early 2009.
The last time the government actually got smaller over the first three years of a presidential term was when Richard M. Nixon was president. That decrease was largely because of declining spending on the Vietnam War.
The accompanying charts show the gains in real G.D.P. for the first three years of each presidential administration since 1989. They also show how different parts of government have grown.
Many things other than presidential policies contribute to economic growth, of course, including whether a president has the good or bad fortune to enter office when the economy is already moving in a certain direction.
Bill Clinton took office when the economy was weak and starting to get better, while George W. Bush entered the White House just as a recession was getting under way. The most recent recession officially ended in June 2009, a few months after Mr. Obama took office, but the recovery has been slow.
Of the administrations shown, overall growth in Mr. Obama's first three years has been the slowest. But that is largely because government spending did not accelerate as it normally does when the private sector is weak. The private sector grew faster in the first three years of the Obama administration than it did in three of the previous five administrations -- the exception being Bill Clinton's administrations, when private sector growth was more rapid. In both of George W. Bush's terms as well as in the first three years of the George H. W. Bush administration, though, the private sector grew more slowly.
Much of the variation in government spending trends can be attributed to military spending. Adjusted for inflation, it has grown at a slow pace under President Obama despite declines in the costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Nonmilitary spending has risen at about the same pace as it did during George W. Bush's second administration, and much more slowly than during his first.
State and local government spending on investments -- new schools and highways, for example -- has often been subject to abrupt cutbacks in response to a weak economy. But the continued decline in operating expenditures is new. In the past, saving money through such means as laying off teachers has generally been avoided, but the number of education employees at the state and local level has been lower in each of the last three autumns than it was a year earlier.

HEADLINE: A Clear Warning From the Jobs Numbers

 BODY:
This week's economic news was mixed, but the employment report on Friday was unmistakably weak. The economy added only 115,000 jobs in April, versus 154,000 in March and 200,000-plus in each of the three months before that. Even taking into account that unusually warm winter weather probably distorted the recent results, the underlying trend shows an economy that has been creating about 175,000 jobs a month -- enough to keep the recovery crawling along, but too weak to appreciably raise hiring or wages. 
Nor is it clear where more growth will come from. Manufacturing picked up last month, but activity in the larger service sector slowed. Recent auto sales were up, and home sales have been slowly, if fitfully, improving, but home prices continue to fall. Consumer spending, in general, rose in the first quarter, but it appears to be driven by people who are profiting from a rising stock market. Increased market volatility, like Friday's 168-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average, would make them nervous and less inclined to spend.
Election-year politics are bound to further confuse the economic picture and the way forward. On Friday, Mitt Romney blamed President Obama for the April jobs figures, saying that in a normal recovery ''we should be seeing numbers in the 500,000 jobs created per month.''
The truth is that the economy has not seen job growth like that in nearly 30 years. More to the point, the policies Mr. Romney espouses -- notably deregulation and tax cuts for the rich -- were the favored policies under President George W. Bush, years when job growth and wage gains were, at best, anemic. And then the economy barreled into the Great Recession.
More deregulation and high-end tax cuts -- along with the deep spending cuts Mr. Romney has endorsed in the House Republican budget -- would mean less economic stability, greater inequality and fewer jobs.
Mr. Obama has called for sensible policies that would create more jobs, including infrastructure spending and aid to states to prevent layoffs and boost hiring among teachers and other public employees, but Congressional Republicans have blocked him at every turn. On Friday, Mr. Obama said that he would urge Congress ''to take some actions on common-sense ideas'' to boost jobs. There is no sign that Republicans are ready to see the light -- especially when they see the weak economy as an election-year advantage.
The jobless rate dropped in April, from 8.2 percent to 8.1 percent, but the decline was caused by 342,000 people dropping out of the work force. A smaller work force means even slower growth.
Without further government help -- especially more aggressive spending to boost demand -- the economy simply does not have the momentum to heal itself any time soon. Millions of today's unemployed and underemployed Americans will pay the price for the rest of their lives, in lost earnings, lost homes and shattered retirement hopes.
This is no time for political game-playing or ideological posturing. Americans need help now.

HEADLINE: New York's Children Shouldn't Pay the Price

 BODY:
Mayor Michael Bloomberg this week put out his revised proposal for the next city budget -- a $68.7 billion plan that spares teachers, police and firefighters but slashes vital programs for needy children. That is not the way to balance a budget. 
The mayor's budget and other changes will result in losses of about $150 million to city day-care and after-school programs. The programs are a lifeline for the working poor -- without them many parents would have to give up their jobs and stay home to care for their children. They are also vital for children and young people who need the extra preparation the programs provide. The City Council can usually be counted on to restore some of these cuts. But it must fight even harder to expand the programs, not allow them to diminish every year.
The city's child-care and after-school programs have been cut from 137,000 places in 2009 to 94,000 today. The new budget would reduce that further to about 53,000. In these hard economic times, the need, and the waiting lists, are growing.
Mayor Bloomberg on Friday announced that a program called Early Learn NYC would cover about 43,000 of the 50,000 children now in city child care and Head Start programs. The program sounds promising, with nutrition and health care provided along with childhood education. But 7,000 children should not be dropped from the rolls.
On Thursday the mayor boasted that this budget had no new taxes and no cuts for teachers, police officers and firefighters. When pressed about the cut in children's programs, he said, ''The city cannot do everything for everybody.'' That is true. But Mr. Bloomberg and the Council need to do a lot more for the city's neediest children.

 BODY:
9 P.M. (Showtime) SOURCE CODE (2011) A man who knows himself to be Capt. Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal, above), an Army helicopter pilot in Afghanistan, is sent via a software program onto a commuter train in Chicago with orders to stop a bomber from destroying it. Michelle Monaghan is Christina Warren, the pretty woman sitting opposite him, who knows and sees him as Sean (Frederick De Grandpre), a schoolteacher. After Stevens fails to stop the bomber and the train blows up, he is returned to the dark capsule that contains him in the alternate reality -- only to be sent back repeatedly to the train with the understanding that his job is not done until the bomber has been stopped. Vera Farmiga plays Colleen Goodwin, the military officer who guides Stevens on his mission. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called the film ''a smooth diversion directed by Duncan Jones that bats around a few big ideas,'' adding that Mr. Gyllenhall ''hits the dark and light notes right, bringing subtle differences to his performance, whether Stevens is questioning reality or riding that train of life and death and angling for what everyone wants: the chance to get it right.''

Performers include Green Day, in a rendition of its song ''Letterbomb''; Ledisi, in Etta James's ''At Last''; and an all-star jam of Stevie Wonder's ''Higher Ground'' featuring the Chili Peppers with Billie Joe Armstrong (above), George Clinton, Slash and Ron Wood.
9 P.M. (Starz) CARS 2 (2011) Mater, the dimwitted tow truck voiced by Daniel Whitney, better known as Larry the Cable Guy, moves to the front of the pack in this sequel to the 2006 Pixar hit centered on a hotshot racecar named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson). This time around, Lightning escorts Mater on the Grand Prix circuit in Tokyo, Paris and London, where he embarks on an espionage caper with a James Bond-style sports car named Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and a sexy, Emma Peel-like coupe, Holly Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer). In a subplot, a petroleum magnate (Eddie Izzard) uses car races to promote his new alternative fuel. Writing in The Times about this film directed by John Lasseter (with Brad Lewis credited as co-director), A. O. Scott said, '' 'Cars 2' is certainly built to move merchandise -- this series may surpass even the 'Toy Story' films as an effective advertisement for licensed playthings -- but it is notably lacking in soul or sublimity.''

Panic ensues when they return to the fountain and discover that it has been moved. Leslie Mann plays Dave's high-strung wife, Jamie, whom Mitch has always secretly coveted. Olivia Wilde is Sabrina, a luscious legal associate with whom Mitch, as Dave, makes a promising connection. ''The body-swapping premise, which is stale to begin with, isn't explored with any depth, unless you find meaningful Freudian subtext in the movie's relentless anal fixation,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The Times. ''But the premise at least sets up a farce that surpasses 'The Hangover' in gleeful crudeness and profanity. The similarities between the two movies aren't coincidental: Jon Lucas and Scott Moore wrote both. David Dobkin, the director of 'The Change-Up,' is best known for 'Wedding Crashers.' ''

HEADLINE: Progress Seen on Economic Issues in U.S.-China Talks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES and ANNIE LOWREY; Michael Wines reported from Beijing and Annie Lowrey from Washington.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Leaders of China and the United States said Friday that they had made important progress on a range of economic issues at their annual bilateral meeting, with Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China saying the areas of agreement included ''some important breakthroughs.'' 
China agreed to remove what United States officials said were unfair subsidies and favorable regulations affecting state-owned corporations and to allow foreigners to take bigger stakes in Chinese securities firms, according to a senior official of the United States delegation who spoke on condition of anonymity.
China's state-owned behemoths dominate industries like steel and telecommunications. They are formidable competitors in some global markets and have a lock on many domestic ones.
United States officials attending the annual meeting, the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, were clearly eager to report some good news from China amid a furor over mishandled efforts by the United States to assist a leading Chinese dissident, Chen Guangcheng.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, meeting Friday with Li Keqiang, a Chinese vice premier, said the economic talks had achieved ''very good progress.''
Later, in prepared remarks for the meeting's closing ceremony, Mr. Geithner praised the Chinese for moving toward a more flexible exchange rate system and loosening controls on moving capital in and out of the country.
''These steps are significant and promising, and, we believe, will lead to further appreciation in the exchange rate over time against the dollar and other major currencies,'' he said.
Wang Qishan, another Chinese vice premier, said the United States had agreed to back China's effort to get its currency, the renminbi, included in the International Monetary Fund's basket of reserve currencies. China wants to build the renminbi it into a reserve currency like the dollar and the euro. But because the renminbi is not freely convertible, the I.M.F. has declined to include it in its basket.
For the first time, according to senior United States officials, Chinese policy makers said they would commit to removing advantageous financing and regulatory conditions for state-owned enterprises, a significant step forward in the eyes of the administration of President Obama, the official said, even though such changes may take years.
China said it would review its policy of providing attractive -- and some companies say unfair -- financing for its exports.

HEADLINE: Deal Would Let China Dissident And Family In U.S.

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ and MICHAEL WINES; Sharon LaFraniere contributed reporting. Research was contributed by Edy Yin, Mia Li, Li Bibo and Bree Feng.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China and the United States reached a deal Friday that calls for the dissident Chen Guangcheng to travel to the United States with his family, in what appeared to be a resolution to an eight-day diplomatic crisis that had threatened to strain the relationship between the two countries and left the Obama administration open to attacks from human rights activists and political opponents at home.
The accord, rushed on the last full day of the visit to China by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, enabled her to salvage a trip tarnished by Mr. Chen's rejection of an arrangement forged earlier in the week by United States diplomats that called for him to remain in China. 
At a news conference here, however, Mrs. Clinton spoke cautiously about a definitive outcome. ''We are encouraged by the progress we have seen today,'' she said. ''But there is more work to be done.'' Moments after Mrs. Clinton finished speaking, the State Department spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, released a statement saying that China was expected to issue travel documents to Mr. Chen ''expeditiously'' and that the United States would speed visa requests by his wife and two children. Mr. Chen, a self-taught lawyer who is blind, has been offered a fellowship at New York University, according to Jerome A. Cohen, a New York lawyer and expert on Chinese law who has advised Mr. Chen since his escape from house arrest nearly two weeks ago.
The statement was the coda to what was, by all appearances, a carefully choreographed series of declarations by Mr. Chen, the Chinese government and American officials that committed all three parties to a mutually agreeable settlement of Mr. Chen's future.
But the arrangement was unlikely to silence a fusillade of accusations that the Obama administration had bungled Mr. Chen's case by essentially handing him over to the Chinese authorities earlier this week, without ironclad assurances that he would be safe. And it only underscored the degree to which Chinese violations of human rights remain a lightning rod in the two nations' ever more intertwined relationship, despite Washington's best efforts to the contrary.
It was not clear when Mr. Chen and his family would be able to leave China, senior American officials said, but he would not be allowed to join Mrs. Clinton, as he had requested, on her departure for Bangladesh and India on Saturday. Still, the Americans appeared confident that the Chinese would abide by the accord, largely because Beijing was eager to see Mr. Chen go.
Indeed, as part of their negotiating tactics with the Chinese government, State Department officials seemed to have used the argument that Mr. Chen's departure would ease a major headache for Beijing both abroad and at home. Unlike the former Soviet Union, China has encouraged outspoken dissidents to go into exile, knowing that they would lose their influence inside China once they left.
Whether Mr. Chen would be able to return to China was not addressed by American officials Friday. It is almost unheard of for Chinese dissidents who leave China to return.
The negotiations with the Chinese government to allow Mr. Chen to leave China were conducted privately as Mrs. Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner attended the annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue on Thursday and Friday.
The formal meetings were overshadowed by the crisis over the dissident, but American officials said the forums were useful for pushing forward a host of hot-button issues.
Mr. Geithner praised China at the closing session on Friday for ''significant and promising'' currency reforms that, over time, would lead to further appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar and other major currencies.
China announced that it would let foreigners own bigger stakes in its securities firms and promised to limit export subsidies. The cap on foreign ownership of joint ventures involving investment firms would be raised to 49 percent. The two governments said they would begin talks on limits to export credits.
In the foreign policy realm, Mrs. Clinton urged China to join Washington in considering additional sanctions against Syria. She praised China for supporting a United Nations Security Council resolution backing an African Union peace plan for Sudan and South Sudan. Overall, Mrs. Clinton said that the relationship between the United States and China ''will determine the course of history in the 21st century,'' and therefore it was up to the leaders to get it right.
But behind the lofty talk, the Chen case had intensified to a point on Friday morning where it was clear that Mrs. Clinton and her aides had only a day to find a solution, unless she was prepared to leave China with a very disturbing human rights case hanging over her and the Obama administration.
The situation was volatile because Mr. Chen was criticizing the United States government from his hospital bed. Under the original deal worked out by some of Mrs. Clinton's top officials, including Gary Locke, the United States ambassador to China, and Kurt Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs, Mr. Chen was to move from his provincial home to a big city, probably Tianjin, to study law. The Americans believed they had secured pledges that Mr. Chen and his family would not be mistreated, and they were proud of what they called ''a new model'' for a Chinese dissident to stay in China.
But after his release from the United States Embassy into a hospital for treatment of an injured foot, Mr. Chen said he feared for his life. His wife, who met him at the hospital, had been threatened after his escape, he said. Moreover, he felt abandoned at the hospital, where security officers prevented American diplomats from coming to see him.
A friend, Jiang Tianyong, said in an interview on Friday that plainclothes police officers had abducted him and beat him when he tried to visit Mr. Chen.
As Mrs. Clinton moved from one session to another at the high-level gathering, she and her top aides messaged each other about how to persuade the Chinese to fulfill Mr. Chen's new wish to go the United States, senior officials said.
Mrs. Clinton met the two top Chinese leaders, President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, at the Great Hall of the People in the late morning on Friday. They did not discuss the Chen case, officials said.
A few hours later, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that Mr. Chen, as a Chinese citizen, could apply for a passport in the same manner as the 340,000 students who studied abroad last year. It was the first public sign that a deal was in motion.
The Clinton entourage, aware that they needed to maximize Mrs. Clinton's presence in Beijing, still seemed unsure, however, whether everything would come together in time for her scheduled news conference in the early evening.
Criticized for not getting a written agreement in their earlier arrangement, State Department officials made sure their statement detailed the basic terms for how the departure of Mr. Chen would work. The release said the Chinese government would ''make accommodations for his medical condition,'' a reference to the fact that Mr. Chen is blind and would not have to travel to his hometown for his passport application. In most cases, Chinese citizens must apply for a passport in their home jurisdiction. Mr. Chen had been badly mistreated by local officials.
The statement said that once Mr. Chen had his passport, the United States would expedite visa requests from him and his family. The statement ended, ''This matter has been handled in the spirit of a cooperative U.S.-China partnership.''
United States officials said an American doctor visited Mr. Chen in the hospital on Friday, and reported that his foot, injured as he escaped his house arrest two weeks ago, had three broken bones. The hospital staff gave Mr. Chen's two children clothes and haircuts, the Americans said. His son received a birthday cake.

HEADLINE: What Would Improve Job Prospects for Young Workers?

BYLINE: ECONOMIX EDITORS


HIGHLIGHT: No one wants to see millions of young people sitting idle. So what can be done? 

 BODY:
As Hannah Seligson reports in Sunday Business, joblessness among the young remains at crisis levels. In April, the unemployment rate for workers under age 25 was 16.4 percent, compared with 8.1 percent over all.
No one wants to see millions of young people sitting idle. So what can be done? Can policies and programs be created to channel them into full-time jobs?
Two movements have sprouted to improve this generation's chance to move out of the parental basement (or avoid it altogether): the Campaign for Young America and Fix Young America. In a way, they are the younger siblings of Occupy Wall Street, but with a nonpartisan agenda, more centralized leadership and one specific mission: to help young people find jobs.
The Campaign for Young America is in the midst of a 21-state bus tour that is set to conduct 100 roundtables with young people, Occupy Wall Street protesters, community leaders and entrepreneurs. Fix Young America is supported by members of the nonprofit
Young Entrepreneur Council, based in New York. The new group assembled more than two dozen people - including lawmakers, university leaders and entrepreneurs - to offer solutions with a track record.
The effectiveness of these efforts remains to be seen. But both groups are asking young people to share their stories and offer suggestions for reducing unemployment. Have a story or suggestion? Let us hear it in the comments.

HEADLINE: Buffett Talks Succession and Taxes at Berkshire Annual Meeting

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: DealBook blogged Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting, where analysts and investors again focused on Warren E. Buffett's succession plans. 

 BODY:
OMAHA -- Tens of thousands of shareholders gathered at the CenturyLink Center here to take in Warren E. Buffett's pronouncements on his massive conglomerate, the global economy and whatever else tickles his or investors' fancy. DealBook's Andrew Ross Sorkin was one of the reporters on stage to ask questions as well.
 Hanging over this year's festivities was Mr. Buffett's disclosure that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer. He has taken pains to emphasize that the disease was caught early and that he plans to keep working for a long time. 
Mr. Buffett addressed the succession issue again, as well as the ongoing controversy over his principle of raising tax rates on the wealthiest Americans and his management philosophies. He also briefly mentioned a deal that would have been worth more than $20 billion, but had discarded the idea after deciding the takeover would have been too expensive.
4:50 P.M. | And We're Done
With that, the Berkshire meeting has concluded. Not a whole lot of news, per se, other than Mr. Buffett teasing about a mega-deal that almost came to fruition recently and defending the principle of raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans. 
Thanks for joining us today.
4:44 P.M. | A Shareholder Asks About Succession
A representative from the AFL-CIO puts forth a proposal that essentially asks for formal updates on Berkshire's succession plan. 
Mr. Buffett says that while Berkshire won't necessarily include the information about the successor in its formal proxy statement, he's asked about it and discloses its status often enough that shareholders are kept abreast. No dice in getting a name, but Mr. Buffett says he's gratified that shareholders care.
He says, "I think we're going to come up with a result that you'll be happy with," then adds wryly, "though I hope it's not too soon."
With that, it's revealed that the motion has failed.
4:32 P.M. | An End to Q.&A.
With that last question, we're out of the question-and-answer session of the Berkshire annual meeting. Because this is a shareholder meeting, Mr. Buffett and crew actually have corporate business to conduct.
We'll see if there are any interesting shareholder proposals that come up.
4:30 P.M. | The Trouble With Taxes, Redux
A shareholder, who wins applause from the audience by saying she hopes the duo on stage comes to the Berkshire annual meeting well into their 90s and 100s, asks what the ideal corporate tax rate is.
Mr. Buffett says that taxes aren't the issue. "It's not a lack of capital that's holding them back," he says of corporations, "nor is it tax rates." Indeed, the country grew fine in the 1950s and 1960s, when rates were far higher.
The issue now is medical costs, which Mr. Buffett memorably describes as "the tapeworm of American industry."
Mr. Munger adds that when he was younger, he thought he'd live to see a value-added tax regime be implemented in the United States. Now he's not so sure, though he believes that it will happen eventually.
Ultimately, according to Mr. Buffett, the problem will be that some companies' taxes will go up. And those companies will fight any such legislation with more intensity than those proposing it.
4:21 P.M. | The Endgame for Fixing Global Economies
A questioner wonders about how the European debt crisis ends up. Mr. Buffett thinks that sovereign countries can't keep borrowing forever. The time for them to stop isn't now, however.
The more conservative Mr. Munger is skeptical that "the Keynesian stuff" of direct government intervention will keep working indefinitely, given that people will eventually want to restore "fiscal virtue." He adds: "It's important that we not go too far in that direction."
4:15 P.M. | Energy Independence
Mr. Munger doesn't think it's a particularly smart idea. In fact, he's dubbed it "the stupidest idea."
What he'd rather see: the United States use up other countries' resources and preserve its own. 
4:13 P.M. | The Meeting's Unofficial Entertainment
Some people have gone to the Berkshire meeting for several years now, enough that there are few surprises and many beats that they know are coming.
That's why it's not surprising that some folks at the meeting are playing a drinking game. Rants posed as questions? Words of high praise for potential Buffett successors? For some audience members, that's a cue to hoist an (imaginary) glass.
3:58 P.M. | BYD's Future in America
A young questioner asks about BYD Auto and whether a rise in demand for electric cars in the United States will lead the Chinese car maker to bring its products here.
Mr. Buffett lets Mr. Munger, Berkshire's resident BYD fan, take the question. Mr. Munger says that the company is focused on the Chinese car market, though its first serious move into the United States might involve rental fleet sales in California.
The prospects for success and profit may eventually become bright, with Mr. Munger specifically alludes to government subsidies for electric cars. But when pressed about how much in the way of car sales BYD will make here in the near future, he responds curtly, "Very few."
3:51 P.M. | Mistakes, I've Made a Few
A shareholder, who says he runs a software company in California, asks about Mr. Buffett's philosophy on mistakes.
It's relatively simple, the investor responds. "I do not sit around thinking about my mistakes," he says. It's not generally helpful.
What he does think about is how he has learned more about his investment philosophy, and much of that involves understanding people. "I think I recognize the extraordinary ones," he says.
3:37 P.M. | Just Say No to Super PACs
A shareholder asks if Mr. Buffett, whose political leanings are well-known, would ever donate to a Super PAC to aid the Democratic Party's cause.
Mr. Buffett says that he wouldn't, because he couldn't be sure that a $10 million donation wouldn't be used to distort facts or otherwise be used for negative effect.
3:35 P.M. | The Diplomacy Department
Mr. Munger is known for his delicate touch. Piping up on the compensation consultant issue, he remarks that when it comes to that profession, prostitution would be "a step up."
Mr. Buffett only notes afterward that his longtime buddy "is in charge of diplomacy" at the company.
3:30 P.M. | And Another Word on Compensation
In discussing the prior answer, Mr. Buffett says that, sure, Berkshire could bring in compensation consultants. But such advisers "want to please the people they're working for," he adds, implying that they'll just recommend higher paychecks.
3:28 P.M. | The Tao of Berkshire
A shareholder asks about executive compensation, and how they manage to keep their managers motivated.
That prompts a philosophical response. Mr. Buffett trots out a metaphor he's been fond of using at this meeting: "We get the opportunity to paint our painting," he says. And, he adds, he and Mr. Munger like painting together than painting alone.
It's a system, Mr. Buffett says, that he can't imagine not working for other people. At Berkshire, he tries to remove the constraints that managers would face elsewhere: talking to lawyers and bankers and the like. It's an attempt to let the managers enjoy their lives and their business lives.
"Berkshire is a negative art, in that we focus on not messing up something that's already good," he says.
3:17 P.M. | Taking the Training Wheels Off
Now a question about Mr. Combs and Mr. Weschler from Andrew. It's one that Mr. Buffett uses to talk up how happy he is with both hires.
The two former hedge fund managers recently raised the amount of money they have to play with to $2.75 billion each from $1.75 billion, Mr. Buffett says. (That pales next to the money their boss has at his disposal, an amount that is orders of magnitude larger.)
Some of the two men's pay is based on how well the other does, a system that Mr. Buffett says motivates them to make good picks and work well together.
3:09 P.M. | Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
A shareholder asks a real stemwinder of a question, which began with a long discourse about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They're continuing to grow while under the watch of the federal government. "What is the solution? How many years can they stay under conservatorship," she asks.
... Only to ask further questions about the residential mortgage-backed securities market and a slew of other topics. The audience eventually applauds, in an apparent attempt to hurry her up.
Mr. Buffett, with a bemused expression, looks up after she finishes. "I'm guessing, from the tone of your question, that you think they're a mess," he says, to laughter. "That's because they are."
Later on, Mr. Munger adds: "I sometimes say, 'Alan Greenspan overdosed on Ayn Rand when he was younger." He essentially says that as Fed chairman, Mr. Greenspan was wrong to allow the amount of deregulation he did. The word "disgraceful" gets used a couple of times.
Mr. Buffett relates one anecdote where unnamed regulators asked Mr. Munger whom Berkshire lends money to. The succinct Mr. Munger replied, "Not people like you."
2:52 P.M. | Defining "Understanding" a Business
Good point from @RahulSaraogi:
When Buffett says he "doesn't understand" a business he means he knows how it works but doesn't know what their future looks like#BRK2012
2:49 P.M. | Berkshire Synergies
So Berkshire has scores of companies under its control. Does the company function like private equity firms that have portfolio companies source their materials from each other? It's called "synergy" in deal-making.
It's also not really a policy at Berkshire. The company's executives are generally on good terms with each other; Geico's Tony Nicely gets along fine with reinsurance chief Ajit Jain, for instance. But, Mr. Buffett says, "We don't tell people at Clayton Homes to buy their paint from Benjamin Moore."
Any gains from that, he says, wouldn't really be worth the effort.
2:42 P.M. | "That's a First"
Mr. Buffett turns the questioning to the audience. A staffer sheepishly says, "Section Four does not have any questions at this time."
Guffaws in the press box. Mr. Buffett pauses a beat, then says, "That's a first."
2:39 P.M. | The Technology Game
DealBook's Andrew Sorkin asks about technology companies, specifically Google and Apple Inc., and whether they'll ever get to the point that they're as much a corporate fixture as I.B.M., which Berkshire has invested in.
Mr. Buffett says that they're both "huge companies that make a ton of money," and would be hard to evict from their market-leading positions. Yet even still, he's reluctant to invest in either of them - though he wouldn't bet against them either.
Again, it comes down to the simplicity of the business and the investing story. Mr. Buffett says that "the chance of being way wrong about I.B.M. are probably less than being way wrong in Apple or Google."
Ultimately, he says, "I just don't know how to value them."
Always ready with a quick rejoinder, Mr. Munger chimes in with a crowd-pleaser: "And what do we know about computer science?"
2:28 P.M. | Declining Businesses
A shareholder from Middle Europe- who first gains sustained applause for asking about Mr. Buffett's health - asks about the billionaire's philosophy about investing in declining businesses.
It's a relatively straightforward answer. Mr. Buffett tends to stay away from them.
"I would never spend a lot of time trying to revive a declining business," he says. "The same amount of energy and intelligence could be brought to other kinds of businesses."
2:25 P.M. | A Post-Buffett Berkshire
We're back from lunch, with a question about a post-Buffett Berkshire Hathaway. A shareholder asks two things: Is there a risk that the company's investment managers could choose to leave for higher-paying jobs? And could some investor - a hedge fund, or somesuch - eventually amass enough of a position in Berkshire to change the company's culture?
Mr. Buffett says that he doesn't believe either scenario likely. The investment managers he has hired could retire now if they wanted, so money isn't their motivating factor.
"They're only going to work if it's more fun than anything else," he says.
As for a potential takeover, Mr. Buffett says that's a remote possibility. Berkshire's big - $201.8 billion in market capitalization at the moment - and he expects his family to have 10 times the voting power of any other shareholder for a very long time.
Mr. Buffett then adds a plug for the machine he's built. "Berkshire stands for something different than most companies," he says.
1:01 P.M. | Lunch break!
We'll be back in an hour, for more questions with Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger that will run until about 3:30 p.m. Central time.
12:59 P.M. | The Wal-Mart Bribery Issue
Here's a question, asked by DealBook's Andrew Sorkin: Has Mr. Buffett's opinion of Wal-Mart Stores, one of Berkshire's biggest investments of late, been affected by the recent disclosure of a bribery investigation involving the retail giant's Mexican subsidiary?
Mr. Buffett's pretty blunt here. "There's always another side, but it looks like they may have made a mistake in how it was handled," he says. "I don't think that it changes the fundamental dynamic" of Wal-Mart's growth.
"It's a huge diversion of management's time," Mr. Buffett adds, "but I don't think the earnings power of Wal-Mart will be materially affected by the outcome of the investigation."
Mr. Munger chimes in, saying that in a corporation as large as Wal-Mart, it's hard to police everyone all the time. He adds that he doesn't see anything "dishonorable" at Wal-Mart.
12:49 P.M. | Not a List to Be On
Mr. Buffett: "We have seen a few of our companies engage in some pretty dumb deals. And we've usually been right. But we can't always stop them."
12:43 P.M. | Buffett on Newspapers: Read All About it
It's fitting in some ways that the Berkshire exhibit hall included a newspaper-tossing contest. Not only is it a reminder of Mr. Buffett's childhood, but it also reminds people that the billionaire is also a small-time newspaper magnate.
Carol Loomis of Fortune asks, Why buy the Omaha World Herald? It leads to a long disquisition by Mr. Buffett on the plight affecting newspapers, namely their cloudy economic prospects.
Mr. Buffett notes that decades ago, newspapers served as a great hub of all kinds of news. That's changed in the era of the Internet and a million new outlets for information like stock markets. There's the additional problem with a lot of newspapers giving away their content online for free while charging for the print edition.
"I don't know of any business plan that has sustained itself that charges in one version and offers the same version free to people," he says.
Some newspapers have successfully - at least for now - managed to charge for online content. And where the opportunity for many newspapers lies, Mr. Buffett argues, is in areas with a strong sense of community. The Omaha paper can't tell him meaningful new information about Afghanistan, he says, but it can fill him in on local events and sports.
"There's a market for that, though it's not as bulletproof as the old method," Mr. Buffett says.
Just look at Buffalo, where Berkshire also owns a newspaper. It's not making as much money as it once did, but the paper still generates profits. It needs to develop a better online-payment plan, Mr. Buffett concedes.
But the idea of community-focused papers is still attractive, adding, "We may buy more."
12:31 P.M. | Since It Apparently Bears Repeating
Another questioner wonders if Berkshire should be doing more buybacks or using stock for acquisitions. Want to guess what Mr. Buffett has to say?
"We'd still prefer using cash, just because we're generating a lot of it," he said. Besides, he hates giving out shares unnecessarily.
12:23 P.M. | Buying Like Buffett
DealBook's Andrew Sorkin passes along an interesting question about how Mr. Buffett invests. Berkshire has bet big on Wells Fargo, but Andrew notes that the investor holds some JPMorgan Chase stock in his personal account. How does the Oracle of Omaha decide on what he'll personally invest in, versus on behalf of Berkshire shareholders?
(And, since the question needed to be asked, what else is in the personal Buffett investment fund?)
Mr. Buffett laughs and notes drily that he has "some money lying around." His personal account is mostly for stocks he's interested in, but apparently not enough to pour Berkshire money in. Some of its holdings include positions in small Korean companies and the like.
"My best ideas are all in Berkshire," he says.
That said, if all Mr. Buffett did was invest his own money, he'd own some Wells Fargo - a simpler investment story that's more easily understandable - but also JPMorgan.
12:18 P.M. | Who Doesn't Love Gold? Here's One Guy
A shareholder says that he's investing in Berkshire not for the glamour, but that the stock has been beaten by gold in terms of returns in recent years.
Known to be dismissive of gold as an investment trend, Mr. Buffett argues that his company has beaten gold over the long run, as have the equity markets as a whole.
12:12 P.M. | Berkshire's W.M.D.'s
Becky Quick asks on behalf of a shareholder about Berkshire's book of derivative investments "Who will managed these weapons of mass destruction after you're gone?" she asks, adding that people don't don't want a situation like the American International Group after the ouster of its longtime chief executive.
(For some context, Mr. Buffett has long derided derivatives as weapons of mass financial destruction. But he has entered into a number of derivatives bets, notably some tied to the equity markets.)
Mr. Buffett says that some of Berkshire's businesses, like its utilities, will need to use derivatives as a hedge. But in general, derivatives likely won't be a big part of Berkshire's profits or losses by the time he leaves. While he won't stop his two new investment managers, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, from investing in them, Mr. Buffett doesn't think they'll be a major source of financial comfort or woe.
11:56 A.M. | Shareholders, Politics and the Buffett Tax
Also earlier in the Q.&A., Becky Quick passes on a question from a shareholder in Brunswick, Ga., who says that his 84-year-old father won't invest in Berkshire because of his opposition to the Buffett Tax.
The man who gave his name to the higher-tax-rate proposal responds pithily, "I don't think employees of Berkshire should in any way have their citizenship restricted."
He adds that he doesn't necessarily know the politics of executives at companies he has invested in, like Muhtar Kent of Coca-Cola or John Stumpf of Wells Fargo.
Then Mr. Buffett slides in a political jab: If people don't like his politics, he says, "it sounds like they should own Fox."
11:53 A.M. | Asking the Deal Question
A bit earlier in the Q.&A. session, an analyst asked Mr. Buffett about deal-making, and whether Berkshire would again use stock in buying a company, as it has done infrequently.
Mr. Buffett answers that he had looked at a potential $23 billion deal opportunity some time ago, but had to pass. Why? The price was too rich, given Berkshire's current cash position. "I would have had to sell securities I didn't want to sell," he says.
Ultimately, shareholders don't need to worry about one thing Mr. Buffett has long deplored: dilution. "We would not use our stock now," he says.
11:50 A.M. | "How're You Feeling?"
Andrew Sorkin asks Mr. Buffett a question that a lot of shareholders have been asking: "How're you feeling?"
A chipper Mr. Buffett responds cheerily, "Terrific," drawing sustained applause from investors. He adds, "I love what I do."
About two and a half weeks ago, Mr. Buffett says, his family sat down with his four doctors - "some of whom own Berkshire Hathaway, I think," he jokes - and listened to various proposed treatments. None requires a day of hospitalization or taking a day off from work.
"In all seriousness, it's a nonevent," he says.
11:27 A.M. | A Bit of Berkshire Humor, Twitter Edition
DealBook's Andrew Ross Sorkin notes that Bono has left his seat:
update: bono just snuck out of his front row seat at the berkshire hathaway annual meeting! where do you think he went? #buffettwatch
DealBook friend Josh Brown, on Twitter at @reformedbroker, has a gem of a response:
Where the seats have no names
11:24 A.M. | More on Tax Rates
Mr. Buffett offers more reasoning behind the Buffett Rule. There were at least three years when he was paying the lowest tax rate in the Berkshire offices - despite pulling down anywhere from $25 million to $65 million.
Everyone else, by contrast, had a tax rate in the 30-something percent range.
11:21 A.M. | The Buffett Rule
Mr. Buffett explains his reasoning behind the Buffett Rule, a proposal to raise taxes on the highest-income earners. The rule would essentially restore tax rates for the top wage earners back to what those rates were in the early-to-mid 1990s.
"It would affect very few people," he said.
11:17 A.M. | The Problem With Business Schools
Riffing off a shareholder question, Mr. Buffett offers a critique of business schools.
"It's amazing to me how the schools have focused on one fad or another," he says. Sometimes it's finance theory, sometime it's another thing. But once it becomes set in stone, any particular mindset is exceptionally difficult to change.
"Going against the revealed wisdom of shareholders can be very difficult for your career path," he said.
Mr. Buffett says that his ideal curriculum would include a course on how to value a business and one on the markets.
11:12 A.M. | "Nothing to Add"
Mr. Munger is notorious for often replying "nothing to add" in Q.&A. time. He's said it twice now.
11:12 A.M. | Coal Versus Oil
DealBook's Andrew Ross Sorkin asks Mr. Buffett about energy generation, and investing in coal versus natural gas. (A Berkshire portfolio company, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, is in part a bet on coal.)
Mr. Buffett responds that the price of those materials is in flux, though the ratio of oil-to-natural gas prices has been astonishing. As for coal, he adds that eventually, the United States will rely less and less on coal for energy production.
"It's going to be very interesting to see how this coal versus gas question plays out," he said.
11:07 A.M. | Responses to the Financial Crisis
An Austrian shareholder asks a question about European banks versus American banks. That leads to Mr. Buffett explaining his views on the responses of Europe and the United States to the financial crisis.
The Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve were smart to force banks to raise capital, whether they liked it or not, according to Mr. Buffett. European banks, which were more dependent on financing themselves in the markets instead of from deposits, were slower and more reluctant to react, leaving them "gasping for air" before they were saved by cheap loans from the European Central Bank.
The ultimate result was that American banks are in a much stronger position now than their European counterparts. "It's night and day," Mr. Buffett says, praising the former Treasury secretary Henry M. Paulson and the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, for their decisiveness.
11:00 A.M. | More on Buybacks
Jay Gelb, an analyst at Barclays, asks another question about share buybacks. How much will Berkshire buy and when?
Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger trade witticisms about the various reasons why companies do them. But ultimately, the Berkshire chief's response boils down to this: "We will do it for only one reason, and that's to increase the value of Berkshire the day after we've done it."
He doesn't really expand beyond that.
10:56 A.M. | A Public Service Reminder
If you have any questions that you'd like DealBook's Andrew Ross Sorkin to ask Mr. Buffett, tweet him at @andrewrsorkin.
10:54 A.M. | Berkshire Stock Buy-Backs
CNBC's Becky Quick asks about Berkshire's first-ever stock buyback, a move Mr. Buffett has long deplored.
The Oracle of Omaha quips that if he had his way, he and Mr. Munger would have the stock trade once a year, and the two of them would determine its intrinsic value.
10:52 A.M. | Buffett, the Non-Advice Giver
A question from a shareholder from Connecticut prompts a musing by Mr. Buffett on his advice-giving to the chief executives of the companies he's invested in. The investor answers relatively simply: He doesn't really do it.
If you look at our four largest investments, which are worth $50 billion today, some of which we've held for 25 years, the number of times we've talked to the C.E.O. of those companies doesn't average more than twice a year.
We are not in the business of giving them advice. If we thought the success of our investment depended on us giving them advice, we would move on.
10:48 A.M. | A Question of Insurance
The analyst Cliff Gallant of the firm KBW asks a question about insurance, and how Berkshire accounts for various assumptions.
Mr. Buffett says that Berkshire's businesses are very conservative in their assumptions. The only issues are events like the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which are "very hard" to reserve against.
10:43 A.M. | Another Celebrity Sighting
DealBook's Andrew Ross Sorkin just tweeted this:
"Bono is sitting in the front row of the Berkshire Hathaway meeting - eating a See's Candies lollypop! #BRK2012 #buffettwatch"
10:42 A.M. | Whom You Can Rule Out for a Buffett Successor
Succession is indeed the first topic of discussion at Berkshire's annual meeting, and Mr. Buffett's continuing to address the issue.
He jokes that there's no way an arts major is going to become Berkshire's next chief executive. More seriously, he concedes, "not every deal that I've made" could be done by his successor. But the person has his or her own talents that will add to the job.
Ultimately, Mr. Buffett suggests, the special mega-deals that he's arranged aren't key to Berkshire's future success.
"Those deals have not been key to Berkshire - what we did with General Electric and Goldman Sachs, for example, in 2008. They were O.K., but they were not remotely as important as, say, buying Coca-Cola stock on the open market. or buying I.B.M. stock on the open market, for about six to eight months last year."
10:34 A.M. | Talking Business
Mr. Buffett turns to the putative business reason for holding this massive event: Berkshire Hathaway's business results. You can read the results here. 
He's running through the Berkshire board now, which includes Bill Gates. Polite applause for all.
And we're starting off the question-and-answer session. It'll feature three reporters - Carol Loomis of Fortune, Becky Quick of CNBC and DealBook's own Andrew Ross Sorkin.
Ms. Loomis starts off by asking a question from shareholders: Will the next Berkshire chief executive have a separate chief risk officer?
Mr. Buffett answers that overseeing risk is a real job, one that's not to be delegated. "I am the chief risk officer at Berkshire," he says, "and it's on me to make sure we don't get into any catastrophic risk in any way."
10:28 A.M. | Buffett Takes the Stage
Finally, Mr. Buffett takes the stage, to big applause.
He finally addresses the packs of See's Candies lollipops on each investor's seat. Mr. Buffett asks people to hold them up, joking that the photo's going to end up on Facebook.
Mr. Buffett and his longtime chief, Charlie Munger, have fudge and peanut brittle onstage.
10:20 A.M. | A Glee-ful Interlude
The cast of "Glee" is sitting in their usual high-school bleachers, reluctantly welcoming their newest member, Warren.
"Which grade are you in?" asks one incredulous member. Warren demurs, before finally admitting that he's "proud to say he's 81."
Jane Lynch's Coach Sue Sylvester tromps in and sticks her claws into Mr. Buffett, calling his tax rate pronouncements "shameful." He turns to her and apologizes for how their relationship ended. Sue admits, "Well, I did try to poison you."
Lea Michele's Rachel then tries to persuade her teacher, Matthew Morrison's Will Schuester, that letting in a "75th-grader" like Mr. Buffett could help solve the glee club's financial problems.
Then it's ukulele time!
10:15 A.M. | A Sobering Look Back to Salomon Brothers
The jovial mood of the CenturyLink Center arena, lightened by innumerable Geico commercials, becomes a bit more somber as a reminder of Berkshire's more troubled past flickers onscreen.
It's a replay of Mr. Buffett's testimony before Congress about the scandal involving Salomon Brothers. The testimony features one of the investor's most famous dire dictums: "Lose money for the firm, and I will be understanding. Lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless."
The clip took on special resonance last year, amid the disclosure of an investigation into a former Berkshire lieutenant, David Sokol, who was once so highly regarded he was considered a potential successor to Mr. Buffett.
10:09 A.M. | Paging Dr. Jimmy Buffett
Now we've got Warren Buffett lying down on a psychiatrist couch, having a heart to heart with a "Dr." Jimmy Buffett. The Berkshire Buffett is relating his dream of being backstage with his ukulele, which is starting to shrink.
Dr. Buffett is intently nodding his head, while playing a game on his iPad. He's holding up Rorschach test cards, in which Mr. Buffett sees only pretty brunettes.
The musician Buffett then persuades Mr. Buffett to relax and play the ukulele with him. Only to have the investor fall asleep peacefully.
10:02 A.M. | The Latest Geico Employee Commercial
It's something of a tradition now for Geico to show off a music video commercial created by its own employees. Previous years were created in the style of '80s power ballads and early '90s hip-hop.
This year's theme, apparently: late '80s pop. It's pretty catchy. And it's got Mr. Buffett popping in the bridge wearing what he calls his George Clooney outfit, a tuxedo with a white jacket. Not quite the shock of seeing Mr. Buffett dolled up like Axl Rose, but it'll do.
9:57 A.M. | Calculating a Headcount
Some may be wondering how many people attending the Berkshire meeting today. According to the CenturyLink Center's Web site, the arena can hold 18,300 people. And every seat is filled.
9:49 A.M. | Warren Buffett's Secretary
A string of news clips highlights Debbie Bosanek, Mr. Buffett's longtime secretary, and her sudden emergence as a celebrity thanks to the tax rate proposal known as the "Buffett rule."
Ms. Bosanek has become such a celebrity that she can't even be bothered to pick up the phone, reducing her boss to playing receptionist for her. That includes answering "Berkshire Hathaway" when the phone rings.
It's Oprah - who's looking for Ms. Bosanek. And it's the president, who's also looking for Mr. Buffett's secretary. Only she's too busy to answer take the call, so she orders Mr. Buffett to tell the president to text her.
It's enough to force Mr. Buffett to scream - with a dissolve to Munch's record-setting "The Scream."
The crowd's lapping this up and claps enthusiastically.
9:41 A.M. | An Animated Introduction
Mr. Buffett usually kicks off his annual meeting with an animated introduction. After a joke about no commercial interruptions - punctuated by plugs for Geico, See's Candies and Coca-Cola - a cartoon version of the Oracle of Omaha arrives onscreen, chatting with Charlie Rose about the University of Nebraska football team.
As Marv Albert gives the play by play for a Cornhuskers game, there are shots of Herman Cain (!) coaching the robotic opposition. Poor Mr. Buffett, the "12th-string" quarterback, is charged with staging a comeback. It's tough, given Herman Cain's "9-9-9" defensive formation, but Mr. Buffett heaves a pass to teammate Charlie Munger.
The ball bounces around before ending up in the hands of ... the Geico gekko, winning the game for the Cornhuskers. And the crowd in the CenturyLink Center claps.
9:20 A.M. | The Final Countdown
The booming voice of a famed voiceover actor just resonated throughout the CenturyLink main arena. It's 10 minutes to showtime.
9:07 A.M. | Surviving the Exhibit Hall
 There are few more crowded places before the meeting's start than the exhibit hall in the CenturyLink Center. It's here that scores of Berkshire companies - Justin Brands, See's Candies and the like - set up shop, enticing investors with their wares. (It's also where you can get a Dairy Queen Dilly Bar at 7:30 a.m., but I digress.)
Of course, the biggest draw is seeing Mr. Buffett and his friends in action. The investor is always thronged by a massive crowd of security and shareholders eager to take a cellphone picture of even the back of Mr. Buffett's head.
One of the biggest draws - other than the University of Nebraska cheerleaders - is the Clayton Homes paper toss, where Mr. Buffett revisits his childhood by flinging papers onto a model home's steps. This year, at least one lucky person had the fortune of being hit in the head by an errant toss by Bill Gates.
8:24 a.m. | Before the Big Show
It's about 7:22 a.m. local time, an hour before the official beginning of the show. And yet, hundreds of Berkshire shareholders have already stormed the floor of the arena to take their seats, while hundreds more are checking out the vendor booths elsewhere in the building.
If it weren't already clear that this is a Berkshire meeting by the throngs of attendees, the prominent mentions of See's Candies and the company's other brands might give someone a clue.

HEADLINE: James Cameron on Chinese Filmmakers, Censorship and Potential Co-Productions

BYLINE: EDWARD WONG


HIGHLIGHT: The director was in China to screen the 3-D version of "Titanic": "We're moving in the right direction. The quotas for international films coming in now, it's a higher quota, the percentage of revenue is higher, so everything is moving in the right direction." 

 BODY:
BEIJING - James Cameron, director of "Titanic" and "Avatar," among other well-known movies, visited Beijing in mid-April for the Beijing International Film Festival. The festival was screening the 3-D version of "Titanic," which had recently opened in theaters here. More important, Mr. Cameron was here to meet with people in the Chinese film industry to talk about doing joint productions and getting greater distribution for his 3-D films, which use technology developed by Cameron Pace Group, or C.P.G.
China has a strict limit on the number of foreign films allowed to be shown in theaters here, although that number was raised in February when Chinese officials announced an agreement with Hollywood studio executives during a trip to the United States by Xi Jinping, the vice president and presumed next leader of China (and reportedly a fan of Hollywood World War II films).
On April 22, the day after his arrival in Beijing, Mr. Cameron talked about his projects and the Chinese film industry in an interview with The New York Times and The Economist. (The interview took place before it was reported that regulators in the United States were looking into whether American studios might have made improper payments to Chinese officials, so that was not a topic of discussion). Edited and condensed excerpts from the interview follow.
Q.
Can you tell us a little bit about your interactions with the Chinese film industry? I know you're here partly to promote the technology and to see where the Chinese filmmaking landscape is in terms of using this technology.
A.
Not just filmmaking but broadcast. Everybody just assumes, probably most people know me internationally as a filmmaker, but domestically in the U.S. as co-chairman of C.P.G., most of our business is broadcast. And China has potentially this enormous 3-D broadcast market - unexplored as of right now, to my knowledge, and I just need to know more. I need to know more about it and find out if there are people here who believe as I do that this is where broadcast can and should be going.
Q.
Xi Jinping is a movie buff. He's talked about American war movies. So are you meeting with him?
A.
I'm not saying anything about who I'm meeting with, but I am in meetings and explorations on a couple of subjects. One is 3-D, both for the filmmaking community and for the broadcast community. And these are very, very preliminary, from my perspective anyway. And the other one is a possibility of co-production here, possibly even to the extent of some kind of technology exchange -- bringing over our 3-D technology and things like that. There are a lot of things I want to look at as possibilities. Because it's such an exciting market that's growing so rapidly. There's a lot that I also have to know about - government restrictions and so on. That would apply to the co-production issues, with respect to content, censorship, content requirements, Chinese content and so on.
Q.
As everybody has already seen, you experienced a small taste of that with "Titanic."
A.
Well, "Titanic" is actually censored less this time than it was in '97. Because it was their second bite at the apple. It's gotten much wider and we're seeing it being less restrictive. So we're moving in the right direction. The quotas for international films coming in now, it's a higher quota, the percentage of revenue is higher, so everything is moving in the right direction. You see the market opening up. And I think that that's having a beneficial effect in that it's growing the exhibition market internally, if you look at how rapidly theaters are being built here. Eight a day, I've been told? Eight theaters a day?
Q.
Are you a fan of Chinese filmmakers? Do you have a few that you like?
A.
I think I like the ones that everybody likes, that we know in the West. You know, Zhang Yimou and, I can never remember, Chen Kaige. But I'm not a student.
Q.
I'm interested in storytellers that you admire. They don't have to be Chinese. If you could talk a little bit about the films that you are looking to these days, whatever you find inspirational. 
A.
I don't find my inspiration in movies. I find my inspiration in life - in the natural world, in daily life. There are filmmakers that come along that are quite iconoclastic. And that I'm in awe of, frankly. Zack Snyder's "300." I think that was a really revolutionary film, because it was a completely deconstructive form of filmmaking in a way that nobody had done before, other than maybe Robert Rodriguez. That's inspirational to me. Zhang Yimou's films are inspirational to me. I have to see them multiple times to really see how he's doing it and what exactly he's doing that seems to work so well. So as a fan of film, there are certain films that come along that are just stunning to me, and I'll study them.
Q.
Who are you in awe of?
A.
I just gave you three examples. You know, there's the old guard. You know, Spielberg, Kubrick and all that sort of thing. But in terms of new filmmakers, up and coming, I haven't seen anybody that blew me away in the last year or so.
Q.
What about scripts that you're looking at? Is there a project that you're working on right now? Or subject matters or general areas of interest that you're looking at?
A.
That's interesting. I've divided my time over the last 16 years over deep ocean exploration and filmmaking. I've made two movies in 16 years, and I've done eight expeditions. Last year I basically completely disbanded my production company's development arm. So I'm not interested in developing anything. I'm in the "Avatar" business. Period. That's it. I'm making "Avatar 2," "Avatar 3," maybe "Avatar 4," and I'm not going to produce other people's movies for them. I'm not interested in taking scripts. And that all sounds I suppose a little bit restricted, but the point is I think within the "Avatar" landscape I can say everything I need to say that I think needs to be said, in terms of the state of the world and what I think we need to be doing about it. And doing it in an entertaining way. And anything I can't say in that area, I want to say through documentaries, which I'm continuing. I've done five documentaries in the last 10 years, and I'll hopefully do a lot more. In fact, I'm doing one right now, which is on this, the Deep Sea Challenge project that we just completed the first expedition. So that'll be a film that'll get made this year and come out first quarter of next year.
Q.
"Avatar," of course, said a few things in terms of your world view, including on the environment. And here of course, it was interpreted differently as being about China. Some people online and fans took a kind of political overlay that applied here.
A.
Yeah, I'm not too aware of the nuances of that. Other than that there was speculation that it might be problematic for the government, seen as criticism of a resource-hungry nation. Except all the developing or developed nations on the planet are resource-hungry. So the same perspective was in Russia, Europe, Canada and the U.S. I got the biggest political blowback in the U.S., because frankly the U.S. is the most medieval right now when it comes to climate change and the role of business in compromising and devastating the natural world. Way behind Europe.
Q.
How far are you along in working on the "Avatar" sequels?
A.
We've spent the last year and a half on software development and pipeline development. The virtual production methodology was extremely prototypical on the first film. As then, no one had ever done it before and we didn't even know for two and half years into it and $100 million into it if it was going to work. So we just wanted to make our lives a whole lot easier so that we can spend a little more of our brainpower on creativity. It was a very, very uphill battle on the first film. So we've been mostly working on the tool set, the production pipeline, setting up the new stages in Los Angeles, setting up the new visual effects pipeline in New Zealand, that sort of thing. And, by the way, writing. We haven't gotten to the design stage yet. That'll be the next.
Q.
Would any part of the sequels - I mean two, three, or a possible four - be done partly in China?
A.
It's conceivable. You know, one of the things I want to explore while I'm here is the idea of co-production on those films, but it's a slightly different case because they're studio films. There were zero I can't say zero exteriors. We did one night in the parking lot next to the sound stage. But there were no locations.
Q.
So what's the advantage of doing a co-production at all in China? I mean, your movie's going to make money, you don't need the financing .
A.
It's a major market. Possibly within this time scope of these two films, certainly by the time of the third film, it may rival the U.S. domestic market, if not surpass it. And there are economic advantages with respect to the percentage of gross revenue that flows back. So that needs to be weighed off against what it would cost us to set up our capability here. We'd have to take our capability with us to do the virtual production. The 3-D production is easy. That's flight-ready to go anywhere in the world, so that's not an issue. When I say 3-D, I'm talking about the cameras. With my C.P.G. hat on, my Cameron Pace Group hat on, we can put fly packs anywhere in the world to support up to 30 or 40 cameras. We can do it right now. Mobile units and all that sort of thing. So that's not an issue. That could come here easily, and that might be very beneficial to the Chinese resident film community because the crews would get trained up on this equipment. They would have access to cutting-edge stuff, so that's partly how we sell our position. But we'd have to bring over our virtual production capability with us. And again, that's mobile. We took it with us to New Zealand last time. So it's all doable. It's just looking at the numbers.
Q.
Some American businesses have expressed reluctance in doing technology transfer here in China because then they'll lose the proprietary technology. And they feel the Chinese competitors might create products that compete with theirs in the market. You're so closely associated with this technology, so I'm just wondering whether you have any thoughts on this?
A.
I think that there's certainly always that danger. But we've found that people have tried to imitate us in the past and it usually comes to grief, because they can't continuously invest in R.&D. So they'll create a rig. Well that rig then becomes fixed in time at the moment they create it. We've got many, many clients across broadcast and cinema. So that allows us to continuously do engineering development of the next generation. And our generations are three to six months apart. Nobody can compete with that. So what we find is that our partners just say, "Look it's better for us to just do business with you because you're already ahead." We've seen people buy rigs and then be mired three or four years down the line in that moment of technology, and we've gone four generations past that. If it's embraced here and there's a big enough market for it, there may be other companies that spring up. But you're not going to be able to replace 12 years of experience overnight. So I think it's a question of being first to market with quality and good, solid partnerships. And after that we just have to see where it goes.
Q.
Is it fair to say then that when you're exploring the possibility of co-production, that includes the next one, "Avatar 2?"
A.
Yeah, absolutely. Sure.
Q.
You must have had people talk to you to give you a briefing on the censorship process, about how it works or how it's affected certain films here. Do you have any general thoughts on that?
A.
As an artist, I'm always against censorship. But censorship's a reality, even in the U.S. We have a form of it there. We used to have the Hays commission. We now have the M.P.A.A. ratings system, which is basically a self-censorship process that prevents government from doing it. But the economic imperatives are that if you get an R rating, the studio won't make a film that looks like it's headed toward an R rating, and if you get a R you've got to cut it yourself to comply with PG-13. So it's really just a form of censorship indirectly."
Q.
Do you consider that the same as Chinese censorship?
A.
You've got a little more choice in it. It's not as draconian. But I can't be judgmental about another culture's process. I don't think that's healthy.
Q.
Did you talk to other filmmakers - your peers - about Chinese censorship?
A.
No. I'm not interested in their reality. My reality is that I've made two films in the last 15 years that both have been resounding successes here, and this is an important market for me. And so I'm going to do what's necessary to continue having this be an important market for my films. And I'm going to play by the rules that are internal to this market. Because you have to. You know, I can stomp my feet and hold my breath but I'm not going to change people's minds that way. Now I do feel that everything is trending in the right direction right now, as I mentioned earlier.

HEADLINE: When Hillary Meets 'Didi'

BYLINE: ANURADHA SHARMA


HIGHLIGHT: What will the most powerful women in India and the United States discuss on Monday. 

 BODY:
On Monday in Kolkata, the U.S. secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, is scheduled to meet with the chief minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, nicknamed "Didi" or Big Sister, a woman whose power over Indian central government decisions has been virtually unchecked but whose increasingly erratic actions are raising concern even in her own party.
What will the two women, each arguably the most powerful in her country, discuss? Officials from both governments are being tight-lipped, but asked several experts for their opinions. Here's what they said: 
Deb Mukharji, former Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh
Mamata Banerjee is a powerful force and has been successful in replacing a Communist government after 34 years. Hillary Clinton would appreciate Ms Banerjee in a way.
Ms. Clinton would be trying to promote U.S. business interests in Bengal, and their talks on Monday are likely to center around this.
During her last visit to India, Ms. Clinton had asked India to take greater responsibilities in the Asia Pacific region. She could discuss with Banerjee the importance of West Bengal in promoting India's relations with her eastern neighbors and thus, by extension, to the region as a whole. This would include close ties with Bangladesh, for instance. She could likely discuss the critical role West Bengal has in forging relations with partners.
Dr. Sabyasachi Basu Ray Chaudhury, professor of political science, Rabindra Bharati University
One of the issues that could be taken up at the meeting isforeign direct investment in India's retail sector. They could also talk on Bengal's role in the east and the northeast. Some issues relating to Bangladesh, such as water-sharing and import-export, are likely to be discussed.
Ms. Clinton's visit is sure to increase the prestige and position of Ms. Banerjee, who has been criticized widely for throwing a spanner in development projects. On the other hand, since Ms. Clinton is on her way out, I am not too sure how the visit will influence the overall situation of the state or country.
Dr. Anindya Jyoti Majumdar, head of international relations department, Jadavpur University
With another impending recession in the U.S., I am of the opinion that Ms. Clinton's meeting with the chief minister could be an exercise in exploring business opportunities in West Bengal. Foreign direct investment in retail could also be discussed.
Ms. Clinton's calling on the chief minister of a state is a recognition of the federalized nature of Indian politics and the influence that coalition partners wield on central decisions.
Amada Kidwai, regional director, American Chamber of Commerce in India
Since this is not an economic visit, I am not expecting really significant developments as far as business goes. However, I am pretty certain that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will raise the issue of investment opportunities in West Bengal. She is the first woman chief minister of the state and comes after 34 years of Communist rule. She is likely to share her vision for the state. The visit will have a positive impact on Indo-U.S. relations.
However, more than that, I think, it will be able to draw the attention of people in India and abroad to India's eastern region, which has often been neglected by the center.
Harsh Neotia, chairman, Ambuja Realty 
I would like to refrain from speculating on what the two powerful women could talk about. As a Kolkatan, I am thrilled that our city and the state are getting U.S. attention. It shall sure augur well for Indo-U.S. ties, which include business ties.
Swapan Dasgupta, journalist and political commentator
I am frankly mystified as to what exactly Mamata will discuss with Hillary. I can only presume it is a good-will visit bereft of political and diplomatic significance.
