HEADLINE: Turning to More Provocative Shows, a Cable Channel Woos Back Some Viewers

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. -- The summer of 2010 was a nail-biter for USA, television's most popular cable channel in prime time, and not just because of the spy capers and doctor dramas like ''Burn Notice'' and ''Royal Pains'' that it carries.
Compared with the summer of 2009, its highest-rated so far, the channel lost 4 percent of its prime-time viewers and, more troublingly, nearly 10 percent of the 18- to 49-year-old viewers that advertisers pay a premium to reach. 
So this summer, the channel spread the new seasons of its sunny and optimistic dramas across more nights than before and added two shows, ''Suits'' and ''Necessary Roughness,'' that were slightly more provocative than past shows.
The summer ratings, formally tallied this week, show that USA has recouped about half of 2010's losses among 18- to 49-year-olds and all of its losses in its total viewership. The channel is expected to renew every one of the seven shows it featured this summer -- giving its new parent, Comcast, early proof of its big bet on cable programming.
USA's strength is emblematic of cable's robust summer ratings overall, part of a generation-long trend away from broadcast viewing and toward cable viewing. Total time spent viewing television has risen again this year, even as slight minorities of people forgo owning televisions or subscribing to cable for economic and cultural reasons. And the reason is largely cable programming.
''Cable numbers are growing more than broadcast is eroding, which is why the overall number is growing,'' said Jack Wakshlag, the chief research officer for Turner Broadcasting.
HLN, formerly known as Headline News, had its highest rating ever in July when the Casey Anthony verdict was announced; the Weather Channel attained a viewer record last Saturday when Hurricane Irene made landfall in North Carolina; and MTV had its highest rating ever last Sunday with the Video Music Awards.
For all of these cable channels, including USA, the challenge is to hold onto a core audience while broadening out to attract new viewers.
''This is a place that has built its success one show at a time,'' said Jeff Wachtel, a USA co-president, in an interview at the channel's West Coast office adjacent to the Universal Pictures studio here. He objected to suggestions that USA is a repetitive factory of dramas -- ''There is no formula!'' was written at the top of his typed talking points for the interview -- and instead said that the channel has a filter for aspirational, stylish shows.
That filter, said Chris McCumber, USA's other co-president, creates expectations that benefit new shows. Referring to ''Suits,'' he said by teleconference from New York, ''even if they don't know anything about it, they're more likely to check it out.'' He added, ''We didn't see that kind of response six years ago.''
Under Bonnie Hammer, USA became the single most profitable asset within NBC Universal. After she was promoted to chairwoman of the company's cable entertainment and cable studios, Mr. Wachtel and Mr. McCumber were named co-presidents of the network last March, two months after Comcast took control of NBC Universal. Already, USA has given Comcast an early success to extol to investors. Steve Burke, the chief executive of NBC Universal, said on an earnings call in August that ''Suits'' and ''Necessary Roughness'' were ordered ''after the deal closed'' and that they ''now promise to be important new franchises for USA for many years to come.''
For years, USA's closest competitor in prime time has been TNT, the drama network owned by Turner Broadcasting. But this summer, the History channel rose to No. 2, the result of hit reality shows like ''Pawn Stars,'' ''American Restoration'' and ''Mounted in Alaska.''
History has posted 30 to 40 percent gains in audience two summers in a row, a remarkable feat. Nancy Dubuc, the president and general manager of History, said in an e-mail message that the ratings were ''a clear indication we know what History viewers want and that we're giving it to them.''
TNT, meanwhile, is down 2 percent among 18- to 49-year-olds in prime time this summer. TNT had a bigger new show this summer -- the sci-fi show ''Falling Skies'' drew almost 3.3 million 18- to 49-year-olds each week, more than any of USA's shows -- but the rest of its schedule did not hold up as well.
Mr. Wakshlag said that repeats of acquired shows, like ''Law & Order'' on TNT, are not as reliably popular as they once were, perhaps because such shows are replayed in other places and because there are so many original series competing for attention. USA attributed its declines last year to the same trend.
On the reality side, the only cable channel with a bigger hit than History is MTV, which has benefited hugely from ''Jersey Shore'' for the second summer in a row. It has had an average of 5.8 million viewers ages 18 to 49 this summer, more than 2 million more than History's ''Pawn Stars.''
Arguably the most notable decline on cable this summer was TBS, the comedic sister of TNT, which was down 20 percent in prime time among 18- to 49-year-olds. The channel is optimistic about the repeats of ''The Big Bang Theory'' that will come onto its schedule in the fall.
USA is moving into comedy, too. It is also developing reality shows and long-form events that allow it to be ''a little bit edgier,'' Mr. Wachtel said.
''It's like any good financial adviser will tell you,'' Mr. McCumber added. ''You've got to broaden the portfolio.''

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania: Rescue Plan Rejected

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Voting 4 to 3, the Harrisburg City Council rejected a rescue plan by Mayor Linda D. Thompson to address the city's debt crisis. The rejection could prompt a state takeover of the finances of the city, the state capital. The vote came less than two months after the council rejected another plan presented by a state-appointed adviser. Harrisburg, a city of 50,000, is one of a handful of cities and counties that has teetered toward economic collapse in the wake of the 2007-9 recession. The mayor has said that Harrisburg could run out of money next month, meaning it could miss a bond payment and be unable to pay city workers. Council President Gloria Martin-Roberts warned the next step was the forced execution of the rescue plan by the state. ''We have a takeover that's coming, mark my word,'' she said. A complicated financing scheme to fund a state-of-the-art revamping of its trash-burning plant left the city with $300 million in debt. The previous plan rejected by the council called on the city to sell the incinerator, renegotiate labor deals, cut jobs and lease its parking garage.

HEADLINE: Accountability on the Quad

BYLINE: By C. THOMAS McMILLEN. 
C. Thomas McMillen, a former professional basketball player and a former Democratic representative from Maryland, is a regent of the University System of Maryland.

 BODY:
Ellicott City, Md.
A SERIES of recent scandals involving players receiving money, cars and other improper benefits, along with violations by recruiters and sports agents, has debased the already tarnished reputation of college sports. Schools like the University of Miami, the University of North Carolina and the University of Southern California, to name just a few, have been in the news more for abusing the rules than for teaching their students.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association is supposed to hold colleges and universities accountable, but it has been reluctant to police with any stringency the growing number of violations. The assumption that the N.C.A.A. can develop safeguards and mete out punishment for those who violate its rules is wishful thinking. The N.C.A.A. is simply not up to the task; college trustees need to take charge instead. 
In 1991, I introduced a bill in the House of Representatives aimed at reforming college athletics. My bill would have granted the N.C.A.A. an exemption from antitrust laws, which would allow it to constrain the extraordinary growth in athletic spending by schools. Under my proposal, the distribution of money from broadcast fees and other income would have been based not on winning or losing, but on the academic performance of the athletes, gender equity, and the breadth and diversity of the sports programs. The bill would have rewarded those schools promoting the values of higher education.
My attempt at reform failed, and in the 20 years since, things have gotten worse. There is just too much money involved in the multibillion-dollar industry that is college athletics to expect the participants to police themselves. Bloated college sports budgets, with coaches who earn millions of dollars, often more than college presidents, have created a situation where the tail is wagging the dog, with the result that colleges are losing control over their own athletic programs.
Moreover, once the N.C.A.A. does get around to punishing violations, the culprits have often moved on. To take one notorious example, the $4 million-a-year football coach at U.S.C., Pete Carroll, resigned in January 2010, just as the N.C.A.A. was investigating accusations that the former player Reggie Bush had accepted improper gifts from agents. Mr. Carroll was subsequently named head coach of the Seattle Seahawks with a five-year, $30 million-plus contract. By the time the N.C.A.A. announced sanctions against the U.S.C. football team, in June, he was safely gone.
Universities take pride in the success of their sports teams, but their reputations suffer when things go wrong. If they truly want to prevent scandals, they need to take control. And the people who can and must make this happen are the trustees and regents of these institutions, not the presidents, who are less equipped to stand up to the economic pressure from alumni and fans.
Currently, many boards are too cozy with athletic departments; their members forget that their job is to protect the institution -- not the coaches, not the boosters and not the fans. But if they want to avoid embarrassment and scandal, they need to be much more involved in maintaining standards.
Many institutions have a laissez-faire attitude toward their athletic departments; given the profits from sports broadcasting and the fervor of alumni and fans, their reluctance to rein in athletic directors, coaches and players is understandable. But trustees and regents have both a legal and an ethical obligation to do what is right for their schools.
If more colleges and universities would adopt the recommendations of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges, we'd see fewer violations of N.C.A.A. rules and of the law. Among the recommendations are these: regents should approve annual athletic budgets and significant capital expenditures; athletic departments should undergo annual audits by independent auditors; each school's board should have a committee to monitor compliance with N.C.A.A. rules and student performance; and boards should approve compensation of coaches and directors.
Some schools are beginning to recognize the wisdom of these proposals. Regents at Kansas State University now conduct annual audits of the athletic department. Regents at the University of Michigan sign off on athletic departments' operating and capital budgets. Both the University of Colorado and Georgetown University have panels dedicated to athletic issues. The boards at Texas A&M University and the Universities of Wisconsin and Oklahoma must approve any changes in compensation for the highest-paid athletic personnel.
These are encouraging changes. The N.C.A.A. should be more rigorous in keeping colleges compliant with its rules, but true accountability rests with individual boards. The schools would then not need to respond to the disgrace of violations and penalties, but could prevent the scandals in the first place.

HEADLINE: Generation Limbo: Waiting It Out

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE

 BODY:
WHEN Stephanie Kelly, a 2009 graduate of the University of Florida, looked for a job in her chosen field, advertising, she found few prospects and even fewer takers. So now she has two jobs: as a part-time ''senior secretary'' at the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville and a freelance gig writing for Elfster.com, a ''secret Santa'' Web site.
But is Ms. Kelly stressed out about the lack of a career path she spent four years preparing for? Not at all. Instead, she has come to appreciate her life. ''I can cook and write at my own pace,'' she said. ''I kind of like that about my life.''
Likewise, Amy Klein, who graduated from Harvard in 2007 with a degree in English literature, couldn't find a job in publishing. At one point, she had applied for an editorial-assistant job at Gourmet magazine. Less than two weeks later, Conde Nast shut down that 68- year-old magazine. ''So much for that job application,'' said Ms. Klein, now 26. 
One night she bumped into a friend, who asked her to join a punk rock band, Titus Andronicus, as a guitarist. Once, that might have been considered professional suicide. But weighed against a dreary day job, music suddenly held considerable appeal. So last spring, she sublet her room in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn and toured the country in an old Chevy minivan.
''I'm fulfilling my artistic goals,'' Ms. Klein said.
Meet the members of what might be called Generation Limbo: highly educated 20-somethings, whose careers are stuck in neutral, coping with dead-end jobs and listless prospects.
And so they wait: for the economy to turn, for good jobs to materialize, for their lucky break. Some do so bitterly, frustrated that their well-mapped careers have gone astray. Others do so anxiously, wondering how they are going to pay their rent, their school loans, their living expenses -- sometimes resorting to once-unthinkable government handouts.
''We did everything we were supposed to,'' said Stephanie Morales, 23, who graduated from Dartmouth College in 2009 with hopes of working in the arts. Instead she ended up waiting tables at a Chart House restaurant in Weehawken, N.J., earning $2.17 an hour plus tips, to pay off her student loans. ''What was the point of working so hard for 22 years if there was nothing out there?'' said Ms. Morales, who is now a paralegal and plans on attending law school.
Some of Ms. Morales's classmates have found themselves on welfare. ''You don't expect someone who just spent four years in Ivy League schools to be on food stamps,'' said Ms. Morales, who estimates that a half-dozen of her friends are on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. A few are even helping younger graduates figure out how to apply. ''We are passing on these traditions on how to work in the adult world as working poor,'' Ms. Morales said.
But then there are people like Ms. Kelly and Ms. Klein, who are more laissez-faire. With the job market still bleak, their motto might as well be: ''No career? No prospects? No worries!'' (Well, at least for the time being.)
After all, much of the situation is out of their control, as victims of bad timing. Ms. Klein contrasted her Harvard classmates with the ones of her older sister, Lauren, who graduated from Harvard seven years earlier. Those graduates, she said, were career-obsessed and, helped along by a strong economy, aggressively pursued high-powered jobs right after graduation. (Lauren is a professor at Georgia Tech University.)
By comparison, Ms. Kelly said her classmates seemed resigned to waiting for the economic tides to turn. ''Plenty of people work in bookstores and work in low-end administrative jobs, even though they have a Harvard degree,'' she said. ''They are thinking more in terms of creating their own kinds of life that interests them, rather than following a conventional idea of success and job security.''
The numbers are not encouraging. About 14 percent of those who graduated from college between 2006 and 2010 are looking for full-time jobs, either because they are unemployed or have only part-time jobs, according to a survey of 571 recent college graduates released in May by the Heldrich Center at Rutgers.
And then there is the slice of graduates effectively underemployed, using a college degree for positions that don't require one or barely scraping by, working in call centers, bars or art-supply stores.
''They are a postponed generation,'' said Cliff Zukin, an author of the Heldrich Center study. He noted that recent graduates seemed to be living with parents longer and taking longer to become financially secure. The journey on the life path, for many, is essentially stalled.
The Heldrich survey also found that the portion of graduates who described their first job as a ''career'' fell from 30 percent, if they graduated before the 2008 economic downturn (in 2006 and 2007), to 22 percent, if they graduated after the downturn (in 2009 and 2010).
In an ominous sign, those figures didn't change much for second jobs, Dr. Zukin added, suggesting that recent graduates were stumbling from field to field. Indeed, Till Marco von Wachter, an economics professor at Columbia University who has studied the impact of recessions on young workers, said the effect on earnings took about a decade to fade.
MEANWHILE, modest jobs mean modest lives. Benjamin Shore, 23, graduated from the University of Maryland last year with a business degree and planned to go into consulting. Instead, he moved back into his parents' house in Cherry Hill, N.J., and spent his days browsing for jobs online.
But when his parents started charging him $500 a month for rent, he moved into a windowless room in a Baltimore row house and took a $12-an-hour job at a Baltimore call center, making calls for a university, encouraging prospects to go back to school. ''There's no point in being diplomatic: it is horrible,'' Mr. Shore said.
''I have a college education that I feel like I am wasting by being there,'' he added. ''I am supposed to do something interesting, something with my brain.'' For a while, Mr. Shore ran LongevityDrugstore.com, an online drug retailer that he started, but it went nowhere. To stretch his pay check, he made beans and rice at home and drove slowly to save gas. Eventually he quit, got work as a dock hand and is now thinking of becoming a doctor.
Perhaps not surprisingly, volunteering has become a popular outlet for a generation that seeks meaning in its work. Sarah Weinstein, 25, a 2008 graduate of Boston University, manages a bar in Austin because she couldn't find an advertising job. In her spare time, she volunteers, doing media relations for Austin Pets Alive, an animal rescue shelter.
''It'd be nice to make more money,'' Ms. Weinstein said, but ''I prefer it this way so that I have the extra time to spend volunteering and pursuing other things.'' Volunteering, however, goes only so far. After three years without an advertising job, she is now applying to graduate school to freshen up her resume.
Meanwhile, people forced out of the rat race are re-evaluating their values and looking elsewhere for satisfaction. ''They have to revise their ideas of what they are looking for,'' said Kenneth Jedding, author of ''Higher Education: On Life, Landing a Job, and Everything Else They Didn't Teach You in College.''
For Geo Wyeth, 27, who graduated from Yale in 2007, that means adopting a do-it-yourself approach to his career. After college, he worked at an Apple Store in New York as a salesclerk and trainer, while furthering his music career in an experimental rock band. He has observed, he said, a shift among his peers away from the corporate track and toward a more artistic mentality.
''You have to make opportunities happen for yourself, and I think a lot of my classmates weren't thinking in that way,'' he said. ''It's the equivalent of setting up your own lemonade stand.''
Online Correction: September 1, 2011, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article transposed the last names of two of its subjects in one instance. It was Amy Klein who had classmates at Harvard, not Stephanie Kelly. Additionally, the university at which Ms. Klein's sister is a professor was identified incorrectly. It is Georgia Tech University, not Georgia State.

HEADLINE: The Evolution of Binghamton, Block by Block

BYLINE: By MARK OPPENHEIMER. 
Mark Oppenheimer writes the ''Beliefs'' column for The New York Times.

 BODY:
THE NEIGHBORHOOD PROJECT
Using Evolution to Improve My City, One Block at a Time
By David Sloan Wilson
432 pages. Little, Brown & Company. $25.99.
For years the evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson paid little attention to Binghamton, N.Y., where he lived and taught. ''I hadn't joined the PTA,'' he writes, ''attended council meetings, given blood, or served turkey to the homeless on Thanksgiving.'' It was enough, he modestly believed, ''to raise two healthy kids and work at changing the way the planet thinks about evolution.''
But five years ago Mr. Wilson, the author of two popular booksabout Darwin, decided it would be fruitful to apply his training to the (human) animals closer to home. With colleagues at Binghamton University, Mr. Wilson founded the Binghamton Neighborhood Project to use evolutionary theory, along with data collection, to improve the quality of life in his struggling city. The Project's activities included surveys of students, old people and members of religious groups; attempts to empower neighborhood activists; and competitions to design new parks for vacant lots. 
Much of ''The Neighborhood Project'' is an inspiring panorama of Mr. Wilson's partners, from the energetic superintendent of Binghamton's schools, Peggy Wozniak, to his beloved graduate students, including Omar Eldakar, a star athlete who had flunked entire years of school and ''scored in the sociopathic range'' on personality tests administered when he was a child. Mr. Eldakar was running track as a Binghamton undergraduate when he discovered one of Mr. Wilson's classes on evolution. He became a leading pupil, then stuck around for a doctorate. After reading Mr. Eldakar's tale, you definitely want to see what apprenticing oneself to Mr. Wilson can do for you. Many books present science or social science to the curious layman, but none make the actual work of research sound this invigorating.
The Binghamton Neighborhood Project is a young endeavor, and there is something preclimactic about ''The Neighborhood Project.'' Its best chapters describe some of the preliminary work Mr. Wilson's team has done. For example the Project gave a wide cross section of Binghamton schoolchildren the Development Assessment Profile, a survey that measures sociability, citizenship skills and the conditions that promote such traits. Students rated their agreement with statements like ''I think it is important to help other people'' and ''I tell the truth even when it is not easy.''
The project then figured out where the most trusting, pro-social children lived: which neighborhoods, in other words, seemed to be breeding the most social capital. Using the technology on which Google Earth relies, the project created a krig map -- a topographical map representing demographic data -- for the city. The valleys showed areas with low social capital, the peaks with high.
''If every neighborhood had exactly the same mix'' of ''knaves and solid citizens,'' Mr. Wilson writes, ''then the krig map of the city would look like a flat plain. Instead, it looked like the Himalayas.''
Of course we know some neighborhoods are good, some bad. But we often deploy very crude measurements to back up our judgments. The social-capital survey used by the project is a better tool than mere crime figures, far better than people's unreliable perceptions of what is safe.
Mr. Wilson's maps are subtler than the police blotter. And the next steps he took were ingenious. For example figuring that holiday decorations were a good proxy for civic health, Mr. Wilson and his team canvassed Binghamton neighborhoods on Halloween and Christmas to see which neighborhoods were lighted most decoratively. ''On a clear night,'' he writes, ''I could probably measure it from an aerial photograph: the more nurturing neighborhoods actually glowed more brightly during the holiday season.''
Lovely. But so far this is fairly standard, if high-order, social science. Where is the evolution? Drawing on the Jesuit archaeologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Mr. Wilson argues -- more controversially than he lets on -- that ''human cultural diversity is like biological diversity.'' Teilhard, who died in 1955, went off in a fantastical direction, one that culminated in what he called the Omega Point, a form of supreme consciousness. For Mr. Wilson the main thing to understand is not that culture trends toward sublimity, but that it evolves, rather than merely changing, and that its evolution is subject to rules like those that govern biological organisms.
Our cultural forms adapt, Mr. Wilson says. They are shaped by a kind of natural selection. And once we accept that cultural evolution can be interpreted in this mechanistic way, we are better positioned to interpret the evidence we get from surveys, Christmas-light canvassing and so forth. Mr. Wilson introduces us to psychologists, economists and others who, he says, use the insights of cultural evolution, if not always the language, to offer strong advice about how to improve the world.
Drawing on theology, economics and other fields, he co-opts most any idea he likes as evidence of cultural evolution. Perhaps the celebrated economists Amos Tversky, Daniel Kahneman and Elinor Ostrom believe their work is usefully discussed alongside evolutionary biology -- Ms. Ostrom did subtitle a book ''The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Actions'' -- but Mr. Wilson is a bit hasty in claiming them for his project. His evolutionary metaphor is voracious, and so can veer toward meaningless.
And sometimes Mr. Wilson is plain wrong. His explanation of urban black chess whizzes leaves the queen hanging: ''Once we appreciate that chess is an abstract representation of a social world where survival hinges on fighting for oneself, we can appreciate why inner-city folks might hold an advantage.'' As one who has lost good money in Washington Square Park, I can tell you why the chess hustlers are so good: they are always there.
The chess passage highlights Mr. Wilson's central conceit, inspiring without being fully persuasive: that evolutionary theory is the academic's proper lingua franca, the terminology and indeed the theoretical framework that allows everyone to talk, and to plot the improvement of humankind, across disciplines. With a reasonably scientific understanding of any habitat and the animals in it -- students in Binghamton schools, Christmas revelers in assorted neighborhoods -- a shrewd scientist can develop tools to help the animals survive and flourish.
Mr. Wilson is hopeful his team can use its information to address the city's ''prenatal and early-childhood care, high school graduation rates, stress-related diseases'' and more. If they can, nobody will be complaining that his ''evolutionary paradigm'' was pretty confusing.
''The Neighborhood Project'' is a sprawling, poorly edited book. But I enjoyed every page. Sometimes the digressions into immunobiology and the social organization of wasps seemed relevant; sometimes they didn't. But at the end I was excited by Mr. Wilson's promise that, thanks to his project, ''Binghamton is on its way to being the first city with a nervous system'' (whatever that means). It will be built by Mr. Wilson, with his manic energy and his charming helpers. In his next book maybe he will tell us how.

HEADLINE: Range of Data Calms Fear of a Return to Recession

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Factory activity in the Midwest slowed a bit in August and private employers continued to hire despite extreme financial market turmoil, easing fears the economy would fall back into recession. 
Other economic data on Wednesday showed a strong rebound in demand for manufactured goods in July as orders for motor vehicles posted their largest gain since 2003, another suggestion that a recession could be avoided despite some weak economic signals.
''For those of us who don't believe the economy is in a free fall, we have got some support,'' said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International in New York.
The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its business barometer fell to 56.5, the lowest since November 2009, from 58.8 in July. However, the reading was above economists' expectations and indicated that activity had grown.
A separate report from ADP, a payroll processing company, showed that private employers had added 91,000 new jobs this month after expanding by 114,000 in July.
The ADP figures come ahead of the government's much more comprehensive labor market report on Friday, which is expected to show a modest increase in employment, despite the damping effect of a strike at Verizon Communications.
While the ADP report has a poor track record of predicting nonfarm employment, it offered hope that businesses had not pulled back as sharply in hiring despite a big stock market sell-off and a loss of both business and consumer confidence.
Other data showed the number of planned layoffs at companies declined in August after rising for three months in a row, although the cuts were well above year-ago levels.
''The labor market is soft but not falling apart,'' said Joel L. Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa. ''The economy is not on the verge of a recession.''
High unemployment is a major concern for the Federal Reserve. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have increased by only 75,000 in August, according to a Reuters survey. The jobless rate is expected to remain at 9.1 percent.
The modest slowdown in Midwest factory activity suggested national manufacturing might not be slowing as fast as indicated in other regional surveys. It also implied that forecasts that the Institute for Supply Management's index of national manufacturing would fall to 48.5 in August, from 50.9 in July, might be overdone. The survey will be published on Thursday. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction, but economists say a reading of 48.5 would still be inconsistent with an overall recession.
''The I.S.M. does not take into account that the auto industry is getting a very strong pickup in orders as parts are replenished and production is continuing,'' said Michael H. Strauss, chief economist at Commonfund in Wilton, Conn.
Strong demand for motor vehicles helped lift orders for manufactured goods by 2.4 percent in July, the Commerce Department said. Factory orders fell 0.4 percent in June.
Orders for motor vehicles advanced 9.8 percent. That was the biggest gain since January 2003 and suggested that auto shortages caused by supply chain disruptions after the March earthquake in Japan were easing.

HEADLINE: A Place Uniquely Theirs to Savor Day's End

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
As summer approached, Gianluca Nardi's wife, a hard-working lawyer, proposed that they live each day as if it were vacation, vacation in New York.
So in the evening, after he finishes work selling fine Italian yarn to designers in the garment district, Mr. Nardi, 37, puts on shorts and sneakers and makes his way to his designated spot in Manhattan on the Hudson River, at about 106th Street in Riverside Park, where he waits for his wife, Emily Kern, 31.
In this part of the park, no fence separates pedestrians from the river, only crabgrass that goes right down to the water. The bank is littered with large rocks, flat enough to sit on, as if left there by a distant ice age. Driftwood as big as dinosaur bones and plastic soda bottles get snagged between the rocks. 
Mr. Nardi's spot is a concrete platform jutting out into the khaki-colored waves. One day, while sailing with friends, he saw the concrete platform from the river and discovered that it was the housing for a storm runoff drain. But he said it did not bother him. ''The smell is a New York Harbor smell,'' he said with fondness.
A visitor from, say, Montana might not be impressed by this stretch of the river, but for many New Yorkers, it is paradise, drawing regulars from as far away as the Bronx in search of respite from the daily grind. Around 5 p.m., it starts filling up, and people keep coming until the sun sets gently over New Jersey.
It is a dose of nature with a peculiarly New York cast, an edge of man-made imperfection, even menace. On one side, rush-hour traffic whizzes and rattles up the Henry Hudson Parkway, bound for the suburbs. On the other, the occasional sewage spill from the plant at Riverbank State Park, a few blocks north, perfumes the water, most notably after a fire at the plant in July flushed millions of gallons into the river. Still, during this time of year, it practically takes a tropical storm to keep people away.
Depending on how one sees it, this is nature for cynics who delight in rough edges, or for idealists, who see past them. Mostly, it is a place where people seek that specialty of city life: solitude among the crowds.
During one recent afternoon, all those who were approached described the bit of New York where they were sitting as their spot, reserved for them. Women perched on rocks like mermaids. Couples picnicked in the grass.
Maria David tied her striped hammock between two trees, as she has been doing nearly every summer evening for 10 years, and in another grove, Ning Fung curled up in his green hammock, looking like a pod person in ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers.''
Ms. David and Mr. Fung, who does not speak English, are on waving terms.
''I have a great view here,'' Ms. David said. She was wearing frosted apricot lipstick and matching nail polish, as if dressed for a social event. She likes being both public and alone, she said.
She demonstrated how she kept a big stick under a nearby bush, which she uses to rock her hammock back and forth. As for the highway noise, ''Oh, I interpret that as the waves hitting the rocks,'' she said.
Once in a while, something bad has happened, like when she was holding her iPod one moment, and the next, ''Poof! There was no music. Some little dude came running up and grabbed it.''
As she rocked herself, her stick broke. She jumped out of the hammock and ran down to the bank to rummage for a good strong replacement.
At 22, Narjis Hancharick attracts the usual amount of unwanted attention from strange men. This has driven Ms. Hancharick, an administrative assistant at the Chapin School, out of the parks near her apartment in the South Bronx, where there are ''too many weirdos,'' to the banks of the Hudson, at about 125th Street.
There she raises her black umbrella -- ''a $3 job'' bought on the street -- to block out the sun. She also makes sure to position herself in front of a stone bench, to stay hidden from Peeping Toms walking by.
Emel Gunduc, once a saleswoman in a French boutique but now unemployed, always sits in the same spot, her feet almost touching the water. It takes her back to her home in Turkey, on the Aegean coast. She said she was used to living near water. ''The smell of moss sometimes reminds me of the islands where I lived,'' she said. ''Eating fish. Grilled fish. Fresh fish.''
As the sun scored an orangish path across the water, Carolina Solano, an assistant teacher, and her husband, Simon Castillo, a computer network technician, sat barefoot on a blanket eating Indian food and chocolate cake. Their two girls were at summer camp, so they were basking in being alone.
''This is our spot,'' Ms. Solano said. ''We own this.''
After the sewage plant fire on July 20, they stayed away for a couple of weeks. But they returned, as did the sailboats, water scooters and kayaks.
Three hours after arriving, Mr. Nardi was still sitting on his makeshift pier.
''I try to come at low tide,'' he said, so as not to get splashed. When is low tide? ''I'm not sure,'' he replied. ''It changes a lot.''
Nearby was the corpse of a bagel swollen beyond recognition (plain? onion? poppyseed?), and a Pepsi Max bottle bobbed gently next to his platform.
Mr. Nardi was holding a novel featuring Sandokan, a fictional Italian pirate, in his lap. But mostly he stared out at the setting sun. His wife, the lawyer, who proposed to make every day like a vacation, had not yet arrived.

HEADLINE: More of the Same in a Mortgage Plan

BYLINE: By AGNES T. CRANE and MARTIN HUTCHINSON

 BODY:
There's talk of yet more government help for careworn American mortgage borrowers. Washington has already made Herculean efforts. But there's no magic bullet and returns are diminishing.
Refinancing is back on the agenda. The idea is to find ways for underwater homeowners, or those nearly so -- and therefore unable to meet the usual criteria to replace their mortgages -- to benefit from currently low interest rates. This has been tried already, with miserable results.
Two years ago, the Obama administration set up a program called the Home Affordable Refinancing Plan, or HARP, precisely for this purpose. Yet fewer than one million of the anticipated five million to six million borrowers have benefited from the program. Meanwhile, the president's Home Affordable Modification Program , known as HAMP, has permanently reduced monthly payments for fewer than one million homeowners, a far cry from the three million to four million initially expected. Both programs remain open. 
A big hurdle is the role of private banks. Mortgage servicing operations, which do all the paperwork, are overloaded and in some cases seem to lack even a basic level of competence. Catherine Cortez Masto, the attorney general of Nevada, for instance, wants to tear up a 2008 settlement with Bank of America because of the bank's subsequent bungling of loan modifications.
And while even Detroit got a car czar, there's no single government entity in charge of the multitude of housing-related initiatives. The departments of the Treasury and of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Federal Reserve and others are involved but none is ultimately accountable for the programs. Many of the agencies are distracted by other responsibilities.
That helps explain why the initiatives have met with so little success. The Fed's first round of quantitative easing, which stabilized the mortgage bond market and helped push interest rates down, was an exception. Short of forcing banks to act, new government schemes are doomed to similar ineffectiveness. The housing market will eventually recover on its own. At this stage, it would be better for lawmakers to deploy precious capital, real and political, elsewhere.
Where's the Shine?
Shares of gold mining companies are a damped, rather than leveraged, play on gold -- at least from evidence so far this year. Gold's price is up more than a quarter since Dec. 31, 2010, but mining shares are roughly flat.
Australia and Peru recently showed how governments grab more when commodity prices rise, while operating costs go up with prices, too. Moreover, mining investors tend to discount spikes in the price of gold as merely temporary, offering little uplift to the value of miners.
Royalties or equivalent charges paid to governments can severely crimp a mine operator's upside. Australia, for instance, is weighing a tax that would take 30 percent of operating profit exceeding a return equal to the government bond yield plus seven percentage points. That will not deter investment in high-cost mines, where profitability is modest, but it caps the leverage of mining profit to 70 percent of the change in the gold price once profits are high.
In Peru, miners feared that Ollanta Humala, the new president, might expropriate assets. In comparison, the royalty he has proposed seems a fair deal. Nevertheless, the government's levy will be linked to operating profit, again limiting the upside for mining companies.
There is slippage on the cost side, too. Oil prices often rise along with other commodities and precious metals, and fuel typically represents 25 percent of costs to operate a mine. Naturally, wages for mining company workers, especially skilled labor, also tend to increase when prices are high and activity is intense. The same applies to the cost of mining equipment.
Finally, rocketing gold prices make increasing numbers of higher-cost mines viable and attract new capital. That adds competitive pressures. Meanwhile, investors doubt the long-term sustainability of high prices. Both of these effects tend to mean mining companies decline in value relative to gold itself.
In 2010, an earlier phase of the upward trajectory for gold, the Market Vectors Gold Miners exchange-traded fund gained 33 percent, more than the 29 percent rise in the price of the metal. In 2011, by contrast, the E.T.F. has gained only 2.5 percent compared with gold's rise of 29 percent. This year at least, mining shares just aren't shining for gold bugs.

HEADLINE: River, at 100-Year High, Ravages New Jersey City That Once Thrived on It

BYLINE: By SAM DOLNICK; Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
PATERSON, N.J. -- The red roof of an old fried-chicken restaurant peeked out above the floodwaters. A roiling current marooned a furniture shop, while the manager of a 99-cent store watched boxes of diapers bob like buoys in her basement.
Nearby, a resident named Vendetta Wilson, 45, looked at her apartment building on the wrong side of the newly impassable Passaic River. She had just spent a night in her truck and several more with relatives after her complex, on one of the river's banks, was evacuated.
''I just want to go home,'' Ms. Wilson said. ''It's sad. It's just really sad.''
On Wednesday, this working-class city in North Jersey was fighting back the highest floodwaters in over a century. At least 6,000 people here have been affected, Mayor Jeffery Jones said. Roads have been destroyed, and stores have been wrecked. Whole blocks lie beneath waters that have swallowed stop signs as easily as skipping stones. Four of Paterson's five bridges crossing the Passaic River were still underwater, Mr. Jones said. 
''It's just complete devastation,'' he said. ''We've lost our businesses, and folks are wondering what's available and where the help comes from.''
Paterson, which has about 150,000 people, once thrived because of the river, which powered mills that made textiles, giving the city a worldwide reputation for manufacturing. The mills are gone, and now that same water has brought destruction. The damage from the storm is so severe that the White House announced on Wednesday that President Obama would visit Paterson on Sunday, in his first trip to survey the storm's impact.
Paterson shares an unlikely bond with rural hamlets in the Catskills and Vermont that were similarly walloped by the storm. But Paterson's inundated streets show that urban floods pose different challenges, and carry different detritus, than rural ones.
''There's garbage floating everywhere,'' said Rickeya Rogers, 28, a lifelong Paterson resident who left her house when the power was shut off and the water reached her front stoop. ''You've got fishes, you've got garbage, you've got turtles!'' She said she saw two big turtles on Jefferson Street.
There have been no reported deaths from the floods, which were beginning to recede on Wednesday, and many parts of the city appeared untouched.
For some, the flooding has been almost exciting. Great Falls, a local attraction, was roiling like a world-class rapid, attracting delighted squeals from residents and visitors.
But the low-lying neighborhoods along the river were struggling.
An alarm blared from a vacant storefront on Market Street. Flotsam still covered the sidewalks of Memorial Drive, which was itself underwater when the river was at its highest on Tuesday. Lifelong residents walked down the hill to see the waters for themselves, their conversations punctuated by roaring sirens.
Gov. Chris Christie, who visited Paterson on Wednesday, as well as other damaged areas, said the Passaic River would remain dangerously high for several more days.
''We're clearly not out of the woods yet,'' said Mr. Christie, who was joined by Janet Napolitano, the homeland security secretary.
Paterson was far from the only city in New Jersey to be hit by floods. Little Falls, Woodland Park and Wayne, among others, suffered extensive damage from swollen rivers.
Officials said it would be days before the waters fully receded, and the scope of the damage could be determined.
''There are people in our town who have never had a drop of water during a flood whose basements are six or eight feet high with water,'' said Keith Kazmark, a former Woodland Park councilman and a member of the local Office of Emergency Management.
State officials said 179,000 customers in New Jersey were still without power, and 10 major roads were still closed. More than a dozen municipalities were asking residents to boil water, and 765 people remained in 16 shelters.
In Paterson, Johanna Vasquez, 25, runs a 99-cent store, one of the few businesses along the river that were open on Wednesday. Eight feet of water had poured into her basement, causing thousands of dollars in damage and lost inventory.
She ran two pumps to suck out the water, and sold the stray box of cereal to one of the few customers who reached her stoop.
''They told us not to come here, but this is all we have,'' she said. ''We weren't just going to cross our fingers and hope.''
Her usual customers live in Riverview Towers, a complex of four buildings that are among the tallest in the city. With the power and gas shut off, most residents had been evacuated, creating a ghost town of flooded roads and dark windows.
''All this is black at night; there are no lights,'' said Rikita Scott, 32, a neighbor whose grandmother refused to leave her apartment in the towers. ''It looks like you're walking straight into the water.''
Down the road, the owner of Uncle and Nephew Rebuilders, an auto body shop, surveyed the damage. The tire yard in the back was a fetid pool. Water reached the windows of cars parked in the lot, while the nearby intersection was somewhere beneath six feet of water.
''In 30 years, my business has never flooded,'' said the owner, Iris Tejada, 59. She pointed to her ruined computer and water-logged office. ''It's very bad. It means no money for me.''
Ms. Tejada was one of many who said they wondered how fast the government would act to help Paterson.
A city made up largely of immigrants and minorities, Paterson sits just miles from manicured suburbs like Little Falls.
Here, local businesses struggle to compete with nearby malls in Wayne and Paramus. The flooded fried-chicken restaurant that has attracted news cameras has actually been empty for years. Unemployment is high, and crime is a fact of life.
''We're a city that needs financial help from the state, and any expense that we have to incur now only straps us for other services like parks and road repairs,'' said Mr. Jones, the mayor.
Some residents said they were used to being overlooked.
''We're the last on the totem pole to get anything,'' said Ms. Wilson, the woman evacuated from the apartment complex on the river's edge.
But she said she was optimistic that Mr. Obama's visit would bring relief. ''That is a good thing, no doubt,'' she said. ''I'm really hoping that we get everything done that needs to be done and fixed around this place.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about flooding in New Jersey caused by swollen rivers misstated, in some editions, part of the name of a town that suffered extensive damage. It is Woodland Park, not Woodlawn Park. The article also repeated the error in identifying Keith Kazmark, a former Woodland Park councilman.

 BODY:
BRIEF REPRIEVE The hedge fund magnate John A. Paulson, below, has endured a long, hot summer, with two of his largest funds seemingly in free fall.
Few if any major managers have done as poorly as Mr. Paulson this year. His funds' performance have become an industry obsession. But last week, the storm broke momentarily for Mr. Paulson. His Advantage fund gained 2.3 percent, and the Advantage Plus gained 3.5 percent. AZAM AHMED 
HIGH STAKES Some $150 million in advisory fees is at risk if AT&T is thwarted in its bid to buy T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom, Thomson Reuters calculates.
When the $39 billion sale was announced in March, it was hailed by bankers who for the most part had been starved of megadeals since the financial crisis. Now, the Justice Department's lawsuit to block the deal threatens the paydays for seven investment banks.
WINNING STREAK Cantor Fitzgerald, the Wall Street bond firm, dove further into the gambling world on Wednesday, announcing an agreement to operate the race and sports book at the newly renovated Plaza Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. The deal, slated to start in 2012, is the latest for Cantor's gambling division.
''We are thrilled and honored that the Plaza has chosen us as its long-term partner,'' Lee M. Amaitis, above, a former bond trader who runs Cantor's operations in Las Vegas, said in a statement. BEN PROTESS

HEADLINE: A One-Sided Rivalry

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Xu Yan contributed reporting from Shanghai and Joshua Frank from Beijing.

 BODY:
MUMBAI, India -- It seems to be a national obsession in India: measuring the country's economic development against China's yardstick.
At a recent panel discussion to commemorate the 20th anniversary of India's dismantling parts of its socialist economy, a government minister told business leaders to keep their eye on the big prize: growing faster than China.
''That's not impossible,'' said the minister, Palaniappan Chidambaram, who oversees national security and previously was finance minister. ''People are beginning to talk about outpacing China.''
Indians, in fact, seem to talk endlessly about all things China, a neighbor with whom they have long had a prickly relationship, but which is also one of the few other economies that has had 8 percent or more annual growth in recent years. 
Indian newspapers are filled with articles comparing the two countries. Indian executives refer to China as a template for development. Government officials cite Beijing, variously as a threat, partner or role model.
But if keeping up with the Wangs is India's economic motive force, the rivalry seems to be largely one-sided.
''Indians are obsessed with China, but the Chinese are paying too little attention to India,'' said Minxin Pei, an economist who was born in China and who writes a monthly column for The Indian Express, a national daily newspaper. (No Indian economists are known to have a regular column in mainland Chinese publications.)
Most Chinese are unconcerned with how India is growing and changing, because they prefer to compare their country with the United States and Europe, said Mr. Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna College near Los Angeles. He says he has tried to organize conferences about India in China but has struggled to find enough Chinese India experts.
Liu Yi, a clothing store owner in Beijing, echoed the sentiments of a dozen Chinese people interviewed in Beijing and Shanghai, in dismissing the idea that the two countries could be compared. Yes, he said India was a ''world leader'' in information technology but it also had many ''backward, undeveloped places.''
''China's economy is special,'' Mr. Liu said. ''If China's development has a model, you could say it's the U.S. or England.''
It might be only natural that the Chinese would look up the development ladder to the United States, now that it is the only nation in the world with a larger economy, rather than over their shoulders at India, which ranks ninth. And while China is India's largest trading partner, the greatest portion of China's exports go to the United States.
So for India, China represents the higher rung to strive for.
Like India, China traces its civilization back thousands of years and has a population of more than 1 billion people. And China has lessons to offer because, under Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s and early '80s, it started the transition to a more open and competitive economy more than a decade before India. Before Deng took power, India's economy was bigger on a per-capita basis than China's.
Whatever the reasons, Indians compare virtually every aspect of their nation with China. Infrastructure (China is acknowledged as being many kilometers ahead). The armed forces (China is more powerful). Universities (China has invested more in its institutions). The software industry (India is far ahead). Proficiency in the English language (India has the historical advantage, but China is catching up).
Evidence of the Indo-Sino interest disparity can be seen in the two countries' leading newspapers. The People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's house organ, had only 24 articles mentioning India on its English-language Web site in the first seven months of this year, according to the Factiva database. By contrast, The Times of India, the country's largest circulation English-language newspaper, had 57 articles mentioning China -- in July alone.
There are other big gaps. Indian cities, large and small, are filled with Chinese restaurants that serve a distinctly ultraspicy, Indian version of that cuisine. But there are few Indian restaurants in Beijing or Shanghai, let alone in smaller Chinese cities.
In 2009, more than 160,000 Indian tourists visited mainland China, according to the Chinese government. Barely 100,000 Chinese tourists made the reverse trek, according to India's government.
Prakash Jagtap, who owns a small engineering firm in the western Indian city of Pune, has been to China five times. Like many Indians, he loves Chinese food (of the Indian variant) and he sings the praises of Chinese diligence and persistence.
''They have more discipline,'' he said. ''Here in our country, people don't look for the long term. Instead, they look for short term, both the management and labor. We have to change our work culture.''
Mr. Jagtap's statement reflects a widely held view among Indians that China has outperformed their country in large part because the Chinese one-party system is more ''disciplined'' than India's vibrant, but messy, democracy.
In early July, The Economic Times, India's leading financial newspaper, ran a photo slide show on its Web site titled ''How China builds these, and why India never does.'' The slide show is a series of photographs of large infrastructure projects in China, including the a new 26-mile-long bridge linking Qingdao and the Huangdao district across the Jiaozhou Bay on the northeastern coast.
India's views have also been shaped by a 1962 war that ended with China seizing a chunk of the northern India state of Kashmir. The countries still have an unsettled border, and China claims a large piece of territory controlled by India.
Raghav Bahl, an Indian media executive who has written a book about the economic rise of both countries, said Indians ''nursed a severe feeling of humiliation'' from the 1962 war that was compounded by China's economic rise.
''There is a sense that this is one race that we could have done much better in,'' said Mr. Bahl, author of ''Superpower? The Amazing Race Between China's Hare and India's Tortoise.''
But he added that Indians had regained confidence recently as a result of their country's strong economy. Many, like Mr. Chidambaram and The Economist magazine, have suggested that India could soon grow at a faster pace than China. Its economy, at $5.9 trillion, is about three and a half times as big as the Indian economy, but China's population is much older than India's.
In China, however, India does not register as a threat, economically or otherwise.
Mr. Pei, the economist, said Chinese officials, executives and even many intellectuals did not have a nuanced understanding of India. Communist conservatives maintain that ''democracy is hindering India's development,'' he said.
Meanwhile, Chinese liberals argue that democracy makes India more stable and its government more accountable -- an impression that appears to ignore India's frequent electoral turmoil and deep-rooted corruption.
But Indian fascination with China's economic success is also simplistic, Mr. Pei said. While one-party rule may have helped the country build infrastructure and factories in recent decades, it was also responsible for big failures under Mao Zedong. They include the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, when millions of people starved or were killed or persecuted.
Even now, China's leaders are struggling to quell public outrage over a recent high-speed train disaster, for which many Chinese blame corruption and cronyism in the railways ministry.
''In both countries, the level of knowledge about the other is relatively low,'' Mr. Pei said.
But at least several people interviewed in China acknowledged an inherent competition between the countries, given their size and fast growth. Ideally, they said, it will be a healthy rivalry.
''Competition exists between any two nations,'' said Hu Jun, a 40-year-old teacher in Shanghai. ''That's a good thing. If we compete in the areas of high-tech and energy saving, I think that will benefit everyone.''
In India, Shrayank Gupta, a 21-year-old student at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, echoed those sentiments: ''There will definitely be a race, because we are both naturally competitive, and the world will depend on both of us.''

HEADLINE: Taking the Dogs Out for a Drive

BYLINE: By TED TRAUTMAN

 BODY:
The recession has not been kind to the pet industry. While their finances are in flux, pet owners are less likely to splurge on toys or grooming, and fewer vacations spell empty kennels at the boarding house. In fact, prospective owners are less likely to take on the financial burden of a new dog or cat to begin with. 
As you can see in the video above, David Lang, owner of a Manhattan business called Pet Chauffeur, is keenly aware of these challenges. Fifteen years ago, Mr. Lang noticed that the subway system's vast ridership included few dogs. Passengers can bring small pets on board in carrying cases, but owners of larger dogs cannot travel with their pets by subway, bus or taxi. Sensing he could fill a void, he founded Pet Chauffeur, a taxi service for animals, in 1996.
From his home office on East 36th Street, Mr. Lang coordinates a fleet of four orange-and-blue minivans and a staff of 12 dispatchers and drivers. Customers have the option of riding along with their pets, but many choose not to, leaving the drivers to learn their dogs' idiosyncrasies first-hand. And dogs are not the only animals getting a lift: Pet Chauffeur has transported everything from leopards to bulk shipments of lab rats. But dogs are the most frequent riders, and Mr. Lang says the most popular destinations are veterinary clinics, grooming salons and boarding kennels.
The bulk of Pet Chauffeur's $1 million annual revenue comes from its business in New York City, but its vans have traveled as far as Florida, and the company also coordinates the shipping of animals by air. Because many of his customers live in Manhattan's tonier neighborhoods, Mr. Lang hopes to sell ad space on his vans to luxury retailers. ''I got vans running up and down Fifth Avenue all day long,'' he said. ''Who wouldn't want their perfume on top of a Pet Chauffeur?''
Despite these plans, Mr. Lang is wary of expansion. He used to run a boarding service and a pet supply retail Web site, both of which failed to weather the recent recession. He now concentrates all of his effort on transportation and has adapted his company to the new economic context in two ways: first, he targets high-end customers. In 2008, he came to the conclusion, ''now's the time to get rid of the people who don't want to pay for our service anyway, and up the price, and go with the high-end people that want our service.''
Pet Chauffeur's other post-recession adaptation is to collaborate with competitors. If Mr. Lang is unable to arrange a pick-up for a customer, he will refer that person to companies like Tim's Pet Minivan or Tony's Canine Cab. Because the pet taxi industry represents such a niche service, Mr. Lang said, he'd ''rather see someone go with the other guy than not go at all.'' Mr. Lang added: ''Anyway, we've got the best service, so they'll come back to us in the end.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Veterans Discover Allure Of Jobs in Western Wilderness

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK, Calif. -- On the hillside above Evelyn Lake, deep in the southern Sierra Nevada, it was surprisingly easy to tell time: precisely at noon, a loud whoop echoed amid the black-flecked granite and dust, signaling lunch hour for the 17-person crew repairing the trail to the lake.
''How much rock do you think we moved today?'' Gregory Snyder asked his work partner, James Morin, over the metallic clang of rakes, shovels, mallets and pickaxes. 
''About five tons,'' Mr. Morin guessed. Not bad for a morning's work building wilderness paths with tools little different from the ones the Egyptians used to build the pyramids. Not bad at all.
Fourteen miles from the nearest road and thousands of miles from the areas of conflict and tension where the two men served in the Army, Mr. Snyder (a former air traffic controller in Iraq) and Mr. Morin (a tank corpsman on the Korean Peninsula) and five other former military men are breaking a trail, figuratively and literally. They are part of a pilot program run by the California Conservation Corps, which gives veterans a chance to learn skills and perhaps pursue careers preserving public lands.
The two Army veterans along with two Navy veterans, three Marines, seven civilians and three supervisors, are part of a backcountry crew shoring up and clearing debris from paths that transport hikers from a world of Facebook into a more natural life, where encounters with sharp-smelling bear clover or the shrub's namesake are possible.
The effort to attract veterans, many either unemployed or adrift in a turbulent economy, into the backcountry is new to California this year. The program took root in Colorado in 2009 and has spread from the Rockies to the rest of the West. It is a collaboration among many government agencies and nonprofits, particularly a three-year-old group called Veterans Green Jobs.
Bill Doe, the chief executive, said the number of veterans participating was small but growing: perhaps 300 since the program's inception. The number on trail crews this summer is about 100, estimated Harry Bruell, the executive director of the Southwest Conservation Corps. Like the California Conservation Corps, whose logo adorns Mr. Snyder's and Mr. Morin's hardhats, the Southwestern Corps offers a chance to cut trees and rebuild switchbacks amid huge forests and tiny flowers.
The veterans benefit from having work (albeit at $8 an hour) and from being in a familiar situation: part of a small group in a far-off location with a little-understood job to do.
''This reminds me of Fallujah, being in a remote area with a tight family,'' said Aaron Hernandez, a former Marine who served as a diesel mechanic in the Iraqi city during a bloody assault in 2004. ''There were 10 mechanics, and we all lived together, we all ate together, we all worked together. That was what kept us going.''
Mr. Bruell said he had heard much the same from others in similar programs. ''You have all these people who had all these experiences, trained expensively at government cost, put their bodies on the line and have all kinds of skills,'' he said.
The backcountry provides a respite from the very different demands of civilian life.
''You're out here in the middle of nowhere,'' said Mr. Snyder, 26, who attended Bowling Green State University in Ohio. ''It gives you time to reflect. You don't have to deal with all the chaos in society. You have to deal with yourself and your community, and it's a very small community. It's easy to function.''
The close quarters, heavy-duty chores and interdependence of a backcountry camp reminded participants of the military but with a new wrinkle. Most of the civilians on the crew have lacked contact with military life. ''People outside the military, they think people in the military who've been veterans and been to Afghanistan and Iraq, they think like all of us have, like, P.T.S.D.,'' Mr. Snyder said, referring to post-traumatic stress disorder. ''They are really kind of cautious at first.''
In its last big job before moving on to the Inyo National Forest, the Sequoia crew rerouted a trail near Evelyn Lake under the direction of Major Bryant, leader of a permanent trail crew from the National Park Service. They reduced a steep grade by adding six switchbacks, each anchored with a massive keystone that they found, unearthed and replanted. Each switchback was dedicated by the team to someone who died not long ago, like the singer Amy Winehouse or the author J. D. Salinger.
Emergencies also forged common bonds. A lesson in using a cross-cut saw turned into a lesson in fleeing as the log broke loose and rolled downhill, catching a comrade, whom the group rescued.
A more serious emergency had some crew members cutting trees to create a trail and a helicopter landing area while others -- Mr. Snyder included -- ran two miles to get oxygen from a ranger station for a 57-year-old visitor who had had a heart attack. The man survived.
Crew members networked with every ranger and park supervisor they met. At least three want to land permanent backcountry jobs; Mr. Snyder wants to become a backcountry firefighter.
''Wild-land firefighting, as anybody understands, it's a military operation,'' said Mr. Doe, listing the skills required: ''communications, traversing over terrain with lots of equipment on your back, using chain saws.''
Finally, Mr. Doe added, ''There's the element of risk.''
Seeing bears and mountain lion tracks, catching a trout with bare hands, as Mr. Snyder did last month, is gravy.

HEADLINE: Indexes Are Up for the Day, Down for the Month

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Until the end, August was a difficult month for Wall Street.
Capping a period characterized by wild swings of hundreds of points, all three major indexes finished the month lower, despite rising for the day.
On Wednesday, shares shifted between gains and declines, running from flat to more than 1 percent, in a market weighed down by news that the Justice Department would seek to block AT&T's proposed acquisition of T-Mobile USA.
Shares shot up after the opening, but the AT&T news dragged down the telecommunications sector. Then the three main indexes lost steam after a Federal Reserve official said that policy adjustments were not justified now. 
In the last half hour, a bounce sent the Dow Jones industrial average above its starting point for 2011, but there was still not enough momentum to finish the month higher.
The Dow was up 53.58 points, or 0.46 percent, to 11,613.53 at the close, just above its 2011 start of 11,577.51. It was down more than 4 percent for the month. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 5.97 points, or 0.49 percent, to 1,218.89, but down more than 5 percent for the month.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 3.35 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,579.46. It closed down more than 6 percent for August.
AT&T was the second-most actively traded stock in the telecommunications sector, behind Sprint. It fell 3.85 percent, to $28.48. Its rival Sprint Nextel was up nearly 6 percent to $3.76.
August was punctuated by volatility in the broader markets, as choppy economic data renewed discussions about whether the economy was headed for another recession. Concerns about euro zone debt, fiscal uncertainty in the United States and the potential for further economic stimulus from the Federal Reserve also affected market sentiment.
Those issues persisted this week when the Fed released minutes from its Aug. 9 meeting, where its policy makers considered changing the size or composition of the Fed's balance sheet or reducing the interest rate paid on banks' excess reserve balances.
Fed policy makers have agreed to consider other options at their next meeting in September. Some analysts said the Fed might need more information before deciding on further stimulus.
On Wednesday, Dennis P. Lockhart, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, appeared to tamp down the prospect.
''We may find, as economic circumstances evolve, that policy adjustments are required,'' Mr. Lockhart said in speech to the Chamber of Commerce in Lafayette, La. ''In more adverse scenarios, further policy accommodation might be called for. But as of today, I am comfortable with the current stance of policy, especially considering the tensions policy must navigate between the short and long term and between recovery and the need for longer-term structural adjustments.''
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 17/32 to 99 1/32, pushing the yield to 2.23 percent, up from 2.18 percent late Tuesday.
Mark T. Lamkin, the chief executive officer of Lamkin Wealth Management, said the late-day swoon in shares could be attributed to short-term technical profit-taking, before the release of the national jobs report for August on Friday. It could also be a reaction to Mr. Lockhart's remarks, he said.
Britain's FTSE 100 gained 2.4 percent, and Germany's DAX gained 2.5 percent. In Paris, the CAC 40 rose 3.1 percent. Asian markets were broadly higher on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, new data on factory orders and jobs set up a rise in shares that carried over from markets in Asia and Europe.
The Commerce Department showed that factory orders for July rose 2.4 percent, the largest increase since March. Demand for automobiles and commercial airplanes propelled the orders.
A report on employment from ADP Employer Services showed new jobs on private payrolls totaled 91,000 for August, below forecasts.
Those reports were made public before the release Friday of one of the most closely watched indicators, the Labor Department's national report on the job situation. Analysts were forecasting a gain of 70,000 in new nonfarm payroll jobs for August, compared with 117,000 the previous month, while the unemployment rate of 9.1 percent was not expected to change, according to a survey by Bloomberg News.
''We are still not seeing job losses, which is what you would see in a recession,'' said Anthony G. Valeri, a senior vice president and market strategist for LPL Financial.
Goldman Sachs economists said that the ADP report, which is used to help estimate the outcome of the national report, could mean lower forecasts for Friday's numbers.

HEADLINE: Praising NATO, and France's Place in It

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
PARIS -- On the eve of a major conference here to try to consolidate international support and reconstruction aid for Libya's fledgling government, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France praised the working of the NATO alliance in support of the rebels, calling it ''an indispensable tool'' despite Washington's decision to take a back seat in the war.
''For the first time since 1949 NATO was put at the service of a coalition led by two determined European countries, France and Great Britain,'' Mr. Sarkozy told French ambassadors and other dignitaries on Wednesday in a wide-ranging hourlong speech at the Elysee Palace, an annual performance to set the themes of French diplomacy that was more pointed than usual, with presidential elections next year. 
Mr. Sarkozy, as ever, was passionate about his government's accomplishments, both in helping oust the defeated president of Ivory Coast, Laurent Gbagbo, four months ago, and now Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya. He was also defiant about the need to aggressively meet the economic and political challenges of the future. It was vital to act, he said, ''not submit.''
Libya was a particularly fierce point of pride, where the bombing campaign did halt an anticipated massacre of rebels, in contrast to the Bosnian wars, when United Nations troops were unable to stop the killings of 7,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica. Mr. Sarkozy said Libya proved ''a strong contrast'' to past European weakness, and justified his decision to integrate France into NATO's military command in 2009, ending the long separation initiated by de Gaulle.
Recalling the complaints that ''France would lose its independence'' and ''its image would be destroyed in the Third World,'' he said, ''Our Libyan friends ask every day for more action from NATO!''
Europe must focus more on its military capabilities, he said. ''President Obama has presented a new vision of U.S. military engagement that implies that the Europeans must assume more of their responsibilities,'' Mr. Sarkozy said. ''If we don't draw the necessary conclusions, Europe will wake up to a difficult reality.''
He praised Arab youths' desire for liberty and democracy, and the ability of French diplomacy to rebound from a late start in support of the Arab Spring. The comments referred to the period in which his country remained supportive of the Tunisian leader, even as he was being toppled, and was slow to recognize the Egyptian revolt.
At a time of rising concerns over illegal migration, he called for partnership with all the countries of the Mediterranean, calling it both the obligation and the future for Europe.
For Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, whom Mr. Sarkozy had once courted (as he had Colonel Qaddafi), he had harsh words. The Syrian leader's credibility had suffered ''irreparable'' damage, he said, and France would do everything ''legally permissible'' to bring about his downfall and the Syrian people's aspirations to freedom and democracy.
France supports stronger economic sanctions against Syria, but opposes any military action without the kind of clear mandate from the United Nations Security Council it received on Libya.
On the Mideast stalemate, Mr. Sarkozy said negotiation efforts led by the United States had reached a dead end and should be rethought. He said he hoped that all 27 member nations of the European Union could find a common position at the United Nations on the Palestinian effort to get recognition as a de facto state. He did not say what the position should be.
Acknowledging Germany's central role in calming Europe's lengthy financial turmoil, he thanked the chancellor, Angela Merkel, for her support in helping preserve the troubled euro and for backing the idea of a balanced-budget amendment for the 17 countries using it.
He also noted France's central role, as the current president of the Group of 20 large economies. France will push at a summit meeting in November ''a plan of action for growth, including precise and concrete commitments from the main economies,'' he said, calling on all countries, in particular China, to promote imports for domestic consumption in the face of a major global slowdown.
Mr. Sarkozy seemed slightly distracted as he spoke. A new book charges that a judge heard unsworn testimony from a nurse of the L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt that he received campaign cash from Mrs. Bettencourt in 2007, a charge that the Elysee denied fiercely.
The Libyan conference Thursday will be attended by the two main leaders of the Transitional National Council and some 60 delegations. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will attend, as will representatives of Russia, China and Germany. Those countries did not support the NATO operation or criticized it. A senior French official called the transition to a legitimate political leadership vital, adding that ''there is a risk that the transition will fail.''
In Iraq, the official said, ''there was a successful military operation and a failed transition.'' In Libya, he said, the new leaders would have to be more autonomous. ''It is they who know what is good for the Libyan people, and we are there to listen to them, to help them,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Solar Firm Aided by U.S. Shuts Doors

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A Silicon Valley maker of solar power arrays that was started with high hopes and $527 million in loans from the federal government said on Wednesday that it would cease operations. The failure of the company -- and the loss to taxpayers -- is likely to renew the debate in Washington about the wisdom of clean energy subsidies and loan guarantees.
President Obama praised the company, Solyndra, for its advanced technology during a visit last year. But in a statement on Wednesday, Solyndra said its business had run into trouble because of difficult global business conditions, including slowing demand for solar panels, and stiff competition. 
The Energy Department, which approved the funding, said China's subsidies to its solar industry were threatening the ability of Solyndra and other American manufacturers to compete. The price of a solar array, measured by cost per watt of capacity, has fallen 42 percent since December 2010, the agency said.
Two other American solar companies, Evergreen Solar and SpectraWatt, also sought bankruptcy protection in August, and both said competition from Chinese companies had contributed to their financial problems.
In the case of Solyndra, some experts said that regardless of the competition, the company's unique designs, which were expensive to manufacture, were to blame for its failure.
Solyndra was promised loans of up to $535 million under a guarantee program authorized by Congress as part of the 2009 stimulus package. The Energy Department has made more than 40 promises of guarantees, of which Solyndra was the first. It has committed $18 billion in guarantees and expects to allocate several billion dollars more by the time the program finishes at the end of September.
The government calculates premiums for the guarantees, essentially a loan fee based on the risk of default, but it picks up the cost of the premiums for the companies in the subsidy program. By that yardstick, it has spent $2.4 billion in credit subsidies for the program.
Solyndra's troubles have been growing for some time. Republican budget-cutters in Congress have viewed it as a model of poor government investment.
''In an apparent rush to push stimulus dollars out the door, the Obama administration wasted $535 million in taxpayer funds in guaranteeing a loan to a firm that has proven to be unviable in the global market,'' said Representative Cliff Stearns, the Florida Republican who is chairman of an investigative subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
He said the Energy Department might have authorized the guarantee because an Oklahoma oil man who was a donor to the Obama campaign, George Kaiser, was an investor in the project. In a joint statement, Mr. Stearns and Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, the chairman of the committee, said, ''We smelled a rat from the onset.''
But the Energy Department dismissed that assertion, saying that Solyndra applied for federal help during the Bush administration and that Obama-era officials merely finished the process the Republicans had begun.
The department says government subsidies are essential to keep the United States competitive in renewable energy, and not all companies will succeed.
''The project that we supported succeeded,'' insisted Damien LaVera, a spokesman for the Department of Energy.
''The facility was producing the product it said it would produce, and consumers were buying the product,'' he said. ''The company struggled because the market has changed dramatically.''
Although the government typically guarantees loans made to a company by a commercial bank, that was not the case for Solyndra. Solyndra borrowed the money from the Federal Financing Bank, part of the Treasury Department, so in effect, the government was lending the money to the company directly. The Energy Department gave Solyndra a conditional guarantee for $535 million, in multiple stages, contingent on reaching a variety of milestones, and to date, it had received $527 million.
Mr. LaVera held out the hope that in a bankruptcy reorganization, Solyndra or some other company would run the factory profitably and that not all the taxpayer investment would be lost. In addition to the government, private investors put about $1 billion into the company. More than 1,000 employees were laid off.
Although the Obama administration is under pressure from energy companies to extend the guarantee program, it is a likely target for Congressional budget-cutters.
''Solyndra is a black eye for the program,'' said Matthew A. Feinstein, an analyst at Lux Research. ''And that means bad things for the solar industry in the United States.''
Solyndra, which once had plans to sell stock to the public, was a darling of policy makers. When it broke ground in Fremont, Calif., Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was then governor, and Steven Chu, the federal secretary of energy, wielded ceremonial gold-colored shovels.
Solyndra's problem, according to outsiders, was that the product looked better when it was conceived than when it hit the market. Solyndra's design avoids the use of silicon, a commodity that was selling at very high prices in 2009 when the loan guarantee was approved but that has crashed since then.
The design also sought to cut costs with an innovative cylindrical design that reduced the labor required for installation. As the sun moves across the sky, the light hits a different facet of the cylinder. But the capital costs for manufacturing were high.
Barry Cinnamon, the chief executive of Westinghouse Solar, a competitor, said Solyndra and Evergreen Solar had tried new designs that turned out not to be as good as standard flat panels.
''In both cases, they made a bad bet,'' he said.
Evergreen, based in Massachusetts, received tens of millions of dollars in state loans and grants in exchange for opening a factory there. In January, it announced that it was closing that factory and moving manufacturing to China. But a few weeks ago, it concluded that even the move offshore was not enough to save the company.
SpectraWatt, a small solar company near Poughkeepsie, N.Y., ceased operations earlier this year and declared bankruptcy on Aug. 19. The company, which was created as a spinoff from Intel, the computer chip maker, cited poor market conditions created by China's subsidies to its manufacturers.
Ken Zweibel, director of the Solar Institute at the George Washington University, said solar companies in China and Germany were receiving big subsidies from their governments and were pressuring American companies.
''There's definitely a crisis in traditional technology,'' he said. But Solyndra, he said, was ''a wild-card technology,'' and both Solyndra and Evergreen products had ''questionable attributes.''

HEADLINE: Speaker Says No, So Obama Delays Speech

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and JACKIE CALMES; Michael D. Shear and Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Any hopes that a kinder, gentler bipartisan Washington would surface once Congress returns after Labor Day were summarily dashed on Wednesday when President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner clashed over, of all things, the date and time of the president's much-awaited speech to the nation about his proposal to increase jobs and fix the economy.
In a surreal volley of letters, each released to the news media as soon as it was sent, Mr. Boehner rejected a request from the president to address a joint session of Congress next Wednesday at 8 p.m. -- the same night that a Republican presidential debate is scheduled.
In an extraordinary turn, the House speaker fired back his own letter to the president saying, in a word, no. Might the president be able to reschedule for the following night, Sept. 8? 
For several hours, the day turned into a very public game of chicken.
By late Wednesday night, though, the White House issued a statement saying that because Mr. Obama ''is focused on the urgent need to create jobs and grow our economy,'' he ''welcomes the opportunity to address a joint session of Congress on Thursday, Sept. 8.''
The president had sent in the first volley with his request for a speech next Wednesday night, when Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is scheduled to debate his fellow would-be Republican presidential nominees for the first time.
''No, of course not,'' the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, replied when a reporter asked if the timing of the president's speech had been meant to play havoc with the Republican debate plans. He said that ''one debate of many was no reason not to have a speech when we wanted to have it.''
Mr. Boehner was not budging.
''As the majority leader announced more than a month ago, the House will not be in session until Wednesday, Sept. 7, with votes at 6:30 that evening,'' the speaker wrote. ''With the significant amount of time, typically more than three hours, that is required to allow for a security sweep of the House chamber before receiving a president, it is my recommendation that your address be held on the following evening, when we can ensure there will be no parliamentary or logistical impediments that might detract from your remarks.''
Mr. Boehner did not specify what votes were scheduled for 6:30 that evening that could not be moved. The House calendar shows that members are expected to vote on the ''suspension calendar,'' generally minor bills like naming a post office.
Congressional historians said Mr. Boehner's move was unprecedented.
''The Senate Historical Office knows of no instance in which Congress refused the president permission to speak before a joint session of Congress,'' Betty K. Koed, associate historian with the Senate, said in an e-mail. ''Permission to speak in a joint session is given by resolution of the House and Senate, and arrangements are made through the leadership offices of each chamber.''
White House officials held talks with Mr. Boehner's office into the night Wednesday. At 9:17 p.m., the White House released a statement to the news media saying it had agreed to change the date to Sept. 8.
A White House official said Mr. Obama and his advisers had chosen Wednesday because it was Congress's first day back. ''The debate was never really an issue,'' because there are a total of 20 and three this month alone, said the official, who would not allow his name to be used because he was not authorized to speak publicly. ''Had Mr. Boehner told us he had a problem with Wednesday this morning,'' when the White House consulted him, the official said, ''we would have done Thursday from the beginning.''
The scheduling clash came at a time when public confidence in Washington to move beyond partisan bickering is at historic lows. The fracas also had the potential to rattle already jittery markets.
''If the objective of the White House and Speaker Boehner was to demonstrate to the American people that they have gotten the message from the markets and from voters that our economic straits are so dire that it is time to set petty politics aside, they have failed before they started,'' said David Rothkopf, a former Commerce Department official in the Clinton administration. ''This childish gamesmanship regarding timing reconfirms to the world that Washington is a sandbox full of petulant children who don't play well together.'' He called Wednesday's antics ''late-summer silliness.''
In fact, Mr. Obama's initial proposal to address the nation on the same night as the candidates' debate immediately became fodder for heated talk-radio discussion over whether he was trying to upstage the televised event.
Before Mr. Boehner said that a joint session on Wednesday would not work, the debate's sponsors had said their event would go on as planned -- potentially creating a lively opportunity for counterprogramming. The sponsors did not specify a time for the debate, leaving open the possibility it would take place after a presidential address.
''We are thrilled that we now have a terrific opportunity to hear from national leaders of both major parties about the most pressing domestic issues facing the country,'' the sponsors said in a statement.
Still, the political gamesmanship and the maneuvering over the optics of the speech left little hope of compromise once the speech takes place and Mr. Obama lays out his promised job growth proposals and plans to get the economy moving.
Just Tuesday, the president, speaking before the annual convention of the American Legion, criticized the Washington gridlock and said that he hoped the Congressional recess, during which time lawmakers returned home and presumably got an earful on voter frustration over partisan bickering, would usher in repentant Congressional representatives ready to compromise.
But Wednesday showcased only finger-pointing.
The White House said officials talked to Mr. Boehner's office about the date and time before sending the letter, and ''no objection was raised by them.''
Not so, countered Mr. Boehner's office. Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, said the White House had not discussed any possible dates for a speech by Mr. Obama before sending its request.
''We were told this morning that they were sending a letter to us,'' Mr. Buck said. ''They never discussed any dates with us. The letter itself arrived 15 minutes before the press had it.''
He added, ''It's unfortunate the White House ignored decades, if not centuries, of the protocol of working out a mutually agreeable date and time before making any public announcement.''
Mr. Boehner was not the only one complaining about not being consulted. An aide to the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, said, ''The House Democratic leadership was not consulted with respect to Speaker Boehner's letter requesting a new date for the president's address.''
A Congressional staff member said the White House chief of staff, William M. Daley, called the speaker on Wednesday morning and said the president would ask for a joint session of Congress, but did not indicate the time.
Earlier on Wednesday, before Mr. Boehner's letter, Mr. Obama's rivals were quick to heap scorn on the president's move.
''President Obama has a troubling predilection toward diluting the presidency itself in order to pursue his political goals,'' said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist who was Mitt Romney's spokesman in 2008. ''His so-called jobs plan should be about more than just winning a news cycle against a Republican debate.''
Tim Miller, spokesman for Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor and presidential hopeful, said: ''Desperate political times for the president call for desperate political measures. This tactic won't work though because his economic policies have failed.''
Not that the selection of Sept. 8 is free of complications. It is the first night of the N.F.L. season.

HEADLINE: Huntsman Urges Stripping Deductions From Tax Code

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
Jon M. Huntsman Jr. again showed himself on Wednesday to be an ideological outlier in the Republican presidential field, calling for the tax code to be stripped of all loopholes and deductions. 
Congressional Republicans have resisted closing loopholes in recent budget talks, portraying such moves as tax increases.
''Over the last few decades, our tax code has devolved into a maze of special-interest carve-outs, loopholes and temporary provisions that cost taxpayers more than $400 billion a year to comply with,'' Mr. Huntsman said in a speech at a metal plant in Hudson, N.H. ''Get rid of all tax expenditures, all loopholes, all deductions, all subsidies, all corporate welfare.''
Mr. Huntsman's plan, which borrows from both Representative Paul D. Ryan's proposal and the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles Commission recommendations to reduce the deficit, also calls for sharply lowering both corporate and individual tax rates, as well as ending taxes on capital gains and dividends, positions more in line with Republican orthodoxy.
It calls for simplified income tax rates of 8 percent, 14 percent and 23 percent, but would eliminate popular tax breaks like the deduction for interest on home mortgages.
Mr. Huntsman, who was President Obama's ambassador to China for two years, has struggled to gain national attention for his presidential bid, and his speech on his economic plan was yet another instance in which he cast himself as a moderate among his fellow Republicans. For example, he sent out a Twitter post in August that contrasted himself with his rivals, some of whom have questioned both evolution and the premise that human activities cause climate change.
''To be clear,'' the post read. ''I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy.''
On Wednesday, Mr. Huntsman also pushed for energy independence, the part of his speech that seemed to garner the most applause.
The most poignant moment of his remarks came in the question-and-answer session when someone asked what he thought of China's one-child policy. (The policy was recently in the news when, during his visit to China, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. seemed to condone it.)
''I hate the one-child policy, as do a lot of people there,'' Mr. Huntsman said, explaining that ''it is robbing the Chinese people of life and opportunity.''
But, he added, his 12-year-old daughter, whom he and his wife adopted from China, was a direct result of the policy.
''I've got to say it has given me one of the loves of my life in my own daughter,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Legislature In California Is Set to Pass A Dream Act

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- The California Legislature is poised to pass a law that would allow illegal immigrants to receive state-financed aid for college. Known as the California Dream Act, the bill underscores the ways states are navigating their own way through controversial immigration issues, as the Obama administration has been unable to make headway on plans for an overhaul of immigration laws.
While the state law would do nothing to provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, it would provide them with more education benefits than they have in any other state. Advocates of the legislation say it would also send a powerful message to President Obama and Congress, forcing them to reconcile a patchwork of state laws that contradict one another. 
Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, said during his campaign last fall that he would support such a law and signed legislation this summer that gave illegal immigrants access to privately financed state scholarships and other aid. While he has not publicly said that he would sign this second measure, Mr. Brown's staff members have been working with legislators to amend the bill in order to trim some costs.
The Democratic-controlled Senate overwhelmingly approved the bill on Wednesday along a party-line vote. The amended bill is expected to pass the Democratic-controlled State Assembly in the next week.
Assemblyman Gil Cedillo of Los Angeles, the lead author of the bill, has persistently made an economic argument to convince his colleagues.
''We will soon have to replace one million workers who leave the work force,'' Mr. Cedillo said. ''Why would we cut ourselves off from students who have demonstrated since they got here that they have tremendous talent and resilience? This is a very smart decision for the state. It's not necessarily popular or without controversy, but we have to get these students fully educated.''
The bill is particularly controversial at a time when the state is facing major budget problems and drastically cutting spending on higher education.
The legislation is expected to cost about $40 million, according to an analysis by the State Senate, about 1 percent of the state's total $3.5 billion budget for college financial aid.
Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, a Republican who represents San Bernardino, said that he would try to organize a ballot referendum to overturn the legislation.
''The governor is coming to the folks and saying they need to pay more, and then he's going to turn around and say we still have money to hand over to people who are in the country illegally,'' Mr. Donnelly said. ''That is absolutely wrong. We are saying to the world: 'If you haven't come to California yet illegally, come as soon you can.' And we're saying to the people who came legally: 'You guys are idiots.' ''
The law would allow illegal immigrants and out-of-state students who attended California high schools for three years or more to apply for the financial aid.
In 2001, the state passed a law allowing those same students to be eligible for in-state tuition. The University of California, California State University and community college systems now enroll roughly 40,000 such students, about 1 percent of the total enrollment.
Because they lack work visas, many of those students are still unable to secure jobs for which they may be qualified. Opponents of the state Dream Act argue that such legislation would only increase the number of college graduates without jobs.
But supporters contend that many students may get legal status while they are in school, because they have already applied for legal residency or citizenship, a process that can take decades. And they are holding out hope that the Obama administration and Congress will approve the federal Dream Act, which would give students who have graduated from college or served in the military a path to citizenship.
Ana Gomez, whose parents brought her from Mexico to the United States when she was 7 years old, graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2009 and said she was among the few in her group of friends who did not have to spend semesters away from campus to make more money to pay for tuition. Most of them relied on odd jobs that paid cash because they did not have work permits.
''People are really struggling to stay and make it through,'' Ms. Gomez said. ''Being able to attend and get in-state tuition is one thing, but then you have to find a way to pay for it, and it's next to impossible. A lot of kids just get stuck in community college. This changes all of that.''
The legislation that Mr. Brown signed in July allowed illegal immigrants to apply for a pool of $80 million in state scholarships that are financed through private sources. The bill that passed Wednesday would allow them to also gain access to $40 million in grants and scholarships that are paid for by the state.
Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which sued the state to overturn the law granting illegal immigrants in-state tuition, called the bill ''a really stupid allocation of limited resources.''
''It certainly ranks up there as one of the most dramatic moves, but I leave it up the California Legislature to outdo themselves,'' Mr. Mehlman said.
He added, ''In every way possible the state is catering to illegal aliens even if it comes at the cost of other legal citizens.''
Although there has been vocal opposition to the bill, it has benefited from widespread support; the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, university presidents and agricultural leaders have all backed the legislation.
Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed similar legislation three times while he was in office.
Public opinion on illegal immigrants has shifted sharply in the state over the last several years, said Dan Schnur, the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California.
''Five years ago, this was politically risky,'' Mr. Schnur said. ''Fifteen or 20 years ago, it would have been political suicide. But today, it is hard to see it having much of a political impact one way or another here.''

HEADLINE: Buffett Investment Could Erode Confidence in Big Banks

BYLINE: By JESSE EISINGER. 
Jesse Eisinger is a reporter for ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest. Email: jesse@propublica.org Twitter: @eisingerj.

 BODY:
Last week, our financial Superman, the mild-mannered Midwesterner Warren E. Buffett, swooped in again to save another bank, the financial markets, the American economy and just maybe our precious way of life.
Mr. Buffett's purchase of $5 billion worth of Bank of America preferred stock (on his usual generous terms, including long-lasting warrants to buy common stock at an attractive price) immediately stiffened the upper lips of chattering investors and pundits. Bank of America's chairman hailed it as a ''vote of confidence'' in the bank. It was also celebrated as a signal that the worst was over in the rout recently experienced by the American financial sector.
For the moment, that all seems right: Bank of America's stock is up 17 percent from the Aug. 25 announcement, and stocks of the other three major American banks - JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo - are also up.
But as the news is digested, it could set off the opposite effect. The Buffett investment just might turn out to erode, not increase, confidence. And not only for Bank of America, but for the banking sector as a whole. 
Mr. Buffett's investment reveals something both infuriating and scary. Bank of America has not been talking straight about its need for capital.
''You cannot have the largest bank in the country saying, 'We don't need the money,' and then paying this kind of price to Warren Buffett for capital they say they don't need, '' said Daniel Alpert, who runs the investment firm Westwood Capital. ''Industrywide, it's a potential boomerang because we think, 'Why should we believe any of these guys when they say they don't need the money?'----''
''We've been through a massive crisis in 2007 and '08 where executives of major financial institutions tried to hide their insolvency,'' he added. ''They said, 'No, no, a thousand times no, we're fine.' And then they were gone.''
Sure, Mr. Buffett reportedly approached Brian T. Moynihan, Bank of America's chief executive, who initially rebuffed the investment offer - suggesting that Bank of America didn't really need capital. Even so, Mr. Moynihan's reticence didn't last long. And if the bank truly didn't need capital, why make such an expensive deal that could dilute other shareholders?
The more investors think about it, the more Mr. Buffett's announcement will intensify, not allay, their fears about Bank of America's capital position. Indeed, Mr. Buffett is making something more resembling a loan than an equity investment. Of his $5 billion investment, only $2 billion counts in the important measure of capital that regulators look at, called Tier 1.
That is perhaps why Bank of America's money-raising has not stopped with Mr. Buffett. On Monday, the bank sold about half of its stake in China Construction Bank for more than $8 billion. And over the last year, Bank of America has been jettisoning multiple businesses to raise cash and shore up its capital.
Prudent, yes, and we can hope the bank's management has learned a lesson about credibility. Last year, Mr. Moynihan suggested that the bank would be able to raise its dividend after it passed the Federal Reserve's second round of stress tests. No such luck. That plan was blocked, rightly, by the Fed, whose exams revealed, among other perils, Bank of America's overexposure to the sickly real estate sector.
Yet Mr. Moynihan and Bank of America persisted, with analysts expecting the bank to come back in the middle of the year to push the Fed to revisit the dividend issue. So much for that now. Still, even with these moves, some investors and analysts do not think the bank's actions will be sufficient, and that it will have to sell common shares to raise capital.
Bank of America disagrees. Yes, the stock has ''an overhang'' thanks to economic and legal uncertainty, but ''we understand that and are working very aggressively to address that,'' said Jerome F. Dubrowski, a spokesman. ''We have more than enough capital to run our business'' based on current rules, he said.
The bank has clearly explained to investors and regulators how it will reach compliance with the new rules ahead of schedule, he added. The Buffett opportunity was too good to pass up, Mr. Dubrowski said: ''There's only one Warren Buffett. We are very happy to have him, but it wasn't driven by capital.''
Yet Bank of America investors had whipped themselves into a panic in August because of the giant legal liability faced by the bank. The Buffett investment does not remove that, let alone any of the bank's other millstones.
Not only does the bank still face billions in legal settlement costs from Countrywide Financial deals, but it also has to buy back billions in faulty mortgages. Bank of America's questionable foreclosure practices continue to drag it down, and, in addition, it faces Securities and Exchange Commission investigations into the actions of its subsidiary, Merrill Lynch, in the lead-up to the financial crisis. Bank of America acquired Merrill in 2008, under heavy pressure from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department.
The big problem, however, is not the unknown legal costs, but the exceedingly well-known exposure to real estate, both home mortgages and home-equity lines of credit.
The bears will return, armed with a soft economy and the declining housing market. As they do, what is to stop them from jumping from bank to bank?
Compared with Bank of America, Wells Fargo has more exposure to real estate and less capital. The bank classifies about 19 percent of its residential mortgage loans as either delinquent or nonperforming, a number similar to that of Bank of America. Wells Fargo says it's fine, but where have we heard that before?
Of all the big American banks, JPMorgan Chase, perhaps surprisingly, has the highest proportion of bad mortgages, at about 24 percent, according to Bankregdata--.com. Citigroup is lowest at less than 14 percent. But JPMorgan's balance sheet is more solid than that of any of the country's other megabanks.
Even if the major banks do not experience additional capital crises, the Fed plans to keep interest rates low for years. That will almost certainly depress bank lending rates, squeezing profits.
That is, if the banks lend at all. In one of the most important business lines for Bank of America and the other big banks,Big Three, residential mortgages, the banks are pricing themselves out of the market, offering uncompetitive rates. The mortgage market remains shattered.
Why aren't the banks lending? They fear potential future litigation, for one. And they claim there is not enough demand from high-quality borrowers. But if they had conviction that the economy and housing markets were recovering, those concerns would ebb.
So if bank leaders are not exhibiting confidence, why should the rest of us?

CORRECTION-DATE: September 2, 2011

 CORRECTION:
The Trade column on Thursday, about Warren E. Buffett's $5 billion investment in Bank of America, referred incorrectly to the investment's impact on the bank's capital position. Of the $5 billion, $2 billion will count in the measure of capital called Tier 1 under the current capital standard, known as Basel I. It is not the case that none of the $5 billion will count as Tier 1 capital.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.S. Files Lawsuit To Block Merger Of Phone Rivals

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department on Wednesday sued to block the proposed $39 billion merger between the cellphone giants AT&T and T-Mobile USA, arguing that keeping them separate would preserve competition in the wireless industry and even help save jobs of American workers.
In a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court here, the Justice Department argued that the proposed deal, which would join the nation's second- and fourth-largest wireless phone carriers, would result in higher prices and give consumers fewer innovative products. The companies disputed those assertions, and labor unions that support the deal said that the merger would add jobs, not cost them.
''The view that this administration has is that through innovation and through competition, we create jobs,'' said James M. Cole, the deputy attorney general, at a news conference announcing the lawsuit. Mergers usually reduce jobs through the elimination of redundancies, he said, ''so we see this as a move that will help protect jobs in the economy, not a move that is going in any way to reduce them.'' 
The lawsuit, which could take years to wind its way through the courts, sets up a prominent antitrust battle -- a rarity since the election of President Obama, who campaigned with promises to revitalize the Justice Department's policing of mergers and their effects on competition, which he said had declined significantly under the Bush administration.
AT&T said it would fight the lawsuit. ''We plan to ask for an expedited hearing so the enormous benefits of this merger can be fully reviewed,'' Wayne Watts, an executive vice president and general counsel at AT&T, said in a statement. ''The D.O.J. has the burden of proving alleged anticompetitive effects, and we intend to vigorously contest this matter in court.''
Deutsche Telekom, the German parent of T-Mobile USA, said that the Justice Department ''failed to acknowledge the robust competition in the U.S. wireless telecommunications industry and the tremendous efficiencies associated with the proposed transaction, which would lead to significant customer, shareholder and public benefits.''
AT&T has been actively involved in discussions with both the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission since the proposal was announced in March. The company has indicated that it would consider divestitures or other business actions to allow the deal to go forward.
But Justice Department officials said that those discussions led it to believe that it would be difficult to arrange conditions under which the merger could proceed. ''Unless this merger is blocked, competition and innovation will be reduced, and consumers will suffer,'' said Sharis A. Pozen, acting assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division. Offering AT&T only a glimmer of hope, she added that the department's ''door is open'' to discuss possible remedies.
Both the F.C.C. and the Justice Department would need to approve the merger, and though they consider a proposed combination on different scales, they usually reach the same conclusion. The F.C.C., which has never approved a significant merger that the Justice Department is challenging in court, hinted that it was leaning in the same direction of blocking the AT&T deal with T-Mobile.
''Competition is an essential component of the F.C.C.'s statutory public interest analysis,'' said Julius Genachowski, the F.C.C. chairman. ''Although our process is not complete, the record before this agency also raises serious concerns about the impact of the proposed transaction on competition.''
Consumer advocacy groups cheered the administration's move. ''This announcement is something for consumers to celebrate,'' said Parul P. Desai, the policy counsel for Consumers Union. ''We have consistently warned that eliminating T-Mobile as a low-cost option will raise prices, lower choices and turn the cellular market into a duopoly controlled by AT&T and Verizon.''
Harold Feld, legal director of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit group, said that ''fighting this job-killing merger is the best Labor Day present anyone can give the American people.'' Labor groups, however, have generally supported the merger, in part because a substantial number of AT&T employees are members of the Communication Workers of America, while T-Mobile is a largely nonunion company.
Mr. Cole said the department thought that an independent T-Mobile would be more likely to expand its business and add jobs, while mergers often eliminate jobs.
Critics have faulted the Obama administration for not doing more to block big corporate mergers. Those involving Comcast and NBC Universal, Ticketmaster and Live Nation, and United and Continental Airlines were all approved with conditions attached.
But the challenge to the merger makes the future of an independent T-Mobile more of a question than before the deal was announced. Deutsche Telekom has said it does not want to continue to invest in the American wireless market, preferring to focus on the growth of its telecommunications business in Europe.
Before AT&T announced plans to buy T-Mobile, there was consistent speculation that a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint Nextel, the third-largest provider, was in the works. But such a deal seems unlikely in light of the arguments mustered by the Justice Department against the AT&T deal.
Those arguments include the assertion that a combination that took the number of nationwide wireless phone providers down to three from four would harm competition, because the four nationwide service providers already account for more than 90 percent of the mobile wireless connections nationwide.
The proposed merger has been a topic of robust debate in Congress, where both houses have held committee hearings on the merger. At one of them in May, Randall L. Stephenson, the chief executive of AT&T, tried to convince lawmakers that AT&T and T-Mobile should not even be considered as competitors.
He later abandoned that assertion, going back to the company's main point: While the two companies are competitors, plenty of other competition exists in local wireless markets, with most potential customers having a choice among at least five providers.
''Certain critics may attempt to create a myth that only a few national competitors exist, but wireless competition occurs primarily on the local level,'' Mr. Stephenson said.
The Justice Department turned some of AT&T's own statements against it, however. ''As AT&T acknowledged less than three years ago during a merger proceeding,'' referring to AT&T's acquisition of Centennial Wireless, ''it aims to 'develop its rate plans, features and prices in response to competitive conditions and offerings at the national levels -- primarily the plans offered by the other national carriers,' '' the Justice Department said in its lawsuit. ''As AT&T recognized, 'the predominant forces driving competition among wireless carriers operate at the national level.' That remains the case today.''

HEADLINE: Striving for Innovation and Competition: In T-Mobile Suit, Consumers Are Central

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The Justice Department, in the suit it filed Wednesday to block AT&T's $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile, asserted that T-Mobile ''places important competitive pressure'' on the larger cellular carriers. Keeping T-Mobile away from AT&T, the government contends, will spur innovation and give consumers lower prices and more choice.
But a big question, industry analysts say, is whether the mobile industry will be genuinely more competitive and innovative with T-Mobile as a stand-alone company. 
The two biggest carriers, analysts note, are gaining subscribers, while their smaller national rivals, Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile USA, a unit of Deutsche Telekom, are losing ground.
''The gap between the haves -- AT&T and Verizon -- and the have-nots, which is essentially everybody else, is only getting wider,'' said Kevin Smithen, an analyst for Macquarie Securities.
Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, agreed, saying: ''This market is going to consolidate one way or another.''
But in taking action, the Justice Department is making a bet that this is not necessarily the case. And its analysis concluded that the anticompetitive risk of allowing AT&T to reduce the ranks of the four largest carriers -- which provide more than 90 percent of mobile wireless service in the country -- to three was too great.
Wireless looks to be the communications and computing technology of the future, as sales of smartphones and iPads surge and people increasingly use them for sending and receiving messages, reading, and playing games. Competition among mobile carriers, then, is clearly important to both consumers and the economy.
But even if the deal goes through, other forces could eventually shake up the tiny club of large wireless companies. There are upstart carriers, led by MetroPCS, which offer discount service and prepaid plans, enjoy strong positions in some local markets and have national ambitions. A specialist company, LightSquared, is selling capacity on its high-speed wireless network at wholesale rates to niche carriers.
The Federal Communications Commission has begun prodding broadcasters to free up wireless spectrum, opening up more potential opportunities for newcomers to the market. And powerful companies like Google, Apple and Microsoft, with deep pockets and a stake in mobile computing and communications, could also step in and change the game, analysts note.
The mobile market is ''a fast-shifting chessboard these days,'' said Kevin Werbach, an associate professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and a former counsel for new technology policy at the F.C.C.
''If the AT&T merger with T-Mobile fails,'' Mr. Werbach added, ''it will shuffle the pieces still more.''
Yet the Justice Department was faced with a decision about the near-term impact of a huge merger, rather than one about the possibility of new entrants or new technology stimulating competition years down the road.
AT&T had argued that adding T-Mobile would give it the extra network capability it needed to fairly quickly roll out the next generation of high-speed service -- so-called 4G -- across the nation.
The Obama administration has championed the accelerated rollout of faster wireless service as an important foundation for innovation and future growth. But the administration's antitrust regulators decided there were other ways for AT&T to do that without taking out a competitor.
For one, the company could just invest in expanding its own network. Another approach, analysts say, is network-sharing arrangements with T-Mobile and other carriers. That way, rivals avoid the redundant investment of building cell towers side by side. But the companies remain separate and still compete on service in those markets.
''Network-sharing arrangements are common in some European markets,'' said Jan Dawson, an analyst at Ovum, a technology research firm. ''You get some of the same benefits, without running into the kind of antitrust concerns AT&T has with T-Mobile.''
T-Mobile USA's German corporate parent wants to get out of the United States, and concentrate its resources elsewhere. But the unit's assets -- its wireless spectrum and network of cell towers -- could be sold off to others who might sustain a fourth national competitor, like cable, satellite or technology companies that want to offer wireless service, according to some analysts.
The potential for bigger wireless bills for consumers if T-Mobile was acquired by AT&T, legal experts say, was a crucial part of the Justice Department's analysis. T-Mobile offers smartphone service with voice and data plans that, in some markets, are cheaper than AT&T by 20 percent or more. Lower prices are the most easily measured consumer benefit of competition, and in merger cases, the government typically looks at the potential for price increases of 5 percent to 10 percent or more as significant.
AT&T has some sought-after offerings that T-Mobile does not, like Apple's iPhone. But, according to the Justice Department, AT&T's prices would have been higher without the competitive pressure from T-Mobile.
AT&T, when advocating for the deal announced in March, repeatedly said that the merger should be judged not by the impact on market share nationally, but by the impact on local markets, where there are often smaller, regional competitors.
In its complaint and supporting documents, the Justice Department said it had examined local markets carefully. In more than half of the 100 larger markets, for example, the T-Mobile-AT&T combination would have more than 40 percent market share.
In its way, the government complaint tells a story, portraying T-Mobile as a particularly important competitor. With its pricing plans, T-Mobile has led in making smartphone service affordable to a mass market. T-Mobile, the government states, was an early adopter of smartphones that used Google's Android operating system.
''The picture presented is that T-Mobile is not just any competitor, but a 'maverick,' in the term of art used in antitrust,'' said Andrew I. Gavil, a professor at the Howard University law school. ''So if it's acquired, you remove a disruptive, innovative force from the marketplace.''

PERSON: Bernard Wolfman 

HEADLINE: Bernard Wolfman, 87; Sought Tax Overhaul

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Bernard Wolfman criticized America's tax system as being riddled with loopholes, favoring the rich and hopelessly unwieldy. But after Washington's political quicksand repeatedly swallowed his hopes for tax reform in Congress, he concluded that only an independent commission could do the job.
Mr. Wolfman, a leading tax authority who died on Aug. 20 at age 87, expressed those views more than 40 years ago. They continue to echo in Washington today as lawmakers wrestle with a stalled economy and await the recommendations of a special bipartisan Congressional committee formed to address the federal deficit. And like today's advocates of a tax overhaul, he advised simplicity as a means to ensure fairness. 
''The more detailed a statute gets, as it becomes increasingly encrusted with preferences, the easier it is to work loopholes,'' he said in an interview with The New York Times in 1969. ''If the statute were simpler, and spoke more in principles, the courts would feel a broad mandate to enforce the law and honor the intentions of lawgivers.''
He advocated that a government panel be created, patterned after British royal commissions, with real power to revamp the tax code.
Mr. Wolfman used his perches as a senior professor and dean at Ivy League law schools, as an adviser to federal authorities and as a provocative writer and public speaker to propound his usually liberal and, to him, common-sense views on taxation.
He criticized President Ronald Reagan for granting tax exemptions to racially segregated schools. He questioned the selling of insurance against the bite of a tax audit, saying it only encouraged people to cheat on their taxes.
Mr. Wolfman achieved his greatest public prominence in 2001 after President Bill Clinton, on his last day in office, pardoned the financier Marc Rich, who had been indicted on racketeering charges and had fled the United States.
In an Op-Ed article in The Times, Mr. Clinton cited Mr. Wolfman as one of ''two highly respected tax experts'' who had determined that Mr. Rich's transactions had conformed with tax law.
The other was Martin D. Ginsburg of Georgetown University Law Center, the husband of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the United States Supreme Court.
What Mr. Clinton failed to say was that Mr. Wolfman and Mr. Ginsburg had been hired by Mr. Rich's lawyers to do the analysis. The two said they had not verified the facts the lawyers supplied to them.
Mr. Wolfman died in West Orange, N.J., where he was visiting relatives. The cause was heart failure, his daughter, Dina Wolfman Baker, said. He lived in Cambridge, Mass.
Bernard Wolfman was born in Philadelphia on July 8, 1924, earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Pennsylvania and worked at the Philadelphia firm of Wolf, Block, Schorr and Solis-Cohen from 1948 to 1963.
As a volunteer with the American Civil Liberties Union, he did preparatory work for what became a landmark school-prayer case in 1963, that of Ellory Schempp against a school district in a Philadelphia suburb. It and a similar case were the basis of a Supreme Court ruling prohibiting state-sponsored prayer in public schools.
Mr. Wolfman went on to be a professor and dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School and a professor at Harvard Law School.
His first wife, the former Zelda Bernstein, died in 1973. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Toni A. Grotta; his sons Jonathan and Brian Wolfman and Jeffrey and David Braemer; his sister, Lila Booth; and 10 grandchildren.
Mr. Wolfman wrote or edited four books, including the well-regarded ''Dissent Without Opinion: The Behavior of Justice William O. Douglas in Tax Cases'' (1975), which examined how Justice Douglas had gone from consistently voting with the government in tax cases before the Supreme Court to voting just as consistently against it.
Justice Douglas rarely issued an explanatory opinion, and Mr. Wolfman could only speculate on his motivation. One suggestion echoed his own views: that perhaps Justice Douglas was expressing disgust with the tax code in the hope it would be changed.

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Blackmail isn't an economic principle.

 BODY:
Steve Landsburg critiques my critique of Eric Cantor's demand that emergency relief be offset by spending cuts elsewhere. But I think that he misses the point.
Landsburg points out, correctly, that the proposition that a spending increase should be offset with a little bit of pain everywhere and everywhen -- that is, with higher current and future taxes and lower current and future spending on many things -- follows from assuming that the government starts from a position of doing the right thing. If you think the government's priorities are all wrong, then theory doesn't tell you much about what should happen.
But wait: is the one claiming that there's a principle here, that any spending rise on disaster relief must be offset with current spending cuts. I'm critiquing that assertion; there is no such principle. I should have been clearer on that.
Where Landsburg really goes where he shouldn't, though, is by comparing Cantor's proposal to denying someone goodies unless he shapes up elsewhere -- he uses the example of a teenager who won't be allowed to go to the prom unless he does his chores. Is that really a good metaphor for what's happening here?
Remember, Cantor isn't denying something called "the government" the right to do something it wants to do. He's denying disaster relief to people hard hit by a hurricane. That is, he's holding suffering Americans hostage to his goal of smaller government. And the whole point of his offsetting spending cuts thing -- his invention of a nonsense principle -- is to obscure the ruthlessness of the blackmail involved.
Is this really a tactic you want to defend?

HEADLINE: For Refugees, the Price of Dignity

BYLINE: TINA ROSENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: Helping refugees become established outside camps can offer them a dignified life while they are in exile.

 BODY:
Somalia is now suffering its worst drought in 60 years. A quarter of the population has fled famine and conflict, heading west into Kenya. More than 1,300 people a day stream into the complex of refugee camps at Dadaab, Kenya, which is now housing more than 430,000 people in camps designed for 90,000. Many Somalis arrive near death after journeys of weeks with little food. Large numbers of them are children, often without parents.

At Dadaab they receive food, medical care, basic shelter - the emergency relief they need. But they will probably spend years in that desolate grid of white tents, eating gruel that gets thinner toward the end of the month. The camp lacks the money to provide even subsistence rations. In exchange, the refugees give up their rights to move freely and to work.
The history of refugee camps tells us that they are likely to suffer cholera and other diseases and that rape and domestic violence are widespread. Refugees in Dadaab face lives of enforced idleness and dependency; children born there may grow up there. This is what we have come to expect for refugees: a place one step removed from hell.
Contrast Dadaab with the situation of the roughly 1.6 million Iraqi refugees in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. Instead of living in camps, they live in Damascus, Aleppo, Beirut and Amman. They get help from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, with an A.T.M. card that allows them to withdraw money every month. Some can work legally, but others work in the informal economy, as do locals.
They buy their own food and rent their own apartments. They use the local schools and health clinics. In areas where Iraqi refugees are concentrated enough to strain those services, the refugee agency spends money to refurbish and supply them, helping both the refugees and their neighbors.
Most Iraqi refugees are educated and middle class. They fled to relatively prosperous cities, and they get an unusually large amount of aid because of donations from the United States. They are in a very different position than the destitute Somali farmers.
But the policy of self-settlement outside camps has also been successful with the poor. Because it has shown results, it should be tried in a systemic way on a much larger scale - with Somali refugees, those now coming out of Syria and others who have already spent months or years in camps.
Sometimes it has been achieved through official policy, but more often by refugees on their own - they simply go where they want. If the United Nations refugee agency has programs to help them, they can register and get those services. But many simply choose to blend in with the local population. The vast majority of Angolans in Zambia and refugees in Uganda from South Sudan and elsewhere, for example, have chosen to avoid camps and live, without help, on their own; both cases are considered successful. In many countries, refugees can receive aid while living in cities or local villages. Self-settlement can allow refugees to acquire savings and skills that will make them more productive when they return home. (Refugee status is temporary. When their country is declared safe that status expires, and with it the right to stay in their country of asylum.)
The most vulnerable and weakest might prefer camps. But most refugees, given a chance, prefer self-reliance, said Jeff Crisp, the head of policy development and evaluation at the United Nations refugee agency.
The camp model began at the end of World War II as a way to provide temporary housing for the displaced. "Over the years, camps have become the standard response," Mr. Crisp said. "But they should be a last resort."
Most refugees in displaced persons camps after World War II were quickly repatriated or resettled. The official fiction is that refugees today can expect the same. It is not true; the United States State Department says that more than 10 million refugees - two thirds of the world's total - live in what is called "protracted refugee situations." In 1993, refugee-producing situations like famine or war lasted an average of nine years each. By 2003, the average length was 17 years. For all their flaws, camps have persisted for powerful reasons. They are the most effective way to provide emergency aid to a vast number of people - Dadaab is saving hundreds of thousands of lives. The problem comes later; once built and populated, camps stay.
Vast bureaucracies and networks of aid workers now revolve around camps, where refugees and their plight can easily be made visible. Most crucial, the countries that host refugees prefer camps, and they have a veto. Host countries assume enormous and unfair burdens. Fewer than 7,000 Afghans have settled in the United States; over time Pakistan has hosted five million. Camps are built in the middle of nowhere so they can keep refugees away from local society, which is what host governments demand.
Camps also ensure that the refugees will be the United Nations refugee agency's problem. Wealthy countries might promise to pay the costs of helping refugees outside camps, but host governments don't believe them, said Lavinia Limon, president of the United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, which has led the campaign to end what it calls the "warehousing" of refugees. "Host countries often say that the idea of self-settlement is a plot to have refugees integrated into society and disappear, sticking the local government with the bill," she said.
Iraqi refugees managed to avoid being settled in camps because many had left for Amman and Damascus before camps were even considered. Nor did the United States want to call attention to the fact that 40 percent of Iraq's professional class had fled.
The world has taken notice of the policy's success. In 2009, the refugee agency decided to help in urban areas, but host countries have resisted. Self-settlement would almost certainly cost less than camps: help would merely supplement what refugees earn, and there would be no need to feed them or build complex infrastructure.
It is a cruel irony that host governments have an interest in camps being miserable - on the theory that the worse off the refugees are, the more likely they are to return home. But it's not clear that people in camps are more likely to repatriate than those who self-settle. The Committee for Refugees and Immigrants argues that refugees should be able to go where they want. They would get some special services - counseling, support groups, drop-in centers. But they would use the same schools and health clinics as the local population. The government would send the bill to donors and with that money expand and improve those schools and clinics. Donors would also pay nongovernmental groups to run projects - microcredit, for example - that would help refugees and their hosts.
A State Department official said that American humanitarian aid is doing this in several countries - notably in Pakistan. It is not easy work; in many cases a refugee becomes just one more resident of vast urban slums, and development projects in poor countries do not have a perfect record.
But it is at least the sort of help that offers a chance to produce something lasting; merely keeping people barely alive year after year does not.

HEADLINE: Jobs Report Preview

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: On Friday the Labor Department will release its first estimate for the number of jobs created in the United States in August, and right now expectations are low.

 BODY:
On Friday morning, the Labor Department will release its first estimate for the number of jobs created in the United States in August, and right now expectations are low.
Wall Street analysts have a median forecast of just a 60,000 net gain in nonfarm payroll jobs, about half of the gain from July. The unemployment rate -- which comes from a different survey, and reflects the share of people who want work and are actively looking for it but can't find a job -- is expected to remain 9.1 percent.
To put this in perspective, the United States generally needs to add about 150,000 jobs each month just to keep up with the growth in the working-age population.
These are among the factors that economists are citing for their weak forecasts:

        
The latest consumer confidence survey from the Conference Board showed a sharp drop in perceptions of job availability, back to the lowest level since 2009.

        
A survey from the Institute for Supply Management showed a decline in manufacturing hiring.

        
Layoff announcements have been higher in the last two months than they were earlier this year, according to a recent Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

        
The recent strike by 45,000 Verizon workers occurred during the week that the Labor Department collects data on employment, and so that may be reflected in the employment and unemployment numbers.

        
Layoffs by state and local governments are continuing.
Even if the numbers come in just as expected, economists will be scouring the report for any signs of what lies ahead. 
Here are some details to keep an eye on:

        
What's happening to the length of the workweek? The workweek has averaged 34.3 hours for the two previous months. Economists are expecting it to remain unchanged in August. A slight change, though, would give a sense of whether employers are thinking of expanding or shrinking their staffs, since they usually change hours before making the bigger commitment to hire or fire.

        
How much are average hourly earnings changing? The consensus forecast is that wages will rise 0.2 percent, after having risen 0.4 percent in July. Wage fluctuations can be important for consumer spending, which drives the economy. Recent surveys have found that consumers have very low expectations for income increases in the next few months.

        
Finally, are more people dropping out of the work force? The share of working-age Americans who are either working or looking for work has been dropping to record lows. In July, this labor force participation rate was just 63.9 percent, the lowest share since 1984, when there were many fewer women in the work force. Some of the recent decline in the participation rate reflects the retirement of boomers, but it also means many workers are just giving up. This is a bad sign for the future health of the economy, especially if giving up on looking for work now means giving up forever, which it does for many older workers.

HEADLINE: Deputy Mayor Was Arrested Before He Resigned

BYLINE: MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: The Bloomberg administration said that Stephen Goldsmith was leaving "to pursue private-sector opportunities in infrastructure finance." But just days before his resignation, he had spent two days in jail on a domestic violence arrest.

 BODY:
Updated, 2:43 p.m. | A powerful aide to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg resigned from City Hall because he was arrested in Washington for his role in a heated altercation with his wife, according to a person familiar with the account.
Stephen Goldsmith, who oversaw the city's most visible agencies as Mr. Bloomberg's deputy mayor for operations, was arrested in his town house on July 30 and spent two days in a Washington jail - a series of events that Mr. Goldsmith reported to City Hall almost immediately.
But when the Bloomberg administration announced Mr. Goldsmith's resignation five days later, the mayor's office said that the deputy mayor was leaving the administration "to pursue private-sector opportunities in infrastructure finance." 
Pressed about why City Hall did not disclose the arrest of a high-ranking administration official or the reason for Mr. Goldsmith's resignation, a deputy mayor, Howard Wolfson, declined to comment.
The arrest was first reported on Thursday in The New York Post.
Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, strongly criticized the Bloomberg administration for not disclosing the arrest.
"The mayor and his staff should give a full accounting of what they knew and when they knew it," Mr. Stringer said, noting that Mr. Goldsmith oversaw local law enforcement agencies "that routinely confront the issues of domestic violence."
"No comment," Mr. Stringer said, "is not an acceptable response."
The public advocate, Bill de Blasio, also called for greater disclosure by the mayor's office.
"While Deputy Mayor Goldsmith's resignation was more than appropriate given the circumstances, New Yorkers deserve a full airing of the facts known to the administration," Mr. de Blasio said in a statement.
According to a report released by Washington's Metropolitan Police Department, Mr. Goldsmith's wife, Margaret, told the police "she got into a verbal altercation" with Mr. Goldsmith the night of July 30, and Mrs. Goldsmith told her husband, "I should have put a bullet through you years ago." Mr. Goldsmith then shoved Mrs. Goldsmith into a kitchen counter, she told the police.
At that point, according to the report, Mrs. Goldsmith said: "You're not going to do this to me again. I'm calling the police." Mr. Goldsmith "grabbed the phone ... and threw it onto the ground, breaking the phone" and then grabbed Mrs. Goldsmith and "refused to let her go," the report says.
Mrs. Goldsmith said she screamed, "Let me go, let me go," and dug her nails into her husband's forearms; when he released her, she ran to another room and called the police, the report says.
Mr. Goldsmith was arrested on a charge of "simple assault domestic violence."
Mr. Goldsmith, in a statement Thursday morning, confirmed his arrest, but denied any violence toward his wife.
"I offered my resignation in order not to be a distraction to the mayor," he said.
In the same statement, which is available below, Mr. Goldsmith's wife said that despite the language in the police report, "there was no violence nor any physical harm."
The police report, she said, "is a summary of what discussions occurred that evening in our home, and those comments have been misconstrued as well as taken out of context." She said that the arrest, which was required under Washington's domestic violence laws, "was made over my strong objections and numerous appeals to the officers."
Mr. Wolfson, deputy mayor for government affairs in the Bloomberg administration, said that City Hall did not "have anything to add to the Goldsmiths' account."
Mr. Goldsmith's 14-month tenure at City Hall was troubled from the start. He clashed with his fellow commissioners, upset municipal unions, and oversaw the city's widely criticized response to a blizzard last December.
Mr. Goldsmith, 64, who split his time between New York and Washington over the last year, had previously served as a two-term mayor of Indianapolis in the 1990s. There, he gained a reputation as a wonkish reformer who emphasized outsourcing traditional public functions to private industry.
He has written several books on government innovation, tracts that helped land him a academic post at Harvard University, where he worked until Mr. Bloomberg recruited him to work at City Hall.
An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that it was Mr. Goldsmith who told his wife that he "should have put a bullet" through her years ago, according to a police report.

HEADLINE: 3 Questions on Financial Stability

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: The council set up under the Dodd-Frank Act to guard against systemic risk should look at two impending mergers, risks posed by Bank of America, and bank capitalization generally, an economist writes.

 BODY:
The Dodd-Frank financial legislation of 2010 created a Financial Stability Oversight Council, tasked with taking an integrated view of risks in and around the financial sector in the United States. Known as the FSoc (pronounced EFF-sock), the council comprises all leading regulators and other responsible officials, headed by the Treasury secretary.
So far, it has done little -- reflecting the predominant official view that in the post-crisis recovery phase, financial risks in the United States are generally receding.
But three important and related issues emerged this summer that the FSoc needs to consider quickly: impending bank mergers that could create two more too-big-to-fail banks; whether to force the breakup of Bank of America; and how to rethink capital requirements for large systemically important banks, particularly as continuing European sovereign debt problems undermine the credibility of the international Basel Committee approach to bank capital.
On the merger front, Capital One plans to buy the online business of ING, and PNC is acquiring the American business of Royal Bank of Canada. Both acquisitions would create banks with assets around $300 billion. (Steven Pearlstein had a very good column in The Washington Post on Sunday on the background to these deals.)
In some official minds, Dodd-Frank has made it impossible for too-big-to-fail banks to exist -- if any such bank got into trouble, it would be shut down without any significant costs being incurred by taxpayers. Most independent analysts and many people active in financial markets regard this proposition as unproven at best and, most likely, incorrect.

For example, in a new working paper, "Too-Systemic-to-Fail: What Option Markets Imply About Sector-Wide Government Guarantees," Bryan T. Kelly, Hanno Lustig and Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh compare the price of put options (i.e., the option to sell and therefore lock in a price) for the financial sector stock index relative to put options on individual banks' stocks (Disclosure: I'm a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, which published this paper, and co-director of its Africa Project but had nothing to do with this paper).
Put options are cheaper if they are less valuable to investors as protection against price collapses, and the index puts are a lot cheaper than the appropriately weighted sum of put options on individual bank stocks, particularly during the recent financial crisis.
The authors infer that "investors price in substantial government bailout guarantees for the financial sector as a whole" -- thus the index puts are cheap, because you don't need to insure privately against overall collapse -- with around half of the market value of the financial sector during 2003-9 accounted for by collective bailout guarantees. No other sector in the United States economy gets anything like this kind of insurance.
At the same time, the researchers point out that the government does not eliminate all idiosyncratic company-specific risk; this is why put options on individual companies stocks are relatively more valuable. In a sense this message is encouraging, because it suggests some specific companies can fail or otherwise go out of business.
But presumably, at critical moments specific megabanks have a particular and complete kind of downside protection. It's hard to envisage the potential failure of a $2 trillion bank like Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase or Bank of America without systemwide adverse consequences.
The first question for the FSoc is therefore: Wouldn't allowing mergers by Capital One and ING and by PNC and Royal Bank of Canada create financial companies whose potential risk is more likely to be systemic?
The largest financial institution allowed to fail without a bailout since the collapse of Lehman Brothers was CIT Group, which had a balance sheet of around $80 billion. Perhaps Capital One and PNC are already too big to fail; PNC is No. 12 and Capital One is No. 13 on the official list of bank holding companies, ranked by assets as of June 30.
We don't know where the critical cutoff is -- and perhaps more studies along the lines of the work by Professors Kelly, Lustig and Nieuwerburgh would be helpful, or the FSoc could find another way to make a reasonable and fact-based determination.
But what really matters is what could happen in future systemic crises, and this is very hard to predict. So why not err on the side of caution and keep large banks from becoming bigger through merging? Or the FSoc could require these merging banks to demonstrate that they will generate social value commensurate with or in excess of the extra social risks that they are creating.
The second question is closely related: Why not break up Bank of America? The Dodd-Frank legislative process ended up rejecting the idea that existing banks, as of 2010, should be broken up -- as long as they continue to operate in a reasonable and sustainable fashion. But the legislative intent was also clear with regard to big banks that are in trouble: There should be preemptive action, either through pressing bank management or, if that doesn't work, through regulator-imposed requirements.
These requirements can include making the bank smaller, simpler and less systemic - in other words making sure that any kind of future "resolution" or "intervention" for that bank (both euphemisms for a form of bankruptcy) would not be a systemic event.
If Bank of America were to fail today, it would create a systemic problem and presumably set off some sort of desperate policy reaction. The bank is the largest bank-holding company in the United States, with assets at the end of June of more than $2.26 trillion.
If Bank of America is forced to divest various activities, like those it bought from Merrill Lynch, that would not eliminate systemic risk. But it would make this one troubled institution less central to the economy, and, if handled properly, less of a brake on economic recovery.
This raises the third and arguably most important question: Why not increase capital requirements further for systemically important financial institutions?
Warren Buffett's agreement last week to invest in Bank of America has highlighted the lack of capital, at least at that one bank: It has too little equity relative to its debts, hence the need for Mr. Buffett.
But Mr. Buffett, it now appears, is getting cumulative preferred stock -- so he gets a guaranteed dividend before any common-stock holders get a return. This makes sense for him, without question. And his holding is loss-absorbing, in the sense that his equity would be wiped out before there was any question of defaulting on money owed to any creditors.
This is presumably the best that Bank of America could do in terms of raising capital through the market. But it should not be enough from the perspective of FSoc, which is charged with overall responsibility for systemic risks.
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has proposed a methodology for systemically important institutions, but it rests on a very weak analytical basis, as Americans for Financial Reform pointed out in a recent letter. The FSoc would be making a very bad mistake if it continued to follow the European lead that set the lowest common denominator at Basel.
The evident capital problems of European banks, and the way this will slow growth, were flagged at the Jackson Hole, Wyo., meeting of policy makers last week by Christine Lagarde, the new managing director of the International Monetary Fund and, until recently, finance minister of France (see this assessment by Felix Salmon). The FSoc should listen to her warnings and think about what this means for American banks.
If the Dodd-Frank legislation is to have lasting impact, the FSoc needs to establish itself as a meaningful overseer of systemic financial risks. It needs to meet and deliberate in an open and transparent manner. It should confront pressing questions of systemic risk head on, being clear about the analytical basis for its decisions. Business as usual is a recipe for disaster -- in the United States, as in Europe.

HEADLINE: Franken Pursues Tighter Oversight of Rating Agencies

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Senator Al Franken takes aim at "the conflict of interest that's inherent in the system" in the credit rating agencies' business model.

 BODY:
The Dodd-Frank Act cracked down on the credit rating agencies, the firms that awarded rosy ratings to bonds backed by junky mortgages, but some lawmakers and consumer advocates contend that the regulatory overhaul falls short. 
A spate of new Dodd-Frank rules for the rating agencies "doesn't really respond to the conflict of interest that's inherent in the system," Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, said Thursday.
Critics like Mr. Franken argue that the rating agencies' business model is innately compromised. Banks and corporations that issue debt pay the rating agencies to assign their bonds a letter grade. In the lead up to the financial crisis, the critics say, the rating agencies sacrificed the integrity of their ratings to increase their bottom lines. 
At the time, the rating agencies blessed many subprime mortgage bonds with the highly coveted triple-A rating. When the investments soured, it set off a chain reaction that nearly toppled the economy. 
When Congress was debating Dodd-Frank, some lawmakers floated the idea of scrapping the so-called issuer-pays model altogether. Mr. Franken proposed creating an independent body, perhaps a public utility or self-regulatory organization, that would randomly assign ratings to different agencies.
"This is not a progressive or conservative idea -- it's a common-sense idea," Mr. Franken said on a conference call with reporters, hosted by Americans for Financial Reform, a consumer advocacy group. "Instead of pay-to-play, we'd switch to pay-for-perform."
But during the final days of negotiations over Dodd-Frank, amid fierce lobbying by the rating agencies, lawmakers abandoned the plan. Instead, they reached a compromise, requiring the Securities and Exchange Commission to study the feasibility of using an independent body to assign ratings. 
Mr. Franken vowed to "hold the S.E.C.'s feet to the fire" when the study is released. 
The S.E.C., meanwhile, has proposed several new rules to tighten its oversight of the rating agencies. Under Dodd-Frank, the S.E.C. has moved to strip references to credit ratings from dozens of regulations, some of them decades old, including rules that govern securities offerings. In May, regulators also unveiled 500 pages of proposed rules that, for instance, would prohibit analysts from issuing ratings if they also separately marketed their rating agency's products or services.
"These rules are intended to help investors and other users of credit ratings better understand and assess the ratings," Mary L. Schapiro, chairwoman of the S.E.C., said at the time. 
But Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America, likened the rules to the "Chinese restaurant approach to reform," offering a smattering of options but no comprehensive overhaul. 
"The commission has proposed simply to do," she said on the conference call, what the rating agencies "already claim to be doing."

HEADLINE: Bearing the Brunt of the New Mortgage Cap

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: A relatively small number of counties will be affected the most by a change in federal mortgage rules.

 BODY:
The pending end of federal guarantees for pricey mortgages will probably have the greatest effect on borrowers in counties in just a few states, an analysis by the real estate site Zillow finds.
The change on Oct. 1 will affect fewer than 2 percent of the total mortgage applications in the United States, Zillow estimated. But, while applications in just 250 of the roughly 3,000 counties nationwide will be affected, certain counties -- in California, Virginia and Washington State, for instance -- will bear the brunt. "While the impact of the changing loan limits is relatively small in aggregate," wrote Svenja Gudell, Zillow's senior economist, "there are some larger local impacts where individual counties could be harder hit."
In San Juan County in Washington State, for instance, an estimated 20 percent of submitted loan requests will no longer be eligible for lower interest rates. Instead, they would be categorized as "jumbo" loans, and subject to higher rates. The percentage is about 17 percent in Monterey County, Calif., followed by roughly 14 percent in San Mateo and San Francisco Counties, and about 12 percent in Arlington County, Va., Zillow found. To arrive at its estimates, Zillow analyzed more than 830,000 applications to its mortgage marketplace during the 12 months ending in August.
The limit for a government-insured loan is $417,000 in most parts of the country. Loans above that limit have generally been considered "nonconforming" or "jumbo" loans, and carried a higher interest rate to reflect their higher risk. But for the last three years, due to housing market turmoil, the government raised the conforming loan limit to as much as $729,750 in areas with very high home prices. The move created a new, middle tier of loans (Zillow calls them "expanded conforming loans") that were eligible for government backing but, in practice, still subject to slightly higher interest rates.
Now, a change in the government's formula that takes effect Oct. 1 will lower the maximum loan to $625,500. (A front-page storydiscussed the issue in May, and explained how the change might affect a hypothetical borrower.) That means borrowers will either have to make a larger down payment, to bring the loan below the new limit, or pay a higher interest rate, Zillow said.
Zillow also estimated how many properties in those 250 counties that could currently be financed with an "expanded conforming" loan won't be able to be financed that way as of Oct. 1. (The analysis is based on Zillow's estimate of the home's current value and assumes a 20 percent down payment. The study included the roughly 1 million homes in Zillow's database.)
About 2.5 percent of homes in those counties are affected, Zillow says, which represents less than 1 percent of homes nationally. The results are similar to the mortgage application results, although the analysis also shows significant effects in some counties in Florida, New York and Massachusetts. There are a few differences, though. In Summit County, Utah, for instance, Zillow found that just 1.3 percent of mortgage requests would be affected by the change, but that nearly 10 percent of the houses in the county, "if sold, would now have to be financed by a jumbo loan. "
Are you trying to finance the purchase of a house? Has the change in conforming loan limits affected your purchase?

HEADLINE: Justice Dept.'s Key Officials in Pursuing AT&T Suit

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Christine A. Varney and James M. Cole presided over the government's decision to block the planned merger of AT&#038;T and T-Mobile.

 BODY:
The names of 25 government lawyers are listed on the last page of the Justice Department's lawsuit seeking to block the proposed $39 billion merger between AT&T and T-Mobile USA.
But two senior lawyers who played crucial roles in bringing the lawsuit are nowhere to be found on the complaint.
Christine A. Varney, the government's former top antitrust lawyer, oversaw the investigation into the planned merger until July, when she said she was leaving the Justice Department to join the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore. When she departed, the investigation was in its final stages but the government had not yet decided to bring a lawsuit.
And James M. Cole, the No. 2 official in the Justice Department, made the ultimate decision to bring what is the Obama administration's most significant antitrust enforcement action to date. He announced the lawsuit at a news conference Wednesday, one of his more prominent public appearances since he assumed the post in January.
"The leadership transition has been seamless, and the right decision was reached in this case," Mr. Cole said before he introduced Sharis A. Pozen, the acting head of the antitrust unit. "We are seeking to block this deal in order to maintain a vibrant and competitive marketplace."
When Ms. Varney announced her departure, some lawmakers and consumer advocates had expressed disappointment that the Obama administration had not been tougher in antitrust. Instead of bringing legal actions, the division approved a number of large mergers, including Comcast and NBC Universal, as long as the companies made certain concessions.
And the Federal Trade Commission, which also has antitrust oversight, stole some of the Justice Department's thunder in starting an investigation into whether Google had engaged in anticompetitive practices.
The legal action against AT&T appeared to ease the concerns of antitrust enforcement advocates.
Ms. Varney had been skeptical of the T-Mobile acquisition since it was announced in March, said two people familiar with her thinking who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case.
"Christine Varney set the table for this decision," said Bert Foer, the president of the American Antitrust Institute. "We are delighted that the administration is committed to the vigorous use of antitrust even at a time of economic difficulties."
President Obama's appointment of Ms. Varney in January 2009 was seen as a step toward fulfilling his vow to "reinvigorate antitrust enforcement." He had also criticized what he said was the Bush administration's weak record in challenging mergers and failing to bring monopolization cases.
Ms. Varney was a Clinton administration antitrust veteran, having served as a former commissioner at the F.T.C. She joined the Obama White House from the Washington law firm of Hogan & Hartson, where she focused on antitrust work.
One of Ms. Varney's first moves was to name as her deputy Ms. Pozen, a fellow antitrust lawyer at Hogan & Hartson and former colleague at the F.T.C. When Ms. Varney left the Justice Department, Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general, named Ms. Pozen as her temporary replacement. Ms. Pozen and another government lawyer, Joseph F. Wayland, led the decision to sue AT&T.
Ms. Pozen then took the case up the Justice Department's chain of command. Mr. Holder had recused himself from the investigation for unspecified reasons, so the final decision fell to Mr. Cole.
Mr. Cole, who wears a mustache like his boss, joined the Justice Department last December from the law firm Bryan Cave, where he was a white-collar defense lawyer.
Jumping between government service and private practice throughout his career, Mr. Cole, 59, is a longtime friend of Mr. Holder. The two worked together in the Justice Department earlier in their careers.
His confirmation as deputy attorney general was a bumpy one. It was delayed in the Senate in part because lawmakers expressed concern over his role as the independent monitor for the American International Group in the years leading up to the $182 billion bailout of the insurance giant. Mr. Cole's work did not involve many of the issues at the center of A.I.G.'s collapse, including credit-default swaps.
As for Ms. Varney, she has moved to New York, where she starts her job at Cravath on Tuesday. She will advise the law firm's clients on antitrust issues related to mergers.
Under government ethics rules, Ms. Varney is banned for two years from appearing in any matter before the Justice Department. And she is permanently prohibited from working on anything related to the AT&T and T-Mobile deal, though at the moment Cravath is not involved in the case.

HEADLINE: Obama Backs Bill Barring Discrimination Against Jobless

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The president has said hiring practices that exclude applicants who were not already employed should be outlawed.

 BODY:
We've writtenbeforeabout job ads and hiring practices that exclude unemployed candidates from applying. Mitchell Hirsch, an associate at the National Employment Law Project, recently alerted me that President Obama had expressed support for outlawing such practices.
From an interview with the president on the Tom Joyner Morning Show, a national radio program, which aired on Tuesday:
Well, there is no doubt that folks who have been unemployed longer than six months have a tougher time getting back into the job market. Now, the single most important thing we can do is just have the economy strong so that employers aren't as choosy because they've got to hire because their businesses are expanding.
But we have seen instances in which employers are explicitly saying we don't want to take a look at folks who've been unemployed. Well, that makes absolutely no sense, and I know there's legislation that I'm supportive of that says you cannot discriminate against folks because they've been unemployed, particularly when you've seen so many folks who, through no fault of their own, ended up being laid off because of the difficulty of this recession.
Mr. Obama appears to be referring to this bill, introduced by Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Scheduling Conflict

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner quibbled not over the economy but their calendars on Wednesday.

 BODY:
Today's Times:

        
Signaling that lawmakers may not be in an accommodating mood when they return from August recess, Speaker John A. Boehner rejected President Obama's request to address a joint session of Congress next Wednesday, the same night as the next Republican presidential debate, Helene Cooper and Jackie Calmes report. After what turned into a very public game of chicken, the White House agreed to schedule the president's much-anticipated speech on the economy for next Thursday instead.

        
The Justice Department sued to stop the merger of two of the largest wireless phone carriers on Wednesday, blocking a move it contends would hamper competition, Edward Wyatt reports. The companies and some labor unions say the $39 billion merger between AT&T and T-Mobile USA would not kill jobs, as the Justice Department argued.

        
Positioning himself as the moderate outlier in the Republican presidential field, Jon M. Huntsman Jr. called for purging the tax code of loopholes and deductions on Wednesday, Ashley Parker reports. Fellow Republicans in Congress have resisted such moves, characterizing them as tax increases.

        
Sarah Palin is bound for Iowa and New Hampshire over the Labor Day weekend, Michael D. Shear reports. Is it a clue that she's running for president or further proof that she's just enjoying the attention that follows wherever she goes?
Around the Web:

        
President Clooney? Definitely not, Politico reports. George Clooney, who directed and stars in "The Ides of March," a political thriller that comes out in October, said he had no interest in the highest office. "Why would anybody volunteer for that job?" he said.
Washington Happenings:

        
On Thursday, the Labor Department releases its weekly report on jobless claims.

        
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut independent who is chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, gives the keynote address at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism's event on the 10 years since 9/11.

HEADLINE: Boehner to Address Jobs a Week After Obama

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: Speaker John A. Boehner will offer a Republican perspective on jobs and the economy a week after President Obama presents his plan to Congress.

 BODY:
Exactly one week after President Obama delivers his (rescheduled) speech to Congress, Speaker John A. Boehner of the House of Representatives is slated to address the Economic Club of Washington, D.C.
Mr. Boehner's office would say only that the topic would be "jobs and economic growth." However, if this speech is anything like the one he gave to the Economic Club of New York in May, it could be a preview of the legislative wrangling to come.
During his May 9 remarks in Manhattan, Mr. Boehner said that Republicans would agree to increase the federal debt limit only in exchange for trillions in spending cuts - at the time, his most specific outline of G.O.P. demands to date.
Nearly three months later, Republicans held fast to their demands, finally reaching an agreement just under the Treasury Department's deadline for avoiding a credit crisis.

HEADLINE: In Flap Over Obama Speech, a Clear Winner

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: The winner of a spat between President Obama and the House speaker may be the sponsors of a presidential debate.

 BODY:
 While the political world ponders the ultimate loser in Wednesday's back-and-forth between the White House and the speaker's office over when President Obama could deliver his jobs speech, the real winner may be the NBC News/Politico debate itself.
 Mr. Obama originally asked Congress for permission to give his jobs address before a joint session next Wednesday night, the same evening a debate for Republican presidential candidates was scheduled at the Reagan Library in California. The House speaker, John A. Boehner, countered by offering the following night, and several hours later, the president relented to the new date. But while the Beltway game of political chicken was going on, the Republican debate - the first one to feature Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who is leading in several nation polls - gained some welcomed publicity.
 "We are thrilled at how the confluence of events has raised the profile -- and raised the stakes -- for the whole week," said John Harris, the editor in chief of Politico, a sponsor of the debate. "It's clear for several reasons -- including the fact that this is Governor Perry's first debate, and the way the Obama speech had intensified national attention on the economy -- that this will be a very consequential event."
 An official with the other debate sponsor concurred.
 "Clearly, you can't buy this kind of promotion for a debate," said an insider at NBC News who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 But if the Republican debate has landed some extra attention, so has Mr. Obama, and not necessarily the kind he was hoping for.
 "Desperate political times called for desperate political measures from President Obama," said Tim Miller, a spokesman for Jon M. Huntsman Jr.'s campaign. "It was more political theatrics to distract from the fact that the president doesn't have a plan to fix the economy."
 The Romney campaign also took the opportunity to criticize the president as the whole affair was unfolding and before the White House moved the speech to next Thursday. "Next Wednesday night TV viewers will have a choice between Republican candidates talking about the future of America, or Barack Obama talking about the future of his presidency." (The choice, the campaign's statement seemed to imply, was obvious).
 Though the president's address will no longer be competing with the Republican debate, which is will be airing on MSNBC next Wednesday at 8 p.m. Eastern, the Romney campaign said that the original thought remained the same.

HEADLINE: Ad by Group Supporting Bachmann Assails Perry

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: An ad by a group supporting Michele Bachmann takes aim at Rick Perry's years as Texas governor and signals the emergence of super PACs in the coming ad wars.

 BODY:
7:45 p.m. | Updated When Representative Michele Bachmann hits the campaign trail, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. 
Mrs. Bachmann never mentions her rival Mr. Perry, who in a matter of weeks since he entered the Republican race for the 2012 nomination has captured a fair share of her Tea Party base.
But a political action committee that supports Mrs. Bachmann is not nearly so discreet. An advertisement it has created attacks Mr. Perry for raising spending in Texas and borrowing to cover deficits. "There is an honest conservative,'' the ad concludes, "and she's not Rick Perry.''
Bob Harris, a founder of Keep Conservatives United, an independent group that created the spot, said it will begin airing Wednesday on television stations in South Carolina. The ad opens with an image of Gov. Perry in a cowboy hat and the question, "Tea Party Guy?'' 
Mr. Harris, who said he has no connection with the Bachmann campaign, said he acted because Mr. Perry had upstaged Mrs. Bachmann's victory in the much-watched Iowa straw poll Aug. 13. "He hurt her momentum coming out of Iowa, and I don't think anyone responded to it until now,'' he said. 
Mr. Perry's campaign hit back hard Thursday afternoon, disputing point by point what it called false claims in the ad. "Gov. Perry is a proven fiscal conservative,'' his spokesman, Ray Sullivan, said in a statement. 
The ad asserts that state spending in Texas doubled since Mr. Perry became governor in 2000. 
The governor's campaign responded that the state budget passed for the for the two-year period 2012-13 is $80.5 billion, up from $55.7 billion in 2000-01. But those figures, it said, are not adjusted for inflation and population growth.
The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that using adjusted figures, state spending under Mr. Perry has increased 4.2 percent every two years, faster than inflation and population increases -- but the portion of the budget over which the governor has most influence, general revenue spending, did fall over the past decade, adjusted for inflation and population growth.
The attack ad is evidence that the Republican race is entering a new phase as the field -- particularly the most conservative candidates all seeking Tea Party support -- attempt to sharp draw distinction with their rivals. The sparks will no doubt continue flying when Mr. Perry makes his first appearance in a national debate of the candidates Sept. 7.
The ad is also a sign of things to come, as such so-called super PACs, which can raise unlimited funds, ramp up their activity and begin spending the millions of dollars they have already raised for this presidential campaign.

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Despite disruptions from Hurricane Irene and signs of a slowing economy, Americans bought more cars in August.
General Motors, the Ford Motor Company and Chrysler all posted impressive gains from a year earlier in their August data released on Thursday. Industrywide, sales rose 7.5 percent from a year ago and 1.2 percent from July, according to the Autodata Corporation, which tracks auto sales.
''Consumers are getting used to making these big-ticket item purchase decisions in an everlasting, chaotic, uncertain economic environment,'' said Jesse Toprak, vice president for industry trends and insight at TrueCar.com, an automotive research firm. ''We're seeing more and more consumers becoming relatively comfortable in pulling the trigger when they don't have all the answers.'' 
Almost all of the 20 largest automakers have sales gains for the year to date. The only exceptions are Honda and Toyota, whose dealers have struggled to keep their lots stocked sufficiently since the earthquake and tsunami struck Japan early this year. Honda's sales in the United States fell 24.3 percent last month from August 2010, and Toyota's sales declined 12.7 percent.
Shortages of some small, fuel-efficient cars hindered other carmakers as well.
G.M. sales rose 18 percent, and Ford reported an 11.1 percent increase. But both companies are having trouble keeping up with demand for their respective compact cars, the Chevrolet Cruze and Ford Focus, among other models.
G.M. is adding overtime shifts to the Ohio plant that builds the Cruze, and Ford said it is stepping up overall production by 9 percent in the fourth quarter from what it was at the end of 2010. Sales of the Focus, which was redesigned for the 2012 model year, declined 8.9 percent in August despite increased demand for vehicles of its size.
The auto industry continues to make big strides in recovery from the depths of the financial crisis. Sales of autos are on track to be well ahead of last year, when 11.6 million vehicles were sold in the United States. G.M. said it remains confident that industry sales will top 13 million vehicles this year, even though several analysts have recently chopped their projections. At G.M.'s projected rate, sales would be roughly back to their 2008 level, when 13.2 million were sold in the United States.
''Consumers are being cautious, and appropriately so, but they are not retrenching,'' said Don Johnson, G.M.'s vice president for United States sales operations, on a conference call. ''All indications to us are that the industry is going to slowly grow for the rest of this year.''
But Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, questioned whether G.M. is ''playing chicken'' with the economy by maintaining or increasing production even as consumer confidence levels slide. G.M. ''could get caught out with large production cuts and/or price discounting should the underlying market not recover as G.M. appears to have anticipated,'' Mr. Jonas wrote in a report Thursday afternoon.
Ford officials said the company is not stockpiling extra inventory in preparation for a possible strike by the United Automobile Workers union, a typical practice for the Detroit carmakers during past negotiations. U.A.W. members have been overwhelmingly voting this week in favor of authorizing a strike against Ford if contract talks break down.
Labor experts say a strike against Ford is unlikely, but union leaders have been urging workers to approve an authorization as a bargaining tool. At least 98 percent of workers have voted in favor of authorizing a strike at large U.A.W. locals in Chicago, Cleveland, Louisville and Kansas City, Mo. Voting is scheduled to finish Friday. Ford is the only Detroit carmaker whose workers can strike over wages and benefits. G.M. and Chrysler employees agreed to no-strike clauses as part of concessionary deals they approved before those companies' bankruptcies in 2009.
Chrysler said its August sales rose 30.6 percent, including a 58 percent increase for its Jeep brand of sport utility vehicles. It was the 17th consecutive month of year-over-year increases for Chrysler, which is gathering momentum after being written off by many critics. The company outsold Toyota by 636 vehicles, the third time this year that Chrysler has topped its larger, but injured, Japanese rival.
Nissan, which was able to return to normal production levels much faster that Honda and Toyota, reported a 19.2 percent gain. Nissan ran ads last month juxtaposing the abundance of inventory at its dealerships with bare Honda showrooms.
Sales rose 9.1 percent at Hyundai and 26.9 percent at Kia.
Consumer confidence has slipped recently, and economic growth has been crimped by the persistent European debt crisis and the debate in Washington over how to cut spending by the federal government.
As August began, markets swooned with uncertainty over whether Congress would lift the debt ceiling and with the subsequent cut in the nation's credit rating. The month ended with much of the East Coast focused more on Hurricane Irene than on buying a new car. In addition, some shoppers probably stayed on the sidelines in the hopes of getting a good deal during the coming holiday weekend, said Jeff Schuster, executive director of global forecasting at J.D. Power and Associates.
''We did see things get a little bit weaker as we got into the second half of the month,'' Mr. Schuster said. ''Many buyers are still conditioned to the strong Labor Day sales, so we could have seen some buyers pull back their purchase decisions waiting for some deals.''
From January through July, industry sales rose 10.9 percent. Excluding the 7.1 percent decline at Toyota and 2.6 percent decline at Honda, the industry gain was 16.6 percent in the period.
Nissan pulled further ahead of G.M. last month in the battle between the Leaf electric car and the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid. Leaf sales for the month were 1,362, more than quadruple the Volt's 302. Since they were introduced late last year, the Leaf has outsold the Volt by two to one.
G.M. halted production of the Volt this summer to retool in preparation for an large increase in production and said it is still working to build enough inventory to meet demand. It has promised significantly higher Volt sales in the months ahead.
''Every unit that we ship right now is presold,'' said Alan Batey, the head of Chevrolet sales in the United States. ''It's essentially a magnet for us. It's doing a wonderful job for the brand.''

HEADLINE: In Japan, A Tenuous Vow to Cut

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- As Japan's fiscally conservative finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda long sounded the alarm on the nation's ballooning government debt. It is more than twice the size of its $5 trillion economy -- and rated more risky than that of Italy and Spain.
Now, after Mr. Noda was elected Japan's prime minister this week in response to the nation's natural and nuclear disasters, the question is whether he can administer his prescription: raise taxes while reining in spending.
''We will no longer spend wastefully as if we are pouring buckets of water into a sieve,'' Mr. Noda declared in a speech on Monday just before Japan's ruling Democratic Party elevated him to the top job.
But that political resolve could prove hard to sustain -- and not simply because of the systemic weaknesses that have resulted in six prime ministers in the last five years. 
This is a country that was already addicted to its public spending, even before the huge needs of the postquake reconstruction. The last time the Japanese government ran a budget surplus was in 1992, almost two decades ago. Tax income now covers less than half of Japan's annual budget.
Mr. Noda's call for fiscal restraint is timely, given the global context. Last month, the ratings agency Standard & Poor's stripped the United States of its top credit ranking, saying political paralysis in Washington was making the country less creditworthy. In Europe, bond investors make daily sport of handicapping the relative risks of the debt loads shouldered by members of the euro monetary union.
''Sovereign risk is spreading to, and starting to engulf, large economies that were previously unaffected,'' Hideo Kumao, chief economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, said in a recent research note.
For years, Japan has managed its gargantuan debt load, and bond buyers have been willing to lend the government money at some of the world's lowest interest rates. But for various reasons -- including that low tax rate and Japan's aging, shrinking population -- the borrowing binge is looking unsustainable.
On July 23, Moody's Investors Service lowered Japan's credit rating by one notch, to a level two grades below the top rating, saying weak prospects for economic growth, as well as its recent disasters, made it difficult for the government to tackle its debt.
In the near term, though, Mr. Noda's government has little choice but to spend on postquake reconstruction. The government estimates that losses could reach as much as 20 trillion yen ($260 billion) just for the natural disasters, excluding costs from the continuing nuclear crisis at Fukushima.
That means spending on a scale unprecedented even for Japan, whose decades of public works projects are a big reason that the national debt is expected to reach 228 percent of its gross domestic product this year. That is far higher than even debt-saddled Italy, at 118 percent, and the United States, at 92 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund.
And in trying to raise taxes, Mr. Noda must contend with a painful historical precedent: an increase in the consumption tax meant to help finance rebuilding after the 1995 earthquake in Kobe snuffed out a nascent economic recovery. The consumption tax has not been raised since.
That is probably why in his speech on Monday, he shied away from using the word ''tax'' entirely. ''If there is a revenue shortfall, we may have to ask the public for help,'' was the closest he ventured.
The precarious standing of the ruling Democratic Party, whose ratings have slumped after two unpopular prime ministers, has made politicians adverse to any move that might anger voters.
A particular headache for Mr. Noda is a party heavyweight who has turned rebel: Ichiro Ozawa, a longtime advocate of robust government spending to prop up growth, and a fierce opponent of raising taxes.
Mr. Ozawa backed the second-place candidate in the party ballot, and to appease him Mr. Noda is expected to tone down the fiscal hawkishness and hand out cabinet posts to some of Mr. Ozawa's allies. The new cabinet may be named as soon as Friday in Tokyo.
''We expect that, unless economic uncertainty is wiped out completely, a tax rate increase will be quite difficult next year to finance reconstruction projects,'' said Masaaki Kanno, an economist for JPMorgan Securities.
Why does Japan's debt burden matter? After all, despite Japan's highest debt-to-gross-domestic- product ratio, and less-than-stellar debt ratings -- a couple rungs below even the downgraded United States -- Japanese bond yields remain the lowest among advanced economies. This signals that bond buyers, far from seeing Japan on the fiscal brink, regard the Japanese government as exceptionally creditworthy.
''Japan is not Greece, or even the United States,'' Akira Kojima, a senior fellow at a Tokyo-based private policy research organization, the Japan Center for Economic Research, said in a research note. ''Japan can finance its deficit on its own.''
Mr. Kojima referred to the current-account surplus Japan has run for most of the last three decades, selling and investing more overseas than the other way round. And Japan's notably thrifty households sit on 1,500 trillion yen ($20 trillion) in savings. The Japanese government is in deep debt, but the rest of Japan has ample money to spare.
And Japanese investors have long been happy to buy up government bonds. In contrast to Greece and other afflicted economies in the euro zone that are heavily indebted to foreign creditors, 60 percent of Japan's government bonds are held by Japanese banks, insurance companies and pension funds. An additional 20 percent or so is owned by governmental organizations and the Bank of Japan.
Throw in individual investors, and 95 percent of Japan's debt is held domestically. That makes the country less vulnerable to outside pressures that might cause it to default. And in theory, it gives the government plenty of leeway to print money -- a spendthrift's prerogative it holds in common with the United States.
''Unlike the peripheral euro zone countries, where bond yields can easily spike without official support, Japan still boasts the luxury of being able to issue debt in a market full of willing buyers,'' said Cameron Umetsu, Tokyo-based economist at UBS Securities. ''This is one luxury the government should exploit while it can.''
While it can. That is the crucial caveat.
After the collapse of its boom of the 1970s and '80s, Japan has since the 1990s poured yen after yen into stimulus programs trying to revive the economy, while letting tax revenue atrophy.
And now, demographics are taking a toll. Social security and pension costs have soared as Japan's baby boomers reach retirement, while the birth rate is so slow that the population is actually shrinking.
Not only are there going to be fewer taxpayers, but Japan's savings rate is falling, as more pensioners start dipping into their nest eggs, shrinking the pool of money available for government bond purchases.
And it is unclear, analysts say, how much longer Japanese banks and pension funds will keep up their appetite for government bonds that bring in little interest.
The Bank of Japan could buy up more government bonds to make up for a slack in demand, but within the bank there is strong opposition to such moves, which many fear could fuel inflation.
All of which is why analysts see little chance of any bold fiscal moves from Mr. Noda's new government. ''It's as if the crisis that faces Japan's finances has been completely forgotten,'' Masataka Nakajima, a special researcher at the Japan Securities Research Institute wrote in a recent report.
Mr. Noda, as evident from his ''sieve'' speech, hasn't forgotten. But he had a big distraction right now: putting together yet another emergency budget for Japan's crippled economy.

HEADLINE: China Benefits as U.S. Solar Industry Withers

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The bankruptcies of three American solar power companies in the last month, including Solyndra of California on Wednesday, have left China's industry with a dominant sales position -- almost three-fifths of the world's production capacity -- and rapidly declining costs.
Some American, Japanese and European solar companies still have a technological edge over Chinese rivals, but seldom a cost advantage, according to industry analysts. 
Loans at very low rates from state-owned banks in Beijing, cheap or free land from local and provincial governments across China, huge economies of scale and other cost advantages have transformed China from a minor player in the solar power industry just a few years ago into the main producer of an increasingly competitive source of electricity.
''The top-tier Chinese firms are kind of the benchmark now,'' said Shayle Kann, a managing director of solar power studies at GTM Research, a renewable energy market analysis firm based in Boston. Pricing of solar equipment is determined by the Chinese industry, he said, ''and everyone else prices at a premium or discount to them.''
Besides Solyndra, the other two American manufacturers that filed for bankruptcy in August were Evergreen Solar, of Massachusetts, and SpectraWatt, a New York company. Another company, BP Solar, halted manufacturing at its complex in Frederick, Md., last spring.
Those bankruptcies and closings represent almost one-fifth of the solar panel manufacturing capacity in the United States, according to GTM Research.
Solyndra and Evergreen in particular suffered because they pursued unusual technologies whose competitiveness depended on their using less polysilicon, the main material for solar panels. That has become less important because polysilicon prices have tumbled more than 80 percent in the last three years as output has caught up with demand.
Analysts say that two American companies remain strongly placed. One is First Solar, the largest American manufacturer, which uses a different technology but has its biggest factory in Malaysia. The other, SunPower, is much smaller but is an industry leader in the efficiency with which its panels convert sunlight into electricity, so that they sell at a premium to Chinese panels.
But with Beijing heavily supporting its industry, the Chinese companies are forging ahead.
''There is no question that renewable energy companies in the United States feel pressure from China,'' said David B. Sandalow, the assistant secretary for policy and international affairs at the United States Energy Department. ''Many of them say it is cheap capital, not cheap labor, that gives Chinese companies the main competitive advantage.''
China's three biggest solar power companies -- Suntech Power, Yingli Green Energy and Trina Solar -- have all in the last two weeks announced second-quarter sales increases of 33 to 63 percent from a year earlier.
Yingli and Trina were also profitable in the quarter. Suntech posted a loss, mostly because it broke a longstanding agreement to buy solar wafers -- critical components in the manufacturing process -- from a Singapore affiliate of MEMC Electronic Materials of Missouri. Suntech aims to make more wafers itself.
Shares in large and small Chinese solar power companies have mostly rallied in the last two weeks on the New York and Hong Kong stock markets, as investors have welcomed their strong quarterly results and the prospect of dwindling competition from Western rivals. Besides the bankruptcies in the United States, solar power companies in Germany, another big producer, have been laying off workers and retrenching.
The recent strength of Chinese stocks ''truly reflects the low cost base of the Chinese solar manufacturers, and it is great to see their positioning, particularly relative to their American and European counterparts,'' said K. K. Chan, the chief executive of Nature Elements Capital, a Chinese clean energy investment company based in Beijing.
He attributed the Chinese industry's low costs not to inexpensive labor in China -- high-technology solar panel manufacturing is not labor-intensive -- but rather to free or subsidized land from local governments, extensive tax breaks and other state assistance.
Solar panel prices have plunged by 30 to 42 percent per kilowatt-hour in the last year as manufacturers have sharply increased capacity, particularly in China. Meanwhile, demand has been somewhat weak in the main markets in the United States and Europe.
Costs for electricity generated by utility-scale solar installations now approach costs for natural gas in some markets, like California's, when subsidies of as much as 30 percent of the price are included. However, costs remain well above the cost of electricity from coal.
The United States and the European Union have tried to build demand for solar power by subsidizing the buyers of solar panels. But increasingly those subsidies are being used to buy solar panels from China.
The Chinese government has pursued a different policy course. Instead of subsidizing the purchase and use of solar power, China has focused on building the competitiveness of the country's manufacturers. As a result, China exports 95 percent of the solar panels it produces. The United Steelworkers union filed a legal complaint a year ago with the United States government, asking the Obama administration to investigate China's clean energy subsidies and other policies and to bring cases against them at the World Trade Organization. The organization's rules strictly prohibit export subsidies, to prevent countries from buying market share in foreign markets for their producers.
The administration did challenge one Chinese government practice: giving subsidy grants of $6.7 million and $22.5 million to Chinese wind turbine manufacturers that agreed not to buy imported components.
China agreed in June to discontinue the practice, but by then it had already built the world's largest wind turbine manufacturing industry over the last five years and now has highly competitive Chinese producers for almost every component.
Nkenge L. Harmon, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative's office, said on Thursday that the agency's investigation continued into whether other Chinese green energy policies might violate W.T.O. rules.

HEADLINE: Slumping Bank Shares and Fear Over Jobs End Market Rally

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A four-day rally on the stock market ended Thursday with a slump led by banks. Many investors also sold stocks ahead of the government's monthly jobs report Friday, fearful that it might revive worries that the nation could enter another recession.
Goldman Sachs fell 3.5 percent after regulators announced enforcement actions against a former subsidiary of the bank over mortgage and foreclosure practices. Bank stocks fell more than the rest of the market as investors worried that other banks might face similar reprisals. Financial stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 2.4 percent, the most of the 10 company groups that make up the index. 
''There's obviously a lot of fear in the marketplace,'' said Ann Miletti, managing director and senior portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management. ''Right now, the market's just lacking confidence.''
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 119.96 points, or 1 percent, to close at 11,493.57. It rose by more than 100 points shortly after 10 a.m., when a crucial manufacturing report showed evidence of growth in August.
Retailers including Macy's and Costco rose after reporting strong sales last month, despite wild swings in the stock market and worries about the economy.
Goldman Sachs, in a settlement with a New York state banking regulator, agreed to stop controversial mortgage-related practices such as the ''robo-signing'' of documents. The settlement was a condition to Goldman's sale of its Litton Loan Servicing subsidiary, where the practices occurred.
Also Thursday, the Federal Reserve said it ordered Goldman to review how foreclosures were handled at Litton. The Fed said there was a ''pattern of misconduct and negligence'' at Litton.
Stock indexes traded mixed for much of the day, but turned lower after the Fed's announcement on Goldman Sachs came out at 1:30 p.m. They continued to drift lower for the rest of the afternoon.
Other banks also fell. Citigroup lost 3.4 percent and the PNC Financial Services Group fell 3.2 percent. Bank of America, which is facing many lawsuits over its dealings in mortgage-backed securities, also fell 3.2 percent.
The regulatory actions showed that problems related to the mortgage crisis in 2008 remained far from over, said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. Ms. Krosby also said investors were nervous ahead of the Labor Department's jobs report.
The S.& P. 500-stock index fell 14.47 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,204.42.
SAIC, which provides engineering and technology services to the military and other agencies, fell 13.5 percent, the most in the S.& P. 500, after issuing a full-year earnings forecast that was below analysts' expectations. The company cited tightening government budgets.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 33.42, or 1.3 percent, to 2,546.04.
All three indexes had their worst August since 2001 after fears of an economic slowdown in the United States and debt issues in Europe put investors on edge.
Trading volume was relatively light at 4.3 billion shares. Many traders were on vacation. Low volume suggests that relatively few investors were driving the market's gains and losses.
Rob T. Lutts, president and chief investment officer of Cabot Money Management, said he expected volume to remain low until next week, when many traders return to work after Labor Day. ''That's when we'll see what's really going on,'' Mr. Lutts said.
Retailers rose after several companies reported sales gains that beat analysts' estimates. August is an important month for back-to-school shopping, which can account for up to 25 percent of retailers' annual revenue. Macy's rose 2.1 percent; Costco Wholesale rose 1.2 percent.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 29/32, to 99 30/32, and the yield fell to 2.13 percent from 2.23 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Tech Industry Becomes a Force in Local Politics

BYLINE: By GERRY SHIH. 
gshih@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Last spring, in an effort to spur economic growth in San Francisco, Mayor Edwin M. Lee and David Chiu, president of the Board of Supervisors, engineered legislation to waive millions of dollars in taxes for technology companies like Twitter and Zynga.
Now, with both men running for mayor, the tech industry is returning the favor.
In late June, more than a dozen executives, including Ali Row-ghani and David Wehner -- chief financial officers of Twitter and Zynga, respectively -- hosted a $100-a-plate fund-raiser for Mr. Chiu. The event, ''Innovate SF,'' brought in about $6,000, according to Mr. Chiu's campaign.
Meanwhile, Ron Conway, a major investor in Twitter, aims to raise as much as $1 million for a political action committee that is expected to run television ads in support of Mr. Lee during the run-up to the Nov. 8 election, according to several San Francisco fund-raisers. 
Under federal election laws, Mr. Conway can independently solicit unrestricted amounts of money on Mr. Lee's behalf. He has raised thousands of dollars over the past few weeks, city records show, including a $1,000 donation from Marc Benioff, the founder of Salesforce, and a $500 donation from Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the media and real estate mogul based in New York.
''Ron has seen how effective Ed Lee has been in just a few months as mayor,'' said Brian Brokaw, a political consultant working for Mr. Conway. ''He recognizes that Ed Lee is a public servant, not a career politician, and hasn't spent years accumulating a campaign war chest, so he's committed to raising and contributing his own resources to support Ed Lee.''
Silicon Valley has exerted a powerful pull over national and state politics for more than a decade, but the mayoral campaigns for Mr. Lee and Mr. Chiu show how a new wave of booming start-ups in San Francisco has emerged as a major force on the local level as well.
The industry is realizing its political might in a variety of ways.
In March, Twitter negotiated a payroll tax exemption worth more than $30 million by agreeing to move into the blighted Central Market neighborhood, which officials hope to develop. Two months later, Zynga pressured the city into granting a separate tax break for companies that go public within the next two years.
Mr. Conway spent $35,000 to support the controversial sit-lie initiative, which passed last November. Michael Moritz, a partner at Sequoia Capital and one of the world's pre-eminent venture capitalists, jolted San Francisco politics last year when he spent more than $250,000 to support a pension reform initiative that was bitterly opposed by unions and most of the political establishment. That measure failed, but Mr. Moritz now supports another pension reform effort, as well as the mayoral campaign of Jeff Adachi, the public defender.
''By far and away the biggest issue confronted by people from the tech industry -- and it completely dwarfs the sit-lie/payroll/stock options stuff is pension reform,'' Mr. Moritz said in an e-mail. ''Whichever pension measure passes this fall, San Franciscans can thank Silicon Valley. Without pressure from the tech industry, San Francisco would just be closer to the abyss.''
Other tech veterans are experiencing firsthand success in San Francisco elections, an insular arena traditionally dominated by Democratic Party bosses, union leaders and entrenched political families. Mark Farrell, a venture capitalist, was elected to the Board of Supervisors in November. Another, Joanna Rees, is now one of a dozen leading candidates for mayor.
Mr. Chiu and Mr. Lee acknowledge that the growing industry represents a vast pool of young, wealthy voters. But their support, they say, is rooted in the fact that employment in San Francisco's tech industry has shot up 60 percent since 2005, to more than 30,000 jobs.
''The reason why David and I are so passionate about tech is because they offer jobs,'' Mr. Lee said in an interview. ''That's why we support them in the city, and that's why we're giving a lot of attention to start-ups. I'm not looking at it in terms of votes.''
At a news conference on Monday at Autodesk, an engineering software firm, the mayor said he had expedited building inspection permits for the company's 36,000-square-foot expansion on Market Street.
The next day, during a visit with Mr. Chiu to the new Central Market headquarters of Zendesk, a customer support start-up, Mr. Lee praised tax relief for tech companies and reaffirmed his desire to repeal the city tax on stock options permanently. (A moratorium sponsored this year by Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi expires in 2013.)
Last week, when the mayor called Jack Dorsey, the Twitter co-founder, to ask for his support for his campaign, Mr. Dorsey readily agreed, according to Mr. Lee's aides. The campaigns for Mr. Lee, Mr. Chiu and Supervisor John Avalos, who also backed the tax moratorium, were granted visits to Zynga's new South of Market headquarters to campaign in front of employees. Other candidates have been turned away, according to people involved in the planning.
Jeff Weiner, the chief executive of LinkedIn in Mountain View, attributed his peers' political awakening to the current tech boom's taking place largely in San Francisco rather than in Silicon Valley, the industry's historic cradle.
It was only when a handful of prominent start-ups like Twitter, Zynga and Yelp began preparing for multibillion-dollar initial public offerings in recent months that they began lobbying City Hall for an overhaul of the tax code. That interest in local legislation has now seeped into the election, said Mr. Weiner, who is supporting Ms. Rees.
''There's a lot more of that energy in the city than you've had at any time since the late '90s,'' Mr. Weiner said. ''This is the first time you're seeing it and feeling it in the last decade.''
Ms. Rees said it was no longer solely the business establishment like the Chamber of Commerce that shaped tax policy. ''The entrepreneurial companies are now realizing they need to be thinking about policy,'' she said.
Politicians feel comfortable embracing tech companies because the public views the industry benignly, said Judy Nadler, a former mayor of Santa Clara and a senior fellow at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University. But for that same reason, potential conflicts may escape scrutiny.
''In this economy it is incumbent upon every mayor and elected official to do their best to bring new business to their community,'' Ms. Nadler said. ''But what is important is to think: If you substituted 'tech' for 'oil company' or 'dress designing' or 'shipbuilding' or 'arms building,' how would you feel about that?''
The deepening ties between city officials and the tech sector follows an established arc in national and state politics. President Obama has already visited Silicon Valley twice this year to woo tech executives and will pay another visit this month. So will Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, a presidential candidate who often talks up his tech-friendly credentials.
Unlike energy and pharmaceutical companies, which have been ''kicked around by politicians for a long time,'' said Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the conservative-leaning Hoover Institution, the tech industry continues to enjoy a special relationship with politicians because they are seen as hip, young and idealistic.
But as these companies continue to wrestle with mounting controversies over privacy and increase their lobbying presence in Washington, Mr. Whalen added, that sheen of innocence may be gradually fading.
''Democrats, in particular, rail against oil companies and insurance companies,'' Mr. Whalen said. ''But no one rails against tech companies. At least not yet.''

HEADLINE: Argentina's Turnaround Tango

BYLINE: By IAN MOUNT. 
Ian Mount is the author of the forthcoming book ''The Vineyard at the End of the World: Maverick Winemakers and the Rebirth of Malbec.''

 BODY:
Buenos Aires
ARGENTINA may seem like one of the last countries on earth to offer lessons for dealing with economic malaise. Once the eighth-largest economy in the world, it steadily slid through the 20th century, thanks to decades of repressive dictatorships and inconsistent market experiments. This ended ignominiously in 2001, when it defaulted on $100 billion in sovereign debt, plunging over half its 35 million people into poverty.
That, at least, is the Argentina people know. Since then, it has performed an economic U-turn -- an achievement largely unnoticed outside Latin America, but one that President Obama and Congress should look to for inspiration. 
Argentina is not without problems, but its recent economic record speaks for itself: the economy has grown by over 6 percent a year for seven of the last eight years, unemployment has been cut to under 8 percent today from over 20 percent in 2002, and the poverty level has fallen by almost half over the last decade. The streets of Buenos Aires are choked with cars as Argentines are on track to buy some 800,000 new vehicles this year; the wine mecca of Mendoza is full of high-end tasting rooms, hotels and restaurants offering regional haute cuisine; and plasma TVs and BlackBerrys have become household staples among the urban middle class.
Argentina has regained its prosperity partly out of dumb luck: a commodity price boom has vastly benefitted this soy, corn and wheat producer. But it has also prospered thanks to smart economic measures. The government intervened to keep the value of its currency low, which boosts local industry by making Argentina's exports cheaper abroad while keeping foreign imports expensive.
It then taxed those imports and exports, using the money to pay for a New Deal-like public works binge, increasing government spending to 25 percent of G.D.P. today from 14 percent in 2003. As a result, the country has 400,000 new low-income housing units, as well as a long-delayed, 235-mile highway between the northern cities of Rosario and Cordoba.
It has also strengthened its social safety net: the Universal Child Allowance, started in 2009 with support from both the ruling party and the opposition, gives 1.9 million low-income families a monthly stipend of about $42 per child, which helps increase consumption. Because the amount depends in part on how often the child attends school, it is also likely to improve the country's long-term educational performance.
The results have also paid off politically: President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner recently won about 50 percent of the vote in an open primary against nine other presidential candidates.
Why have Argentines embraced bigger government? In part because the preceding era showed how poorly austerity measures -- the sort now being pushed by conservatives in the United States -- promote growth. In the late 1990s, Argentina cut government spending drastically on the order of its lenders at the International Monetary Fund. Predictably, between 1998 and 2002, Argentina's economy shrank by almost 20 percent. It was only after Argentina turned its back on these austerity demands, and defaulted on its debt, that it began to recover.
Of course, Argentina is far from perfect: the import and export taxes have scared away some foreign investment, while high spending has pushed inflation well over 20 percent. There are also problems with the way Argentina is run: corruption, government opacity, authoritarian tendencies, confiscatory taxes and a temptation to tweak unpleasant inflation statistics. And it would be laughable to suggest that the United States follow its lead and default on its debt.
But Argentina still offers valuable lessons. For one thing, extreme cost-cutting during a stagnant economic period will only inhibit growth. And government spending to promote local industry, pro-job infrastructure programs and unemployment benefits does not turn a country into a kind of Soviet parody. It puts money in the pockets of average citizens, who then spend it and spur the economy. Spending cuts need to be made when times improve -- an imperative Argentina is struggling with now -- but not before.
Argentina is hardly a perfect parallel for the United States. But the stark difference between its austere policies and low growth of the late 1990s and the pro-government, high-growth 2000s offers a test case for how to get an economy moving again. Washington would do well to pay attention.

HEADLINE: City Is Subpoenaed for Files on Minority Company

BYLINE: By DAN MIHALOPOULOS. 
dmihalopoulos@chicago newscoop.org

 BODY:
Federal investigators, who long have found corruption in City Hall's minority-contracting efforts, have subpoenaed the city's files on a construction company that was paid at least $26 million in taxpayer money in the past decade.
The office of United States Attorney Patrick J. Fitzgerald sent a grand jury subpoena to the city for minority-contracting documents related to the City Construction Company a year ago, according to records obtained by the Chicago News Cooperative through a Freedom of Information Act request. 
Even after the Chicago Law Department received the subpoena, the city continued to issue checks to pay the company for its work as a subcontractor on public works projects. Payments from the city have amounted to almost $3 million since federal authorities sought the documents.
''Receiving a subpoena regarding a company is not sufficient basis'' to prohibit a company from doing business with the city, Jennifer Hoyle, a spokeswoman for the Law Department, said in an e-mail Thursday.
No charges have been filed. Randall Samborn, a spokesman for Mr. Fitzgerald, said Thursday that he could not comment.
A source close to the investigation said the inquiry originated in the office of the city's inspector general, Joseph Ferguson, who referred the matter to federal prosecutors. Through his spokesman, Mr. Ferguson declined to comment.
Allan W. Masters, a former Cook County judge, is the lawyer for City Construction, whose headquarters are on the far Northwest Side. ''There are some supposed issues that I don't think are issues,'' Mr. Masters said, declining to discuss the case further.
According to the subpoena, which was sent in July 2010, a special grand jury that convened in March 2010 wanted ''any and all records related to the application, certification, participation, re-certification and termination of City Construction Co.'' in the city government's contracting set-aside program for businesses owned by minorities and women.
During the long tenure of former Mayor Richard M. Daley, which ended with his retirement in May, the minority-business program was a frequent source of scandal. In a lengthy string of cases, investigators found that white businessmen actually owned many city contractors that minority or female entrepreneurs claimed to control.
In a report issued in June, Mr. Ferguson, the inspector general, said Mr. Daley's administration ''did not act to effect real reform'' in the program. ''The program's failings result in widespread fraud and abuse,'' he added.
The administration of Mayor Rahm Emanuel has not issued a formal response to that report.
The subpoena also commanded city officials to produce all records of contracts awarded to City Construction and payments the city made to it.
City Construction formed in 1999. The next year, it received the first of what would be more than a dozen contracts with the Daley administration.
By 2003, the city was paying the company more than $3 million a year for work that included resurfacing a stretch of 63rd Street and removing and replacing curbs and gutters.
To win contracts, City Construction benefited from being certified as a minority-owned business enterprise and as a disadvantaged business enterprise, a state designation that affords preferential treatment in the awarding of federally financed public work.
In filings with state and city officials, company executives described a repeatedly changing ownership arrangement that involved investors whose names suggest South Asian and Italian roots.
When the company first began to win city business, economic-disclosure statements indicated that Mohammed Hamid was its president and held a 51 percent stake. The other 49 percent was split equally between Pasquale Miulli and Luigi Spilotro.
In 2008, city officials say, Mr. Hamid sold his controlling stake to his son, Mohamed Yousuf. But Mr. Yousuf quickly sold that interest to Mr. Miulli and Mr. Spilotro, and at the end of 2008, the company reported to the Illinois secretary of state's office that Mr. Miulli was its new president.
City Construction amended its official roster again in November, indicating to state officials that its new president was Ambreen Hameed, with Mr. Spilotro as secretary and treasurer and Mr. Miulli as registered agent. That structure remained in the company's latest filing with the state, on March 22.
Ms. Hoyle, the city spokeswoman, said Ms. Hameed is ''a minority female'' who bought 51 percent of the company from Mr. Miulli and Mr. Spilotro in 2009.
Through all of those ownership shifts, taxpayer dollars continued to flow steadily to City Construction. Direct payments from the Daley administration amounted to $23.2 million from 2001 to 2009, according to data posted on the city's Web site.
Although the company does not appear to have any active contracts with the city, it was paid as recently as April as a subcontractor on deals between City Hall and Reliable Contracting & Equipment of Chicago.
The payments earmarked for City Construction since the Law Department received the subpoena add up to $2.82 million, including almost $400,000 on April 29.
Linval Chung, the president of Reliable Contracting, did not return calls seeking comment.
State records show that Reliable Contracting and City Construction made donations to the unsuccessful mayoral bid of Gery Chico, the former city school board president and one-time top Daley aide, in the election in February.
City Construction lost its status with the city as a minority-owned business enterprise in 2009, Ms. Hoyle said. The company applied to become a woman-owned business enterprise but withdrew its application on June 27, she said.
Although no longer enjoying special status, City Construction filed bids for city work in April, and June, as well as on Aug. 11, when it bid for a citywide viaduct improvement contract.
Information on the city's Web site suggests that the company was not the low bidder for those jobs and was not awarded the contracts.

HEADLINE: A Storied Apple, Struggling To Hold Its Own Among Grapes

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
SEBASTOPOL, Calif. -- It would be almost impossible to visit this town, in the heart of Sonoma County, and miss the Gravenstein, the sweetly tart (or tartly sweet) apple whose name suggests a Transylvanian undertaker. The Gravenstein is harvested in August and often gone by Labor Day, and its name emblazons a local highway, a couple of schools, a town shopping center and an annual festival that draws thousands of visitors -- and apple-a-day acolytes -- to this mellow Bay Area getaway.
But despite its fame, the delicate little Gravenstein --the jewel of a once-thriving apple industry in the county -- is in danger, its supporters say, in large part because of another product from Sonoma: wine. 
''It's grapes,'' said Paul Kolling, a soft-spoken organic apple grower who farms 75 acres of Gravensteins in the picturesque hills outside town. ''It's just more profitable to grow grapes on the lands than apples anymore.''
Indeed, according to a recent report from the county agricultural commissioner, wine grapes were far and away the No. 1 crop in 2010, valued at about $390 million, while the Gravenstein checked in at No. 13, with a mere $1.7 million.
And as goes profit, so goes the plow; land used for Gravensteins has dropped to 763 acres, the report said, down from 833 acres in 2009, part of a long decline in apples in the county. Wine grapes, meanwhile, took up more than 56,000 acres, with an array of cabernets, pinots and merlots soaking up sun and valuable water.
All of which has caused enough consternation among Gravenstein farmers and Gravenstein fans to set off a counteroffensive to ''save the Gravenstein,'' a motto seen on bumper stickers and handmade signs across the county.
Leading the charge is a local chapter of the Slow Food movement, which promotes traditional and sustainably produced foods and which has enlisted dozens of restaurants to feature the apple in dishes and desserts, placed wooden boxes full of free Gravensteins all around Sebastopol and blanketed farmers' markets with free samples of its juice.
Paula Shatkin, the coordinator of the project to save the Gravenstein, says that its roots in Sonoma -- it was widely planted here by homesick Russian immigrants in the 1800s -- and its unique flavor make its survival crucial.
''Some people think they're the perfect apple,'' Ms. Shatkin said. ''They're sweet, they're tart, they're juicy. They're absolutely the best apple for pie, and they make great juice.''
Like all classic heroes, however, the Gravenstein has a fatal flaw -- or two. The apple ripens earlier than most, but does not travel or age well, unlike big-time brands like the Red Delicious, meaning that getting them to distant markets can be a challenge.
''They're kind of ephemeral,'' Ms. Shatkin said.
All of which has lent the Gravenstein a certain niche in food circles, with special-occasion restaurants like Chez Panisse in Berkeley signing on to use Gravensteins, something that the apple's fans hope will raise its profile -- and price. But while premium grapes -- and the wine they make -- might be able to command top dollar, farm economists say that consumers will pay only so much for an apple.
''If a Gravenstein apple could be sold for 10 times what a Red Delicious could, just as a Sonoma County grape can be sold for 10 times what a Fresno County grape is, you'd be set,'' said Daniel Sumner, professor of agricultural economics at the University of California, Davis. ''But we haven't developed a culture where people are willing to.''
Mr. Sumner says that the decline of the Gravenstein is part of an age-old cycle on the farm as certain crops go in and out of fashion, often as a result of larger market forces, changes in technology (including irrigation) and competition from other states and countries. And right now, he said, wine is king in Sonoma, where the number of apple-processing plants has shrunk to one.
''You can say the culprit is wine grape growers, but I would say the culprit is wine drinkers,'' Mr. Sumner said. ''If my wino friends were to decide en masse that Sonoma County wine wasn't as good as they thought it was, and the snobs went in the other direction, the Gravenstein would come back.''
For their part, grape growers say they should not be demonized as land-devouring opportunists.
''The reason apples' acreage is declining is not because grapes are pushing them out of the way, it's because apple growers can't make any money,'' said Nick Frey, president of the Sonoma County Winegrape Commission. ''It's just the economy at play.''
Still, Mr. Frey said he sympathized with orchard owners. ''There's a lot of history and a lot of sentimental attachment, but I think if you're losing money, you can only lose money for so long,'' he said.
None of which would have been apparent at the annual Gravenstein Apple Fair, in mid-August. Thousands of apple enthusiasts crowded in, taking in bluegrass music, hay rides and a cacophonic display of antique engines.
Barbara Walker, whose family has been growing apples in Sonoma County for more than 100 years, said the response to her Gravensteins had been outstanding, with dozens of boxes sold. But at the same time, she understood that like the Gravenstein itself -- here today, gone tomorrow -- success could be short-lived.
''If we don't start promoting it, and recognizing it and saving it,'' Ms. Walker said, ''it's going to die.''

HEADLINE: Grasping The Secrets Of Being An Adult

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
WE THE ANIMALS
By Justin Torres
128 pages. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $18.
Dusk seems to be descending forever on the boys at the center of ''We the Animals,'' a slender but affecting debut novel by Justin Torres. As porch lights go on, and the other kids shamble home to chores and homework, the unnamed narrator and his brothers prowl the blighted streets of their rural hometown in upstate New York like stray dogs sniffing out their next meal or a new bit of trouble. At home the rising of the moon brings a mother's absence -- she works the night shift at the brewery -- and a father's frustration, which is relieved only by violence inflicted on whomever is at hand.
''We the Animals,'' the kind of sensitive, carefully wrought autobiographical first novel that may soon be extinct from the mainstream publishing world, is mostly written in the first person plural, a tricky gambit that calls attention to itself immediately (as it did in Joshua Ferris's best-selling novel of cubicled anomie, ''Then We Came to the End''). But the device doesn't impede our engagement with Mr. Torres's spare, haunting story of a boy scrabbling toward wisdom about the adult world and his place in it. 
''We'' are the three sons of a mixed-race couple, Ma and Paps, who met in Brooklyn in their youth before moving upstate, presumably in search of economic opportunity that hasn't materialized. He is Puerto Rican; she is white. She was just 14, he 16 when she became pregnant; they had to take a bus to Texas so they could marry legally. (One of Mr. Torres's few literary tics is a slight overuse of the semicolon in the early chapters; perhaps it's catching?)
When the book begins the narrator is nearly 7, and his two brothers, Manny and Joel, are just a couple of years older. The boys travel in a pack, their ethnicity setting them apart from the white working-class children around them, and the disorder of their home life encouraging them to burrow further into their protective intimacy.
On the narrator's seventh birthday Ma is languishing in bed, her face bloated and bruised days after a severe beating. (Paps had explained that the dentist did it: ''He said that's how they loosen up the teeth before they rip them out.'') When she wakes and realizes it is her youngest child's birthday, she calls him to her and tells him why it's his duty to remain 6 years old forever: ''She whispered it all to me, her need so big, no softness anywhere, only Paps and boys turning into Paps.'' To grow up is to grow hard.
The book is composed as a series of brief chapters moving roughly chronologically through a span of a little more than a half-dozen years. Telling incidents are described in simple language that occasionally rises to a keening lyricism: Paps teaching his wife and youngest boy to swim by abandoning them in deep water; Ma receding into catatonic despair when her husband disappears for a few days; a frenzied later attempt at escape when she piles the boys into the truck (the truck she hates for its lack of seatbelts) but drags them home again when they can think of no place to go.
''We had been terrified she might actually take us away from him this time but also thrilled with the wild possibility of change,'' Mr. Torres writes. ''Now, at the sight of our house, when it was safe to feel let down, we did.''
The scenes have the jumbled feel of homemade movies spliced together a little haphazardly, echoing the way memory works: moments of fear or excitement sting with bright clarity years later, while the long passages in between dissolve into nothingness. From the patchwork emerges a narrative of emotional maturing and sexual awakening that is in many ways familiar (no prizes for guessing the nature of the sexual awakening in question) but is freshened by the ethnicity of the characters and their background, and the blunt economy of Mr. Torres's writing, lit up by sudden flashes of pained insight.
A sense of lives doomed to struggle and disappointment pervades the writing without dragging it into lugubrious or melodramatic territory. Scenes that thrum with violence can suddenly turn tender too, and the brutality of their father's behavior isn't the whole story. In one striking scene he gives the boys a loving bath before suddenly turning his attention to his wife. The boys, still huddled in the tub, cower in silent awe and confusion as their parents begin to make love.
Although the boys' lives seems to be circumscribed by their isolation from the world and their complicity in the chaos of their parents' fraught marriage, change inevitably comes as adolescence steals up on the narrator. His sensitivity and bookishness puts unwanted distance between him and his brothers. Suddenly the ''we'' is fractured into ''they'' and ''I'': ''They smelled my difference -- my sharp, sad, pansy scent.''
Mr. Torres, whose short story ''Reverting to a Wild State'' was recently published in The New Yorker, is a graduate of the Iowa Writers' Workshop and now holds a prestigious Wallace Stegner Fellowship at Stanford University. He does not always avoid the kind of overly cultivated eloquence that announces a writer staking his claim for literary achievement. The book's first, short chapter ends with a showy, atypical clause-clotted paragraph that I would quote here except that it would take forever.
Writing that calls attention to its own sophistication seems particularly unnecessary when Mr. Torres's novel relates such an affecting story of love, loss and the irreversible trauma that a single event can bring to a family. As he writes with fine simplicity toward the end, when the shock of a secret revealed has drawn a sharp line between the narrator's troubled past and his uncertain future, ''Everything easy between me and my brothers and my mother and my father was lost.''

HEADLINE: Mets Seeking 'Small Ball' Investors

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Now that the Mets are no longer planning to sell a $200 million share of the team to David Einhorn, their owners are dusting off Plan B: selling smaller stakes to people willing to invest perhaps $20 million each. 
The strategy is not uncommon in sports. In baseball, the Yankees, the Rockies and the Rays have many owners with small stakes. The Yankees, for instance, have 30 partners, including members of the Steinbrenner family. In the N.F.L., the Dolphins have sold small shares of the team to celebrities including Marc Anthony, Gloria Estefan and Serena and Venus Williams.
After their acrimonious breakup with Einhorn, a hedge fund mogul with a reputation for playing hardball, it is perhaps unsurprising that the Mets would seek smaller, friendly investors. In some ways, selling 1 or 2 percent shares of a team is easier than trying to reach an agreement with one wealthy person or group for a 20 or 30 percent stake.
Deals for small shares of teams are more likely to win approval from Major League Baseball and from the banks, if loans are needed. Often, such investors simply want the perks of ownership, like access to suites and the team's players. Most of these investors do not have ambitions of being majority owners.
But recruiting multiple minority owners means more due diligence because of the number of people involved, and more time spent keeping everyone happy. In addition, some owners with small stakes may resist paying capital calls to cover a team's losses. And some small minority investors, who rarely receive voting rights, want guarantees that they will get their original investment back if they seek it.
''It's difficult to cobble together a big group,'' said Rob Tilliss, a principal in Inner Circle Sports, a Manhattan-based financial consultant to sports teams. ''It's a lot of people to get and everyone wants different rights.
''There's definitely something cool about owning a piece of the Mets, but it's cheaper to just have season tickets. Trying to get 10 to 15 like-minded people in a room to be passive limited partners, I don't know.''
Nevertheless, the Mets will try. And it is worth noting that Fred Wilpon started out as a small minority owner, buying 5 percent of the Mets in 1980. Six years later, he increased his stake to 50 percent. In 2002, he bought the rest of the club from Nelson Doubleday.
The current Mets team is limping along, just like the nation's economy. But for those who are not discouraged, and have the money, small chunks of the Mets are out there to be acquired.

HEADLINE: Shoppers Shake Off August's Woes for Back-to-School Buying

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Despite the volatile stock market, an East Coast hurricane and predictions of delayed back-to-school purchases, Americans continued buying at a fast pace in August.
Sales at stores open at least a year rose 4.4 percent on average from August 2010, according to a Thomson Reuters tally of 23 retailers. That was 0.2 percentage points below what analysts had expected, but still a strong result.
''It bodes well for the balance of the year -- the consumer has shaken off the craziness of Wall Street and the negativity coming out of Washington, and they're buying,'' said Madison Riley, managing director at Kurt Salmon, a retail consulting firm. 
The companies with the biggest increases represented pretty much every retailing sector. BJ's Wholesale and Costco, both warehouse stores, posted same-store sales increases of 11.5 percent and 11 percent. Limited, a consistently good performer because of its Victoria's Secret division, was also up 11 percent. The teenage-oriented store chain the Buckle was up 8.3 percent, while Nordstrom rose 6.7 percent.
All five were also the biggest upside surprises, beating analyst estimates by the biggest margins among the stores reporting.
On the downside, Kohl's and J. C. Penney, which have been heavily promoting back-to-school shopping, continued to have sales trouble. Both retailers posted same-store sales declines of 1.9 percent. Analysts had expected increases of 1.6 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively.
Earlier in the summer, analysts were predicting that back-to-school shoppers would postpone purchases until September as they waited for deals. But at most retailers, that did not seem to be the case.
''Part of the dynamic we see here is consumers had held off on a fair amount of spending in the last 18 months due to the economic situation. It's pent-up demand, and it's an important part of the retail year,'' Mr. Riley said. ''I don't think they've put it off; I think they've gone ahead.''
MasterCard Advisors' SpendingPulse, which tracks spending at the retail level, said sales in back-to-school categories increased 3 percent in both July and August. ''This is the best back-to-school season we've seen in terms of growth since 2006,'' said Michael McNamara, vice president for research and analysis for SpendingPulse.
While luxury spending is usually correlated with the stock market over the long term, that is not always the case over the short term, as August showed.
In addition to Nordstrom's gain, Saks Fifth Avenue's same-store sales rose 6.1 percent. SpendingPulse did not release a percentage increase for luxury spending this month because of changes in how it reports data, but ''the luxury trend throughout the summer has been one of the leading areas, and it continues to be through August,'' Mr. McNamara said.
Still, analysts said that some lower-end stores have raised prices because of increases in cotton and other materials, but are having trouble getting shoppers to pay more.
''Thus far in the season, promotions appear to be deeper than last year, and inventory levels across the sector are growing faster than sales, which bodes poorly for successful price increases,'' Adrienne Tennant, an analyst at Janney Capital Markets who covers apparel stores, wrote in a note to clients this week.
Hurricane Irene, which caused stores to close and shoppers to stay at home along the East Coast last weekend, seemed to have a light impact on sales. The retailers that quantified the impact of Irene on same-store sales said it had hurt sales by 0.6 percent (J. C. Penney) to 1.5 percent (Macy's and Saks).
The more significant impact of Irene will be felt next month, Paul Lejuez, an analyst with Nomura Securities, said in a note to clients, because the beginning of this week, including Sunday, when many of the stores were closed, will be counted as part of the next period's results.
At Costco, several warehouses closed briefly over the hurricane weekend, but ''we saw a lift in sales prior to the weekend as members anticipated the storm,'' a Costco spokesman said in a recorded message. Over all, the net effect of Irene was slightly negative, Costco said.
Costco also said Thursday that its longtime chief executive and one of its founders, Jim Sinegal, would resign on Jan. 1. He will be succeeded by Craig Jelinek, who is Costco's president and chief operating officer. Mr. Sinegal will continue as a board member.

PERSON: Ronald Fernandez 

HEADLINE: Ronald Fernandez, 67, Scholar on Plight of Puerto Ricans

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

 BODY:
Ronald Fernandez, a professor of sociology whose curiosity about a daring $7 million armored car robbery near his Connecticut home set him on a career path of scholarly investigation into the history of American colonialism in Puerto Rico, died on Tuesday in West Hartford. He was 67.
The cause was esophageal cancer, his wife, Brenda Harrison, said. 
Dr. Fernandez was a recently minted Ph.D. teaching at Central Connecticut State College in 1983 when the robbery took place in a Wells Fargo armored car depot close enough to his house that he was detoured on the way home by police barricades. His initial idea was to write a book about the psychology of the bank robber.
But his research into the lives of the men identified by the F.B.I. as the masterminds of the heist, all of them members of a militant Puerto Rican independence group known as Los Macheteros, led Dr. Fernandez to a broader interest in the back story of the Macheteros' cause: the long and, for most Americans, obscure history of disenfranchisement on the island of Puerto Rico, a subject he knew little about despite growing up in New York City, where about 800,000 Puerto Ricans now live.
Beginning with his 1987 book, ''Los Macheteros: The Wells Fargo Robbery and the Violent Struggle for Puerto Rican Independence,'' Dr. Fernandez wrote five books about Puerto Rico over the next decade. One, a history textbook, received an American Library Association award. The rest were deeply footnoted histories of American military and economic domination of a tiny island that has existed in a kind of limbo since becoming a United States possession in 1898, among the spoils of the Spanish-American War: neither colony nor part of the union.
The nearly four million residents of Puerto Rico are United States citizens, but cannot vote in federal elections. They are represented by a nonvoting representative in Congress. Tax and regulatory exemptions given businesses based on the mainland raise perennial public complaints about environmental and economic exploitation.
''Ronnie recognized that this was very much a hidden history,'' said Martin Espada, a poet and professor of English at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and a friend of Dr. Fernandez's. ''It is not a history taught much at the high school or college level, so he became the foremost authority in the English language on colonialism and the independence movement in Puerto Rico.''
Besides being a history of the relationship between the United States and what is officially known as its ''unincorporated territory'' in the Caribbean, ''Los Macheteros'' was among the first published works to document F.B.I. efforts in the 1960s and '70s to infiltrate and discredit lawful, nonviolent independence groups in Puerto Rico.
Disclosures by Dr. Fernandez and others set off a public outcry on the island, and prompted hundreds of civil rights lawsuits in the '80s and '90s by people claiming to have been blacklisted for participating in pro-independence activities. In 1999 the governor of Puerto Rico, Pedro J. Rossello, issued an official apology and established a compensation fund.
As for the 17 members of Los Macheteros who were eventually indicted in the Wells Fargo robbery -- the largest in American history at the time and one in which no one was injured -- 14 were captured and sentenced to prison, one was killed in 2005 in a shootout with the F.B.I. in Puerto Rico, one was arrested in May, and one, Victor Manuel Gerena, the Wells Fargo security guard who had handcuffed two co-workers and made off with the money, remains a fugitive.
''Ron walked the line between advocate and scholar,'' said Ronald L. Kuby, a lawyer who represented a Wells Fargo defendant. ''He really understood the spirit of the Puerto Rican people.''
Joseph Ronald Fernandez was born in Brooklyn on June 30, 1944, the son of Ernestina and Joseph Fernandez, both immigrants from Spain. His father worked in a factory.
Mr. Fernandez graduated from Xavier High School in Manhattan and Hunter College, and received a master's degree in sociology from the New School for Social Research. He met most of the requirements for his Ph.D. at the New School, then completed his doctorate at the University of Connecticut. He taught sociology throughout his career at what is now Central Connecticut State University, and established the Center for Caribbean and Latin American Studies there in 1992.
Besides his wife, he is survived by their three children, Adam, Carrie and Benjamin; three grandchildren; and a sister, Sally Walkes.
In the last decade of his life, Dr. Fernandez shifted his focus from Puerto Rico's unique struggle for identity to the broader question of cultural and racial identity faced by all American Latinos. All, he said, suffer from the American obsession about race because they ''can never fit into the racial boxes that officially divide us into whites, blacks and others.''
His last book, ''America Beyond Black and White: How Immigrants and Fusions Are Helping Us Overcome the Racial Divide,'' published in 2008, proposed that Americans adopt a more Caribbean attitude about race and ethnicity.
''Americans want Jamaicans or Puerto Ricans to think (and act) in black and white,'' he wrote. ''Qualifications never exist; you see skin color or you do not. When Caribbean people try to explain that their world is much more complicated, we too often write them off as hypocrites and miss one of the most remarkable features of life in many Caribbean nations: When it comes to race and ethnicity, they are among the most civilized people on earth.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 3, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary on Friday about Ronald Fernandez, a sociology professor who wrote about the history of American colonialism in Puerto Rico, referred imprecisely to the federal tax obligations of residents of the island. While they pay Social Security and Medicare taxes, they do not pay federal income tax on income from Puerto Rican sources. (Federal government employees there do pay federal income tax.)
And a subheading with the obituary described incorrectly the $7 million robbery by a Puerto Rican independence group that inspired Dr. Fernandez's interest in Puerto Rican nationalism. As the obituary correctly noted, it involved an armored car depot, not a bank.

HEADLINE: For the Governor of Vermont, a Crash Course in Disaster Management

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
PITTSFIELD, Vt. -- After helicoptering into this flood-ravaged town and delivering a pep talk to residents who had been stranded for three days and counting, Gov. Peter Shumlin asked if anyone had questions for him. It took a minute for anyone to speak up, and even then, the queries were polite to the point of apologetic.
''I keep pushing for generators,'' said Peter Borden, the town's emergency management coordinator. ''I'm sorry, Governor.''
He may be lucky, skillful or both, but so far, Mr. Shumlin, the relatively new governor of a state unaccustomed to disasters, has encountered almost nothing but geniality as he has traveled the hardest-hit parts of Vermont, doling out hugs and reminding residents that ''Vermonters are tough.'' 
Eight months into a two-year term he expected to be dominated by health care and economic issues, Mr. Shumlin, a 55-year-old Democrat, now faces a complicated and costly recovery effort that could well be the defining issue of his governorship.
Dozens of homes were destroyed or badly damaged across the state on Sunday by the flash flooding, which also closed a state office complex and left roads and bridges in tatters.
Mr. Shumlin and his staff are working to get plans in place before patience runs out, making big promises, like to restore power to most towns by week's end, provide school buses to take residents of isolated towns to grocery stores and not let the widespread damage interfere with leaf-peeping season and all the tourists it draws here.
''We've got enough roads to get around, and we've still got leaves on our trees,'' Mr. Shumlin told a group in Rutland on Wednesday, adding that he would tell tourists, ''It might be goat paths instead of highways, but we can get you there.''
Chris Graff, a former journalist and longtime political observer in Montpelier, said that while Mr. Shumlin had so far made good on promises -- getting at least crude roads open to 13 cut-off towns, for example -- it would get harder as the weeks wore on.
''He has a tremendous can-do spirit, and sometimes that can get ahead of his ability to put the plans in place,'' Mr. Graff said. ''There is no doubt that the state government is fully engaged and well aware of all the problems in these communities, but it's just a huge undertaking down the road.''
Mr. Shumlin, a thin, spry man from Putney with a folksy air, was president pro tempore of the Vermont Senate before narrowly winning the governor's race last November. Until now, his top priorities have included creating something close to a single-payer health care system, the nation's first, and shutting down Vermont Yankee, a nuclear power plant in the southeast corner of the state.
In an interview Wednesday, he said such goals would not fall off the radar.
''I'm the kind of person, the more balls I have in the air, generally the more I can land,'' he said as a helicopter shuttled him to Rochester, an isolated, hard-hit town in south-central Vermont. ''We'll just work longer hours and longer days. We can multitask, absolutely.''
Mr. Shumlin has used the rare national spotlight to call attention to another of his priorities: preparing for climate change, which he said was a factor in the torrential rains that dropped as much as nine inches of rain on parts of Vermont as the remnants of Hurricane Irene moved through.
''Any objective scientist will tell you that as a result of climate change, we're going to get more intense storms in New England,'' he said. ''We've got to rethink where you build houses, where you build schools, where you build highways and how you build them. We have to redefine our flood plains.''
He has proven an agile communicator in the early days since the storm, posting frequent updates on Twitter and sending agency heads to answer questions from callers on radio shows. And he has traveled to many of the most damaged towns, asking people what they need and saying, time and again, how proud he is of their resilience.
''From an image standpoint,'' Mr. Graff said, ''Peter has had a tremendous week.''
Bright sun this week has helped keep spirits up; they could flag when the weather turns darker and colder. The fast approach of winter will also pose challenges for rebuilding.
''We've got a very short construction season left, and the snow's going to be flying,'' said Tom Pelham, a former state housing and finance commissioner who has worked for both Democrats and Republicans.
''At some point, Peter is going to have to understand he can't be all things to all people,'' he said. ''Some choices are going to have to be made, and he's going to have to explain them.''
So far, one of the few negative responses that Mr. Shumlin has evoked this week came when he quibbled with a CBS News correspondent's description of people ''stranded'' in flood-damaged towns.
''Stranded is a bit of an exaggeration, to be honest with you,'' Mr. Shumlin told the correspondent. Word of the exchange got to residents of Rochester, and some were miffed.
''That frayed some tempers,'' said Martha Slater, a resident. ''Every way to get out of town is basically blocked off.''
While outsiders have questioned why Mr. Shumlin did not order evacuations before the storm, he has said it made no sense to do so. And while some Vermonters have complained that rescue workers gave them minutes of warning instead of hours as the waters were rising, few appear to be taking it out on Mr. Shumlin, at least so far.
''We're used to storms,'' the governor said. ''We're used to taking care of ourselves in the winter, living on top of mountains in the middle of nowhere. You know, we know how to tough it out here. You're not going to talk a Vermonter out of their house.''
Here in Pittsfield, where residents have taken it upon themselves to try to patch roads with local equipment and to fetch urgent supplies using all-terrain vehicles, Ray Rice, a resident of 11 years, said he had not even begun to think about what Mr. Shumlin and state government could do for the town.
''Oh God, no,'' Mr. Rice said. ''We've been taking care of ourselves pretty good.''
That kind of ethos, typical throughout the state, is helping Mr. Shumlin for now.
''Vermonters are incredibly tough and realistic and practical,'' he said. ''They know the governor didn't create the storm. They know we're working hard to respond.''

HEADLINE: Data Holds Some Hints Of Optimism On Economy

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Manufacturing unexpectedly grew in August and fewer Americans filed new claims for jobless benefits last week despite a slump in confidence that threatened to push the economy back into recession, economic reports showed on Thursday.
Other data on Thursday showed a drop in second-quarter productivity and an unexpected decline in construction spending. But those reports were counterbalanced by solid sales from automakers and retailers.
Taken together, the reports were the latest to suggest the economy remained on a slow-growth path and offered hope it would dodge a recession. 
''I am breathing a little sigh of relief that the bit of data that we have had over the course of August is weak but not giving the recessionary type of signal,'' said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh.
More light will be shed on the health of the economy when the government releases its closely watched employment report for August on Friday.
The Institute for Supply Management's index of manufacturing activity edged down to 50.6 from 50.9 in July, confounding economists' expectations of a drop to 48.5. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in the nation's factory sector.
A separate report from the Labor Department showed that initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 12,000, to 409,000. The drop in claims offered no sign layoffs have picked up because of slumping business and consumer confidence after a steep plunge in the stock market last month and Standard & Poor's decision to strip the nation of its AAA credit rating.
But claims are still above the 400,000 usually associated with a stable labor market, and crucial details of the I.S.M. survey, including production, new orders and employment, were weak.
''The I.S.M. survey is consistent with an economy staggering forward at a weak pace of growth. When the economy tips into recession, the I.S.M. index usually drops into the low 40s,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Mass.
Lingering weakness in the economy was underscored by nonfarm productivity falling at a 0.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter -- the biggest drop since the fourth quarter of 2008.
Normally, a slowdown in productivity suggests businesses have to add workers to meet production. But against the backdrop of slow economic growth, it implies businesses might have to cut costs to protect profits.
Businesses could already be facing some cost pressures. Unit labor costs grew at a 3.3 percent rate in the second quarter, a puzzling development given the high unemployment rate.
''In our view, the rise reflects a labor market that has less spare capacity than may be commonly perceived, in which case, rising labor costs are likely to continue,'' said Troy Davig, an economist at Barclays Capital in New York.
But the pace is still slower than the 6.2 percent rate in the first quarter, indicating wage pressures remain too contained to stoke a broader rise in inflation.
Finally, construction spending fell unexpectedly in July as public construction outlays dropped to their lowest level since December 2006 and private spending also sagged, the Commerce Department said.
Construction spending fell 1.3 percent, to an annual rate of $789.5 billion, the largest drop since January. However, June's construction spending was revised to a 1.6 percent increase rather than the previously reported 0.2 increase.
Economists had expected construction spending to rise 0.2 percent in July.

Cursing Irene for blowing your second-to-last summer weekend? Don't pack up your sundresses and swim trunks just yet. There's still time to kick away those fallen limbs, wipe that rain from your eyes and plunge once more into the (cheap) events that have made us lazy, hazy and crazy (in a good way) this summer.
The Museum of Modern Art may have raised its admission prices, but its extended summer hours (till 8:30 p.m., through Saturday) still get you a bargain in entertainment. Wait for tourists to head to their pre-theater dinners before popping in to see ''Talk to Me: Design and the Communication Between People and Objects,'' an interactive exhibition that opened to wide praise in July. Fans can live-stream a tour of the exhibition on their phones or computers free on Tuesday at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. 
Or skip the art and pick up tickets to the series Hot and Humid: Summer Films From the Archives. Movies like the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' (1968), Spike Lee's ''Do the Right Thing'' (1989) and Martin Scorsese's ''Taxi Driver'' (1976) run through Wednesday. (Films: $6 to $10; museum admission: $14 to $25; all free for those 16 and younger; 212-708-9400, moma.org.)
Over in Queens MoMA PS1's Warm Up series hosts its last parties in the courtyard. The London D.J. collective Horse Meat Disco; Midnight Magic, a disco funk ensemble; D.J. Justin Miller; and BICEP, an analog D.J. duo from Belfast, provide the music for your motion on Saturday. And on Sept. 10, PS 1 gets the last laugh on Irene by adding a party to make up for the canceled Aug. 27 show. ($15, cash only, free for Long Island City residents, 2 to 9 p.m.; 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens; 718-784-2084, ps1.org/warmup.)
SummerStage's season of free theater and performances in city parks ends on a dramatic note on Friday, with an all-female audience-interactive adaptation of Aeschylus' ''Seven Against Thebes,'' from the Faux-Real Theater Company. Check the Summerstage calendar for the dates of concerts (including the Charlie Parker Jazz Festival) that had to be rescheduled because of the storm. (Free, 8 p.m.; East River Park, enter at Delancey Street and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, Lower East Side; 212-360-2777, summerstage.org.)
It's natural to be down about losing those summer Friday hours. Sing your woes away at the Bell House's ''Moulin Rouge Sing-Along'' party on Saturday. Subtitles will help you remember the lovey-dovey, angst-ridden pop songs that made up the 2001 jukebox musical movie ''Moulin Rouge,'' as will several drinks, some of which will be free if you happen to win the Parisian costume contest, the ''Can-Can Dance-Off'' or the ''Songs of Moulin Rouge'' trivia contest. ($8, 7 to 10:30 p.m.)
The Bell House's Sunday event is a ''Take This Job and Shove It'' party, with entertainment from the Wasabassco Burlesque Show and songs for the workingman from Alex Battles and the Whisky Rebellion. ($10; free with your unemployment check stub; 149 Seventh Street, between Second and Third Avenues, Gowanus, Brooklyn; 718-643-6510, thebellhouseny.com.)
Tensions will be high this weekend when the Brooklyn Cyclones take on the Staten Island Yankees for the last time this season, with both teams hoping to win a spot in the minor league playoffs. Friday is the game to see, as no matter who wins, a fireworks show will follow. (Games are Friday through Sunday, in both Brooklyn and Staten Island: 718-720-9265, minorleaguebaseball.com, brooklyncyclones.com.)
An end and a beginning on Governors Island: the Rite of Summer Classical Music Festival closes on Sunday with a free program, ''String Force,'' featuring the program directors, Blair McMillen and Pam Goldberg, along with the violinists Miranda Cuckson and Nurit Pacht, playing violin and piano duets by John Adams, Sofia Gubaidulina, Manuel de Falla , Marc Mellits and others. (1 and 3 p.m., Colonels Row; 917-359-4449, riteofsummer.com.) Next up is the Governors Island Art Fair, which begins on Friday and runs every weekend in September. A collective based in Brooklyn, 4heads, will present pieces by artists who have been working on the island all summer. (Free, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; 4heads.org, govisland.com.)
City Winery hosts yet another collage of new talent in its ''backyard'' parking lot on Monday. The Fool's Gold Day-Off Party presents D.J.'s, rappers, drum machine artists and special guests who have not yet been revealed, taking the stage between 2 and 8 p.m. (Free; 155 Varick Street, near Spring Street, South Village, 212-608-0555, citywinery.com.)
Follow the Amateur Astronomers Association up to the High Line. The group offers guided star-gazing in the park beginning at dusk on Tuesdays, and this week may be one of your last chances to do it without shivering. Telescopes are usually placed near the 14th Street entrance or south of the Standard Hotel, which crosses over the platform near 13th Street.
You can also learn more about the transformation of the elevated railway platform into the High Line, the design of its horticulture and the art being shown there on a free guided tour at 6:30 p.m. Meet at the Chelsea Market Passage, on the High Line near 16th Street. (212-206-9922, aaa.org/highline, thehighline.org.)
Want to run away from work and join the circus? At the exhibition ''Circus! Science Under the Big Top'' at the New York Hall of Science visitors can test their balance on a tightrope; learn circus parlance; see what it takes to be a lion whisperer; and, perhaps the most difficult task of all, figure out how to make a corn dog. (Through Sunday; museum admission is free Friday, 2 to 5 p.m., and Sunday, 10 to 11 a.m., otherwise, $8 to $11; some activities, like tightrope walking, are $4; 47-01 111th Street, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens; 718-619-0005, nysci.org.)
And finally wash away the bitter memories of Irene with a quiet stroll through the Summer Seasonal Walk at the New York Botanical Garden. The designers Piet Oudolf and Jacqueline van der Kloet have created a naturalistic garden highlighting spring and summer bulbs, grasses and native plants of the area.
On Saturdays at 11 a.m. bring your binoculars to walk the grounds with Debbie Becker, the garden's bird expert, looking for migrating species. (Both walks are free, with museum admission, which is $8 to $20 for a late-summer all-garden pass; Bronx River Parkway, Exit 7W, Fordham Road, the Bronx; 718-817-8700, nybg.org.)

HEADLINE: Verizon's Tax Bill

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Two facts not mentioned in ''Where Pay for Chiefs Outstrips U.S. Taxes'' (Business Day, Aug. 31): Verizon's tax payments in 2010 totaled $430 million, and its total tax bill for 2010 was $2.5 billion, including $2.2 billion in federal income taxes. These are documented in our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Indeed, some tax payments have been deferred because of federal economic development policies that have accelerated Verizon's investment in America's technology infrastructure. In 2009 and 2010 alone, Verizon invested $33.3 billion in infrastructure -- sustaining jobs for Verizon union employees and creating jobs at other companies that rely on broadband communications.
Given this -- and the fact that our chief executive's 2010 compensation target was about 140 times lower than our tax bill -- it was regrettable to see Verizon featured in the article.
Despite the opinions of the article's source, the Institute for Policy Studies, identified as ''a liberal-leaning research group,'' Verizon fully complies with all tax laws and pays its fair share of taxes.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Set to Sue Dozen Big Banks Over mortgages

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
The federal agency that oversees the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is set to file suits against more than a dozen big banks, accusing them of misrepresenting the quality of mortgage securities they assembled and sold at the height of the housing bubble, and seeking billions of dollars in compensation.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency suits, which are expected to be filed in the coming days in federal court, are aimed at Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, among others, according to three individuals briefed on the matter.
The suits stem from subpoenas the finance agency issued to banks a year ago. If the case is not filed Friday, they said, it will come Tuesday, shortly before a deadline expires for the housing agency to file claims. 
The suits will argue the banks, which assembled the mortgages and marketed them as securities to investors, failed to perform the due diligence required under securities law and missed evidence that borrowers' incomes were inflated or falsified. When many borrowers were unable to pay their mortgages, the securities backed by the mortgages quickly lost value.
Fannie and Freddie lost more than $30 billion, in part as a result of the deals, losses that were borne mostly by taxpayers.
In July, the agency filed suit against UBS, another major mortgage securitizer, seeking to recover at least $900 million, and the individuals with knowledge of the case said the new litigation would be similar in scope.
Private holders of mortgage securities are already trying to force the big banks to buy back tens of billions in soured mortgage-backed bonds, but this federal effort is a new chapter in a huge legal fight that has alarmed investors in bank shares. In this case, rather than demanding that the banks buy back the original loans, the finance agency is seeking reimbursement for losses on the securities held by Fannie and Freddie.
The impending litigation underscores how almost exactly three years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the beginning of a financial crisis caused in large part by subprime lending, the legal fallout is mounting.
Besides the angry investors, 50 state attorneys general are in the final stages of negotiating a settlement to address abuses by the largest mortgage servicers, including Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup. The attorneys general, as well as federal officials, are pressing the banks to pay at least $20 billion in that case, with much of the money earmarked to reduce mortgages of homeowners facing foreclosure.
And last month, the insurance giant American International Group filed a $10 billion suit against Bank of America, accusing the bank and its Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch units of misrepresenting the quality of mortgages that backed the securities A.I.G. bought.
Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan all declined to comment. Frank Kelly, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank, said, ''We can't comment on a suit that we haven't seen and hasn't been filed yet.''
But privately, financial service industry executives argue that the losses on the mortgage-backed securities were caused by a broader downturn in the economy and the housing market, not by how the mortgages were originated or packaged into securities. In addition, they contend that investors like A.I.G. as well as Fannie and Freddie were sophisticated and knew the securities were not without risk.
Investors fear that if banks are forced to pay out billions of dollars for mortgages that later defaulted, it could sap earnings for years and contribute to further losses across the financial services industry, which has only recently regained its footing.
Bank officials also counter that further legal attacks on them will only delay the recovery in the housing market, which remains moribund, hurting the broader economy. Other experts warned that a series of adverse settlements costing the banks billions raises other risks, even if suits have legal merit.
The housing finance agency was created in 2008 and assigned to oversee the hemorrhaging government-backed mortgage companies, a process known as conservatorship.
''While I believe that F.H.F.A. is acting responsibly in its role as conservator, I am afraid that we risk pushing these guys off of a cliff and we're going to have to bail out the banks again,'' said Tim Rood, who worked at Fannie Mae until 2006 and is now a partner at the Collingwood Group, which advises banks and servicers on housing-related issues.
The suits are being filed now because regulators are concerned that it will be much harder to make claims after a three-year statute of limitations expires on Wednesday, the third anniversary of the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
While the banks put together tens of billions of dollars in mortgage securities backed by risky loans, the Federal Housing Finance Agency is not seeking the total amount in compensation because some of the mortgages are still good and the investments still carry some value. In the UBS suit, the agency said it owned $4.5 billion worth of mortgages, with losses totaling $900 million. Negotiations between the agency and UBS have yielded little progress.
The two mortgage giants acquired the securities in the years before the housing market collapsed as they expanded rapidly and looked for new investments that were seemingly safe. At issue in this case are so-called private-label securities that were backed by subprime and other risky loans but were rated as safe AAA investments by the ratings agencies.
In the years before 2007, ''the market was so frothy then it was hard to find good quality loans to securitize and hold in your portfolio,'' said David Felt, a lawyer who served as deputy general counsel of the finance agency until January 2010. ''Fannie and Freddie thought they were taking AAA tranches, and like so many investors, they were surprised when they didn't turn out to be such quality investments.''
Fannie and Freddie had other reasons to buy the securities, Mr. Rood added. For starters, they carried higher yields at a time when the two mortgage giants could buy them using money borrowed at rock-bottom rates, thanks to the implicit federal guarantee they enjoyed.
In addition, by law Fannie and Freddie were required to back loans to low-to-moderate income and minority borrowers, and the private-label securities were counted toward those goals.
''Competitive pressures and onerous housing goals compelled them to operate more like hedge funds than government-sponsored guarantors, '' Mr. Rood said.
In fact, Freddie was warned by regulators in 2006 that its purchases of subprime securities had outpaced its risk management abilities, but the company continued to load up on debt that ultimately soured.
As of June 30, Freddie Mac holds more than $80 billion in mortgage securities backed by more shaky home loans like subprime mortgages, Option ARM and Alt-A loans. Freddie estimates its total gross losses stand at roughly $19 billion. Fannie Mae holds $38 billion of securities backed by Alt-A and subprime loans, with losses standing at nearly $14 billion.

HEADLINE: Balancing Act For President

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Anticipation of President Obama's plan for creating jobs while cutting deficits, now heightened by the scheduling controversy over his prime time address to Congress next Thursday, has turned on a question: Will he go big and highlight his sharp differences with Republicans, or will he be pragmatic and downsize his ideas to get Republican votes?
The challenge for Mr. Obama is that he must do both. 
Despite Republican opposition to spending measures or tax cuts to spur job creation and economic growth, the president is under pressure to fight for a significant stimulus program. The demands come not only from Democrats, but also from many economists, financial analysts and executives who fear a relapse into recession.
But as administration officials are well aware, another display of partisan gridlock this fall could again provoke a downgrade of the United States' credit and market upheavals that would further batter consumer confidence.
Mr. Obama has said bipartisanship is his aim. Yet even the president's letter asking to address Congress next Wednesday provoked sparring. House Speaker John A. Boehner insisted on the following day, and more than 24 hours later extended the official invitation, which the White House immediately accepted. The embarrassing episode bodes badly for the reception that Mr. Obama's ideas will receive, and for the parties' ability to reach a much more difficult agreement on budget priorities by December as required in the deficit reduction deal last month.
''It is my intention,'' the president wrote, ''to lay out a series of bipartisan proposals that the Congress can take immediately to continue to rebuild the American economy by strengthening small businesses, helping Americans get back to work and putting more money in the paychecks of the middle class and working Americans, while still reducing our deficit and getting our fiscal house in order.''
People familiar with the White House's planning say Mr. Obama will focus in his speech on the specifics of his immediate job-creation plans, but leave the details of his longer-term deficit reduction program for later. They say he does not want to dilute the political impact of his jobs message with controversies, especially with his Democratic base, over deficit-reduction ideas like raising the eligibility age for future Medicare recipients.
The signals from the White House suggest that Mr. Obama's agenda will not be so bold as to satisfy many liberals clamoring for New Deal-style programs. On Tuesday, 68 progressive groups wrote to Mr. Obama urging him ''to move beyond these half-measures designed to appeal to a narrow ideological minority who have repeatedly shown their unwillingness to negotiate.''
Still, they say Mr. Obama's plan will be far more ambitious than would have been expected just months ago, given the weakened economy. He has concluded, Democrats say, that Republicans will oppose anything he proposes, and with an election looming, Mr. Obama must make clear what he stands for.
Expected among those stimulus proposals is an extension for another year of the payroll tax cut for workers that Mr. Obama and Republicans agreed to last December, which has meant $1,000 more this year for the average family. Mr. Obama has been considering whether to seek an expansion of the payroll tax cut for employers. And he is expected to propose a separate tax credit for employers who increase their payrolls.
The total cost could reach several hundred billion dollars. But the White House figures that tax cuts have the best chance of Republican support.
Yet Republicans say they oppose another round of stimulus measures, a stance consistent with their argument that Mr. Obama's original $800 billion stimulus package was a failure. And despite their party's longstanding support of tax cuts, Republican leaders say they are opposed to any revenue-losing proposals unless they are offset by equal spending cuts -- a condition they did not make for extending the Bush-era tax cuts.
That sets up an opportunity, as Democrats see it, to saddle Republicans with the blame for a weak economy.
''The president wants to work with Republicans and Democrats to create jobs and grow the economy,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director. ''If nothing happens, it will be because Republicans in Congress made a conscious decision to do nothing. And that is a choice that will have tremendous consequences for the country.''
Mr. Obama also will propose added spending that Republicans are even more certain to oppose.
Much of the money would go to infrastructure projects. Mr. Obama is expected to again propose an infrastructure bank to support work on roads, bridges, airports, schools and other public works. Because such a bank would take up to 18 months to get under way, Mr. Obama has indicated he will propose other innovative ways to support such work quickly.
To hold down overall federal costs, and to avoid having to go to Congress, Mr. Obama and his advisers have been looking for ways to divert existing government money to purposes that will create jobs, especially in the hard-hit construction industry. School repairs and retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency will be a focus. And Mr. Obama is expected to argue that to the extent that states and local governments are relieved of school construction costs, they must avoid further layoffs of teachers.
For the long-term unemployed, the White House is considering a program like one in Georgia, which had Republican support there. The idea is to find temporary jobs for people at no expense to employers, providing them with on-the-job training while they receive unemployment compensation or a government stipend, in hopes of ultimately getting hired or finding a similar job elsewhere.
''It's very important for the president to set forth his vision,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee. ''I don't think he should limit his vision to what may or may not pass the House of Representatives.''

HEADLINE: Eric And Irene

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
''Have you left no sense of decency?'' That's the question Joseph Welch famously asked Joseph McCarthy, as the red-baiting demagogue tried to ruin yet another innocent citizen. And these days, it's the question I find myself wanting to ask Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, who has done more than anyone else to make policy blackmail -- using innocent Americans as hostages -- standard operating procedure for the G.O.P.
A few weeks ago, Mr. Cantor was the hard man in the confrontation over the debt ceiling; he was willing to endanger America's financial credibility, putting our whole economy at risk, in order to extract budget concessions from President Obama. Now he's doing it again, this time over disaster relief, making headlines by insisting that any federal aid to the victims of Hurricane Irene be offset by cuts in other spending. In effect, he is threatening to take Irene's victims hostage. 
Mr. Cantor's critics have been quick to accuse him of hypocrisy, and with good reason. After all, he and his Republican colleagues showed no comparable interest in paying for the Bush administration's huge unfunded initiatives. In particular, they did nothing to offset the cost of the Iraq war, which now stands at $800 billion and counting.
And it turns out that in 2004, when his home state of Virginia was struck by Tropical Storm Gaston, Mr. Cantor voted against a bill that would have required the same pay-as-you-go rule that he now advocates.
But, as I see it, hypocrisy is a secondary issue here. The primary issue should be the extraordinary nihilism now on display by Mr. Cantor and his colleagues -- their willingness to flout all the usual conventions of fair play and, well, decency in order to get what they want.
Not long ago, a political party seeking to change U.S. policy would try to achieve that goal by building popular support for its ideas, then implementing those ideas through legislation. That, after all, is how our political system was designed to work.
But today's G.O.P. has decided to bypass all that and go for a quicker route. Never mind getting enough votes to pass legislation; it gets what it wants by threatening to hurt America if its demands aren't met. That's what happened with the debt-ceiling fight, and now it's what's happening over disaster aid. In effect, Mr. Cantor and his allies are threatening to take hurricane victims hostage, using their suffering as a bargaining chip.
Of course, Mr. Cantor would have you believe that he's just trying to be fiscally responsible. But that's no more than a cover story.
Should disaster aid, as a matter of sound public finance, be offset by immediate cuts in other spending? No. The time-honored principle, backed by economists right and left, is that temporary bursts of spending -- which usually arise when there's a war to fight, but can also arise from other causes, including financial crises and natural disasters -- are a good reason to run temporary budget deficits. Rather than imposing sharp cuts in other spending or sharply raising taxes, governments can and should spread the burden over time, borrowing now and repaying gradually via a combination of lower spending and higher taxes.
But can the U.S. government borrow to pay for disaster aid? Isn't the government broke? Yes, it can, and, no, it isn't. America has a long-run deficit problem, which should be met with long-run budget measures. But it's having no problem at all borrowing to pay for current expenses. Moreover, it's able to borrow funds at extremely low interest rates. Notably, right now the interest rate on the benchmark 10-year U.S. government bond is only slightly more than half what it was in 2004 when Mr. Cantor felt that it wasn't necessary to pay for disaster relief.
So the claim that fiscal responsibility requires immediate spending cuts to offset the cost of disaster relief is just wrong, in both theory and practice. As I said, it's just a cover story for the real game being played here.
Now, Mr. Cantor may end up backing down on this one, if only because several of the hard-hit states have Republican governors, who want and need aid soon, without strings attached. But that won't put an end to the larger issue: What will happen to America now that people like Mr. Cantor are calling the shots for one of its two major political parties?
And, yes, I mean one of our parties. There are plenty of bad things to be said about the Democrats, who have their fair share of cynics and careerists. There may even be Democrats in Congress who would be as willing as Mr. Cantor to advance their goals through sabotage and blackmail (although I can't think of any). But, if they exist, they aren't in important leadership positions. Mr. Cantor is. And that should worry anyone who cares about our nation's future.

HEADLINE: The Vigorous Virtues

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
There's a specter haunting American politics: national decline. Is America on the way down, and, if so, what can be done about it?
The Republicans, and Rick Perry in particular, have a reasonably strong story to tell about decline. America became great, they explain, because its citizens possessed certain vigorous virtues: self-reliance, personal responsibility, industriousness and a passion for freedom.
But, over the years, government has grown and undermined these virtues. Wall Street financiers no longer have to behave prudently because they know government will bail them out. Middle-class families no longer have to practice thrift because they know they can use government to force future generations to pay for their retirements. Dads no longer have to marry the women they impregnate because government will step in and provide support. 
Moreover, a growing government sucked resources away from the most productive parts of the economy -- innovators, entrepreneurs and workers -- and redirected it to the most politically connected parts. The byzantine tax code and regulatory state has clogged the arteries of American dynamism.
The current task, therefore, is, as Rick Perry says, to make the government ''inconsequential'' in people's lives -- to pare back the state to revive personal responsibility and private initiative.
There's much truth to this narrative. Stable societies are breeding grounds for interest groups. Over time, these interest groups use government to establish sinecures for themselves, which gradually strangle the economy they are built on -- like parasitic vines around a tree.
Yet as great as the need is to streamline, reform and prune the state, that will not be enough to restore America's vigorous virtues. This is where current Republican orthodoxy is necessary but insufficient. There are certain tasks ahead that cannot be addressed simply by getting government out of the way.
In the first place, there is the need to rebuild America's human capital. The United States became the wealthiest nation on earth primarily because Americans were the best educated.
That advantage has entirely eroded over the past 30 years. It will take an active government to reverse this stagnation -- from prenatal and early childhood education straight up through adult technical training and investments in scientific and other research. If government is ''inconsequential'' in this sphere, then continued American decline is inevitable.
Then there are the long-term structural problems plaguing the economy. There's strong evidence to suggest that the rate of technological innovation has been slowing down. In addition, America is producing fewer business start-ups. Job creation was dismal even in the seven years before the recession, when taxes were low and Republicans ran the regulatory agencies. As economist Michael Spence has argued, nearly all of the job growth over the past 20 years has been in sectors where American workers don't have to compete with workers overseas.
Meanwhile, middle-class wages have been stagnant for a generation. Inequality is rising, and society is stratifying. Americans are less likely to move in search of opportunity. Social mobility has been flat for decades, and American social mobility is no better than European social mobility.
Some of these problems are exacerbated by government regulations and could be eased if government pulled back. But most of them have nothing to do with government and are related to globalization, an aging society, cultural trends and the nature of technological change.
Republicans have done almost nothing to grapple with and address these deeper structural problems. Tackling them means shifting America's economic model -- tilting the playing field away from consumption toward production; away from entitlement spending and more toward investment in infrastructure, skills and technology; mitigating those forces that concentrate wealth and nurturing instead a broad-based opportunity society.
These shifts cannot be done by government alone, but they can't be done without leadership from government. Just as the Washington and Lincoln administrations actively nurtured an industrial economy, so some future American administration will have to nurture a globalized producer society. Just as F.D.R. created a welfare model for the 20th century, some future administration will have to actively champion a sustainable welfare model for this one.
Finally, there is the problem of the social fabric. Segmented societies do not thrive, nor do ones, like ours, with diminishing social trust. Nanny-state government may have helped undermine personal responsibility and the social fabric, but that doesn't mean the older habits and arrangements will magically regrow simply by reducing government's role. For example, there has been a tragic rise in single parenthood, across all ethnic groups, but family structures won't spontaneously regenerate without some serious activism, from both religious and community groups and government agencies.
In short, the current Republican policy of negativism -- cut, cut cut -- is not enough. To restore the vigorous virtues, the nanny state will have to be cut back, but the instigator state will have to be built up. That's the only way to ward off national decline.

HEADLINE: Russia Recognizes Libya Rebels as World Leaders Meet

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Michael Schwirtz contributed reporting from Moscow.

 BODY:
PARIS -- As world leaders gathered on Thursday for a major conference to try to consolidate international support and reconstruction aid for Libya, Russia recognized the fledgling rebel government despite its opposition to the NATO bombing campaign.
The conference, on the 42nd anniversary of the coup that brought Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi to power, will be attended by the two main leaders of the Transitional National Council and some 60 delegations. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will attend, as will representatives of Russia, China and Germany. Those three countries did not support the NATO operation or criticized it.
''Our country established and has maintained diplomatic relations with Libya since Sept. 4, 1955, and has never broken them regardless of what kind of government was in power in Tripoli,'' Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday.
Russia's president, Dmitri A. Medvedev had said earlier that Moscow would withhold official recognition until it appeared the rebels could unite Libya under their leadership. Moscow had been pressing for a negotiated settlement of the conflict and on several occasions had dispatched envoys to meet with leaders on both sides. 
Russia, joined by China, refused to support sanctions against the Qaddafi regime. Russia had criticized the NATO bombing campaign as overstepping a United Nations resolution aimed at protecting civilians.
On the eve of the conference, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France praised the working of the NATO alliance in support of the rebels, calling it ''an indispensable tool'' despite Washington's decision to take a back seat in the war.
''For the first time since 1949 NATO was put at the service of a coalition led by two determined European countries, France and Great Britain,'' Mr. Sarkozy told French ambassadors and other dignitaries on Wednesday in a wide-ranging hourlong speech at the Elysee Palace, an annual occasion to set the themes of French diplomacy that was more pointed than usual, with presidential elections next year.
Mr. Sarkozy, as ever, was passionate about his government's accomplishments, both in helping oust the defeated president of Ivory Coast, Laurent Gbagbo, five months ago, and now Colonel Qaddafi in Libya. He was also defiant about the need to aggressively meet the economic and political challenges of the future. It was vital to act, he said, ''not submit.''
Libya was a particularly fierce point of pride, where the bombing campaign did halt an anticipated massacre of rebels, in contrast to the Bosnian wars, when United Nations troops were unable to stop the killings of 7,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica. Mr. Sarkozy said Libya proved ''a strong contrast'' to past European weakness, and justified his decision to integrate France into NATO's military command in 2009, ending the long separation initiated by de Gaulle.
Recalling the complaints that ''France would lose its independence'' and ''its image would be destroyed in the Third World,'' he said, ''Our Libyan friends ask every day for more action from NATO!''
A senior French official called the transition to a legitimate political leadership in Libya vital, adding that ''there is a risk that the transition will fail.''
In Iraq, the official said, ''there was a successful military operation and a failed transition.'' In Libya, he said, the new leaders would have to be more autonomous. ''It is they who know what is good for the Libyan people, and we are there to listen to them, to help them,'' he said.
Europe must focus more on its military abilities, Mr. Sarkozy said. ''President Obama has presented a new vision of U.S. military engagement that implies that the Europeans must assume more of their responsibilities,'' Mr. Sarkozy said. ''If we don't draw the necessary conclusions, Europe will wake up to a difficult reality.''
He praised Arab youths' desire for liberty and democracy, and the ability of French diplomacy to rebound from a late start in support of the Arab Spring. The comments referred to the period in which his country remained supportive of the Tunisian leader, even as he was being toppled, and was slow to recognize the Egyptian revolt.
At a time of rising concerns over illegal migration, he called for partnership with all the countries of the Mediterranean, calling it both the obligation and the future for Europe.
On the Middle East stalemate, Mr. Sarkozy said negotiation efforts led by the United States had reached a dead end and should be rethought. He said he hoped that all 27 member nations of the European Union could find a common position at the United Nations on the Palestinian effort to get recognition as a de facto state. He did not say what the position should be.
For Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, whom Mr. Sarkozy had once courted (as he had Colonel Qaddafi), he had harsh words, saying that the Syrian leader had caused ''irreparable'' damage to his credibility and that France would do everything ''legally permissible'' to bring about his downfall and the Syrian people's aspirations to freedom and democracy.
''The powers in Damascus are wrong to think they are protected by the people,'' he said. But while France supports stronger economic sanctions against Syria, it opposes any military action, as in Libya, without a clear mandate from the United Nations Security Council, where Russia and China have refused to even consider economic sanctions against Damascus.
Mr. Sarkozy also issued a strong warning to Iran, saying that its continuing enrichment of uranium and its missile program could bring about ''a pre-emptive attack,'' presumably by Israel. Iran's ''military, nuclear and ballistic ambitions constitute a growing threat that may lead to a pre-emptive attack against Iranian sites that would provoke a major crisis that France wants to avoid at all costs,'' Mr. Sarkozy said, blaming Iran for refusing to negotiate seriously about its growing nuclear stockpile.
France has been a fierce critic of Tehran's nuclear program, even as it urged Israel to stop all settlement activity and negotiate seriously for a two-state solution.
Acknowledging Germany's central role in calming Europe's lengthy financial turmoil, he thanked the chancellor, Angela Merkel, for her support in helping preserve the troubled euro and for backing the idea of a balanced-budget amendment for the 17 countries using it.
He also noted France's central role, as the current president of the Group of 20 large economies. France will push at a summit meeting in November ''a plan of action for growth, including precise and concrete commitments from the main economies,'' he said, calling on all countries, in particular China, to promote imports for domestic consumption in the face of a major global slowdown.
Mr. Sarkozy seemed slightly distracted as he spoke. A new book charges that a judge heard unsworn testimony from a nurse of the L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt that he received campaign cash from Mrs. Bettencourt in 2007, a charge that the Elysee Palace denied fiercely.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. vs. Obama: Disrespect or Just Politics?

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Helene Cooper contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- American presidents often have highly disagreeable relationships with members of Congress from the opposing party.
When she was House speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California verbally tormented President George W. Bush. (Ms. Pelosi's description of Mr. Bush as ''an incompetent leader'' comes to mind.) Dick Armey, a Republican former lawmaker from Texas and now a Tea Party leader, referred derisively to Bill Clinton as ''your president'' when speaking to Democrats. President Ronald Reagan sparred often with Democrats on the Hill.
While most of those fights stemmed from deep policy divides, the relentless acrimony between President Obama and Congressional Republicans also seems strikingly personal, almost petty. 
And Democrats worry that Mr. Obama, hampered, too, by his own inexperience and dispassionate style, is increasingly weakened by what they fume is a party that fundamentally disrespects him and his office. They fear the outcome as Congress and the White House face off on a host of new issues: the national deficit and finishing this year's budget, reauthorization of a controversial federal aviation bill and the fate of the cash-strapped Postal Service. The relationship was foreshadowed in 2009 when Representative Joe Wilson, a South Carolina Republican, yelled ''You lie!'' during a presidential address to Congress -- a remarkably rare outburst on the House floor. Since then, Congressional Republicans have turned down requests for White House meetings, refused to return the president's call and walked out of budget talks.
Then, on Wednesday, Speaker John A. Boehner became what historians say was the first ever to tell a sitting president that no, he could not deliver an address to a joint session of Congress on the date of his choice. On Thursday, Representative Joe Walsh said in a Twitter message that he would fly home to Illinois rather than serve as ''a prop of another one of the president's speeches.''
It seems they simply do not like the man.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, said this year that his first goal was to see Mr. Obama defeated.
''The closest we have come to this was Tom DeLay's hatred for Clinton when he demanded impeachment of him,'' said Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group. ''But that was one guy or a handful. Now it is much more widespread, and the toxicity is, and culture is different now.''
Mr. Ornstein pointed to the fight over the payroll tax cut sought by the Obama administration -- one that many Congressional Republicans supported in 2009 but oppose now -- as an example of Republicans' opposing Mr. Obama even when they had agreed with him on a policy. Mr. Obama has had his own contributing role. Often when he has met with Republicans he has taken a scolding tone that irks them. Even some of his fellow Democrats viewed his attempt to schedule an address on job creation before a joint session of Congress next Wednesday -- the same night as a major Republican presidential debate -- as clumsy if not downright rude. It then became embarrassing when Mr. Obama capitulated and changed the date to Thursday at 7 p.m., as Mr. Boehner wanted.
But the dynamic, which Democrats largely blame Republicans for, has irked many of them, especially on the Hill. ''I think it is unprecedented of a leader in the Senate of either party to say the most important goal he has is to make the current president a one-term,'' said Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California. ''That is about respect, that is about priorities and it is just wrong.''
Julian E. Zelizer, a political scientist at Princeton, said that when it comes to Mr. Obama, Republicans ''just keep gaining confidence to force his hand.''
''While there might be a few people whose words have become nastier than usual, I think this is really the new normal in Washington with a president who is always on the ropes,'' Professor Zelizer said. ''I am not convinced that is about lack of respect so much as the feeling that this is a weak president. If the president seemed more powerful they would have returned the call.''
Indeed, Mr. Boehner's spokesman, Kevin Smith, said there was nothing personal about the disputes. ''While they may have different visions for the role of government in our country,'' Mr. Smith said, ''the speaker has great respect for the president, likes him personally and looks forward to hearing his speech next week.''
The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said Thursday that the administration spent ''zero'' time worrying about whether Republicans in Congress are showing the president the respect that the office deserves. ''You guys care much more about this than we do,'' he scolded reporters who asked about the relationship between Mr. Obama and Congressional Republicans.
The president himself eschews making things personal, so his aides follow suit -- at least when it comes to any hint that his critics' attacks are for reasons other than his policies.
There is the persistent and deeply uncomfortable question of race. Many African-Americans, including black lawmakers, and even white Democrats, have complained that some of the disrespect for Mr. Obama stems from distaste among some whites at the idea of seeing a black man in the Oval Office.
''I think people want to not deal with that issue,'' said Representative Raul M. Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona. ''But I think, like it or not, some of the disrespect -- and I stress some, not all -- stems from the discomfort of having a person of color be president of the United States.''
Many Republican members ''don't respect him,'' Mr. Grijalva said, adding, ''Not even in our worst days as Democrats did we demean and attempt to cripple the office of president.''
Mr. Grijalva and Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota have sent a letter pressing Mr. Obama to be ''bold'' in his address to Congress on Thursday on job creation and the economy.
It has been frustrating, especially to the more liberal corners of the Democratic Party, including Mr. Grijalva, that Mr. Obama has not taken on his opponents more forcefully. ''I support him,'' he said of Mr. Obama, ''but he has got to take the fight to them.''
But White House officials, echoing their boss's aversion to suggestions of racism, never play that card, not even in private conversations with reporters.
One administration official said that Mr. Obama ''made it clear'' when he came into office ''that there wouldn't be people crying wolf on race every day.''

HEADLINE: Unlike Bachmann, PAC Is Willing to Attack Perry

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
7:45 p.m. Updated When Representative Michele Bachmann hits the campaign trail, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. 
Mrs. Bachmann never mentions her rival Mr. Perry, who in a matter of weeks since he entered the Republican race for the 2012 nomination has captured a fair share of her Tea Party base.
But a political action committee that supports Mrs. Bachmann is not nearly so discreet. An advertisement it has created attacks Mr. Perry for raising spending in Texas and borrowing to cover deficits. ''There is an honest conservative,'' the ad concludes, ''and she's not Rick Perry.''
Bob Harris, a founder of Keep Conservatives United, an independent group that created the spot, said it will begin airing Wednesday on television stations in South Carolina. The ad opens with an image of Gov. Perry in a cowboy hat and the question, ''Tea Party Guy?''
Mr. Harris, who said he has no connection with the Bachmann campaign, said he acted because Mr. Perry had upstaged Mrs. Bachmann's victory in the much-watched Iowa straw poll Aug. 13. ''He hurt her momentum coming out of Iowa, and I don't think anyone responded to it until now,'' he said.
Mr. Perry's campaign hit back hard Thursday afternoon, disputing point by point what it called false claims in the ad. ''Gov. Perry is a proven fiscal conservative,'' his spokesman, Ray Sullivan, said in a statement.
The ad asserts that state spending in Texas doubled since Mr. Perry became governor in 2000.
The governor's campaign responded that the state budget passed for the for the two-year period 2012-13 is $80.5 billion, up from $55.7 billion in 2000-01. But those figures, it said, are not adjusted for inflation and population growth.
The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that using adjusted figures, state spending under Mr. Perry has increased 4.2 percent every two years, faster than inflation and population increases -- but the portion of the budget over which the governor has most influence, general revenue spending, did fall over the past decade, adjusted for inflation and population growth.
The attack ad is evidence that the Republican race is entering a new phase as the field -- particularly the most conservative candidates all seeking Tea Party support -- attempt to sharp draw distinction with their rivals. The sparks will no doubt continue flying when Mr. Perry makes his first appearance in a national debate of the candidates Sept. 7.
The ad is also a sign of things to come, as such so-called super PACs, which can raise unlimited funds, ramp up their activity and begin spending the millions of dollars they have already raised for this presidential campaign.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Emanuel Puts His Stamp On a Daley Tradition

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
James Warren writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative.
The early adventures of Rahm Emanuel brought the improbable on Wednesday night: The new Chicago mayor deflating much of the energy out of a raucous ritual.
Our impressive, born-again triathlete followed in his predecessor's footsteps by holding two public meetings on the coming city budget. If there is doubt about there being a new sheriff in town, it was dispelled in a disarmingly brief 90 minutes.
During the 22-year reign of Richard M. Daley, these gatherings were untidy, repetitive and occasionally disrespectful to the mayor. Mr. Daley stoically served as a pinata as citizens vented for two or three hours on everything: trimming trees in a nearby park, fixing a catch basin down the block, a mean Park District field house employee, buying electrocardiogram machines for a health clinic, banning drivers from speeding down alleys. 
The sessions had a democratic richness. They were a reminder of how matters convulsing editorial pages or City Hall can be out of whack with what folks at the grass roots are mulling.
On Wednesday, the gym at Malcolm X College hosted Mr. Emanuel's second meeting, and both the stagecraft and atmospherics were quite different.
Mr. Daley's cabinet would sit at either side of him at long tables, and Mr. Daley would let anybody line up at a microphone and fire away. Mr. Emanuel, in presidential fashion, used a raised platform and a lectern with the city seal. This was his show, about him, with the cabinet below and scattered among rows to his left, an appendage.
The questions were largely preselected from ones written earlier by attendees, with a few fetched online from a city Web site.
A fatigued Mr. Emanuel, whose workaholic ways make him a better performer during daylight hours, left no doubt about his agenda: an insult-free, civil discussion about needed change, especially economic. We've deceived ourselves, he said, with dishonest budgets, illusory fixes and false accounting.
It is a candidly blunt analysis that melds with his extraordinary vitality. But there is also a penchant for White House-like control and aversion to surprises that at times seems needless, given Mr. Emanuel's intellect, grasp of detail and improving performance skills.
Thus, the first question selected was a softball: What are his plans for the public schools? It was followed by more nonthreatening queries that allowed the mayor to tick off points he wanted to make, as if at a campaign appearance.
What were his thoughts on economic development? What about switching to a grid system for garbage collection rather than keeping the ward tradition?
Mr. Emanuel has a challenge in sensitizing the body politic to the realities of scarcity. He's trying to hammer home his admonition about change, while assiduously creating an image of being tough, capable and unrelenting.
But, as he evinced slight impatience with the few short moments of indecorous behavior from a quietly frustrated crowd, I recalled the old line about the harried American who runs up the steps of the Louvre in Paris and asks a guard, ''Where's the Mona Lisa? I'm double-parked.''
The mayor and his aides need not be so mindful of orchestration, so wary of the unpredictable. It's an executive reflex that can breed an internal culture of anxiety, in which managers wind up afraid of making decisions lest they err and incur the boss's disfavor.
A heavily union audience did get in fleeting swipes about tax increment financing, laid-off crossing guards and teacher pay. And a rare unscripted question -- from a teenage girl, about too many people hanging out around liquor stores in her neighborhood -- elicited the mayor's best response as he smartly weaved together cultural, economic and sociological factors to lament the existence of too many liquor stores, too few quality groceries.
But the gathering was pretty uninspired, so I leafed through the mayor's just-announced 10th anniversary selection for the Daley-inspired One Book, One Chicago program, ''The Adventures of Augie March'' by Saul Bellow.
Mr. Emanuel had called the protagonist a ''true son of Chicago.'' That's correct, though Augie himself is out of sync with Chicago's tradition of big ideas and deeds invoked by the mayor on Wednesday.
And beyond the fact that they're both Jewish, the novel's protagonist and the force-of-nature mayor have few similarities. Augie, who's moved to place more stock in respect than in love, is a pretty passive fellow.
And, as Mr. Bellow said, he has a ''weak sense of consequences.'' Mr. Emanuel clearly does not, and that is good for the city.

HEADLINE: Libya's Supporters Gather in Paris to Help Ease New Government's Transition

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
PARIS -- With Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi effectively overthrown, representatives of some 60 nations gathered here Thursday to help the new Libyan authorities navigate a fraught transition and restore stability and a functioning economy to a country ravaged by rebellion and 42 years of dictatorship. The specter of the quagmire of Iraq kept the tenor of the day hopeful but cautious.
There was also concern over preserving potentially lucrative oil deals made under the Qaddafi government, and an undercurrent of economic competition for the contracts that will have to go out for the reconstruction and restoration of Libya's tattered infrastructure -- oil, gas, utilities, housing and the like.
Rebel leaders have promised to honor existing deals, most of them with Italian and French oil and gas companies. They have also said that in the future they would favor countries that had helped them defeat Colonel Qaddafi, a stance that would lift Britain, France and the United States ahead of those nations that objected to the NATO bombing campaign, including Russia, China and Germany. 
In comments made to French radio ahead of the international conference here, France's foreign minister, Alain Juppe, called the rebel position ''fair and logical.'' He said that the priority was to help the new government with humanitarian needs and the restoration of water, fuel and power, but he added that investment opportunities were a factor.
''You know this operation in Libya costs a lot,'' Mr. Juppe told RTL radio. ''It's also an investment in the future because a democratic Libya is a country that will develop, offering stability, security and development in the region.''
In what seemed a clear effort to sidestep the mistakes of postwar Iraq, there was no rush to send foreign troops to Libya. But the United Nations was asked to organize a technical mission to Libya to help with matters from policing to technical aid.
The conference, which included the United Nations and nine other multinational organizations, was convened by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, who had jointly pressed for military intervention and whose air forces have flown many of the bombing runs that protected rebels and enabled them to seize the capital, Tripoli.
The conference took place on the 42nd anniversary of the 1969 coup that brought Colonel Qaddafi to power, which one of Libya's representatives, Mahmoud Jibril, said was an important marker for the Libyan people, especially with the colonel and at least two of his sons now in hiding and still trying to avoid surrender.
Mr. Jibril is the prime minister of the rebels' Transitional National Council; he and the council's chairman, Mustafa Abdel- Jalil, laid out the new government's need for reconstruction aid and technical assistance.
Mr. Jalil said that Libyans had made a wager on the world's support, but that ''the world bet on the Libyans, and the Libyans showed their courage and made their dream real.''
The council is the dominant rebel organization, recognized as Libya's government by some 70 nations, but it faces an uphill battle for broad legitimacy in a country splintered by tribal and regional interests. Even the rebel militias who beat the Qaddafi loyalists with the vital aid of NATO aircraft, trainers and weapons supplies have varying loyalties and do not yet see themselves as ''a coherent army,'' a senior French official said.
NATO countries also wanted to hear Libyans' assessment of the situation around major the remaining Qaddafi strongholds, like Surt and Sabha, and of their plans for Colonel Qaddafi if captured. The Transitional National Council may seek short-term loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, American officials said. But as a nation with a small population and a great deal of oil to sell, Libya is expected to be able to finance its own reconstruction.
The Libyans have been pressing for the release of the Qaddafi government's assets frozen at the beginning of the conflict, to pay salaries and restore services and oil production.
Western countries have been pushing the United Nations Security Council to release such assets, particularly cash, and several billion dollars has been released: the United States is releasing $1.5 billion, of which $700 million has been delivered, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said; Britain is freeing $1.6 billion, some of it in huge blocks of Libyan bank notes flown in by the Royal Air Force; and on Thursday, France was authorized to release $2.2 billion. Estimates of the global total vary from $50 billion to $150 billion.
Mrs. Clinton held separate talks on Thursday with Mr. Sarkozy, the Libyan delegation and the Turkish foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, with whom she discussed the Syrian crackdown. The Turks have said they are out of patience with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, but have not called for him to resign, as Washington has.
With the Libyans, Mrs. Clinton emphasized the American willingness to help build ''Libya tomorrow,'' based on reconciliation and transparency, with democratic rights for all citizens, including women, and ''free from extremism,'' according to a senior State Department official. She called for the Libyan seat at the United Nations General Assembly to be transferred to the interim government. She underscored the American view that Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi -- the Libyan convicted for the 1988 Lockerbie bombing and released from a Scottish jail in 2009 to die, but who remains alive in Tripoli -- should be reimprisoned. ''Justice was aborted,'' she said.
In a statement, Mrs. Clinton said ''it is vital that Libya's transition proceed in a spirit of national reconciliation and justice, not retribution or reprisal.''
''Libya's new leadership will need to continue to stand against violent extremism and work with us to ensure that weapons from Qaddafi's stockpiles do not threaten Libya's neighbors and the world.''
Mr. Jalil laid out the council's plan of action in Libya, which includes a democratic transition and a new constitution. Mr. Jibril outlined a procedure for a new government that would begin with an assembly of Libyans from all major cities, towns and regions to elect a group to write a new constitution and name a transitional government.
The draft constitution will be put to a referendum by Libyans, and new elections overseen by United Nations observers will take place within four months for a new parliament and a new government to replace the transitional one, Mr. Jibril said. The process is supposed to take no more than 18 months.
In another important sign of the legitimacy of the Transitional National Council, countries that did not support the United Nations-mandated war in Libya -- notably Russia, China, Germany and Algeria -- all sent delegations or observers here. South Africa, however, did not, in protest, President Jacob Zuma said, of what he called NATO's violation of the Security Council resolution mandating the use of force to protect civilians.

HEADLINE: Oh, Grow Up: Americans want to hear how President Obama, and Congress, plan to fix the economy

 BODY:
Whenever we think Washington couldn't get more cynical or more craven, it proves us wrong. So we will resist the temptation to say it's hard to imagine anything more base than the food fight over President Obama's planned speech to Congress. 
The contemptuous reaction from the House speaker, John Boehner, to the president's request to address a joint session next Wednesday -- the day Congress returns from its summer recess -- was appalling. No matter how he feels about Mr. Obama personally or politically, there can be no excuse for his lack of respect for the office, to which he is second in the line of succession. And it was distressing to watch President Obama fail, once again, to stand up to an opposition that won't brook the smallest compromise.
What made this even more appalling is that the president will be speaking on the country's most pressing problem -- the need to create jobs and stave off another destructive recession.
Mr. Obama's request should have been routine. And The Times on Thursday quoted a White House official as saying it was: Obama aides consulted Boehner aides and then sent a formal request for a joint session on Wednesday. But Mr. Boehner said the date wasn't convenient, a rebuff of the chief executive that the Senate historian's office said seemed unprecedented.
It's possible that the White House failed to seek Mr. Boehner's back-room agreement before making its formal request. That's hard to believe, even from an administration that is maladroit politically, to put it kindly.
But even if that were true. So what?
Mr. Boehner said there are votes scheduled on Wednesday evening, but they seem to be profoundly unimportant and, in any case, this is the same speaker who repeatedly postponed votes on whether to save the nation from default. What could possibly be so pressing this time?
It's also possible that the White House failed to notice that the contenders for the Republican presidential nomination have a debate on Wednesday, or deliberately tried to upstage it. If either is true, shame on the White House.
But, again, so what?
The Republican candidates did not seem to care. Some seemed eager to be up against Mr. Obama on television. And a presidential address on jobs and the faltering economy certainly trumps one of 20 planned debates among the contenders for the Republican nomination.
Mr. Obama's people negotiated with Mr. Boehner's people behind closed doors. When they emerged, the White House caved, to no one's surprise. The speech will take place on Thursday.
One day won't make a difference, but the political spectacle and the final result only served to further underscore the president's weakness. Worse, the vital importance of the speech -- and the need for Congress to take its full responsibility for creating jobs and reviving the economy -- was upstaged by yet another Washington soap opera.

HEADLINE: Two at Justice Dept. Pursued AT&T Suit

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
The names of 25 government lawyers are listed on the last page of the Justice Department's lawsuit seeking to block the proposed $39 billion merger between AT&T and T-Mobile USA.
But two senior lawyers who played crucial roles in bringing the lawsuit are nowhere to be found on the complaint.
Christine A. Varney, the government's former top antitrust lawyer, oversaw the investigation into the planned merger until July, when she said she was leaving the Justice Department to join the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore. When she departed, the investigation was in its final stages but the government had not yet decided to bring a lawsuit. 
And James M. Cole, the No. 2 official in the Justice Department, made the ultimate decision to bring what is the Obama administration's most significant antitrust enforcement action to date. He announced the lawsuit at a news conference Wednesday, one of his more prominent public appearances since he assumed the post in January.
''The leadership transition has been seamless, and the right decision was reached in this case,'' Mr. Cole said before he introduced Sharis A. Pozen, the acting head of the antitrust unit. ''We are seeking to block this deal in order to maintain a vibrant and competitive marketplace.''
When Ms. Varney announced her departure, some lawmakers and consumer advocates had expressed disappointment that the Obama administration had not been tougher in antitrust. Instead of bringing legal actions, the division approved a number of large mergers, including Comcast and NBC Universal, as long as the companies made certain concessions.
And the Federal Trade Commission, which also has antitrust oversight, stole some of the Justice Department's thunder in starting an investigation into whether Google had engaged in anticompetitive practices.
The legal action against AT&T appeared to ease the concerns of antitrust enforcement advocates.
Ms. Varney had been skeptical of the T-Mobile acquisition since it was announced in March, said two people familiar with her thinking who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case.
''Christine Varney set the table for this decision,'' said Bert Foer, the president of the American Antitrust Institute. ''We are delighted that the administration is committed to the vigorous use of antitrust even at a time of economic difficulties.''
President Obama's appointment of Ms. Varney in January 2009 was seen as a step toward fulfilling his vow to ''reinvigorate antitrust enforcement.'' He had also criticized what he said was the Bush administration's weak record in challenging mergers and failing to bring monopolization cases.
Ms. Varney was a Clinton administration antitrust veteran, having served as a former commissioner at the F.T.C. She joined the Obama White House from the Washington law firm of Hogan & Hartson, where she focused on antitrust work.
One of Ms. Varney's first moves was to name as her deputy Ms. Pozen, a fellow antitrust lawyer at Hogan & Hartson and former colleague at the F.T.C. When Ms. Varney left the Justice Department, Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general, named Ms. Pozen as her temporary replacement. Ms. Pozen and another government lawyer, Joseph F. Wayland, led the decision to sue AT&T.
Ms. Pozen then took the case up the Justice Department's chain of command. Mr. Holder had recused himself from the investigation for unspecified reasons, so the final decision fell to Mr. Cole.
Mr. Cole, who wears a mustache like his boss, joined the Justice Department last December from the law firm Bryan Cave, where he was a white-collar defense lawyer.
Jumping between government service and private practice throughout his career, Mr. Cole, 59, is a longtime friend of Mr. Holder. The two worked together in the Justice Department earlier in their careers.
His confirmation as deputy attorney general was a bumpy one. It was delayed in the Senate in part because lawmakers expressed concern over his role as the independent monitor for the American International Group in the years leading up to the $182 billion bailout of the insurance giant. Mr. Cole's work did not involve many of the issues at the center of A.I.G.'s collapse, including credit-default swaps.
As for Ms. Varney, she has moved to New York, where she starts her job at Cravath on Tuesday. She will advise the law firm's clients on antitrust issues related to mergers.
Under government ethics rules, Ms. Varney is banned for two years from appearing in any matter before the Justice Department. And she is permanently prohibited from working on anything related to the AT&T and T-Mobile deal, though at the moment Cravath is not involved in the case.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: What Does 'Economic Growth' Mean for Americans?

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Average growth does not mean a whole lot when translated to income growth for all but the highest earners, an economist writes.

 BODY:
Suppose we placed a carefully selected sample of men on a hot stove and another sample of men on dry ice. Could we reasonably conclude that, on average, they were comfortable?
As a nation we worship a deity called economic growth. The more sophisticated users of that term presumably mean by it "annual growth in average gross domestic product per capita, expressed in dollars with a constant value relative to real goods and services, and averaged over the entire population of the United States" - in short, real G.D.P. per capita.
But what does an average of this sort mean for most people the United States? I am fascinated by a recent paper by Anthony Atkinson, Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez in the Journal of Economic Literature. The authors, recognized experts on the study of income distributions, have constructed a long-run time series of top income shares for more than 20 countries, starting about 1915 and ending in 2007.

Much of their paper is devoted to describing the numerous methodological problems that must be overcome to construct comparable time series of this sort. But they reach some illuminating conclusions, among them this: 
Over the last 30 years, top income shares have increased substantially in English-speaking countries and in India and China, but not in continental European countries or Japan. This increase is due in part to an unprecedented surge in top wage incomes. As a result, wage income comprises a larger fraction of top incomes than in the past.
Top wage incomes include the compensation of corporate executives, including those in the financial sector.
Of particular interest is their Table 1 (Page 9) which I have summarized in the two charts below.
Consider now the longest period featured in their Table 1, from 1976 to 2007. The authors estimate that over that period the average annual income of all families in the United States grew at an average annual compound growth rate of 1.2 percent. But the data reveal that for the top 1 percent of income recipients, average real income grew by 4.4 percent a year. They captured 58 percent of the growth in total income over the period. 
By contrast, for the bottom 99 percent of Americans, average family income over the same period grew by only by only 0.6 percent a year. Within that broad 99 percent, however, some lower-income groups probably saw their real income fall. 
As the data in second chart shows, this inequality was even greater in the period 2002-7, in which the top 1 percent of highest-income recipients garnered 65 percent of the growth in total income over the period. 
Similar conclusions, by the way, were reached in a 2005 paper by Ian-Dew Becker and Robert Gordon, "Where Did the Productivity Growth Go?" 
So if an American macroeconomist -- a specialist who tends to think of nations as people -- or high-level government officials or politicians mimicking a macroeconomist boasted on a television talk show that "average family income grew by 3 percent during 2002-7, more than in most European economies," about 99 percent of American viewers, reflecting on their own experience, would probably scratch their heads and wonder, "What is this guy talking about?" 
The third chart, below, exhibits the growth path of real G.D.P. per capita in the United States over the period 1975-2009 and the corresponding path of real median household income. The data show that over the 34-year period, real G.D.P. per capita rose by an annual compound rate of 1.9 percent. Those data come from the Economic Report of the President to the Congress (Tables B-2 and B-34). 
According to the Census Bureau data (see Table H-6), however, median household income in the United States rose by less than 0.5 percent a year. Other than national pride in league tables, that 1.9 percent average economic growth does not mean much for the experience of the median household in the United States. 
In this regard, I found even more interesting this comment by the authors, pertaining to the international league tables of which we are all so fond, especially if they make us look good:
Average real income per family in the United States grew by 32.2 percent from 1975 to 2006, while they grew only by 27.1 percent in France during the same period, showing that the macroeconomic performance in the United States was better than the French one during this period. Excluding the top percentile, average United States real incomes grew by only 17.9 percent during the period while average French real incomes -- excluding the top percentile -- still grew at much the same rate (26.4 percent) as for the whole French population. Therefore, the better macroeconomic performance of the United States and France is reversed when excluding the top 1 percent.
In other words, if one took away the top 1 percent highest-income recipients and their share of income and focused on what was left for the bottom 99 percent, the median representative of that cohort should not be all that impressed by economic performance in the United States relative to their peers in other countries. 
It can help explain why the so-called median American voter, a concept used in political science literature, seems so angry at this time, looking around for culprits behind the economic predicament of the American middle class. It also can help explain why the high-income groups in the United States have accounted for a growing share of total federal taxes paid in the United States.

HEADLINE: In Reykjavik, a Glittering New Home for Music

BYLINE: JEANINE BARONE


HIGHLIGHT: A new conference center and concert hall in Reykjavik has a facade designed by the artist Olafur Eliasson.

 BODY:
After the economic meltdown and a couple of ash-spewing volcanoes, Iceland still has plenty to be optimistic about.
For one: Harpa, the new abstract glass and steel edifice towering over Reykjavik's old harbor. Harpa (the name refers to the Icelandic word for harp) is the just-inaugurated conference center and concert hall that is home to the Iceland Symphony Orchestra and the Icelandic Opera. 
The building's luminous facade was designed by Olafur Eliasson, creator of the much-discussed "New York City Waterfalls" installation in 2008. The facade reflects the ever-changing Nordic light, thanks to 1,000 hexagon-shaped bricks, and connects the building to the natural world, allowing scenic vistas of the sky, sea and mountains. (Colorful LED strips allow the building to glow in Iceland's dark winter afternoons.) 
"It's an exciting building, but with the important role of music in Iceland, it's also about the identity of this country," Mr. Eliasson said.
Harpais booked with events through 2015.

HEADLINE: A Challenge for Unions in Public Opinion

BYLINE: STEVEN GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: A Gallup poll shows a bare majority of Americans approve of unions, and the split in sentiment between Democrats and Republicans is stark.

 BODY:
 A new Gallup poll has found that a slim majority of Americans, 52 percent, approve of labor unions and that the difference in views between how Democrats and Republicans feel toward unions has reached record levels.
 The Gallup poll, released on Thursday, found that the approval rate for unions was unchanged from 2010 and was up from 2009, when unions had the lowest approval rating, 48 percent, since Gallup began this survey in 1936.
 Showing a huge partisan difference in views, the poll of 1,008 adults found that 78 percent of Democrats approve of unions, while just 26 percent of Republicans do, the lowest percentage ever for Republicans.
 Jeffrey M. Jones, Gallup's managing editor, wrote, "This could reflect a greater politicization of union issues given the fact that many state-level efforts to curb union influence were promoted by Republican governors often backed by a Republican-controlled legislature." 
 After Republicans swept to power in many states last November, the Republican governors of several states, most notably Wisconsin and Ohio, moved to curb collective bargaining by public-employee unions, an effort that generated huge resistance from labor unions and Democrats.

 Mr. Jones wrote that the huge debate over union rights this year "seems to have resulted in a draw in the court of public opinion, with labor unions neither gaining nor losing Americans' support overall compared with last year."
 The Gallup poll found a strong rebound of Democrats' and independents' views toward unions over the last two years. Approval among Democrats rose to 78 percent from 66 percent in 2009, and to 52 percent from 44 percent among independents. For Republicans, the approval rating was 26 percent this year, down from 34 percent last year (and 29 percent in 2009).
This year's poll found that 52 percent of Americans approved of unions and 42 percent disapproved. (The survey was conducted Aug. 11 to 14 with 95 percent confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points.)
 When the overall approval rating for unions fell to its lowest level ever in 2009, many labor relations said that was because many Americans believed that labor unions could be too stubborn and demanding and were a major cause of the General Motors and Chrysler bankruptcies that year. Union leaders maintain that a major reason for the overall decline in approval ratings in recent years -- the approval rate was 65 percent less than a decade ago -- is that conservative politicians and think tanks have been putting out a flood of negative information about organized labor.
Business groups say labor's approval ratings have slid from decades past because many Americans feel they have good wages and benefits and no longer see a need for unions.
Labor leaders acknowledge that one of their biggest challenges is to figure out how to make Americans more enthusiastic about unions and unionizing at a time when many workers face stagnating wages, rising insecurity on the job and employers' cutting back on pensions and other benefits --- all while corporate profits have been quite strong.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Cancels Radio Talk Amid Furor Over Aide

BYLINE: MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Bloomberg has avoided any public appearances since it was revealed that his administration had hidden the true reason for a top aide's resignation.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg canceled his weekly radio appearance, scheduled for Friday morning, amid a growing outcry over his handling of a top aide's arrest over a domestic violence complaint, said a person told of the mayor's decision. 
The move appeared to be an attempt to avoid the public spotlight - and potential questions about why Mr. Bloomberg sought to conceal the arrest of Deputy Mayor Stephen Goldsmith. When Mr. Goldsmith resigned several weeks ago, the mayor's office said he was leaving to pursue a job in private business. 
On Thursday, it was revealed that Mr. Goldsmith had actually stepped down because of the arrest, which stemmed from an altercation with his wife, Margaret, that involved screaming and shoving at their town house in Washington. 
A spokesman for the mayor, Marc La Vorgna, declined to comment Friday morning. The radio program on WOR-AM (710), which starts around 8 a.m., generally touches on the major news of the week, but has a breezy tone: its host, John Gambling, is not known for posing particularly tough questions to the mayor. 
In Mr. Bloomberg's absence, Mr. Gambling spent 12 minutes discussing the controversy on his program, and said he thought that Mr. Bloomberg was making a mistake by not explaining his actions.
"I do think that the mayor has made a mistake because he's going to have to answer the question," Mr. Gambling said. "There's no way out of it at this point. There's no way out of it, because now it has turned into a megillah, and every reporter in New York City is after him for an answer, or a confrontation."
Mr. Gambling said he understood that the mayor might have chosen not to make Mr. Goldsmith's arrest public out of loyalty, but asked, "Did he really believe that this story would not come out? I mean, it was a public record."
Mr. Gambling suggested that the mayor should have heeded some conventional wisdom: "Don't try and cover things up, because you're always going to get caught eventually," and he said that Mr. Bloomberg, at this point, has "got to come clean." 
"This isn't the end of it," Mr. Gambling said. "This is only really the beginning of the story now, that could have been dealt with a month ago. It's only going to reflect worse on the mayor."
Friday is the second day in a row on which Mr. Bloomberg has scheduled no public events where reporters might have an opportunity to ask him questions. 
Several of the city's most prominent lawmakers have rebuked the mayor for offering a misleading explanation for why Mr. Goldsmith departed, especially given the mayor's longstanding advocacy for transparency in government. City Hall has refused to comment on how it handled the episode.
On Friday, two of the mayor's reliable allies on policy matters, the editorial boards of The New York Post and The Daily News, took Mr. Bloomberg to task for misrepresenting the circumstances surrounding the resignation. 
The News wrote that the mayor "let loyalty get the better of his duty to provide the public with straight goods." 
"Bloomberg," it said, "owed New York the full explanation for his deputy's departure, for the sake of the historical record and to enable the public to judge the quality of the mayor's staff picks."
The Post editorial was even more blunt. 
"New Yorkers have a right to know when the second-most powerful man in city government is sitting in a D.C. jail cell," its editorial said. 
"It's utterly inexplicable that no announcement of the arrest was made - and even yesterday the mayor's office was refusing substantive comment. Not good enough," the Post concluded. "Mr. Mayor. Explain yourself."

HIGHLIGHT: Too bad there weren't any prominent economists warning that the obsession with short-term deficits was a terrible mistake.

 BODY:
Zero job growth, with unemployment still at nosebleed levels. Meanwhile, the interest rate on 10-year US bonds is down to 2.04%, and it's negative on inflation-protected securities.
Aren't you glad we pivoted from jobs to deficits a year and a half ago?
Meanwhile, on the other side of the pond, Is austerity killing Europe's recovery?
After more than a year of aggressive budget cutting by European governments, an economic slowdown on the continent is confronting policymakers from Madrid to Frankfurt with an uncomfortable question: Have they been addressing the wrong problem?
Yah think?
Too bad there weren't any prominent economists warning that the obsession with short-term deficits was a terrible mistake, that austerity would undermine hopes of recovery. Oh, wait.
The awful thing is that those of us who warned about all this -- based not on some unorthodox doctrine, but on basic textbook macroeconomics -- weren't so much argued down as just ignored. Somehow, those with actual power were convinced that fiscal austerity wasn't just an option but the only option, and that anyone arguing with that -- even people like me and Joe Stiglitz, who had a few easy-to-understand credentials -- were just not part of the serious discussion.
I haven't fully organized my thoughts on exactly why this happened. But whatever the reasons, we are now reaping the consequences of a disastrous distraction of policy makers, who have been fighting phantoms while the real problems festered.

HEADLINE: This Sunday: Working It Out

BYLINE: HUGO LINDGREN


HIGHLIGHT: What's inside this week's magazine.

 BODY:
As we were thinking about how to mark the 10th anniversary of 9/11, we had the luxury of knowing that our colleagues at The Times were preparing an ambitious package in print and on the Web site, allowing us to focus our efforts and not feel the need to cover every base. We chose to highlight the pictures that Damon Winter took for us of the ironworkers atop the rising One World Trade Center.
As Joe Nocera stated forcefully a few weeks back in a column called "9/11's White Elephant," the vast public resources pumped into the Freedom Tower are disconcerting, to say the least. The original Twin Towers were also the result of the public sector looking out for private enterprise. But that in no way diminishes the extraordinary skill and courage of the workers who Winter has photographed for us. They symbolize an important theme of that dreadful day in 2001 and the years since: work. The places that were attacked were workplaces. Those first responders - the firefighters, police officers and paramedics - were people doing their jobs. As are the American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. And the country recovered, by and large, by getting back to work, much more quickly than anybody could have expected.
That's what Winter's pictures reveal to me - the meaningfulness and purpose of work, a powerful message not only because of the anniversary but because of the difficult economic times. Just today, the latest jobs figures showed no progress. But even those who are suffering the most are persevering in ways that we would all hope to if we were in their shoes. I advise taking the time to read Jennifer Gonnerman's wonderful profile in the newspaper of a Bronx factory worker named Frederick Deare who was out of a job for 290 days before finally landing a new position that nets him less than his unemployment benefits. He's not complaining. He wants to work. "I don't let it bother me that I'm getting less, because of the simple fact I have something, and a lot of people have nothing," he told Gonnerman.

On the subject of work, I would also like to express my gratitude to the Times correspondent Anthony Shadid, who was held hostage earlier this year in Libya and is still out-hustling all of us. At great personal risk, he snuck into Syria, delivering a series of eye-opening dispatches for the newspaper and this extraordinary account for the magazine. Another hero of mine here at the Times is the photographer Joao Silva, whose account this week of losing his legs while on assignment for the paper humbled us all. In his last act as executive editor of The Times, Bill Keller hired Joao as a full-time employee. This was not charity. Joao is not only a brave photographer. He believes in his work.

HEADLINE: The Bright Side of Unemployment?

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Some workers say a few positive things have happened to them as a result of unemployment, including more time with family, education and weight loss, according to a new survey from Rutgers.

 BODY:
On Thursday the Heldrich Center for Workforce Development released its latest reporton the hundreds of unemployed workers it has been following (and surveying) for two years. As you might expect from the report's title -- "Out of Work and Losing Hope: The Misery and Bleak Expectations of American Workers" -- the report's findings are discouraging.
The typical jobless worker has been pounding the pavement for months and is running low on savings, friends and hope. Even the lucky workers who have found jobs are not exactly thriving, as most of the re-employed in the center's survey have had to take pay cuts.
Even so, the report did manage to find some good that has come of its respondents' unemployment spells:
The majority of the 675 workers surveyed in August -- those whom the center was able to reach from its initial group of 1,202 workers first contacted in August 2009 -- said they had worked on projects around the house.
A narrow majority (51 percent) also said they had "spent more enjoyable time" with their families as a result of being unemployed.
Smaller shares cited opportunities for self-improvement they had seized upon, such as additional education, training and volunteer work.
And a slim minority -- 16 percent -- even became "healthier through exercise."
Clearly none of this means that all these workers would have been worse off if they'd kept their jobs. But it's comforting to know that there has been a glimmer of silver lining for at least a few of the nation's jobless.

HIGHLIGHT: Another economic indicator: Lottery ticket sales are up.

 BODY:
Another economic indicator: Lottery ticket sales are up.
USA Today reports:
Financial records for 41 state lotteries that end their fiscal year in June show 28 had higher sales than the year before. Seventeen of those states set all-time sales records...
"We see that lottery sales go up as the economy gets bad - but we don't see people spending more on relatively inexpensive other forms of entertainment," said Garrick Blalock, associate professor of economics at Cornell and a co-author of [an economic study on the subject].
Now that housing is no longer a safe nest egg, I suppose Americans have to invest their money in else. Maybe they should try New York City taxi medallions instead.

HEADLINE: Big Deal | Chronicle of a Project Foreclosed

BYLINE: SARAH KERSHAW


HIGHLIGHT: The developers of 5 Franklin Place were forced to abandon the condominium with only a quarter of the 20 planned stories built.

 BODY:
Every detail of 5 Franklin Place was mapped out: Bosch washers and dryers, cantilevered staircases wrapping around cylindrical glass elevators and a facade with reflective black metal bands that would twist like ribbons and, just maybe, make Frank Gehry squirm.
But the condominium planned for TriBeCa with the dizzyingly ambitious vision of a small development firm, and an exotic design by the Dutch architect Ben van Berkel, may stand out as one of the worst casualties of the city's banking and housing crises.
Many new developments, of course, were stalled or thwarted by the economy's tumble, but the mortgage note on the condo project, which was to have risen 20 stories and contained 55 luxury apartments, has been sold twice. Now a foreclosure auction for the property, with a $47.04 million lien on it, is scheduled for Sept. 12. 
The minimum bid on the TriBeCa property must be higher than the lien, which includes the $28.25 million the developers originally borrowed to finance the project, as well as the interest rates, penalties and fees that piled up after they defaulted on the mortgage, according to Calin Onet, a marketing analyst for PropertyShark, which produced a detailed report on the project's financial history. If no one bids that high - or bids at all - the real estate investment firm that acquired the mortgage note on the property for about $48 million last December, Glacier Global Partners, will obtain ownership, Mr. Onet said. The firm cannot proceed with development plans unless it officially owns the property.
Yaniv Blumenfeld, the chief executive of Glacier Global Partners, declined to comment, saying he did not want to discuss possible plans for the project until after the auction.
The travails of 5 Franklin Place began when Sleepy Hudson, a development firm that had specialized in small-scale projects like modest conversions and brownstone rehabilitations, bought the site, which has frontage on Broadway, for $36.6 million in 2006, property records show.
The firm had done well in developing a 12-story condo, High Line 519 on West 23rd Street, which was completed in 2007 at the height of the real estate market. The developers had built in West Chelsea before many others marched in - and even before plans for the High Line were firm - so they had hoped to repeat the strategy with a bigger condo on the up-and-coming eastern edges of TriBeCa, they said. In the heady days of the boom, a 20-story luxury condo, with prices ranging from $2 million one-bedrooms to $16 million penthouses, seemed like a sure thing.
After buying the property Sleepy Hudson moved quickly: construction began in early 2007; the condo offering plan was approved by the state; a showroom opened on Harrison Street; apartments went on the market in the spring of 2008; and contracts were signed on eight units, including a $16 million penthouse, the developers said.
Leo Tsimmer, a co-founder of Sleepy Hudson, had commissioned Mr. van Berkel to design a country house in the Catskills. He and his partner, David Kislin, then brought the architect into the Franklin Place project. In the design, Mr. van Berkel would "pay homage to TriBeCa's iconic cast-iron aesthetic without compromising his passion for radical design," according a description of the condo prepared for the sales team.
But by the time the apartments hit the market, the developers had already defaulted on their mortgage, as they struggled to secure financing in the wake of the subprime mortgage meltdown and the collapse of Bear Stearns.
Their lender, Canyon Capital Realty Advisors, had assured them of additional loans that would finance the construction, Mr. Kislin said. After the Bear Stearns debacle, there were "two weeks of radio silence," before the lender told the developers there would be no new loan, and they were then turned down elsewhere, Mr. Kislin recalled.
They halted construction after building 5 of 20 floors, returning deposits to the eight buyers who had signed contracts. The bare bones of a partly built condo shrouded in scaffolding with boarded-up windows, the property bears little resemblance to the architectural renderings.
"If the world were different," Mr. Tsimmer said, "I think the city would have appreciated this property being built. I think residents would have viewed it as a great addition to their neighborhood. The prices were great, and we felt it was going to be a very beautiful project."

HEADLINE: Big Deal | Sold for $36,500,000

BYLINE: SARAH KERSHAW


HIGHLIGHT: The town house known as the Harkness Mansion was the biggest recorded sale of the week.

 BODY:
Selling for $36.5 million, the Harkness Mansion, the Upper East Side town house that broke records when it sold for $53 million in 2006, was the highest sale of the week, according to city property records.
The buyer of the mansion at 4 East 75th Street, which is 50 feet wide and has 21,700 square feet of space, was
Larry Gagosian, whose contemporary and modern art galleries form an empire from Rome to Los Angeles. The seller was J. Christopher Flowers, a prominent New York private equity manager who had unofficially been looking for a buyer for several years but eventually sold through Brown Harris Stevens. The sale was recorded in city records on Monday. 
Mr. Flowers bought the town house in October 2006, less than two months after it was listed for $55 million, and at the time the sale was the costliest for a single residence in Manhattan history. Brokers say the mansion is now in need of major renovations; Mr. Flowers had begun a gut renovation but then apparently abandoned the plans. The property sat vacant for a few years before it sold.
Big Ticket includes closed deals from the previous week, ending Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Comparing Recessions and Recoveries: Job Changes

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Today's jobs report is nothing but bad news -- especially when you consider how many fewer jobs the country has today than it had when the recession began in December 2007. 

 BODY:
Today's jobs report is nothing but bad news.
The United States economy showed no net gain in jobs in August, the Labor Department reported, after having added an average of 53,000 in each of the three prior months. This was the worst jobs number since last September.
Hiring was essentially unchanged in almost every private industry. The biggest gain was in health care, which added 30,000 jobs, but health care has been growing steadily despite what happens to the rest of the economy. Government employment continued to fall.
The chart above shows economywide job changes in this last recession and recovery compared with other recent ones, with the black line representing the most recent downturn. Since the downturn began in December 2007, the economy has shed, on balance, about 5 percent of its nonfarm payroll jobs. And that does not even account for the fact that the working-age population has continued to grow, meaning that if the economy were healthy we should have more jobs today than we had before the recession.
The unemployment rate - measured by a different government survey, and based on how many people are without jobs but are actively looking for work - was unchanged in August, at 9.1 percent.
There are now 14 million workers who are looking for work and cannot find it; the figure nearly doubles if you include workers who are in part-time jobs but want to be employed full time, and those who want to work but have stopped looking. A broader measure of the unemployment rate that includes these underemployed workers is 16.2 percent.

HEADLINE: Why Wireless Markets Are Concentrated

BYLINE: STEVE LOHR


HIGHLIGHT: Whether the Justice Department succeeds in blocking AT&#038;T's purchase of T-Mobile or not, the wireless market in America will inevitably be highly concentrated, as it is in markets around the world, new research shows. 

 BODY:
In its suit to block AT&T's $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile, the Justice Department leans heavily on the argument that consolidated market power is bad for consumers. More companies in an industry mean more competition and all the benefits that flow from competition -- lower prices, more choices and more innovation.
That is a basic principle of economics and antitrust - and it is seemingly irrefutable. The yardstick that the Justice Department applied to its merger analysis is a standard, if complex, tool to measure market concentration, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, or HHI for short. Markets with HHI readings above 2,500, the government's complaint states, are "highly concentrated."
The merger would increase the concentration of the cellular industry in the United States to 3,320, by the HHI scale, up from 2,744 before. But note that even if AT&T does not acquire T-Mobile, the American wireless market is and will remain highly concentrated. An international comparison of market concentration, published this week by the Columbia Institute for Tele-Information, shows that the wireless markets in most nations are highly concentrated. 
In fact, the merger would move the United States from "toward the bottom to well in the middle of the pack" in terms of consolidated market power in the wireless industry, said Eli Noam, an economist at the Columbia University Business School and director of the telecommunications research institute.
The research group's data show the historical trends in landline and wireless phone service. In wireless, the story in the United States is one of a patchwork of regional businesses being rolled up over the years.
In telecommunications, the market concentration itself is not surprising. The telephone business, after all, has long been one of the classic examples of an industry that exhibits the forces that lead toward "natural monopolies," or at least oligopolies. Those forces include high fixed costs - the investment needed to build out networks - and the efficiencies that come from providing services to millions of customers.
The drive to build out more sophisticated, higher-speed wireless networks will considerably increase the capital costs for network carriers. "That will almost certainly increase the natural forces of market concentration," Mr. Noam noted.
But if markets are inevitably concentrated, Mr. Noam said, the policy challenge is to make the big players compete in the interests of consumers. "There are ways," he said, "to prevent monopolists or oligopolists from becoming lazy."
The three options, Mr Noam explained, are regulation, antitrust and doing nothing -- betting that technological change will shake up markets.
The Justice Department is betting on options two and three. By blocking the merger, it hopes to keep the assets of T-Mobile out of AT&T's hands. Those assets -- in whole or in part -- will pass to one or several companies, enhancing competition and choice, in theory.
If the Justice Department succeeds, there may not be a lot more competition. But at least, the government asserts, AT&T will be forced to compete on its own rather than by removing a rival from the marketplace.

HEADLINE: G.O.P.'s New Obama Label: President Zero

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: With a new jobs report, the Republicans have some new ammunition against president Obama.

 BODY:
It took the Republican National Committee exactly 94 minutes to coin a new, demeaning title for Barack Obama: President Zero.
In an e-mail to reporters, the committee took note of the worst jobs report in nearly a year, saying that there has been "two and a half years of Obamanomics and nothing to show for it."
The monthly report, which showed a 17,000-job gain among private employers but no growth over all, provides Mr. Obama's Republican rivals with the perfect opportunity to criticize him as they prepare to gather for another nationally televised debate next week.
And it gives Mr. Obama an even more gloomy backdrop for the jobs speech he will give to a joint session of Congress next Thursday. In the speech, Mr. Obama is expected to call for a renewed national effort to put people back to work and trim the nation's deficit.
In the meantime, the Republicans competing for their party's nomination used the latest jobs numbers to slam the president for his stewardship of the nation's economy.
"The American people don't need speeches, they need jobs," Michele Bachmann said during a visit to Iowa on Friday. "Mr. President - it's time to stop digging our country further into debt."
Mitt Romney, who was campaigning in Florida, issued a statement calling the jobs report "unacceptable." He said the report is "further proof that President Obama has failed. President Obama oversaw an economy that created zero jobs last month and that is unacceptable. In order to change the direction of this country, we need to change presidents."
Jon M. Huntsman Jr., who this week issued his own jobs plan built around tax reform, said in a statement that "In a country with 307 million people, zero job growth is unfathomable."
Mr. Obama is scheduled to leave early Friday afternoon for Camp David. His White House economic advisers posted an analysis of the jobs report on the White House web site Friday morning.
The post, by Katharine Abraham, a member of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, called the unemployment rate -- which remained unchanged in August at 9.1. percent -- "a level that remains unacceptably high."
Ms. Abraham previewed Mr. Obama's Thursday jobs speech: 
"Next week," she wrote, "the president will lay out a series of additional bipartisan steps that Congress can take immediately to put more money in the paychecks of working and middle-class families; to make it easier for small businesses to hire workers; to put construction crews to work rebuilding our nation's infrastructure; and other measures that will help the economy grow while still reducing our deficit and getting our fiscal house in order. "
That is unlikely to satisfy Republicans, who have clearly signaled that their strategy for the 2012 election is to argue that Mr. Obama's economic policies are not working.
In his statement Friday, Mr. Huntsman wrote that there was "no clearer sign that the president has failed and the theatrics around his far-too-late jobs speech demonstrate that he has no real plan to change course."

HEADLINE: Pre-Emptive Moves

BYLINE: PETER CATAPANO


HIGHLIGHT: A cross-party squabble over the scheduling of the president's next speech turned out to be no small matter.

 BODY:
 It's tough to make plans. We're all so busy, no? Have you tried to schedule a simple lunch lately? Who has time? And the second you put it on the calendar you remember Or someone reminds you.
These sorts of annoying things apparently also happen to very important people, like the president of the United States. You see? They're just like you and me. Except their scheduling mishaps set off little media storms and apparently have significant political repercussions.
That's what happened this week when the White House tried to set the date of Sept. 7 for the president's post-vacation joint-session speech to Congress on jobs and the economy. The request for that date was rejected by the House speaker, John Boehner. Not a great time for them. A debate among Republican candidates, hosted by MSNBC and Politico, was planned for that time. Would the president consider another day for his speech? Of course! Sept. 8 it is, then, 7 p.m. The leader of the free world would also most likely take care to wrap up before the 8:30 kickoff of the Saints-Packers game Thursday night, the debut of the N.F.L. season, labor willing.
(For an actual detailing of the flap and negotiations, see this piece by The Times' Helene Cooper and Jackie Calmes.)
Everybody happy? Of course not. This is Washington.
You won't be shocked to learn that Republicans and Democrats in this instance were not working in harmony. Accusations of underhandedness and manipulation flew from one side to the other, as did protestations of innocence, ignorance and good will in defense. But it was The White House, with so much to lose politically, that took the hardest hits from commentators.
Prominent among the reaction was a keening despair among would-be Obama supporters, who saw the date change as a backing down in the face of Republican obstructionism, so soon after the budget battle. At Salon, Cenck Uygur decried what he called the president's "embarrassing fail."
So, this leads to the eternal question of whether Obama is just weak or if he is a brilliant strategist who has been playing rope-a-dope all along. I am so silly that I still had hope. 
He doesn't realize he's getting pummeled. He thinks this is all still a genius strategy to capture centrists by compromising on every single little thing. He is not trying to put on an appearance of weakness to lull his opponent into a false sense of complacency. He doesn't even realize he is being weak. He's the one with the false sense of complacency. As he's getting knocked around the ring, he thinks he's winning.
These guys in the Obama camp are in for a horrible, rude awakening. Sometime in the next year, they are going to blink and realize they are lying flat on their back on the canvas. Then as they finally stumble up, they'll realize they should have started fighting 11 rounds ago. Then a panic will set in, but I'm afraid it will be too late by then.
At Swampland Michael Scherer also pointed to what he sees as a lack of urgency in the administration's strategy, with the next election a little more than a year off:
At another point in Obama's presidency, such a minor skirmish would not have mattered all that much. But this is, in fact, a key point in Obama's presidency. [T]he White House is preparing a major shift in tone and substance in the hopes of reasserting Obama's leadership abilities heading into the next election. Recent months, of course, have not been kind to the President's polls, which have registered roughly 10-point declines in Obama's reputation for being a "strong leader" and for being "able to get things done." 
The problem this raises for Obama is real and immediate. He faces a perception problem, not just with Congress but with a growing share of the American people who think he is so eager to find compromise on key issues of national importance that he allows himself to be pushed around. Wednesday's confusion will not help solve this problem.
At The Washington Post blog, Post Partisan, James Downie also saw faulty gamesmanship on the part of the administration:
If this was an attempt to make Republicans look unreasonable, then, in almost every conceivable way, it failed spectacularly. And scheduling the speech during the GOP debate, even if Boehner had immediately acceded, is the one way the White House could guarantee a) that fewer voters would be watching and that b) viewers and pundits would pay less attention to the speech's content and more to the theatrics around it. In other words, it's the easiest way to lessen the speech's chances at success. If this is a preview of Obama's re-election campaign, Democrats should be very worried.
Noah Kristula-Green took note of a report of the dispute in Politico, which quoted an unnamed White House Source saying that the planned Republican debate was not "sacrosanct" because "it was going on a cable station." (Not sacrosanct? Ever heard of "Mad Men"?). This showed, Kristula-Green wrote at Frum Forum, that The White House has "a very peculiar view of media":
[L]ets focus on how the source demeans cable news.
It's true that in absolute terms, MSNBC does not have very high ratings. MSNBC also does not have the deepest penetration into American households.
Yet I am willing to bet that the people who do watch MSNBC are very interested in politics. Whether they are liberal or conservative, they are invested in the 24 hour news cycle. They are more likely to be frustrated if they have to choose between an important speech and a GOP debate.
People with niche media needs have more options than ever to have those needs met. Sure, the country as a whole doesn't really care when the speech is held, but for people who are invested in the GOP debate they not only care more, they also have louder megaphones.
A small pocket of support could be found over at The Fix, a Washington Post blog, where Chris Cillizza counted the ways in which "Obama and his political team were smart to reschedule" the speech.. Among them, the move gives Obama the "last word":
If Obama had stuck to Sept. 7, it would have allowed every Republican presidential candidate a real-time opportunity to respond (and criticize) his proposal. The coverage of the speech would be inter-mingled with coverage of the debate, meaning that Obama's preferred message would be decidedly muddled. By waiting a day, Obama can more tightly control his message and get the last word (or close to it) of what will be a pivotal week in the presidential race.
But honestly, Cillizza was in the minority.
There was, though, a bit of outrage toward the perceived insouciance of Boehner. Most notably, Tommy Christopher at Mediaite drew a lot of attention with a banner of indignation, in which he suggested that Boehner should resign for "his unprecendented insult to the president." (Unprecedented insult? Doesn't he have an Internet connection?) Christopher did not take the next logical step of demanding that Boehner and Obama settle the matter in a duel - seconds anyone? - but he did say this: "Boehner has insulted and disrespected the office of the President of the United States, and should resign." Boehner, he wrote, "made a conscious decision to put Barack Obama in his place by making a public refusal." He continued:
This isn't the first unprecedented Republican insult to the presidency under Barack Obama (but it is, by far, the worst), and it isn't even the first time John Boehner has tried tomake the President "heel" with his datebook. It ought to be the last. Every American who has an appropriate respect for the office of the presidency should demand that John Boehner resign, and every legislator should amplify that demand. The problems facing this country are too great to be left in the hands of someone with such contempt for its highest office.
The media, meanwhile, ought to abandon its fetish foe false objectivity, and recognize the facts. All parties agree the President gave the Speaker sufficient notice, and I cannot think of another president in history whom the media would suggest should have been preempted by a routine political debate, certainly not in a time of national crisis. The media is complicit in the insult through its failure to recognize this.
In a somewhat more measured reflection, Ezra Klein captured the broader sense of despair that the speech dust-up must have triggered in many citizens:
[I] the parlance of Washington, Boehner "won." And perhaps he did. But the rest of us lost. If it wasn't already clear that Republicans in congress have no intention of working with the White House on further help for the jobless, it's plenty clear now. If it wasn't already clear to the business community that the two parties absolutely hate each other and there is no reason to believe that Washington will be able to help the economy if what little recovery we have turns south, it's plenty clear now.
To paraphrase economist Brad DeLong, last night was one of those nights when you remember that even taking into account the fact that our political system is performing worse than you could possibly imagine, it's performing worse than you can possibly imagine. Washington has made many more consequential missteps than this one. But few of them have been so thoroughly depressing, so insistent on showing us, with brutal clarity, what the greatest nation in the world has come to.
Bummer.
Robert Reich has some advice for the president, who might be looking to counter the "weakness" charges that have been flying all week. For inspiration Reich looks back to long before the term "post-partisan" was even conceived:
The winner of the 2012 presidential election will be the person who comes off as the toughest fighter for average Americans.
Earth to Obama: Remember Harry (Give 'em Hell) Truman.
Here's Truman's acceptance speech at the Philadelphia convention that nominated him prior to the 1948 election:
Give em hell, Barack.
Point taken. Let's just make sure we're all done by kickoff.

HEADLINE: Podcast: Job Creation, Cantor Fitzgerald and Keynes

BYLINE: DAN NIEMI


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the latest Weekend Business podcast, and a listen.

 BODY:
The government's report on hiring, which showed no gain in jobs in August, provided fresh evidence that the recovery has fizzled without ever gaining momentum.
The report increases the pressure on President Obama as he prepares to deliver an address next week about job creation, on Republicans who have a starkly different approach to economic revival, and on the Federal Reserve, whose policy makers have been divided over what to do next, Shaila Dewan says in a conversation in the new Weekend Business podcast.
While the new data was worse than expected, several economists said the problem is not that companies have been laying off their employees, though there was an uptick in announced layoffs, but that they have delayed investing in new workers. 
The 10-year anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington is approaching, and perhaps more than any other company, the brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald came to symbolize the horrors of that tragedy. Almost one-fourth of the people killed in New York City that morning worked for the firm. In a podcast conversation, Susanne Craig talks about the strategy of Howard W. Lutnick, who ran Cantor then and still does today. Mr. Lutnick has defied those who said that he and Cantor were finished, and he has rebuilt his firm.

In another podcast conversation and in the Economic View column in Sunday Business, Robert J. Shiller contends that the surge of stock market volatility over the last month cannot be explained by conventional means. He turns to the work of John Maynard Keynes, who once compared the stock market to a beauty contest. Keynes described a newspaper contest in which 100 photographs of faces were displayed, and readers were asked to choose the six prettiest. The winner would be the reader whose list of six came closest to the most popular of the combined lists of all readers. The best strategy, Keynes said, is to select those faces that you think others will think prettiest. Better yet, he said, move to the "third degree" -- by picking the faces you think that others think that still others think are prettiest. Translated into the current market, investors appear to be trying to outguess one another. 
You can find specific segments of the podcast at these junctures: Shaila Dewan on the jobs report (23:36); news summary (19:23); Susanne Craig on Cantor Fitzgerald (17:23); Robert Shiller (8:05); the week ahead (1:05).

HEADLINE: Calling on the Fed

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: How will this dismal jobs report, which didn't even meet economists' already very low expectations, affect the debate at the coming Federal Reserve meeting? 

 BODY:
What I would give to be a fly on in the wall at the Federal Reserve right now, where Ben S. Bernanke is probably doing a double take on Friday's horrible jobs report.
The Fed's recently released minutes from its August meeting showed huge disagreements over whether more monetary stimulus -- and what form of monetary stimulus -- was necessary. Many of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates, said they wanted to do something to help the economy, like further expanding or rejiggering the Fed's balance sheet or decreasing the interest rate paid for banks' excess reserves. And some wanted to do nothing.
Ultimately members decided to pledge to keep short-term interest rates near zero until "at least mid-2013," although there was clearly more appetite from some of the members for more easing. The committee even decided to stretch out its September meeting to allow more time for discussion of these issues.
Publicly Mr. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, has argued that government policy can and should play a significant role in helping the economy grow, but emphasized that Congress should be the ones to lead the way. Congress, however, is trying to tighten fiscal policy, which is the exact opposite of stimulus, and seems fairly entrenched in this view.
It will be interesting to see how this dismal jobs report, which didn't even meet economists' already very low expectations, affects the committee meeting. The Fed may not have much ammunition left, but perhaps this latest news will convince it to fire what bullets it has.
Many Wall Street economists, including those at Goldman Sachs and RBC Capital Markets, are now predicting that the Fed will announce a change in the composition of its balance sheet so that it holds more longer-term assets.

HEADLINE: The North Dakota Paradox

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Given the strength of North Dakota's economy, you might expect President Obama to have a reasonable approval rating there. But in fact, his rating there has dropped more than in any other state. 

 BODY:
North Dakota was barely dented by the recession. Its unemployment rate never rose above 4.3 percent and sits at 3.3 percent today.
Since 2009, personal incomes in the state have grown 5 percent faster than those in the United States as a whole.
Given that the state's economy is not just acceptable but bordering on being good, you might expect President Obama to have a reasonable approval rating there. Not that North Dakota is inherently the friendliest state for Democrats: it's voted Republican for president every year since 1964. However, it did give Mr. Obama a respectable 45 percent of its vote in 2008.
But it isn't so. From January through June 2011, Mr. Obama's approval rating averaged just 37 percent in North Dakota, according to
Gallup polling, at a period during which it averaged 47 percent nationally -- lower than in all but seven other states. In fact, Mr. Obama's approval rating, which averaged 55 percent there in 2009, has dropped more in North Dakota than in any other state. In short, the state with the best economy is just about the keenest to downgrade its views of Mr. Obama.
The North Dakota data point may be something of an anomaly: It's a low-population state, and Gallup conducted only about 300 interviews there during its winter and spring polling.
Nevertheless, there is no overall relationship between Mr. Obama's state-by-state approval ratings and statewide economic performance.
Some of the numbers even point in the opposite direction: Mr. Obama's approval ratings are holding up better in states where the economy is worse, and vice versa.
The chart that follows, for example, compares the unemployment rate in each state as of April 2011 to the decline in Mr. Obama's approval rating there from 2009 to the first half of 2011. As you can see, there is essentially no relationship. In fact, the correlation runs in the opposite direction of what you might expect -- Mr. Obama's approval rating has declined slightly less in states with unemployment, although the relationship is not statistically significant.
Perhaps it's the change in unemployment rate that matters rather than the absolute number? We can track that relationship, too. The next chart presents a comparison of the change in the unemployment rate from mid-2009 to early 2011 to the decline in Mr. Obama's approval rating over the same period. Once again, there is no correlation:
Historically, however, the unemployment rate has been a surprisingly poor predictor of an incumbent president's electoral performance.
Economists have found that income-based measures have performed more promisingly. The government releases estimates of personal income in each state once per quarter. I averaged the annualized change in personal income growth for the seven quarters between summer 2009 and winter 2011 (the most recent data available) and compared it to the change in Obama's approval rating in the state over the same period.
North Dakota, with nominal income growth exceeding 8 percent on an annualized basis during this period, is quite a clear outlier in the chart. Still, even if you ignore it, the relationship does not run in the direction you might expect. If anything, states with higher income growth have tended to downgrade their views of Mr. Obama somewhat further.
As I mentioned, however, states like North Dakota have relatively small populations, and therefore the approval rating estimates (and to some extent also the economic data) are subject to large margins of error. A simple workaround is to limit the analysis to those states where Gallup conducted at least 1,000 interviews between January and June 2011, which represents essentially the 30 largest states.
Here is the comparison between the unemployment rate and the change in approval ratings for the 30 largest states only:
Still no meaningful relationship.
Or the comparison between the in unemployment rate and the change in approval rating:
This relationship is actually statistically significant, although just barely. But it runs in the "wrong" direction -- Mr. Obama's approval ratings have declined more in states where the employment picture has gotten better.
The same holds true for the personal income variable. States with more income growth have seen their approval ratings of Mr. Obama decline more sharply.
I've run through several other permutations of this analysis -- accounting for other factors like the share of the vote that Mr. Obama received in 2008, or the amount of stimulus funding that each state obtained -- and the results have always been the same. The relationship between Mr. Obama's approval ratings and the economic performance of each state has been either neutral or somewhat correlated.
What to make of this? Well, I'm open to ideas. It certainly isn't an intuitive finding.
I don't know that the right conclusion is that the economy doesn't matter to Mr. Obama. Instead, perhaps voters are judging him by subjective rather than objective standards.
Gallup, for instance, publishes data in each state on whether voters think the economy is getting better or worse -- a measure of consumer confidence. For this variable, the relationship finally runs in the direction that you might expect. States where voters tend to have more optimistic views about the economy are associated with higher approval ratings for Mr. Obama. The correlation is statistically significant, although not strongly so.
Correlation is not causation, however, and it's not clear whether these states view Mr. Obama more warmly because they have more optimistic views about the economy or rather whether the reverse is true.
In fact, the evidence probably hints at the latter: perceptions about Mr. Obama tend to drive feelings about the economy as much as the other way around. The reason to think this is because economic optimism is strongly correlated with the vote share that Mr. Obama received in each state in 2008, long before voters would have reason to blame him for economic conditions. The voters in states where economic confidence is low tended not to like Mr. Obama to begin with.
Perhaps you can read this as good news for Mr. Obama. Based on the evidence from the state level, it's not entirely clear that "hard" economic data, like the high unemployment rate or the slow growth in income, is driving the decline in his approval rating. Instead, voters seem to be engaging in a more complex, subjective and partisan calculation. This suggests that perceptions of the economy could potentially improve, probably improving Mr. Obama's approval rating along with it -- even if the fundamentals don't change much, as they seem unlikely to do.
But there is a contrary hypothesis that may be just as compelling, and that would be bad news for Mr. Obama.
Say that a lack of confidence in Mr. Obama is contributing to economic pessimism. And say that this economic pessimism is contributing, on some level, to the tepid recovery.
Economists differ on the extent to which they think business and consumer confidence are causes of, rather than symptoms of, poor economic performance. But the economy is probably driven by psychological factors to at least some extent. A , certainly, does seem to be hampering the recovery: corporate profits have been very high recently, so businesses are sitting on a ton of cash -- but they are electing not to invest it despite interest rates being very low.
If so, this could create something of a feedback loop, with diminishing confidence in Mr. Obama, diminishing confidence in the economy, and an actual decline in economic performance all reinforcing one another.
Yes, the flow could in theory begin to reverse course and move in the other direction. The 14 months between now and November 2012 are a lifetime in terms of econometric forecasting, and periods of economic uncertainty are associated with higher volatility. Economic forecasts are allowed to miss to the upside. As we get closer to the election, however, businesses may decide just to wait it out and see what happens after 2012, after which time the nation's fiscal direction may become clearer.
Still, this doesn't wholly explain the North Dakota Paradox. Certainly, given how murky the data is at the state level, I would be careful about any statistical models that claim to identify a neat, clean and exceptionally precise relationship between economic data and electoral performance at the national level. And I would be wary of any hard-and-fast claims along the lines of "if unemployment is above 8.5 percent on election day, Mr. Obama will lose." There's no doubt that the economy is a huge problem for Mr. Obama, but this may not be the type of election where its effects can be boiled down to a formula.

HEADLINE: Europeans Ban Syrian Oil as Crackdown Continues With 11 Reported Killed

BYLINE: By NADA BAKRI and STEVEN ERLANGER; Nada Bakri reported from Beirut, and Steven Erlanger from Sopot, Poland. Reporting was contributed by Hwaida Saad from Beirut, Rick Gladstone from New York, and James Kanter from Brussels.

 BODY:
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- European Union members escalated the pressure on Syria's government on Friday by banning all imports of Syrian oil in response to its violent suppression of the nearly six-month-old uprising there. It was the most punitive action by the European Union to date over the crackdown in Syria, which sells nearly all its oil to Europe and relies heavily on that export income.
The new sanctions, which take effect on Saturday, came as antigovernment protesters in Syria demonstrated in a number of cities and towns -- including suburbs of Damascus -- despite a heavy presence of police officers and troops who, in some cases, outnumbered the protesters themselves. Activists and witnesses reported that 11 people were killed in the protests, which organizers called ''the Friday of 'death before humiliation.' '' 
The European Union, like the United States, has already prohibited Europeans from doing business with top Syrian officials, including President Bashar al-Assad and his close aides, to press him to end the crackdown. The uprising is the most serious challenge to his family's 40 years of autocratic rule.
Syria produces only about 400,000 barrels of oil a day, less than 1 percent of global production, and exports about 150,000 barrels a day, 95 percent of it to Europe. The exports provide about 25 percent of the Syria's income and are an important source of cash for the government, which has raised subsidies on fuel and food and increased government salaries to try to ease the unrest.
Syria's economy had already been hit hard by the effects of other sanctions and its growing isolation, with tourism, manufacturing and foreign investment all deeply depressed, and it is no secret that Syrian businesses are increasingly concerned about the country's future. The Damascus stock exchange index has fallen by nearly half since January, and there have been reports that the Central Bank began limiting withdrawals of foreign currency by bank customers in recent weeks, suggesting it is facing a cash shortage.
The new sanctions ''will go straight to the heart of the regime,'' Foreign Minister Uri Rosenthal of the Netherlands said at a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in the Polish resort of Sopot, where the oil embargo was announced. Many of the ministers had attended the Friends of Libya conference in Paris on Thursday, aimed at helping Libya's new authorities navigate toward a stable state and resume its own oil production.
Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign policy chief, said the ministers would discuss what other measures to take against Syria. ''That is a conversation that keeps going on,'' she said.
Under the new prohibition, no member of the 27-member European Union can buy, import or transport oil and other petroleum products from Syria, or enter into financial or insurance services for such transactions, as of Saturday, although existing contracts can be fulfilled until Nov. 15.
Of European Union members, Austria was the most reliant on Syrian oil, importing about 8 percent of its total needs from that country, according to European Union officials in Brussels. Italy and Germany imported about 3 percent of their total crude oil from Syria, they said. The European Union also expanded its list of around 50 Syrians subject to an asset freeze and travel ban, adding four businessmen accused of financing the regime, diplomats said. Three companies were added to an existing blacklist of eight firms in Syria and Iran.
Alain Juppe, the foreign minister of France, said that his country intended to increase contacts with the opposition in Syria and that ''we will not let up on our efforts to bring an end to the repression and to secure a democratic dialogue.''
More than 2,200 people have been killed in Mr. Assad's suppression of the revolt, the United Nations has said. Even Mr. Assad's closest foreign supporters, Russia and Iran, have urged him to take steps to mollify the protesters, who have been characterized by his government as terrorists and thugs under the influence of hostile foreign powers.
Some demonstrators on Friday rallied in support of Mohammed Adnan al-Bakhour, a top law enforcement official who resigned this week to distance himself from the crackdown. Mr. Bakhour, the attorney general of Hama, a focal point of the uprising, has been the highest-ranking official to resign since the demonstrations began.
All of the protests on Friday were held under the slogan ''Death before humiliation.''
''With today's slogan we wanted to tell the regime and the world that Syrians want freedom and dignity, not humiliation under the Assad regime,'' a protester who gave his name as Hassan said outside al-Hassan mosque in Damascus. ''We prefer death to anything less than dignity and freedom.''
Activists said that of the 11 deaths reported, four were in two Damascus suburbs, Irbin and Hamouriya, four in the restive city of Homs, and three in Deir al-Zour, a tribal region in eastern Syria along the Iraq border.
In the southern province of Dara'a, where the first protests erupted in March, women demonstrated in the town of Jassem, calling for the fall of the government. Some covered themselves in black shrouds to mourn those who have been killed.
In Damascus, activists said that small protests were held in the neighborhoods of Midan, Rukn Eddin, Qaboun and al-Hajar al-Aswad, and that outside some mosques, security forces outnumbered protesters.
''There were 300 protesters and 500 security men,'' said Mohamad, a 20-year-old protester from Qaboun. ''And everyone demonstrating today knows that he might get killed, wounded or arrested,'' added Khalid, an activist from al-Hajar al-Aswad.

HEADLINE: In Honor of Teachers

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW. 
Joe Nocera is off today.; Gail Collins is on book leave.

 BODY:
Since it's back-to-school season across the country, I wanted to celebrate a group that is often maligned: teachers. Like so many others, it was a teacher who changed the direction of my life, and to whom I'm forever indebted.
A Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll released this week found that 76 percent of Americans believed that high-achieving high school students should later be recruited to become teachers, and 67 percent of respondents said that they would like to have a child of their own take up teaching in the public schools as a career. 
But how do we expect to entice the best and brightest to become teachers when we keep tearing the profession down? We take the people who so desperately want to make a difference that they enter a field where they know that they'll be overworked and underpaid, and we scapegoat them as the cause of a societywide failure.
A March report by the McGraw-Hill Research Foundation and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found that one of the differences between the United States and countries with high-performing school systems was: ''The teaching profession in the U.S. does not have the same high status as it once did, nor does it compare with the status teachers enjoy in the world's best-performing economies.''
The report highlights two example of this diminished status:
''According to a 2005 National Education Association report, nearly 50 percent of new teachers leave the profession within their first five years teaching; they cite poor working conditions and low pay as the chief reason.''
''High school teachers in the U.S. work longer hours (approximately 50 hours, according to the N.E.A.), and yet the U.S. devotes a far lower proportion than the average O.E.C.D. country does to teacher salaries.''
Take Wisconsin, for instance, where a new law stripped teachers of collective bargaining rights and forced them to pay more for benefits. According to documents obtained by The Associated Press, ''about twice as many public schoolteachers decided to hang it up in the first half of this year as in each of the past two full years.''
I'm not saying that we shouldn't seek to reform our education system. We should, and we must. Nor am I saying that all teachers are great teachers. They aren't. But let's be honest: No profession is full of peak performers. At least this one is infused with nobility.
And we as parents, and as a society at large, must also acknowledge our shortcomings and the enormous hurdles that teachers must often clear to reach a child. Teachers may be the biggest in-school factor, but there are many out-of-school factors that weigh heavily on performance, like growing child poverty, hunger, homelessness, home and neighborhood instability, adult role-modeling and parental pressure and expectations.
The first teacher to clear those hurdles in my life was Mrs. Thomas.
From the first through third grades, I went to school in a neighboring town because it was the school where my mother got her first teaching job. I was not a great student. I was slipping in and out of depression from a tumultuous family life that included the recent divorce of my parents. I began to grow invisible. My teachers didn't seem to see me nor I them. (To this day, I can't remember any of their names.)
My work began to suffer so much that I was temporarily placed in the ''slow'' class. No one even talked to me about it. They just sent a note. I didn't believe that I was slow, but I began to live down to their expectations.
When I entered the fourth grade, my mother got a teaching job in our hometown and I came back to my hometown school. I was placed in Mrs. Thomas's class.
There I was, a little nothing of a boy, lost and slumped, flickering in and out of being.
She was a pint-sized firecracker of a woman, with short curly hair, big round glasses set wider than her face, and a thin slit of a mouth that she kept well-lined with red lipstick.
On the first day of class, she gave us a math quiz. Maybe it was the nervousness of being the ''new kid,'' but I quickly jotted down the answers and turned in the test -- first.
''Whoa! That was quick. Blow, we're going to call you Speedy Gonzales.'' She said it with a broad approving smile, and the kind of eyes that warmed you on the inside.
She put her arm around me and pulled me close while she graded my paper with the other hand. I got a couple wrong, but most of them right.
I couldn't remember a teacher ever smiling with approval, or putting their hand around me, or praising my performance in any way.
It was the first time that I felt a teacher cared about me, saw me or believed in me. It lit a fire in me. I never got a bad grade again. I figured that Mrs. Thomas would always be able to see me if I always shined. I always wanted to make her as proud of me as she seemed to be that day. And, she always was.
In high school, the district sent a man to test our I.Q.'s. Turns out that not only was I not slow, but mine and another boy's I.Q. were high enough that they created a gifted-and-talented class just for the two of us with our own teacher who came to our school once a week. I went on to graduate as the valedictorian of my class.
And all of that was because of Mrs. Thomas, the firecracker of a teacher who first saw me and smiled with the smile that warmed me on the inside.
So to all of the Mrs. Thomases out there, all the teachers struggling to reach lost children like I was once, I just want to say thank you. You deserve our admiration, not our contempt.
My column last week about our nation's child crisis misstated the findings of a report by the Guttmacher Institute on unintended pregnancies. The 50 percent increase since 1994 was among poor women, not all women.

HEADLINE: The Dog-Eared Paperback, Newly Endangered in an E-Book Age

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
These are dark and stormy times for the mass-market paperback, that squat little book that calls to mind the beach and airport newsstands.
Recession-minded readers who might have picked up a quick novel in the supermarket or drugstore are lately resisting the impulse purchase. Shelf space in bookstores and retail chains has been turned over to more expensive editions, like hardcovers and trade paperbacks, the sleeker, more glamorous cousin to the mass-market paperback. And while mass-market paperbacks have always been prized for their cheapness and disposability, something even more convenient has come along: the e-book.
A comprehensive survey released last month by the Association of American Publishers and the Book Industry Study Group revealed that while the publishing industry had expanded over all, publishers' mass-market paperback sales had fallen 14 percent since 2008.
''Five years ago, it was a robust market,'' said David Gernert, a literary agent whose clients include John Grisham, a perennial best seller in mass market. ''Now it's on the wane, and e-books have bitten a big chunk out of it.'' 
Fading away is a format that was both inexpensive and widely accessible -- thrillers and mysteries and romances by authors like James Patterson, Stephen King, Clive Cussler and Nora Roberts that were purchased not to be proudly displayed on a living room shelf (and never read), but to be addictively devoured by devoted readers.
''In those days, you could easily ship out a million copies of a book,'' said Beth de Guzman, the editor in chief of paperbacks for Grand Central Publishing, part of the Hachette Book Group. ''Then shelf space started decreasing and decreasing for mass market, and it has especially declined in the last several years.''
For decades, the mass-market paperback has stubbornly held on, despite the predictions of its death since the 1980s, when retail chains that edged out independent bookstores successfully introduced discounts on hardcover versions of the same books. The prices of print formats are typically separated by at least a few dollars. Michael Connelly, the best-selling mystery writer best known for ''The Lincoln Lawyer,'' said he worried that book buyers would not be able to discover new authors very easily if mass-market paperbacks continued to be phased out.
''Growing up and reading primarily inexpensive mass-market novels, it allows you to explore,'' he said. ''I bought countless novels based on the cover or based on the title, not knowing what was inside.''
The growth of the e-book has forced a conversation in the publishing industry about which print formats will survive in the long term. Publishers have begun releasing trade paperbacks sooner than the traditional one-year period after the release of the hardcover, leaving the mass-market paperback even further behind.
Cost-conscious readers who used to wait for the heavily discounted paperback have now realized that the e-book edition, available on the first day the book is published, can be about the same price. For devoted readers of novels, people who sometimes voraciously consume several books in a single week, e-books are a natural fit.
''It's a question of, do you still want to wait for the book?'' said Liate Stehlik, the publisher of William Morrow, Avon and Voyager, imprints of HarperCollins. ''The people who used to wait to buy the mass-market paperback because of the price aren't going to wait anymore.''
That could be good news for authors who make up for a loss in mass-market sales with increases in e-book sales. Generally speaking, authors make more royalties on an e-book than on a paperback.
E-book best-seller lists are packed with the genre novels that have traditionally dominated paperback best-seller lists.
''In some ways, the e-book is yesterday's mass market,'' said Matthew Shear, the executive vice president and publisher of St. Martin's Press, which currently has books by Janet Evanovich and Lora Leigh on the paperback best-seller list in The New York Times.
Mass-market paperback sales have been sliding since giant bookstore chains and later Amazon.com started heavily discounting hardcovers in the 1980s and 1990s. The decline has deepened in the last two years, said Kelly Gallagher, the vice president of publishing services for Bowker, a research organization for the publishing industry.
''You can't list a single thing that has caused its demise,'' he said. ''But as e-books become more affordable and better aligned to the mass-market reader, I would have to say that I don't think there are encouraging signs that print mass-market books will rise again. When all these things align against a certain format or category, it's hard to recover.''
Ms. de Guzman said that Barnes & Noble used to keep a large display solely for mass-market paperbacks in the front of its stores, but that has disappeared. Borders, once a strong seller of mass-market paperbacks, especially romance, is in the process of liquidating all of its stores.
Several publishers said Wal-Mart, a major seller of mass-market paperbacks, has been quietly revamping its book selection to include fewer mass-market paperbacks and more trade paperbacks, which have higher production values: better-quality paper and larger covers.
Even airport stores, traditionally a mainstay retailer of mass-market paperbacks, are shunning them more frequently in favor of hardcovers and trade paperbacks.
Sara Hinckley, the vice president of book-buying and promotions for Hudson Booksellers, said that the stores had gradually decreased their selection in recent years, while increasing their array of hardcovers and trade paperbacks. Sales in trade paperbacks, she said, have continued to increase in recent years. Last fall, in 60 of its stores, Hudson cut the display space for mass-market paperbacks in half.
''With less demand and less retail shelf space for the format, and higher retails on the trade papers, there simply isn't as much publishing into the format, which in turn creates declining sales,'' Ms. Hinckley said in an e-mail.
Some publishers have responded by releasing books in trade paperback format before the mass-market edition. Grand Central Publishing plans to release trade paperback versions of ''The Sixth Man'' by David Baldacci and ''Lethal'' by Sandra Brown -- the first time those authors' thrillers have been published in trade paperback.
After 20 years as a best-selling author, Mr. Connelly will experience a first this fall: his latest legal thriller, ''The Fifth Witness,'' will be released as a trade paperback by Grand Central.
''From my standpoint, which is probably pure vanity, the trade paperback edition is often the way of publishing more literary novels,'' Mr. Connelly said. ''So for me, it's a cool ego thing -- I get to be in the trade edition. But beyond that, I'm hoping it works.''

HEADLINE: Before Release, a Hydraulic Fracturing Study for the State Draws Skepticism

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
New York State environmental officials commissioned a study of impacts of natural gas hydraulic fracturing from a consulting firm that counts oil and gas companies among its clients and that could gain business from increased drilling in the state.
The $223,000 study of the effects of ''hydrofracking'' on the economy and the quality of life was conducted by Ecology and Environment Inc., a global environmental and engineering services company based in Lancaster, N.Y.
The study has yet to be released, but some community, environmental and government watchdog groups say the company's ties to the drilling industry undermine its credibility -- no matter what the report concludes.
''I'm not saying they're bad,'' said Adrienne Esposito, executive director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment, which does not want this kind of drilling to start until the state strengthens regulations of the industry. ''I'm saying let's not be confused. This is not an objective analysis done in the public interest. They went to someone with whom they have a work relationship and that also does work for energy interests.'' 
Emily DeSantis, a spokeswoman for the state's Department of Environmental Conservation, wrote in an e-mail that the company had ''demonstrated it has the needed expertise and capabilities to perform services D.E.C. required.''
She continued, ''E & E's client list played no role in D.E.C.'s decision to engage them.''
Officials at Ecology and Environment declined requests for an interview and referred questions to the state agency.
A 40-year-old public company with a worldwide staff of about 1,100 people, Ecology and Environment assists governments and companies on renewable energy projects, on pollution control at contaminated sites, and with obtaining permits and environmental approval for natural gas storage facilities and oil exploration projects, including offshore drilling.
The state agency had planned to unveil the report assessing ''community impacts'' this past Wednesday, but it postponed the release until next week, citing the agency's workload in responding to Tropical Storm Irene.
The study is part of the department's broader draft document known as the Supplemental Generic Environmental Impact Statement, which identifies risks and proposes rules for allowing the practice of hydraulic fracturing with horizontal drilling, a controversial method of releasing natural gas from tight rock by using high volumes of water, sand and chemicals. A target for the drilling is the Marcellus Shale, a rich natural gas field that runs through New York and is already being mined in other states, including Pennsylvania.
The draft document must go through an extensive public comment period and be made final before the first drilling permits are handed out, but the issue has deeply divided New Yorkers over whether horizontal hydrofracking can be done safely.
Joseph Martens, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's environmental commissioner, says it can.
Mr. Martens's department released the bulk of the draft document in July but stated that it had employed ''independent consultants'' to research both the positive and the negative impacts of hydrofracking on the upstate counties where it would be concentrated.
Specifically, Ecology and Environment was asked to examine anticipated economic activity like tax revenue and job creation as well as quality-of-life issues like increased traffic and noise.
On its Web site, the company says it has expedited permit applications for more than 200 pipeline and gas storage projects worldwide.
''E & E's management recognized early on that the oil and gas industry provided outstanding opportunities for commercial consulting contracts due to federal and state permitting requirements for new facilities,'' the company wrote in its annual report.
The company has multimillion-dollar contracts with several state agencies for other work, including a $50 million, seven-year contract with the Department of Environmental Conservation for what the agency says are services associated with cleanups of contaminated properties.
Eric A. Goldstein, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York who is also a member of an advisory panel on drilling convened by Mr. Martens, played down the bias concerns, noting that the public comment period would provide New Yorkers a chance to identify any problems in the report.
''We have long considered environmental impact statements not truly independent analyses, but rather partisan documents that support the intentions of project sponsors,'' he said. ''For that reason, such studies should always be greeted with a healthy dose of skepticism and meticulous public review.''
Mr. Goldstein said it was not unusual for environmental consultants to work at different times for clients on opposing sides of an issue. In the highly polarized atmosphere surrounding hydrofracking, however, some groups are not accepting the usual practice.
In a letter to Mr. Martens last July, the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York, with more than 1,400 members, asked for the hiring of another consultant to assess the impacts of drilling on agriculture, saying that both the department's staff and Ecology and Environment ''lack the level of agricultural expertise necessary to fully assess the impacts to New York's farming industry.''
Jim Smith, a spokesman for the Independent Oil and Gas Association of New York, which has a representative on the commissioner's advisory panel, said the group would not comment on the choice of the author of the study until its findings were out and members had a chance to read them.
In New York, the company appears to be politically well connected; it has a political action committee and has contributed to elected officials of both parties, including $1,000 to Governor Cuomo's campaign, according to State Board of Elections records.
''They clearly see this as a cost of doing business,'' said Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York. ''They're interested in maintaining good relations with elected officials.''
During his campaign, Mr. Cuomo supported drilling in the Marcellus Shale, but with conditions. Ensuring a supply of low-cost natural gas ''is important to New York,'' he said, as long as drilling is ''environmentally sensitive and safe.''
But some environmental groups said the governor had signaled his support since then in other ways -- by ignoring their calls to take more time with the department's environmental statement or to extend the public comment period beyond the scheduled 60 days once the full report is out next week.
Based on industry projections, state officials say they expect to receive applications to drill up to 2,500 horizontal and vertical wells on the Marcellus Shale during a peak year -- and about 1,600 in an average year -- over a 30-year period.
But the pace of permits will ultimately be dictated by the ability of the department to oversee the safe development of wells.
In a report given to its advisory panel at its first meeting last month, the department said that because of the need to train more staff members to issue permits, monitor drilling activities and enforce compliance with new state regulations, it estimated that it would process fewer than 100 permit applications in the first year.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Tumbles After Bleak Jobs Report

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Shaila Dewan and Nelson D. Schwartz contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A grim report on the job market and news that major banks are facing federal lawsuits hit Wall Street on Friday, sending the broader market lower as crucial financial and industrial stocks spiraled down by more than 3 percent.
Many investors had sold stocks ahead of the Labor Department's jobs report, which analysts in a Bloomberg News survey had forecast would show a gain of 68,000 nonfarm payrolls.
The monthly report showed there was no job growth in the United States in August, and the flat performance had a direct impact on stocks in market-sensitive sectors. 
The August jobs figure was down from a revised 85,000 new jobs added in July. The unemployment rate stayed at 9.1 percent in August, the department said.
Philip J. Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said the jobs report was ''very disappointing. It was much weaker than expected. We were thinking that if today's jobs number was poor, we would start to see a pullback.''
In addition, analysts said financial stocks were hurt during the day by the prospect that a federal agency was set to file lawsuits against more than a dozen big banks over their handling of mortgage securities. Regulators filed the suits on Friday.
The suits by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are aimed at Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, among others.
''This is not good news from the perspective of the banking sector,'' Mr. Orlando said.
When the stock market opened, all three major Wall Street indexes slid lower and stayed there. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 253.31 points, or 2.20 percent, at 11,240.26. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 30.45 points, or 2.53 percent, at 1,173.97. Both indexes ended the week lower, the Dow by 0.3 percent and the S.& P. 500 by 0.2 percent.
The Nasdaq composite index ended the day down by 65.71 points, or 2.58 percent, at 2,480.33. But it managed to squeeze out a 0.2 percent gain for the week.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 1 8/32, to 101 6/32, and the yield fell to 1.99 percent from 2.13 percent late Thursday.
Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, said the jobs report raised fresh concerns about whether the economy might be headed for a new recession.
''Clearly, stocks are responding to the very disappointing jobs report,'' Ms. Warne said. ''It is one more piece of bad news that is really leading to a reassessment of the possibility of even slower economic growth.''
Though she said she did not believe there would ultimately be a double-dip recession, ''the risks probably have risen.''
Financial stocks were affected by the jobs report because of its implications for the real estate market, retailing and consumer lending. The financial sector slid by 4 percent, dragging down the broader market, with the five most actively traded banks in the sector each down by 4 percent or more. Bank of America was more than 8 percent lower at $7.25. Wells Fargo was down 4 percent at $24.20 and JPMorgan was down more than 4 percent at $34.63.
Ms. Warne said that the impending lawsuits meant the banks would face additional legal troubles from lending that took place before the last recession. ''There are not just concerns about weak growth, but increased worries that those problems are not behind them,'' she said.
Industrial shares fell more than 3 percent. General Electric was down by 2.7 percent at $15.76. CSX was down 4.5 percent at $20.56.
Lower market results in the United States came after declines in Asia and Europe. The Euro Stoxx 50 index closed down by 3.69 percent. The DAX in Germany lost 3.36 percent and the CAC 40 in France fell 3.59 percent, while the F.T.S.E. in Britain was down by 2.34 percent. In Asia, the Shanghai, the Nikkei and the Hang Seng indexes each closed down by more than 1 percent.
''The latest fall follows a highly volatile August period which saw global markets take substantial hits over political uncertainty over the U.S. debt ceiling and subsequent credit downgrade,'' John Douthwaite, chief executive of SimplyStockbroking, said in a research note.
In August, all three indexes in the United States turned in their worst monthly performance since 2001. Shares took a beating for reasons that included fears of an economic slowdown and fiscal problems in the United States as well as continuing concerns over debt issues in Europe.
Mr. Douthwaite said market turbulence would probably continue in September because of weak economic data from the United States and Europe.
The worse-than-expected jobs report led some economists to predict new action by the Federal Reserve at its meeting on Sept. 20-21.
Economists from Goldman Sachs said that the Fed was more likely to lengthen the average maturity of its balance sheet, with sales of relatively short-dated Treasuries and purchases of relatively long-dated Treasuries. Mr. Orlando said the central bank could also cut the premium on banking reserves to encourage banks to lend more.
Oil futures in New York for October delivery fell 2.8 percent to about $86.45. Energy related stocks declined by more than 2.5 percent.
Gold rose 2.6 percent to $1,873.70.

HEADLINE: Nearly Out of Tricks, Fed May Pare Longer Rates

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL. 
Floyd Norris, whose Off the Charts column normally appears on this page, is off.

 BODY:
News that the economy added zero jobs in August raises the chances that the Federal Reserve will announce another round of stimulus when it meets in two weeks, Fed-watchers say, most likely by pushing down long-term interest rates.
Cheaper credit could give the economy a boost -- and prompt more hiring -- by encouraging more borrowing, so companies and consumers have more money to spend. But with interest rates already low, it isn't certain how much this might help the economy, though proponents of more action by the Fed argue that this is better than not trying. 
The central bank has already undertaken a spate of unprecedented measures to reinvigorate growth, including two large rounds of asset purchases. At its August meeting, many Fed policy makers expressed interest in engaging in further easing measures, but could not agree what to do.
This dismal job report may spur them to action.
''I just don't think the Fed will sit idly as momentum fizzles in this recovery,'' said Dana Saporta, a United States economist at Credit Suisse. ''We fully expect some more action from the committee later this month.''
The Fed is running low on ammunition, though, and given political attacks on its accommodative measures thus far, its options are especially constrained.
As a result, economists predict that the Fed will change the composition of the assets on its balance sheet, instead of expanding its size as it has in the past. Right now the Federal Reserve holds about $1.7 trillion in United States Treasury securities, of a vast array. Some mature in a few days, and others in more than 10 years. Many economists are guessing that the central bank will start selling off the ones that mature soon, and buying up more Treasuries that mature later.
Buying more longer-term Treasuries increases the demand for longer-term issues. And as their prices rise, the interest rates on those securities fall, as do many other interest rates across the economy that are pegged to the Treasury rate.
In addition to stimulating the economy with cheaper credit, lower long-term interest rates could encourage investment in riskier assets, like stocks. After all, if 10-year Treasuries don't offer much in the way of returns, investors will seek higher returns elsewhere. If investors do start buying up riskier assets, those asset prices rise. Consumers then see that their portfolios are worth more, causing them to feel richer and so more comfortable with spending. This is known as the wealth effect.
There are limits to how aggressive the Fed can be in swapping out short-term securities for longer-term ones. If it sells too many shorter term notes, then short-term interest rates will rise, and the Fed has already promised markets that it will keep short-term rates near zero for the next two years.
Plus, after two rounds of quantitative easing and a worldwide flight to safety, longer term interest rates are already at historical lows of about 2 percent. It is not clear that lowering them further would do much to encourage more investment in riskier assets, or to increase lending.
''The cost of borrowing is not the problem,'' said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics. ''The problem is that there are not creditworthy borrowers, and that businesses don't want to invest because they're concerned about the economic outlook.''
Additionally, if investors do start increasing their investments in assets with higher returns, they may pour more money into commodities like oil. And commodity prices are already higher today than they were a year ago; pushing energy and food prices further up could actually discourage consumers from spending.
Other options that Fed might consider include lowering the interest rate it pays banks on excess reserves to encourage them to lend more, but many economists doubt that this would have substantial effects on growth. A more aggressive option would be to raise its medium-term target for inflation.
If prices are expected to rise, banks, businesses and consumers will be more eager to spend their money before it loses value. That could have positive effects throughout the economy, since spending means more demand for goods and services, which means companies need to hire more employees, which means more spending, and so on.
Additionally, inflation would lower the value of many people's debt burdens and so help with the painful process of deleveraging.
The problem, though, is that inflation has some major downsides, too -- especially if coupled with sluggish growth, as seen during the ''stagflation'' of the 1970s. Not having a good sense of how much your next gallon of milk or gas will cost is stressful, particularly if your wages aren't rising to match the higher prices. And some economists contend that raising inflation would only defer, not eliminate, the nation's problems.
''People who say we should get the inflation rate up to 5 percent forget that there's a second half of that policy: bringing it back down again,'' said Allan H. Meltzer, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon and a Fed historian. ''Raising it, that's the fun part. Lowering it, that's the painful part. At some time in the future you're going to have that pain. Why is it better later than now?''
Mr. Meltzer, like many other economists, argues that any further Fed actions will have little effect on the economy.
Even Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, stated in a speech last week that most of the tools that could be used to increase growth are ''outside the province of the central bank.''
In other words, said Ms. Saporta, ''the Fed is putting the ball back in Congress's court.''

HEADLINE: A School District Mimics Charters, Hoping Success Will Follow

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Classrooms are festooned with college pennants. Hallway placards proclaim: ''No Excuses!'' Students win prizes for attendance, and pore over math problems with newly hired tutors. They start classes earlier and end later than their neighbors; some return to school on Saturdays.
If these new mores at Lee High School, long one of Houston's most troubled campuses, make it seem like one of those intense charter schools, that's no accident.
In the first experiment of its kind in the country, the Houston public schools are testing whether techniques proven successful in high-performing urban charters like those in the Knowledge is Power Program, or KIPP, a national charter chain, can also help raise achievement in regular public schools. Working with Roland G. Fryer, a researcher at Harvard who studies the racial achievement gap, Houston officials last year embraced five key tenets of such charters at nine district secondary schools; this fall, they are expanding the program to 11 elementary schools. A similar effort is beginning in Denver.
''We can't sit idly by and let parents think that only the quality charter schools can educate poor kids well,'' said Terry Grier, Houston's hard-charging superintendent. ''If you see something good, why not try to replicate it?'' 
When first conceived 20 years ago, charter schools -- which are publicly funded but independently operated -- offered two distinct promises: to serve as an escape hatch for children in failing schools, and to be incubators of innovation that, through market forces, would invigorate neighborhood schools. There are scores of examples of the former, but almost none of the latter. Instead, years of bickering have ensued among charter advocates, school boards and teachers' unions.
''One of the rationales for charters was that they would figure out practices that could be adopted by school districts,'' said Grover J. Whitehurst, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and former federal education official. ''I hope Roland succeeds because if he does it'll be a very important demonstration that bad public schools can be fixed.''
Houston is an apt laboratory. It is the birthplace of KIPP as well as home to 105 charters that compete with the district's 300 schools for students and tax dollars. Texas is also a right-to-work state, which means school districts often have more leeway in managing teachers' work than elsewhere.
The experiment, which is known as Apollo 20 and cost $19 million in its first year, has had mixed results: Lee High School saw double-digit gains on state tests last spring, moving to ''acceptable'' on the Texas school report card system after many years of being rated ''unacceptable.'' But four of the nine Apollo schools remained on the unacceptable list, and some saw the percentage of students' passing state tests dip.
Dr. Fryer, an economist and head of Harvard's EdLabs, a research group, has gained national attention in recent years as the architect of incentive programs that offered students cash for improved performance, including one in New York City that was discontinued after being deemed ineffective. In recent years, he has visited scores of charter schools nationwide -- ''some should be closed down this afternoon,'' he said, but others have virtually erased the achievement gap between poor minority students and their white peers.
In 2009, Dr. Fryer identified five policies common to successful charters, including those run by KIPP and the Harlem Children's Zone: longer days and years; more rigorous and selective hiring of principals and teachers; frequent quizzes whose results determine what needs to be retaught; what he calls ''high-dosage tutoring''; and a ''no excuses'' culture. He then set about trying to find a public schools superintendent willing to embrace them. Neither Joel I. Klein in New York nor Michelle Rhee in Washington bit; officials in Omaha decided the political risks of copying charters were too high.
But in February 2010, Dr. Fryer spoke by phone with Dr. Grier, who had been on the job in Houston for six months. As a superintendent in eight other districts over 25 years, Dr. Grier had won plaudits from some educators for trying things like pay for performance and teacher bonuses. ''How soon can you get down here?'' Dr. Fryer recalled him asking.
Over the next six months, the two men selected the Apollo schools, hired several new principals and scores of new teachers, and recruited and trained some 200 math tutors. In the process, the district paid $6 million in severance to 100 teachers who chose to retire rather than participate, and agreed to pay others for working extra hours (something charters often do not do). The Houston Federation of Teachers, the city's largest union, took no formal position on the project.
The preparations were intense: half an hour before Dr. Fryer's wedding in June last year, Dr. Grier called his cellphone to review some details.
''Literally, I said, 'Terry, I gotta go, I gotta get married. I'll call you back,' '' Dr. Fryer recalled.
One of the people watching the experiment closely is Mike Feinberg, who co-founded the first KIPP school here in 1994, and now serves on the program's national board and runs its 20 Houston-area charters. Mr. Feinberg sees Houston's education marketplace as akin to when FedEx emerged to challenge the United States Postal Service. The result: Priority Mail.
''They've been trying to fix Lee High School for 20 years,'' he said. ''But up until now, there's been no competitive pressure for them to really get crazy and do transformational things.''
One of those transformational things at Lee High was hiring 50 full-time math tutors, who are paid $20,000 a year -- under $14 an hour -- plus benefits and possible bonuses if their students do well.
''I don't get this,'' Jennifer Martinez, a junior wearing an ''I love boys'' bracelet, told her tutor, Gerald Frentz, an engineer, one day last week.
They were talking about integers. Mr. Frentz, 56, retired from the Navy in 1986 and has since worked at Wang Computer and been a Tae Kwon Do instructor and substitute teacher. Jennifer's puzzlement visibly faded as he explained how negative 7 and positive 7 have the same absolute value -- definition: distance from zero -- but are separated by 14 ticks along a number line.
''It's an addictive experience,'' Mr. Frentz said of the tutoring.
Lee High's new principal, Xochitl Rodriguez-Davila, described a torrent of challenges, including the exhaustive review of transcripts and test results to organize class schedules and tutoring for 1,600 students; persuading parents to sign KIPP-style contracts pledging that they will help raise achievement; and replacing about a third of Lee's 100 teachers.
''Teachers by far have been the biggest struggle,'' said Ms. Rodriguez-Davila, 39, who previously had been a middle school principal.
In faculty meetings, she said, some people insisted that Lee's immigrant students would never master biology or physics. Other veterans, though, told the complainers to stop belly-aching and get on with the turnaround.
Dr. Fryer, who has made 17 trips to Houston over the past year, is watching not only the Apollo schools but a parallel control group of other Houston schools with similar demographics and prior test results, to rigorously analyze the effectiveness of the three-year experiment.
Even without the formal study, Dr. Grier knows that the mimicking of charter practices is, at best, partial. The nine Apollo secondary schools started Aug. 15, a week ahead of the rest of the district -- and the same day as KIPP. But even with Apollo's lengthened days, KIPP students had still more instructional hours last year: about 1,735, compared with about 1,435 at Lee High School.
''We got close, but we didn't get there completely,'' Dr. Grier said.

HEADLINE: Retrial for Clemens, And More Scolding For the Prosecutors

BYLINE: By JULIET MACUR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A federal judge ruled Friday that Roger Clemens, one of baseball's greatest pitchers, will face a new trial on charges that he lied to Congress about using performance enhancing-drugs.
The judge, Reggie Walton of Federal District Court, seemed reluctant to make the ruling, but said a second trial would not violate Clemens's constitutional rights that protect him from being tried twice for the same crime.
At his first trial, in July, Clemens faced charges of perjury, obstruction of Congress and making false statements in conjunction with his testimony to Congress regarding his suspected use of steroids and human growth hormone. Walton declared a mistrial two days into testimony because prosecutors showed jurors evidence that he had deemed inadmissible. 
On Friday, Walton said he hated to believe that such experienced prosecutors would have blatantly disregarded one of his rulings, but that ''it's hard for me to reach any other conclusion.''
The current state of the law, though, prevented him from barring the prosecutors from moving forward with a second trial, he said. He set a trial date of April 17, but not before raising the question of who should pay for the government's missteps.
''It doesn't seem fair, does it?'' Walton said of Clemens's having to pay for another trial, or at least part of it. ''Should he have to bear that economic expense, or should the United States bear that?''
For a second trial not to go forward, the defense would have needed to prove that the prosecutors goaded the defense into asking for a mistrial. That is a high bar to meet, Walton said, so high that he could not find a precedent for it. Walton said he did not think Clemens's lawyers met that burden.
The defense told Walton it would take a few days to decide if it would appeal, but clearly it was not happy with the decision.
Michael Attanasio, one of Clemens's lawyers, said Friday in his arguments that the prosecutors' errors at the initial trial were intentional and revealed ''a win-at-all-costs mentality.'' The errors were a tactic so that prosecutors could get a new trial because the first one was going badly, Attanasio said, adding that the government now has an unfair advantage because it has already heard the defense's opening statements and that a future jury pool will be tainted.
''This case should end; enough money has been wasted,'' Attanasio said before turning to Clemens, who was seated at the defense table. ''He's been put through enough.''
Clemens appeared unmoved by the announcement that he would face a new trial. On the government's side, one of the lead prosecutors, Steven Durham, stared at the ground and let out an extended breath.
Neither side commented on the ruling because the judge has barred the parties from speaking publicly about the case. But Durham left the courtroom with a slight smile, then hugged a woman who was waiting for him in the hallway.
Durham had delivered an emotional appeal to the judge to allow a new trial, taking the blame for the prosecution's showing the inadmissible evidence and acknowledging that he ''let a lot of people down.'' He said it was his responsibility to ensure that the government's evidence complied with the judge's rulings.
''I just didn't want the court to reach a conclusion that we were trying to play fast and loose and trying to violate a court order to put this man in a position where he can't get a fair trial,'' Durham told the judge, as his voice began to shake.
''My father was in the courtroom on July 14,'' he said. ''I would never dishonor my family by violating a court ruling.''
Yet a serious mistake still occurred. At the trial, jurors were shown a video from the 2008 Congressional hearings on steroid use in baseball in which Representative Elijah Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, read an affidavit by Laura Pettitte, the wife of former Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte.
In her affidavit, she said her husband told her that Clemens had admitted to him that he had used human growth hormone. In the days before the trial, the judge had ruled Laura Pettitte's testimony was hearsay.
More than once on Friday, Walton chastised the prosecutors for thinking that Cummings's comments, which included praise of Andy Pettitte -- a potential star witness for the government -- would be admissible.
''Even before that ruling, the mind-set should have been, this evidence can't be used,'' he said, sounding irritated.

MORE than a dozen American states are considering outlawing aspects of Shariah law. Some of these efforts would curtail Muslims from settling disputes over dietary laws and marriage through religious arbitration, while others would go even further in stigmatizing Islamic life: a bill recently passed by the Tennessee General Assembly equates Shariah with a set of rules that promote ''the destruction of the national existence of the United States.''
Supporters of these bills contend that such measures are needed to protect the country against homegrown terrorism and safeguard its Judeo-Christian values. The Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich has said that ''Shariah is a mortal threat to the survival of freedom in the United States and in the world as we know it.'' 
This is exactly wrong. The crusade against Shariah undermines American democracy, ignores our country's successful history of religious tolerance and assimilation, and creates a dangerous divide between America and its fastest-growing religious minority.
The suggestion that Shariah threatens American security is disturbingly reminiscent of the accusation, in 19th-century Europe, that Jewish religious law was seditious. In 1807, Napoleon convened an assembly of rabbinic authorities to address the question of whether Jewish law prevented Jews from being loyal citizens of the republic. (They said that it did not.)
Fear that Jewish law bred disloyalty was not limited to political elites; leading European philosophers also entertained the idea. Kant argued that the particularistic nature of ''Jewish legislation'' made Jews ''hostile to all other peoples.'' And Hegel contended that Jewish dietary rules and other Mosaic laws barred Jews from identifying with their fellow Prussians and called into question their ability to be civil servants.
The German philosopher Bruno Bauer offered Jews a bargain: renounce Jewish law and be granted full legal rights. He insisted that, otherwise, laws prohibiting work on the Sabbath made it impossible for Jews to be true citizens. (Bauer conveniently ignored the fact that many fully observant Jews violated the Sabbath to fight in the Prussian wars against Napoleon.)
During that era, Christianity was seen as either a universally valid basis of the state or a faith that harmoniously coexisted with the secular law of the land. Conversely, Judaism was seen as a competing legal system -- making Jews at best an unassimilable minority, at worst a fifth column. It was not until the late 19th century that all Jews were granted full citizenship in Western Europe (and even then it was short lived).
Most Americans today would be appalled if Muslims suffered from legally sanctioned discrimination as Jews once did in Europe. Still, there are signs that many Americans view Muslims in this country as disloyal. A recent Gallup poll found that only 56 percent of Protestants think that Muslims are loyal Americans.
This suspicion and mistrust is no doubt fueled by the notion that American Muslims are akin to certain extreme Muslim groups in the Middle East and in Europe. But American Muslims are a different story. They are natural candidates for assimilation. They are demographically the youngest religious group in America, and most of their parents don't even come from the Middle East (the majority have roots in Southeast Asia). A recent Pew Research Center poll found that Muslim Americans exhibit the highest level of integration among major American religious groups, expressing greater degrees of tolerance toward people of other faiths than do Protestants, Catholics or Jews.
Given time, American Muslims, like all other religious minorities before them, will adjust their legal and theological traditions, if necessary, to accord with American values.
America's exceptionalism has always been its ability to transform itself -- economically, culturally and religiously. In the 20th century, we thrived by promoting a Judeo-Christian ethic, respecting differences and accentuating commonalities among Jews, Catholics and Protestants. Today, we need an Abrahamic ethic that welcomes Islam into the religious tapestry of American life.
Anti-Shariah legislation fosters a hostile environment that will stymie the growth of America's tolerant strand of Islam. The continuation of America's pluralistic religious tradition depends on the ability to distinguish between punishing groups that support terror and blaming terrorist activities on a faith that represents roughly a quarter of the world's population.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sues 17 Mortgage Institutions

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and KEVIN ROOSE; Patrick Scott contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A bruising legal fight pitting the country's most powerful banks against the full force of the United States government began Friday, as federal regulators filed suits against 17 financial institutions that sold the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac nearly $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities that later soured.
The suits are the latest legal salvo fired at the banks accusing them of misdeeds during the housing boom. Investors fled financial shares Friday amid growing concern that the litigation could last for years and undermine earnings and balance sheets in the process. 
The complaints were filed just as the stock market closed Friday afternoon, but with word leaking out of the impending legal action during the trading session, shares of Bank of America fell more than 8.3 percent, while JPMorgan Chase dropped 4.6 percent and Goldman fell 4.5 percent.
''The suits only add to the uncertainty that dogs the industry,'' said Mike Mayo, an analyst with Credit Agricole. ''Banks should pay for what they did wrong, but at the same time they shouldn't be treated as a big pinata that has the effect of delaying the housing recovery. If banks have to pay for loans they made five years ago, are they going to make new ones?''
After the savings and loan crisis in the late 1980s and early 1990s, years of litigation followed. The mortgage bust and the subsequent financial crisis have spawned a similar legal fight, said Jaret Seiberg, a financial policy analyst with MF Global in Washington. ''It's going to be exceedingly difficult and take years to play out,'' he said. ''There's not much incentive for either side to settle.''
The litigation represents a more intense effort by the federal government to go after the financial services industry for its supposed mortgage failures.
Indeed, the cases were brought on the basis of 64 subpoenas issued a year ago, giving the government an edge in its investigation that private investors suing the banks lack.
The Obama administration as well as regulators like the Federal Reserve have been criticized for going too easy on the banks, which benefited from a $700 billion bailout package shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the autumn 2008.
Much of that money has been repaid by the banks -- but the rescue of the mortgage giants Fannie and Freddie has already cost taxpayers $153 billion, and the federal government estimates the effort could cost $363 billion through 2013.
Even though the banks already face high legal bills from actions brought by other plaintiffs, including private investors, the suits filed Friday could cost the banks far more. In the case against Bank of America, for example, the suit claims that Fannie and Freddie bought more than $57 billion worth of risky mortgage securities from the bank and two companies it also acquired, Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial.
In addition to suing the companies, the complaints also identified individuals at many institutions responsible for the machinery of turning subprime mortgages into securities that somehow earned a AAA grade from the rating agencies.
The filing did not cite a figure for the total losses the government wanted to recover, but in a similar case brought in July against UBS, the F.H.F.A. is trying to recover $900 million in losses on $4.5 billion in securities. A similar 20 percent claim against Bank of America could equal a $10 billion hit.
In a suit that identifies 23 securities that Bank of America sold for $6 billion, the company ''caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in an amount to be determined at trial.''
Within minutes of the filing of the suits, several banks responded with a preview of the legal arguments they will make in the coming months, namely that Fannie and Freddie were sophisticated investors who should have known the securities were not without risk, and that the losses were caused not by fraud or misrepresentation but by underlying difficulties in the housing market.
In a statement, Bank of America said Fannie and Freddie ''claimed to understand the risks inherent in investing in subprime securities and continued to invest heavily in those securities even after their regulator told them they did not have the risk management capabilities to do so.'' In spite of that warning, Bank of America said, the government-controlled mortgage giants ''are now seeking to hold other market participants responsible for their losses.''
Other large banks also assembled huge amounts of so-called private label mortgage-backed securities for Fannie and Freddie that declined sharply in value after the housing bubble burst in 2007. JPMorgan Chase sold $33 billion, while Morgan Stanley sold over $10 billion and Goldman Sachs sold more than $11 billion. A who's who of foreign banks were also big bundlers and sellers of these securities, like Deutsche Bank with $14.2 billion, Royal Bank of Scotland at $30.4 billion, and Credit Suisse selling $14.1 billion. All were sued Friday.
''We believe the claims brought by the F.H.F.A. are unfounded,'' said Frank Kelly, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank. ''Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the epitome of a sophisticated investor, having issued trillions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities and purchased hundreds of billions of dollars more, often after hand-picking the loans they now claim should not have been included in the offerings.''
Buried in the filings themselves, however, is a damning portrait of the excesses of the housing bubble, when borrowers were able to obtain home loans without basic proof of income or creditworthiness, and banks appeared only too happy to mine profits taking the risky loans and assembling them into securities that could be sold to investors.
In the complaint against Goldman Sachs, for example, the suit says that ''Goldman was not content to simply let poor loans pass into its securitizations.'' In addition, the giant investment bank ''took the fraud further, affirmatively seeking to profit from this knowledge.''
When an outside analytics firm, Clayton, identified potential problems in the underlying mortgages Goldman was turning into securities, the suit said, ''Goldman simply ignored and did not disclose the red flags revealed by Clayton's review.'' Goldman Sachs declined to comment, as did JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and Citigroup.
Similar behavior in terms of warnings provided by Clayton transpired at Bank of America, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, RBS and UBS, according to the complaints.

HEADLINE: Lots of Vitriol For Fed Chief, Despite Facts

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
Attacks on the chairman of the Federal Reserve aren't new. For years I've received a well-organized volley of vitriolic e-mails every time I mention Ben Bernanke. I dismissed them as missives from the lunatic fringe, at least until recently.
On Aug. 16, while speaking in Iowa, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, a Republican presidential candidate, took the demonization of Mr. Bernanke to a new level. He declared in much-quoted remarks -- and to appreciative laughter from the crowd -- that ''we would treat him pretty ugly down in Texas,'' and that Mr. Bernanke's monetary policy was ''almost treacherous -- or treasonous, in my opinion.''
The next day, in New Hampshire, Mr. Perry was less inflammatory but more pointed. ''They should open their books up,'' he said of the Fed. ''They should be transparent so that the people of the United States know what they are doing.'' 
Despite getting in ''trouble'' for calling Mr. Bernanke a traitor, as Mr. Perry subsequently put it, Mr. Perry vaulted to the top of polls and is now the unofficial Republican front-runner. Representative Michele Bachmann, the winner of the Iowa straw poll, has been burnishing her anti-Bernanke credentials, too, criticizing the Fed as ''opaque'' and reminding voters in South Carolina that she's against ''printing'' money.
Nor are such sentiments confined to Republican presidential candidates looking for quick political gain. Last week, I bumped into an acquaintance I've always considered thoughtful and intelligent. He, too, lit into Mr. Bernanke and the Fed with great fervor. He quoted the Austrian School, the once-obscure but newly vocal group of zealous free-market economists who trace their roots to the Hapsburg Empire, disdain the scientific method in economics and blame the Fed for the financial crisis and the faltering recovery.
No one in government, including the quasi-independent Federal Reserve chairman, should be above criticism. But if Mr. Bernanke is going to be the centerpiece of such a heated debate, it should be conducted on the facts. And in that respect, ''The level of ignorance among some of the Republican presidential candidates about monetary policy is stunning,'' Mark Gertler, a professor of economics at New York University, said this week. ''Mr. Perry has been taken to task for his choice of language, but not for the substance of his remarks, which is outrageous.'' (Mr. Gertler said he was a political independent but considered himself a friend of Mr. Bernanke, a Republican.) Even President Obama was curiously restrained in coming to Mr. Bernanke's defense, saying in a CNN interview only that Mr. Perry should be ''a little more careful about what you say.'' Although the Fed only belatedly identified the banks that received many billions of dollars of emergency loans during the crisis -- for which it has rightly been taken to task -- the Fed could hardly have been more transparent than it was recently about monetary policy.
It's hard to believe the Fed's critics have read the minutes of the Aug. 9 Fed Board and Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which were released this week. They may not read like a Robert Ludlum thriller, but they're nothing if not transparent. They spell out in great detail the Fed's reaction to the latest discouraging unemployment data, tepid economic growth and stock market volatility, including specific measures that might be used to address these problems.
Some members thought none of these measures would do any good. A majority nonetheless thought that something needed to be done, and chose to announce that the Fed would keep interest rates low for at least two years -- ''forward guidance,'' in Fed-speak -- as a ''possible way to reduce interest rates.'' Others wanted to peg the duration of low rates to a specific unemployment target, something the board deferred to a two-day meeting in September, when it will also consider other policy options.
The minutes provide a detailed portrait of a well-intentioned group of economists struggling to eke the maximum benefit from a dwindling and largely untested arsenal of monetary options, hardly a treasonous cabal bent on secretly conspiring to inflate its way to -- what? World domination?
The Fed has never in its history provided such explicit forward guidance, and so far that has had exactly the effect the Fed hoped for. Longer-term interest rates have dropped, with 10-year rates dipping below 2 percent for the first time in over half a century. This is significant, since it reduces borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. The stock market seems to have stabilized, at least for the moment. Though the Fed has been moving toward more openness for some time, Mr. Bernanke ''has been the most open and transparent Fed chairman in history,'' Mr. Gertler asserted.
It's also hard to fathom what Mr. Perry means when he calls for the Fed to ''open its books up.'' It publicly releases its current balance sheet every Thursday at approximately 4:30 p.m., and it's available on the Fed's Web site. Mr. Perry's campaign didn't respond to a request for comment.
The charge that the Fed is ''printing money'' seems to be shorthand for recklessly risking or even seeking inflation. That notion ''is complete nonsense,'' Robert E. Hall, a senor fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution and professor of economics at Stanford, told me. ''But it must be exciting to accuse him of things he hasn't done.''
As Mr. Bernanke noted in his recent policy speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo., ''we expect inflation to settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below the rate of 2 percent, or a bit less.'' Inflation in July was 3.63 percent, almost double the optimal rate, but this was largely because of higher oil prices stemming from turmoil in the Middle East and supply shortages from the earthquake in Japan, both transitory events. Inflation was barely over 2 percent before the earthquake and was negative for nine months in 2009.
If the inflation rate doesn't drop in the next six months or so, Mr. Bernanke should be held accountable. But meanwhile, ''the candidates have been trying to tie low rates to higher inflation, but the facts just aren't there,'' Mr. Gertler said. ''With short-term rates near zero, there's been no inflation to speak of for the past three years.''
As for economic growth and employment, Mr. Bernanke has said repeatedly that they have been disappointing. If anything, that's an argument for further monetary stimulus, a subject the Fed said it would revisit in September. No one on the Fed's board, not even the three members who dissented from the more explicit forward guidance, proposed that the Fed actually tighten monetary policy. ''No one I consider a serious economist favors tightening'' now, Mr. Hall said.
''Our economy is suffering today from an extraordinarily high level of long-term unemployment, with nearly half of the unemployed having been out of work for more than six months,'' Mr. Bernanke stressed at Jackson Hole -- something worth pondering this Labor Day weekend.
He also cautioned that the Fed could do only so much: ''Most of the economic policies that support robust economic growth in the long run are outside the province of the central bank. To achieve economic and financial stability, U.S. fiscal policy must be placed on a sustainable path that ensures that debt relative to national income is at least stable or, preferably, declining over time.''
In other words, our political leaders and those who aspire to replace them should be debating the fiscal policies that will put Americans to work in the short term and reduce the deficit in the long term -- not bashing the Fed.
I fear it's going to get uglier as the presidential campaign intensifies. Many voters seem determined to find a scapegoat for the financial crisis and its aftermath, and some candidates are only too willing to pander by serving up Mr. Bernanke. He hasn't commented publicly, and friends say he's taking the attacks in stride. Still, ''as a human being, this has to be exasperating,'' Mr. Gertler said. ''What he cares about is his place in history as a central banker.''
While debate continues about the Fed's role preceding the collapse of Lehman Brothers, during the crisis that followed ''all serious economists think he did a brilliant job in trying circumstances like no one else had ever seen,'' Mr. Gertler said, and Mr. Hall agreed with that assessment. ''At the height of the crisis he slept in his office,'' Mr. Gertler continued. ''He was working around the clock. Can you imagine what it feels like now being called a traitor?''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 7, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Common Sense column on Saturday, about criticism of Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, misstated the effect of the Fed's recent interest rate guidance on Treasury note yields. It was the yield on the 10-year note -- not the two-year note -- that dipped below 2 percent for the first time in over half a century. (The yield on the two-year note is hovering around 0.2 percent.)

HEADLINE: Perry's Blunt Views in Books Get New Scrutiny as He Joins Race

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, believes that climate change is a ''contrived, phony mess.'' The federal income tax was the ''great milestone on the road to serfdom.'' And the Boy Scouts of America are under attack by ''a radical homosexual movement.''
Mr. Perry also thinks that senators should be chosen by legislatures, not the people. And he says that Social Security, the retirement program for the nation's elderly, is a ''failure'' enacted during a power grab called the New Deal and is ''something we have been forced to accept.'' 
Those blunt assertions are in two books Mr. Perry wrote while building a deep base of support in Texas among evangelical voters and Tea Party supporters. But the books have drawn new scrutiny now that Mr. Perry, a Republican, is running for president.
On Wednesday, Mr. Perry is likely to be asked about some of the statements he makes in the books when he takes the stage in his first nationally televised presidential debate. How he responds, and whether he defends the ideas or distances himself from them, will be an early test of his campaign.
On the campaign trail, Mr. Perry talks in broad, vague terms about the need to get America working again. But his words are much more specific in the books.
So far, Mr. Perry has stood by his statements in his books while allowing aides to distance his campaign from the writings. His spokesman has called ''Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington'' a ''look back, not a path forward,'' but when a reporter in Iowa asked Mr. Perry himself whether he stood by his statements, he claimed not to have ''backed off anything in my book.''
Mark Miner, a spokesman for the governor, said Mr. Perry wrote the book to ''foster discussion and to encourage his fellow Americans to think about how we choose to govern ourselves.'' Mr. Miner said that the governor ''trusts the American people to govern themselves'' and said that principle would guide his thinking during the campaign.
But Mr. Perry's own words at the beginning of ''Fed Up!'' suggest that he did not intend for it to sit on a shelf. ''It is not enough to be fed up. We must act,'' he wrote in the first chapter.
Touching a potential political minefield, Mr. Perry unleashes a critique against Social Security as ''a crumbling monument to the failure of the New Deal.''
Mr. Perry's assault on the retirement program is not a throwaway line or two. He asserts that the social programs of the New Deal -- including Social Security -- ''never died, and like a bad disease, they have spread.'' He says the Social Security trust fund is an ''elaborate illusion cooked up by government magicians.''
Asked about the book recently, Mr. Perry went even further, calling Social Security a ''Ponzi scheme for these young people'' and a ''monstrous lie on this generation.''
But his words skim over the financial reality of Social Security. Economists of all stripes agree that the program, while stressed, would exhaust the money in the trust fund by 2037. But even then, taxes would pay for close to 80 percent of the benefits currently promised.
In ''Fed Up!,'' Mr. Perry contrasts himself with politicians who represent places like Massachusetts -- who he said support same-sex marriage and state-run health care. The passage, written less than a year ago, seems squarely aimed at his current rival, Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts.
When it comes to health care, Mr. Perry writes that President Obama's legislation on the subject was ''the closest this country has ever come to outright socialism,'' largely ignoring the fact that Mr. Obama's plan relies heavily on existing private insurance companies, doctors and drug manufacturers.
He takes particular aim at the 16th Amendment, which gives the federal government the power to levy an income tax, and the 17th Amendment, which allows for popular elections of senators rather than selection by state lawmakers.
Americans, Mr. Perry said, ''mistakenly empowered the federal government during a fit of populist rage in the early 20th century.''
His campaign has said Mr. Perry does not believe that either amendment should be repealed, though in the book he raises the possibility of a national sales tax to replace the income tax. A national sales tax could face stiff resistance because it could shift the tax burden to the poor and middle class.
Mr. Miner said the book merely ''reflects the governor's view of how our nation got into the mess we find ourselves in today.''
In his other book, ''On My Honor: Why the American Values of the Boy Scouts are Worth Fighting For,'' Mr. Perry, a former Eagle Scout, offers a defense against criticism of the Scouts for not allowing homosexuals to participate.
He lambastes the American Civil Liberties Union and people who ''claimed to be agnostics'' for their battle over many years to change the membership policies for the Scouts.
In one much-quoted passage, Mr. Perry compares gays and lesbians to alcoholics who choose to drink.
''Even if someone is attracted to a person of the same sex, he or she still makes a choice to engage in sexual activity with someone of the same gender,'' Mr. Perry writes.
His writings about homosexuality are a departure from many of his contemporaries in the Republican Party.
In Washington last year, Congress voted to end the military's ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy restricting gay and lesbian service members amid survey evidence of a new acceptance in the military and in the broader community.
In the book Mr. Perry also takes on the A.C.L.U. as leading a campaign against religion in public life, accusing ''a small minority of atheists'' of trying to sanitize our civil dialogue.
''They protesteth too much,'' he writes. ''It's as if the mere mention of a Creator is too powerful an idea for their own Godless ideology to withstand.''

HEADLINE: Zero Job Growth Latest Bleak Sign For U.S. Economy

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
August brought no increase in the number of jobs in the United States, a signal that the economy has stalled and that inaction by policy makers carries substantial risk.
The government report on hiring, released on Friday, prompted another round in a relentless diminution of economic expectations. The unemployment rate, at 9.1 percent, did not change last month, and the White House said it was expected to stay that high through at least 2012.
The optics of a giant zero in the jobs column -- more symbolically powerful, perhaps, than even a small decrease might have been -- increase the pressure on President Obama as he prepares to deliver a major address on job creation next week, on Republicans who have a starkly different approach to economic revival and on the Federal Reserve, whose policy makers have been divided over the wisdom of using its limited arsenal of tools to get the economy moving again. 
The White House immediately seized on the report to bolster the president's impending call to action. Republicans countered that the numbers were further proof that the stimulus policies of Mr. Obama, whom they quickly dubbed ''President Zero,'' were not working.
Mr. Obama, who instructed the Environmental Protection Agency on Friday to pull back on more stringent standards on ozone emissions in response to complaints that they would hurt hiring, is expected to propose tax incentives to promote hiring and infrastructure spending. He also is expected to renew the payroll tax cut and extend unemployment benefits, both of which are set to expire.
The Federal Reserve is expected to weigh whether to take steps to help lower long-term interest rates to bolster the economy at its two-day meeting this month.
The new data, a monthly snapshot from the Department of Labor, sent stocks sliding. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 253.31 points, 2.2 percent, Friday, closing at 11,240.26.
Some economists said the possibility of a double-dip recession was increasing.
''As long as payrolls are weak, you will continue to hear cries of not just recession risk but cries that the United States is in a recession and we just don't know it,'' said Ellen Zentner, the senior United States economist for Nomura Securities.
This is not the first time that job growth, the most important measure of the economy for many Americans, has ground to a halt since the recovery. It dropped into negative territory in the middle of last year after three months of strong showings. This time, the slowdown comes after the earthquake in Japan, a spike in oil prices and the European debt crisis, in addition to political gridlock in America.
Even if the economy does not contract, the projected growth rate is so slow it will not be enough to absorb new people entering the labor market, much less the unemployed.
''We have virtually the same number of jobs as we did in January 2000,'' said Patrick J. O'Keefe, the director of economic research at J. H. Cohn, an accounting firm. ''Were jobs to continue to grow at the 2011 monthly average, it would take more than four years to return to the prerecession employment level.''
In August, the private sector added 17,000 jobs, a number depressed by the Verizon strike. Some 45,000 Verizon workers were off the payroll when the survey was taken. They will reappear in next month's total. But even adding those workers back to the total, the gain would have been the smallest since May of last year.
The problem is less that companies are laying people off than that they are not hiring. Consumers and employers alike seem almost frozen in place, with many economists saying that they seemed paralyzed by uncertainty about the future after the brinksmanship of the debt ceiling debate, the ensuing cut in the United States credit rating by Standard & Poor's, stock market whiplash and more bad news from Europe.
''There is really a darkening cloud that seems to hover over the U.S. economy because of the lack of progress being made,'' said Bernard Baumohl, chief economist at the Economic Outlook Group. ''There is extreme frustration with Congress and the administration not working together to address the fiscal issues.''
Much of the movement that did appear in the jobs report went in the wrong direction. Revised numbers showed that job growth in June and July was smaller than previously indicated. In August, wages fell and the average number of hours worked inched down -- a sign that businesses had less for employees to do.
Governments continued to cut jobs, the Labor Department reported. Small gains at the state level were attributed in part to the return of workers from the government shutdown in Minnesota. Local governments lost 20,000 jobs as they continued to struggle with budget shortfalls and the disappearance of federal stimulus money.
Two of the bright spots in the economy over the last year, manufacturing and retail, lost steam, falling by 3,000 and 8,000 jobs, respectively. The health care sector added 29,700 jobs in August. Construction lost a net of 5,000 jobs.
The unemployed also seemed to be marching in place. Six million people have been out of work for 27 weeks or more, about the same number as in July. The median duration of unemployment, 21.8 weeks, increased slightly.
The general unemployment rate, which counts only people who looked for work in the previous four weeks, held steady at 9.1 percent. But a broader measure that includes people who have looked for work in the last year and people who were involuntarily working part time instead of full time fell slightly to 16.1 percent. The percent of working-age adults who were employed, already at its lowest rate since 1983, was at 58.2 percent.
Overall unemployment is lower than it was a year ago, but those gains have been among whites, Hispanics and Asians. For blacks, unemployment has increased, to 16.7 percent from 16.2 percent.

HEADLINE: On Race, The Silence Is Bipartisan

BYLINE: By DESMOND S. KING and ROGERS M. SMITH. 
Desmond S. King, a professor of American government at Oxford University, and Rogers M. Smith, a professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania, are the authors of ''Still a House Divided: Race and Politics in Obama's America.''

 BODY:
THE economic crisis in the United States is also a racial crisis. White Americans are hurting, but nonwhite Americans are hurting even more. Yet leaders in both political parties -- for different reasons -- continue to act as though race were anachronistic and irrelevant in a country where an African-American is the president.
In July, the unemployment rate was 8.2 percent for whites, but 16.8 percent for blacks and 11.3 percent for Latinos. The Pew Research Center estimates that in 2009, the median household net worth was $5,677 for blacks, $6,325 for Hispanics and $113,149 for whites -- down from $12,124, $18,539 and $134,992, respectively, in 2005. 
All groups have suffered from high unemployment, the mortgage meltdown and soaring health care costs, but African-Americans and Hispanics started far behind and continue to fall behind. In 2009, 35 percent of black households and 31 percent of Latino households had zero or negative wealth, compared with 15 percent of white households.
Since the end of legal segregation in the 1960s, there have been two approaches to ameliorating racial inequality. Conservatives and most Republican politicians insist that laws be colorblind and that race-conscious measures like affirmative action should be ended. Liberals and most Democratic politicians favor such measures, mindful of the burdens of past and present discrimination.
For most of the nation's history, the two major parties were internally divided over racial issues. But today, racial policy positions align almost perfectly with the party system. The two parties, which openly clashed over race from the late 1970s through the mid-1990s, have for the last decade pretty much agreed not to talk about race -- a silence that impedes progress toward racial equality.
Democrats mention race as little as possible, even though minority voters are crucial constituents, because colorblind positions are far more politically popular. Affirmative action has been supported in every Democratic presidential platform since 1972, but since the Reagan era, Democrats speak of it less and less.
President Obama, for example, does not openly renounce affirmative action, but he pragmatically stresses universal social programs like health care. He manages to avoid appearing especially concerned about African-Americans.
This tack leaves modern Republicans with little to criticize, lest they appear to be race-baiting, so they too keep quiet.
Advocates of both colorblind and race-conscious approaches to public policy now claim the mantle of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s civil rights agenda and his call for people to be judged by their character, not their skin. Though Republicans claim that free-market policies will lift all boats and Democrats hope that ''universal'' measures to combat economic inequality will benefit all groups, racial inequality has endured.
As studies of employment and real estate practices begun during the Reagan era have consistently shown, racial discrimination persists. And ''race neutral'' economic measures backed by Democrats, like the Earned Income Tax Credit and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, have proved too limited to aid many poorer blacks and Hispanics.
Political leaders must openly recognize that we cannot progress either by ignoring race or focusing exclusively on it. It is not only legitimate, but also essential, to evaluate policy options partly on the basis of whether they are likely to reduce or increase racial inequalities.
Compromise policies -- measures that are not explicitly race-targeted but are chosen partly because they will benefit nonwhites especially -- should become the basis for policy debates.
For example, without using explicit racial classifications, we can devise districts and situate homes in ways that are more likely to produce integrated schools and neighborhoods.
We can adopt employment tests that are fair and inclusive and do a better job at predicting job performance than many Civil Service exams now do.
And we can do more to ensure that our criminal laws do not target crimes more typical of urban Hispanics and blacks, like crack cocaine use, more strongly than crimes typical of suburban whites, like powder cocaine use.
Both parties should accept that the question of whether policies help narrow the racial divide must be part of the discussion. After all, it was the Republican-led search for racial progress in the 1860s and the Democratic-led fight for civil rights in the 1960s -- buttressed, of course, by African-Americans' own freedom struggle -- that allowed the election of a black president in 2008.

HEADLINE: New Urgency In the Battle For Stimulus

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Having battled for months over deficit reduction, President Obama and Congress on Friday each confronted new urgency to shift their focus to job creation after the most anemic employment report in many months.
For Mr. Obama, who last month promised a pivot to job creation, the Labor Department's report raises the stakes as he prepares for a prime-time national address on Thursday before a joint session of Congress. In the speech, he will outline a new round of economic stimulus measures.
In Congress, the reactions from some Republicans suggested small cracks in their party's wall of opposition to such measures, whether tax cuts or spending. That change underscored the potential of the moment to alter the dynamic in Washington as Congress returns from its recess, though the prospects of a major compromise on short-term stimulus and long-term deficit reduction remain remote.
Within the White House, the report gave ammunition to Obama advisers who have pressed internally for bolder action on tax cuts and spending measures as Mr. Obama makes the final changes to a speech that could be as important to his re-election prospects as any to date. No president since Franklin Roosevelt has been re-elected with unemployment so high. 
While the scale of stimulus measures Mr. Obama will seek remains unclear, early indications suggest it will far exceed the limited agenda that the White House was talking about as recently as July, which mostly called for extending for another year a payroll tax cut for workers and unemployment compensation for those out of jobs for six months or more.
Now Mr. Obama has said he will seek those extensions and more, including proposals to put people to work repairing and retrofitting roads, bridges, schools, airports, rails and other public projects, and giving tax incentives to employers to hire additional workers.
The rapidity with which the summer's signs of a weakening economy have raised calls for fiscal stimulus -- from economists, financial forecasters, business leaders and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke -- recalls the final months of 2008, as the near collapse of the financial system intensified the recession that year just as Mr. Obama was preparing to take office. Then, the incoming administration put together a package of tax cuts and spending measures that seemed to grow by the month, and finally passed Congress in February 2009 at nearly $800 billion for two years.
Nonpartisan analysts and the Congressional Budget Office have credited the first stimulus package with helping to end the recession and keep unemployment from growing even higher than it did. They say the winding down of the federal government's help this year has contributed to the economy's stall.
But Republicans, who solidly opposed the original stimulus program, say it was a failure that only dug the country deeper into debt -- a stand that hardly suggests they will be receptive to such ideas now. That argument against big government helped Republicans win control of the House last November, and they have since forced Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats into repeated rounds of spending cuts.
While that was widely welcomed at first, given the nation's mounting long-term debt, economists began to fret that the austerity measures in both the United States and Europe threatened to push the world into another recession. In an analysis this week, for example, the chief economist of OppenheimerFunds, Jerry A. Webman, cited ''the counterproductive approach Congress and the administration are taking to fiscal policy.''
Mr. Obama hopes to change the balance with his speech to Congress. He will call for short-term job creation measures now -- to prevent a recession that would widen annual deficits through lost revenue and safety-net spending -- and for deficit reduction proposals, including spending cuts and tax increases for people with higher incomes, that would take effect after the economy regained full health.
The conventional wisdom has been that Mr. Obama's job creation plan ''is likely to be dead on arrival,'' as one financial analysis group, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research, wrote to clients on Friday.
Yet Congressional Republicans' response to the disappointing jobs numbers suggested slightly more openness than before to Mr. Obama's pitch. The question is whether the shift is rhetorical or real.
House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, the Virginia Republican who has fostered a reputation as Mr. Obama's nemesis, in a statement cited two proposals Mr. Obama was expected to make in his address -- for infrastructure spending and for job training for the long-term unemployed -- as ''areas where we can work together to produce real results that will help job creators get people back to work.''
Some Republicans fear the party could bear the greater blame in 2012 if partisan obstruction against the president and political gridlock are seen as damaging to the economy. Through the August recess, unhappy constituents and liberal groups disrupted Republicans lawmakers' meetings in their districts, demanding jobs bills. And while national polls show Mr. Obama's ratings at record lows, the grades for Republicans and Congress are far worse.
Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis said in an interview that she hoped Republicans would embrace the ''bipartisan proposals'' Mr. Obama will make. ''If they're not supported,'' she said, ''then he's going to take it out to the public.''
Still, many Republicans see no reason to change course, one that is heavily influenced by the antigovernment Tea Party movement that helped them win power last year.
Representative Tom Price of Georgia, chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee, in a statement said more Americans would find jobs if ''Washington stops standing in the way.''
Democratic Congressional leaders called for adding job creation to the mandate of the special Congressional committee that was created by the deficit reduction deal to recommend up to $1.5 trillion in deficit reductions over a decade. Representative John Larson of Connecticut, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, introduced legislation to achieve that.
But Don Stewart, a spokesman for the Senate Republican minority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said, ''The mandate of this committee is deficit reduction, not new spending programs.''
Republicans blame the economy's weakness on the uncertainty businesses face as a result of the administration's actual and proposed regulations on health, environmental and financial matters.
Their main proposed remedy is to end those regulations, and Republicans claimed victory on Friday when Mr. Obama overruled the Environmental Protection Agency -- a favorite Republican target -- and shelved a plan for stricter standards against smog-causing pollutants that industries said would have huge costs in dollars and jobs.
That action by the president -- who, in a departure from most of the past months, did not appear in public today to speak about the jobs report -- suggests the increasing pressure he feels to curb his agenda, even at the expense of enraging supporters like environmentalists whose votes he will need next year.

HEADLINE: Obama abandons A Stricter Limit On Air Pollution

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; Leslie Kaufman contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama abandoned a contentious new air pollution rule on Friday, buoying business interests that had lobbied heavily against it, angering environmentalists who called the move a betrayal and unnerving his own top environmental regulators.
The president rejected a proposed rule from the Environmental Protection Agency that would have significantly reduced emissions of smog-causing chemicals, saying that it would impose too severe a burden on industry and local governments at a time of economic distress.
Business groups and Republicans in Congress had complained that meeting the new standard, which governs emissions of so-called ground-level ozone, would cost billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of jobs.
The White House announcement came barely an hour after another weak jobs report from the Labor Department and in the midst of an intensifying political debate over the impact of federal regulations on job creation that is already a major focus of the presidential campaign. 
The president is planning a major address next week on new measures to stimulate employment. Republicans in Congress and on the campaign trail have harshly criticized a number of the administration's environmental and health regulations, which they say are depressing hiring and forcing the export of jobs.
The E.P.A., following the recommendation of its scientific advisers, had proposed lowering the so-called ozone standard of 75 parts per billion, set at the end of the Bush administration, to a stricter standard of 60 to 70 parts per billion. The change would have thrown hundreds of American counties out of compliance with the Clean Air Act and required a major enforcement effort by state and local officials, as well as new emissions controls at industries across the country.
The administration will try to follow the more lenient Bush administration standard set in 2008 until a scheduled reconsideration of acceptable pollution limits in 2013. Environmental advocates vowed on Friday to challenge that standard in court, saying it is too weak to protect public health adequately.
Ozone, when combined with other compounds to form smog, contributes to a variety of ailments, including heart problems, asthma and other lung disorders.
Lisa P. Jackson, the E.P.A. administrator, has pushed hard for a tougher ozone standard, telling associates that it was one of the most important regulatory initiatives she would handle during her tenure. But she found herself on the losing end of a fight with top White House economic and political advisers, who were persuaded by industry arguments that the 2008 ozone rule was due to be reviewed in two years anyway and who were concerned about the impact on state, local and tribal governments that would bear much of the burden of compliance.
The impact would have been felt heavily in a band of Midwest and Great Plains states that are not themselves major sources of ozone pollution and that will be critical 2012 electoral battlegrounds.
In a statement, the president reiterated his commitment to environmental concerns, but added: ''At the same time, I have continued to underscore the importance of reducing regulatory burdens and regulatory uncertainty, particularly as our economy continues to recover. With that in mind, and after careful consideration, I have requested that Administrator Jackson withdraw the draft Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards at this time.''
In words of reassurance directed at Ms. Jackson and the agency she heads, the president said that his commitment to the work of the agency was ''unwavering.''
''And my administration will continue to vigorously oppose efforts to weaken E.P.A.'s authority under the Clean Air Act or dismantle the progress we have made,'' he said.
Ms. Jackson accepted the White House decision with a terse statement: ''We will revisit the ozone standard, in compliance with the Clean Air Act.''
She pointed with pride to the administration's record of establishing a range of other air quality safeguards for power plants, manufacturing facilities and vehicles that will also help to reduce ozone pollution across the country.
Ms. Jackson had made clear her intention to follow her scientific advisers and set a new standard within the more restrictive range by the end of this year. She has told associates that her success in addressing this problem would be a reflection of her ability to perform her job. The agency sent the now-rejected standards to the White House in July with the expectation that they would be issued by Aug. 31.
While some senior agency officials expressed disappointment with the decision, they also said they understood that it was their job to offer their best technical advice to the White House and that the ultimate decision rested with the president, who has to stand for re-election and consider other factors.
Reaction from environmental advocates ranged from disappointment to fury, with several noting that in just the past month the administration had tentatively approved drilling in the Arctic, given an environmental green light to the 1,700-mile Keystone XL oil pipeline from Alberta, Canada, to Texas and opened 20 million more acres of the Gulf of Mexico to drilling.
Daniel J. Weiss, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said, ''Today's announcement from the White House that they will retreat from implementing the much-needed -- and long-overdue -- ozone pollution standard is deeply disappointing and grants an item on Big Oil's wish list at the expense of the health of children, seniors and the infirm.'' The center is a liberal research group with close ties to the White House.
Bill McKibben, an activist leading a two-week White House protest against the pipeline project which has resulted in more than 1,000 arrests, said that the latest move was ''flabbergasting.''
''Somehow we need to get back the president we thought we elected in 2008,'' he said.
Cass R. Sunstein, who leads the White House office that reviews all major regulations, said he was carefully scrutinizing proposed rules across the government to ensure that they are cost efficient and based on the best current science. He said in a letter to Ms. Jackson that the studies on which the E.P.A.'s proposed rule is based were completed in 2006 and that new assessments were already under way.
The issue had become a flashpoint between the administration and Republicans in Congress, who held up the proposed ozone rule as a test of the White House's commitment to regulatory reform and job creation. Imposing the new rule before the 2012 election would have created political problems for the administration and for Democrats nationwide seeking election in a brittle economy.
Leaders of major business groups -- including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute and the Business Roundtable -- met with Ms. Jackson and with top White House officials this summer seeking to moderate, delay or kill the rule. They told William M. Daley, the White House chief of staff, that the rule would be very costly to industry and would hurt Mr. Obama's chances for a second term.
John Engler, a former governor of Michigan and chairman of the Business Roundtable, said Friday in a statement: ''Creating U.S. jobs and providing more economic certainty for all Americans, especially on the heels of today's news that the U.S. unemployment rate remains persistently high, is our greatest challenge. If President Obama's speech next week is as positive as this decision was today, it will be a success.''
Representative Eric Cantor, the majority leader, said this week that the House would review the ozone rule, which he called the most onerous of all proposed regulations.
''This effective ban or restriction on construction and industrial growth for much of America is possibly the most harmful of all the currently anticipated Obama administration regulations,'' Mr. Cantor wrote. He said that the impact would be felt across the economy and cost as much as $1 trillion and millions of jobs over the next decade.

HEADLINE: A Bad Call on Ozone

 BODY:
President Obama's decision not to proceed with stronger air-quality standards governing ozone is a setback for public health and the environment and a victory for industry and its Republican friends in Congress. 
In a terse, three-paragraph statement Friday morning, the president said he did not want to burden industry with new rules at a time of great economic uncertainty, and he pledged to revisit the issue in two years. But since the proposed rules would not have begun to bite for several years, his decision seemed driven more than anything else by politics and his own re-election campaign.
Ozone is the main component of smog, a leading cause of respiratory and other diseases. The standards governing allowable ozone levels of ozone in communities across the country have not changed since 1997. In 2008, the Bush administration proposed a new standard that was a good deal weaker than the recommendations of the E.P.A.'s science advisers and were promptly challenged in courts by state governments and environmental groups.
This summer, Lisa Jackson, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, sent a new and stronger standard to the White House -- igniting a fierce lobbying campaign by industry groups asserting that the standards would require impossibly costly investments in new pollution controls and throw people out of work. Industry has made these arguments before. They almost always turn out to be exaggerated.
The president sought to assuage Ms. Jackson by reminding her that a host of other environmental rules approved or in the works -- including mandating cleaner cars and fewer power plant emissions of mercury and other pollutants -- would do much to clean the air. All true. But there is still no excuse for compromising on public health and allowing politics to trump science.

HEADLINE: The Austerity Economy

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: It's here, and it's ugly.

 BODY:
Do the dismal economic numbers really reflect the turn to fiscal austerity? I keep hearing people say no, because austerity hasn't actually happened yet in America. But they're wrong.
The fact is that the fading out of the stimulus, and in particular of aid to state and local governments, is already and noticeably leading to substantial withdrawal of government demand. Look, in particular, at actual government purchases of goods and services -- governments at all levels buying stuff -- which is what standard macroeconomics says should have the highest multiplier, since unlike transfers and tax cuts it is by definition spent rather than saved. Here's the picture, showing changes in real spending over the previous year:
When the recession officially ended, spending was rising at an annual rate of around $60 billion; now it's declining at an annual rate of $60 billion. That difference is around 1 percent of GDP, and maybe 1.5 percent once you take the multiplier into account. That makes the turn toward austerity a major factor in our growth slowdown.
Still, I guess the beatings will continue until morale improves.

HEADLINE: Man Charged With Stealing Laptops at U.S. Open

BYLINE: ELIZABETH A. HARRIS


HIGHLIGHT: A Queens man has been charged with stealing two laptops from inside the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center at the United States Open this week, the Queens district attorney said Saturday.

 BODY:
A Queens man has been charged with stealing two laptops from inside the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center at the United States Open this week, the Queens district attorney said Saturday. 
When law enforcement officials searched the man's home for the stolen goods, they found more than what they had gone for: they also found cocaine, a loaded gun, lots of bullets, and three laptops stolen from the United States Open last year. 
Kenneth R. O'Quinn, 45, who was working as a janitor at the Open, in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, was caught by a security camera earlier this week making an overnight stop at the SmashZone - an area in the tennis center that features scaled-down tennis courts for children. According to the district attorney's office, Mr. O'Quinn slipped away from the area with a bulky backpack stuffed under his jacket. 
The police later questioned Mr. O'Quinn, who said that he had stolen the computers and stowed them at his home in Corona, Queens. When the police went to recover the laptops, they reported finding a silver 9-millimeter pistol, 27 rounds of ammunition, more than half an ounce of crack cocaine, some marijuana and three more stolen computers.
"The U.S. Open tennis championships is a prestigious international sporting event that draws people from all over the world and has a significant impact on our local economy," the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said. "As such, it is vitally important that nothing mars its image in the eyes of the world."
Mr. O'Quinn was awaiting arraignment in Queens Criminal Court on charges including grand larceny, criminal possession of a controlled substance, and criminal possession of a weapon. If convicted, he could face up to 15 years in prison.

HEADLINE: Sunday Breakfast Menu, September 4

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: For Labor Day weekend, the talk shows are discussing jobs.

 BODY:
In anticipation of President Obama's prime time address to unveil his job-creation proposal on Thursday, the Sunday shows are fittingly taking Labor Day weekend to discuss jobs.
ABC's "This Week" and CNN's "State of the Union" talk to Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, about the economy, as well as the presidential race. Mr. DeMint, who is a Tea Party favorite, will host a forum in South Carolina featuring several of the Republican candidates, including Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul, on Monday. Meanwhile, Mrs. Bachmann and Jon M. Huntsman Jr. will be on CBS's "Face the Nation," weighing in on the economy and the election.
James P. Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, also joins CNN to talk about jobs, and Bloomberg's "Political Capital" features Richard Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
One week before the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Independent of Connecticut and chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, and Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, discuss national security on CNN. Are Americans safer today than they were 10 years ago?
NBC's "Meet the Press" features a panel that includes Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California and member of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mark McKinnon, a former adviser to President George W. Bush, and Doris Kearns Goodwin, a presidential historian. The roundtable will discuss jobs, the presidential race and the 10th anniversary of 9/11.
C-Span's "Newsmakers" plays host to Gov. John Kasich, Republican of Ohio, who will defend his decision to limit collective bargaining rights for state employees.
And former Vice President Dick Cheney joins "Fox News Sunday" to talk about his new book, "In My Time."

HEADLINE: Broken Windows, Ozone, and Jobs

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A lousy decision all around.

 BODY:
I've actually been avoiding thinking about the latest Obama cave-in, on ozone regulation; these repeated retreats are getting painful to watch. For what it's worth, I think it's bad politics. The Obama political people seem to think that their route to victory is to avoid doing anything that the GOP might attack -- but the GOP will call Obama a socialist job-killer no matter what they do. Meanwhile, they just keep reinforcing the perception of mush from the wimp, of a president who doesn't stand for anything.
Whatever. Let's talk about the economics. Because the ozone decision is definitely a mistake on that front.
As some of us keep trying to point out, the United States is in a liquidity trap: private spending is inadequate to achieve full employment, and with short-term interest rates close to zero, conventional monetary policy is exhausted.
This puts us in a world of topsy-turvy, in which many of the usual rules of economics cease to hold. Thrift leads to lower investment; wage cuts reduce employment; even higher productivity can be a bad thing. And the broken windows fallacy ceases to be a fallacy: something that forces firms to replace capital, even if that something seemingly makes them poorer, can stimulate spending and raise employment. Indeed, in the absence of effective policy, that's how recovery eventually happens: as Keynes put it, a slump goes on until "the shortage of capital through use, decay and obsolescence" gets firms spending again to replace their plant and equipment.
And now you can see why tighter ozone regulation would actually have created jobs: it would have forced firms to spend on upgrading or replacing equipment, helping to boost demand. Yes, it would have cost money -- but that's the point! And with corporations sitting on lots of idle cash, the money spent would not, to any significant extent, come at the expense of other investment.
More broadly, if you're going to do environmental investments -- things that are worth doing even in flush times -- it's hard to think of a better time to do them than when the resources needed to make those investments would otherwise have been idle.
So, a lousy decision all around. Are you surprised?

HEADLINE: On the Trail in New Hampshire, Perry Focuses on Jobs

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: In a speech at a campaign stop Saturday afternoon, Mr. Perry said he personally would save the country by limiting the role of the federal government and by creating jobs.

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. -- You can just call him Superman.
At least, that's what Governor Rick Perry of Texas told a nine-year-old boy at a Manchester house party Saturday, when the boy, Ari, asked him which superhero he would be, if he could posses superhuman powers.
"I'm going to show you my age a little bit, Ari, because I don't know any of the real current superheroes," Mr. Perry said, gamely fielding the question. "But there was one back in my day named Superman, and Superman came to save the United States."
In a speech at a campaign stop Saturday afternoon, Mr. Perry said he personally would save the country by limiting the role of the federal government and by creating jobs, though he did not offer many specifics on how exactly he would foster job growth, other than referring to his record in Texas.
"I'm tired of liberals who only care about jobs just to staff up more government programs," Mr. Perry said, speaking from a Manchester front yard. "I want to create jobs so that families can have more income, so families can live free. Jobs are about dignity for American families, so that people are able to live the American dream."

He added: "I'll promise you this, I'll go to the Oval Office every day and try to make Washington, D.C., as inconsequential in your life as I can. Every day!"
Mr. Perry also attacked President Obama over his health care plan, making a promise that his fellow Republican rival, Mitt Romney, often trots out on the stump.
"I will repeal Obamacare as soon as possible, the first day I step into the Oval Office, with a signature on the Executive Order," Mr. Perry said. 
Though Mr. Perry did not mention any of the Republican field by name, he praised them in the most general of terms, and sought to set himself apart from Mr. Obama.
"In the coming months, you're going to hear a lot of appeals from my Republican friends who are running for president," Mr. Perry said. "Let me just go on the record: We're all good men and women. But as we consider this economic misery that spread across this country by the Obama administration, we don't need a nominee who's going to blur the differences between themselves and Barack Obama. We're going to have a nominee who draws a clear contrast."
The differences between himself and Mr. Obama, he said, "are great."
"He's lost more than a million jobs while he's been president, I've created a million jobs since I've been the governor," Mr. Perry said. "He's increased debt by $4 trillion, I've signed six balanced budgets."
Mr. Perry has never lost an election since he first entered politics in 1984, but this is his first national election, and in recent weeks and days his record - and the two books he's written - have come under increased scrutiny. But Mr. Perry said that he's having a grand time on the campaign trail.
"I've run for governor of Texas three times, but I have never seen crowds as excited, I have never seen people more powerfully inclined to be engaged in this political process and I just think Americans are thirsting for a leader, someone who will stand up and say here's where we're going to go," he said, to applause. "Someone who Americans trust can lead us to a place where this country deserves to be and that is a place where everyone who wants a job has a job."
By the early evening, however, his stamina seemed to be flagging slightly. At a house party in Chichester, N.H., he gave an almost identical version of the roughly twelve minute speech he'd given earlier, but this time his delivery was less fluid, and he paused at moments, seeming to briefly lose the thread of his sentence.

HEADLINE: Palin Rails Against 'Crony Capitalism' and 'Career Politicians'

BYLINE: JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: On Saturday, Sarah Palin did not say whether she would seek the Republican presidential nomination, but she made clear that she has no intentions of simply falling into line behind one of the party's leading candidates.

 BODY:
INDIANOLA, Iowa -- Sarah Palin did not say whether she would seek the Republican presidential nomination, but she made clear during a speech here on Saturday that she has no intentions of simply falling into line behind one of the party's leading candidates.
At times she sounded like a candidate. At times she did not.
But in a 40-minute speech before a Tea Party rally here, which was one of her most expansive addresses since she accepted the Republican vice presidential nomination three years ago, she railed against "crony capitalism" in both parties. She suggested that the "permanent political class" -- Republicans, too -- needed to be rattled.
"You know that it's not enough to just change up the uniform," Ms. Palin said. "If we don't change the team and the game plan we won't save our country."
Her appearance at a Tea Party of America rally drew about 2,000 people on a rainy afternoon. A persistent downpour turned the grounds of the National Balloon Classic Field about 20 miles south of Des Moines into a soggy and muddy mess, but that did not deter the crowd from sitting outdoors for several hours to await her arrival.
In her speech, Ms. Palin assailed the Washington establishment, directing most of her criticism at President Obama, but saving plenty for Republicans. The themes carried familiar strains from her time as governor of Alaska, when she was known for an independent streak that aggravated both parties.

"The real challenge is who and what we will replace him with," Ms. Palin said, referring to her goal of making Mr. Obama a one-term president. She added, "America is at a tipping point. This is a systemic crisis due to failed policies and incompetent leadership."
She outlined economic proposals for creating jobs, including the elimination of all federal corporate income taxes. She said the cozy relationship between political contributions and government favors needed to be exposed and eliminated.
Ms. Palin criticized career politicians. She did not mention any candidates by name, but her aides have quietly pushed back against the conventional wisdom that she was considering endorsing Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. She said that it was not enough simply to replace Mr. Obama with an ordinary Republican administration.
"You must vet a candidate's record," Ms. Palin said, delivering an admonition to a crowd that traveled here from Iowa and points across the country. "You must know their ability to successfully reform and actually fix problems that they are going to claim that they inherited."
In a brief exchange with reporters as she shook hands, signed autographs and posed for pictures for more than 30 minutes after her speech, she smiled and did not answer when asked if her comments were directed at Mr. Perry.
"I want all of our GOP candidates to take the opportunity to kill corporate capitalism that is leading to this cronyism that is killing our economy," Ms. Palin said. "They all have an opportunity to speak out against it. That's what I want them to do."
Her comments suggested that she intended to play a role in the Republican nominating contest -- and the general election -- regardless of whether she is a candidate. Asked whether she would be letting her supporters down if she didn't enter the race, she said: "Oh, these are such nice people."
The rally took on the feel of a Palin reunion, with conservative bloggers and activists from across the country traveling to Iowa. A random sampling of conversations with people in the crowd found supporters who had driven from Alabama, Maryland, Texas, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania, New York and Wisconsin. 
Ron Dahlberg, who owns a real estate company in Wisconsin, said he left his home at 2 a.m. for the 387-mile trip to Indianola. He came to the rally to show his support for Ms. Palin and hoped that she would join the presidential race. He said he was infuriated at Republican Party leaders for not backing her candidacy.
"Has there ever been a person of her stature that they have told not to run?" Mr. Dahlberg said. "They are afraid of her. If she wins, it will change the dynamic in the country. Women of all kinds will support her."
In her speech, she drew laughs when she said that neither her message nor her political plans would be driven by public opinion polls. She said with a smile: "Polls -- they're for strippers and cross-country skiers."
She took a gentle swipe at Republican pundits who have admonished urged her to stay out of the presidential race. She did not directly name Karl Rove, the chief strategist to George W. Bush, but her point was made clear by the crowd's applause. 
"I don't hire those political advisers, just so they say something nice about me on TV," Ms. Palin said. "Like you, I'm not for sale."
Her Labor Day weekend schedule also includes an appearance on Monday at a Tea Party rally in New Hampshire. With deadlines looming to raise money, build a campaign organization and start the process of collecting signatures to get her name on the ballot, she has said that she likely intends to make a decision by late September.
"I'm still not ready to make any kind of an announcement," Ms. Palin told Tthe Des Moines Register on Saturday. "I'm still trying to figure it out -- if it's the right thing to do."
An earlier version of this post said Sarah Palin accepted the vice presidential nomination four years ago, rather than three.

HEADLINE: On the Fringe, With Benefits

BYLINE: By CHRISTIAN L. WRIGHT

 BODY:
''HEY, look out!'' cried a man on the street as he grabbed an elderly woman from the path of a bicyclist whizzing down the steep slope of West 181st Street, toward Riverside Drive. The cyclist was gone in a flash, trailed by a few choice expletives from the pedestrians in his wake. No one was hurt, yet there was plenty of harrumphing on the sidewalk. People gathered to commiserate, to make sure the woman was O.K., and to see if anyone needed help carrying packages up the hill.
This neighborhood is not for everyone, said Laura Hembree, a longtime resident of Washington Heights who is also a broker at Simone Song Properties, which has served these parts for 25 years. ''You have to like the parks and the quiet and not be concerned with being in the fashionable place.''
West 181st, from Fort Washington Avenue to Riverside Drive, cuts through a part of the city that seems caught in time. If not a leafy European suburb unruffled by economic crisis, then perhaps the Upper West Side, circa 1987, before the slick condos and big-box stores began to take over. In fact, there are a lot of expats from 10025 here. (Earlier immigrants include the Dutch, the Irish, German Jews, Russians, Dominicans and Mexicans.) 
Only three blocks in length, the stretch seems a lot longer, in part because of its hilly topography, curving pattern, big sky and leisurely rhythm -- whizzing bikes notwithstanding.
Here, neighbors stop to say hello to one another. Dogs on leashes do, too. Fathers mind the kids, some of them trooping up to Bennett Park where a high natural point in Manhattan (267.75 feet above sea level) is marked with a plaque on a stone. Ladies in Lycra chat post-workout in front of a Pilates studio. Old people mix with trendy young ones. A woman who lives at Pinehurst Avenue and 181st has a place in the Catskills where she grows things to sell at her little farm stand, which appears sporadically on the sidewalk.
There's even an echo of Montmartre on the tree-shaded steps between Cabrini and Pinehurst Avenues that lead from West 181 to West 183 Street and Bennett Park, complete with cigarette butts by the benches and buckets of empty booze bottles.
''It's surprisingly friendly and open,'' said Barbara Taylor, 65, a fund-raiser who moved to 870 West 181st Street in 1986. When she first arrived, ''there was fear,'' she said. ''Crack cocaine and a couple of murders. Now there are a significant number of musicians, actors and other artsy types, and still those vestiges of wonderful old folks.''
Along with one bustling block on West 187th Street, West 181st is the commercial center of Hudson Heights, a microneighborhood within Washington Heights. It is roughly demarcated by Broadway to the east, 173rd Street to the south, Fort Tryon Park to the north, and, indisputably, the Hudson River to the west.
The good people of Washington Heights may bristle when they hear the sloping patch referred to as Hudson Heights. Maybe it has the whiff of elitism, this carving out of a few blocks that are markedly tidier and more white-collar than the rest of the district. But names change: Washington Heights takes its name from Fort Washington, which, for a while after the British captured New York, became Fort Knyphausen. Cabrini Boulevard, named in 1939 in honor of Mother Frances Xavier Cabrini, the first American citizen to be canonized by the Roman Catholic Church, used to be plain old Northern Boulevard.
Take the A train, as the songwriter Billy Strayhorn did in the 1940s, en route to visit Duke Ellington in Sugar Hill (''Hurry, get on, now it's coming/Listen to those rails a-thrumming''). Don't get off until 181st Street -- about 26 minutes from 14th Street. Then, pop out of the station to enter another world.
''The air is good,'' said a resident who moved here 10 years ago from the East Village and was out walking his little terrier the other day. No one asked him; he just volunteered his critique in a nice, neighborly way.
Apartments go for a lot less here than in many other parts of Manhattan. A 1,050-square-foot garden apartment in Hudson View Gardens, a 1924 co-op that seems plucked from the imagination of Beatrix Potter, recently sold for under $500,000. A 1,500-square-foot loft space at 875 West 181st Street, a co-op constructed in 1917, is listed at $699,000. In SoHo, that kind of loft space would cost at least $2 million -- and it would not come with unobstructed views of the George Washington Bridge and the open sky over the Hudson River across to the Palisades.
Those are what the trade calls trophy views.
According to the Corcoran Group, whose broker Kelly Cole and her team do a lot of business in Upper Manhattan, the average sale price in the second quarter of 2011 for co-ops uptown, including Hudson Heights, was $584 per square foot. Downtown, the average was $891; the East Side, $943; and the West Side, $978.
It feels like a hamlet, especially when a black squirrel skitters across your path, or you hear German spoken, or you notice that the locals refer to anything south of the George Washington Bridge as ''downtown.'' There is lots of greenery, and residential complexes with well-kept private gardens.
But there's concrete, ethnicity and bustle, too. New restaurants are opening up, following Saggio (No. 829), the sunny Northern Italian that's become a neighborhood favorite. The expansive Cabrini Wines and Liquors (No. 831), owned by Ernest Campos, whose family came from Cuba and who has been doing business here for 35 years, serves as a kind of community hangout.
Moscow on the Hudson (No. 801) is a funny little market with shelves piled high with jars with Russian labels identifying marinated mushrooms, special mustards and ''chilly'' sauce, and a glass display featuring smoked mackerel, salamis and cakes. A Starbucks has taken over a corner of Fort Washington Avenue. There's always a scene on the benches out front: serious cyclists, old dears, novel readers, weary travelers. And the other day, a preppy young couple walked by, he carrying a trumpet in a leather case. On the sidewalk outside Lissemore Music Studios at 495 Fort Washington, you sometimes can hear opera singers practicing.
It's no wonder that people come to West 181st Street to discover this part of Manhattan. ''More space for the dollar, that's the obvious draw,'' said Paul Cole, a sales agent with the Corcoran team led by Ms. Cole (his wife). ''But there's also a little bit of a different quality of life.''
Ms. Taylor, who lives in 2,000 square feet overlooking the Hudson, agrees. ''It's infinitely friendlier,'' she said. ''It really is small townish. There's something so relaxing in having that big damn river. And the bridge, when it's illuminated, it's like honeycombs.''

HEADLINE: Learning to Talk It Out

BYLINE: By ERIC V. COPAGE

 BODY:
SARAH CROPLEY HENLEY still likes the looks of her husband's kneecaps. Those were the physical attributes she first noted about Steve Henley when they met. He was dressed as a 13th-century Scotsman, in kilt and handmade shoes, at an outing organized by the Society for Creative Anachronism, to which they both belonged.
Over their decadelong marriage, Ms. Henley, 33, remains steadfast in her admiration of her spouse's knees, and he remains steadfast in his appreciation of ''everything about her face: The way her eyes are set, and the shape of her nose, and the curve of her chin.'' 
But many things have changed in their lives. For example, the constraints of Ms. Henley's studies for her second graduate degree (this one in Shakespeare), the couple's individual jobs and raising their 3-year-old son have cut into their free time so they are no longer active in the society, which recreates life in the Middle Ages.
When they married on May 12, 2001, Mr. Henley, was a service technician and construction supervisor at Swindell Dressler International, a kiln manufacturer in Coraopolis, Pa. He was laid off in January 2003, but it looked to be a golden opportunity for him.
''It's always been a dream of mine to start a company of my own,'' said Mr. Henley, 50. In the spring of 2003 he opened Parapet Builders, a construction company based in Long Valley, N.J. He employed up to six people, and they started out specializing in home repair and moved up to home additions, with the goal of eventually constructing entire houses.
But in 2007-8, the bottom fell out.
They had moved to Virginia, where Ms. Henley began her second graduate degree studies. ''I had taken another job because building had come to a standstill,'' Mr. Henley said. He scrambled and found employment as a department supervisor in a food-processing plant in Virginia, and it made him miserable: ''For 18 months I worked from 3 p.m. to 3 a.m., and I hated it. I never got to see my family.''
Simultaneously, Ms. Henley, who was pregnant during that period, often returned home from work in tears.
''The economy really started to falter,'' said Ms. Henley, who at the time was the education program manager at the American Shakespeare Center in Staunton, Va.
''Uncomfortable cuts were being made,'' she said. ''I'd been in the job for three years, but it felt longer because it was tied to the graduate school I had attended. It was tough because I very much liked my job.'' She did not want to lose it.
Neither spouse let the other know of the dissatisfaction and insecurities. But stress would leak out in the form of ''nitpicking'' and ''throwing barbs at each other,'' Mr. Henley said. One day there was a ''blowup,'' he said, and subsequently a search for a solution to their marital woes.
There was no separation, and after conferring with church elders and friends, they realized that ''you can't keep those feelings bottled up,'' he said.
For instance, Mr. Henley took to his job at the processing plant with a ''gotta do what I need to do to support my family'' attitude. ''I was trying to be strong, but Sarah was essentially raising our son by herself,'' he said, and that ''ate away'' at him. Ms. Henley liked her job, but ultimately wanted to teach college, and in Staunton there was an overabundance of people qualified to do that. So, they discussed these issues with each other.
''You think it's easier to keep things hidden in order to spare your spouse the harsh reality'' of the inner turmoil, Ms. Henley said. ''It's almost like trying to shelter them. But it's a spouse, not a child.''
During that period, Mr. Henley said, he learned: ''No matter what your dreams are or your partner's dreams are, talk about them. No matter what your problem or your partner's problems are. Talk about it. Find out together how to solve them.''
They know it's advice as old as the Cotswold hills.
''It's something that I constantly need to reinforce in myself, even though it's a truth that I know,'' she said.
They moved back to Long Valley, thinking there were more teaching opportunities in the Northeast. Since fall 2009 Ms. Henley has been an adjunct professor of English, theater and music at two community colleges in New Jersey and one in Pennsylvania.
Mr. Henley is now a project consultant in the South Jersey office of Sears Home Improvement, in New Brunswick. ''I'm still in construction, but I don't come home all grimy and nasty and dirty,'' he said.
''Our cleaning bills have gone way down,'' Ms. Henley said.
Although they named their son, Arden, ''after Shakespeare's mother's maiden name,'' Ms. Henley said, the halcyon days of dressing up in medieval gear and trudging through the woods re-enacting battles are on indefinite hold.
''I still do research on genealogy,'' Mr. Henley said. ''I have been doing home brewing and home vinting using recipes from Middle Ages. So, in one way we are still tied to it. I still have one case left of my last batch of beer. I suppose it's time for another.''

HEADLINE: Rentals Fly Off the Shelves

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
THE bidding wars are going on constantly in Summit and Short Hills, and other expensive suburbs. In Jersey City, units at two brand-new 50-story towers are being snapped up at the rate of more than 100 a month -- even though prices are at the top of the scale.
But it isn't the home-sale market that has had a miracle recovery, during this season of credit downgrades and job anxiety. It's the rental market -- which is experiencing nearly frenzied demand. 
At Monaco Towers, the new high-rise structures in Jersey City, ''we've been leasing at the fastest pace I've ever experienced in my entire career,'' said Carl Goldberg, the managing partner of one of the state's largest real estate firms, the Roseland Property Company.
It doesn't hurt that Roseland is offering an incentive -- two free months' rent with a 14-month lease -- yet that is apparently the company's practice with new buildings, particularly when they are as large as Monaco Towers, with a total of 540 apartments.
''Still, the rents are as high as residential rents have ever been, up to $41 per square foot for the premium units, and people are eating it up,'' Mr. Goldberg said. ''We rented 370 apartments in three months,'' from mid-May to mid-August, he said in a telephone interview.
According to the Monaco Web site, monthly rates start at $2,500 for studios, and range up to $7,500 for three-bedroom penthouses.
Such good business at the high end bodes well for projects like Palmer Square in Princeton, where a cluster of 58 ''ultraluxury'' rentals in two buildings is set to open in October and November, as part of a development of condominium town homes all priced well above $1 million. One-bedroom one-bath rentals with a den are to start at $3,750; rents will range up to $5,500 for the largest two-bedroom two-bath units, according to David Newton, the vice president of Palmer Square Management.
But, high end or low end, the rental market is ''very tight, very hot,'' said Martin D. Brady, the vice president for sales of the Marketing Directors, which markets both for-sale and rental projects. He said newer buildings in Hudson County had occupancy rates above 95 percent, most of them 96 to 98 percent.
''We rented 348 homes at 225 Grand'' in Jersey City, an Ironstate Development building, ''in under 10 months,'' Mr. Brady said. ''At the Berkshire,'' another Ironstate property, in Hoboken, ''we rented 90 homes in under four months.'' Also, he said, all 44 apartments at the URSA Development Group's 1100 Jefferson building in Hoboken were leased within three months.
The Monaco project, which was granted city tax abatements to encourage development, was originally supposed to be three towers, two of them condominiums. The condo part of the plan was abandoned two years ago, during construction; the third tower is on indefinite hold.
In sharp contrast, towns like Summit in Union County or Short Hills in Essex County, are almost entirely made up of single-family houses, and there is very little new building, so rentals are always a scarce commodity. Right now, said Susan Hughes Hunter, a broker for Lois Schneider Realtor, any time a home is available for rent, it seems to spark a bidding war.
Mary Jo Herr, a sales associate with Ms. Hunter's agency, listed a house for rent last month on Oak Hill Road in Short Hills, a three-bedroom two-bath colonial, at $4,200 a month. The owners were moving to Shanghai, but were uncertain their move would be permanent, Ms. Herr said.
''The listing was on the market for one day, and they got a full-price offer,'' she added. ''The first night, there were two other offers for more, and calls continued to come, some offering a longer-term lease.''(She said the owners opted to stay with the first bid.)
''There are lots of reasons why people are renting,'' she explained. ''Some get foreclosed on, and wouldn't get financing to buy a new home. Also, job transferees used to come here and buy, and then sell when they left in two or three years. But they don't buy anymore; in this uncertain economy, they rent.''
One of Ms. Herr's colleagues, Macy Egerton, said she had recently been making bids on rentals on behalf of clients who had not yet been able to sell their house in a town north of Summit, but had already enrolled their child in a private school in Summit for this fall.
She had scoured the listings and tried to pounce on each new one, Ms. Egerton said. ''But with every house we found, and liked, we just couldn't act quickly enough.'' After some weeks, when Ms. Egerton found an excellent rental, she decided to mount a full-scale effort.
''Another family who wanted to live in the house had agreed to pay a year's rent in advance. So my client offered to pay $50 over the monthly asking price and take a two-year lease. We won.''
Some houses in desirable towns are being offered either for sale or for rent, with owners taking whichever is the better deal presented, said Ms. Hunter, who is the vice president of the Lois Schneider agency.
Recently, her agency had clients who already live in Summit and were looking for a rental house to live in for 10 months, with their 25-pound dog, while their own house was being renovated. ''They lost out on two high-end rentals, both of which were on the market as for-sale too,'' Ms. Hunter said. ''They finally came to terms on one in Summit, for $1,000 more per month in rent than was asked.''

HEADLINE: What Kind of Innovation?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I read ''In Silicon Valley, the Night Is Still Young'' (Aug. 21) with some consternation, though not because I am concerned about another tech bubble inflating. I am concerned because bright young entrepreneurs and engineers, as well as the venture capitalists and their billions, could be spending their time, talents and money to spur innovation in areas of critical need: feeding a growing planet, finding new solutions for energy, and providing health care around the world, to name a few. 
These are challenging problems, to be sure, but they are surely not intractable to the optimists drawn to the tech industry. Angel investors perpetuating the cycle of start-ups should keep this in mind -- our future requires creative, innovative ideas in these areas far more than it needs a slate of variations on shopping or social networking sites.

HEADLINE: After Layoff, Hope, Fear And Insomnia

BYLINE: By JENNIFER GONNERMAN

 BODY:
On June 25, 2010, Frederick Deare punched out for the last time from his job driving a forklift at the Old London factory in the Bronx. That summer, everyone at the plant was being laid off: the oven operators, the assembly-line packers, the forklift drivers, the sanitation workers. Total jobs lost: 228. Old London, the snack manufacturer that invented the Cheez Doodle, was moving its operations to North Carolina. At 53, Mr. Deare, known as Freddy or Teddy Bear to his co-workers, would have to find a new job.
There was a time, not all that long ago, when the sound of factory whistles could be heard throughout the five boroughs. In the Bronx, there was Farberware, the pot manufacturer, which employed 700 people before shutting down its plant in 1996; Everlast, the boxing glove maker, which closed its operation in 2003; and Stella D'oro, the cookie-and-breadstick bakery that moved to Ohio in 2009. A. L. Bazzini Company, the peanut factory that supplies snacks to Yankee Stadium, will soon be leaving the city, too. 
A century ago, about 40 percent of New York City workers held manufacturing jobs, according to ''Working-Class New York,'' by Joshua B. Freeman. As Labor Day rolls around again, that portion has shrunk to less than 4 percent, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. And when Mr. Deare received his pink slip, he joined a growing army of the unemployed in a borough that has been hit hard by the nation's financial turmoil. The Bronx has an unemployment rate of 12 percent, the highest in the state. For African-American men like Mr. Deare, the city's unemployment rate is even more disturbing: nearly 20 percent.
If getting a job is hard enough for a white-collar worker armed with a college degree, then the challenge was even steeper for Mr. Deare, who has only a G.E.D., lost 15 years to drug addiction and did a brief stint in prison. He had reinvented himself at Old London, reporting to work day after day for a decade; by the end, he was earning $16.61 an hour with health insurance. How does someone with his background find a job in the new economy? Mr. Deare was about to find out.
In those first weeks after he was laid off, Mr. Deare found that he liked staying home -- hanging out with his fiancee, Annette Amaro; eating her cooking; zoning out in front of the television. With low rent and his three children all grown, Mr. Deare was in better financial shape than many of his former co-workers. And it helped that he had received a severance check of nearly $5,000.
As the end of summer neared, he threw himself into job-hunting. He put in applications everywhere he could think of, including Target and FedEx. He contacted his former union to see if it could help. He asked everyone he knew with a job to look out for him. The effort turned out to be an exercise in rejection. Nobody offered to hire him; they didn't even bother calling back.
To keep up his spirits, he called each morning into a 6 o'clock prayer line run by his daughter, a minister in Massachusetts. Callers shared their worries, then prayed together; some mornings, Mr. Deare revealed his job woes.
''The hardest part for him is not working, not being in the game,'' Ms. Amaro said. ''He's not a sit-around kind of guy.''
That fall, her mother came through with the best lead: somebody had told her there might be an opening at one of the meat markets at Hunts Point in the Bronx. Unsure which market needed help, Mr. Deare visited five or six. Most wouldn't even let him fill out an application -- ''Sorry, we're not hiring'' -- but he managed to leave his resume at one place. When he returned the following week, he talked his way into a job.
He started in October, working the midnight-to-8 a.m. shift. The job required spending all night in frigid temperatures, moving in and out of freezers and refrigerators, lifting 70-pound boxes. ''I'm 53 years old, and this is some strenuous work,'' he said. ''Everybody else is 23.''
When he got home in the morning, he would slide into a warm bath. The position paid $15 an hour, but if he could hold on to it for a few months, he would move up to $18 an hour, with benefits and a spot in the union.
Reese Grosett and Iraida Rivera had been two of Mr. Deare's closest friends at Old London. As of November, neither had a job, and one morning the two met up at a McDonald's near the Bronx Zoo. Ms. Rivera confessed that while she had enjoyed her first five days out of work, Day 6 was different.
''I woke up in the morning, and when I looked at what time it was and I had nothing to do, I literally cried,'' she recalled. ''I said, 'What am I going to do now?' ''
Of all the people Mr. Grosett and Ms. Rivera knew from Old London, Mr. Deare was one of the very few who had found work. He had become a source of hope to everyone else, his good fortune reminding them that even in these bleak times, it was still possible to find a decent job. But now, a month after he started work at Hunts Point, Mr. Deare's fortunes had changed.
''Did he tell you?'' Mr. Grosett asked, between sips of orange juice. ''They laid him off.''
Mr. Deare had recounted to friends what the boss told him: ''Business is very slow right now. If it picks up, I have your number.'' This conversation took place at 5 a.m., and the boss asked if Mr. Deare could stay and finish his shift. He was tempted to storm off, but considering the state of the economy, it seemed a bad idea to anger any potential employer, even one who had just let him go. So he completed the shift.
In many ways, this second layoff stung even more than the first. ''I thought I was on that track again to be a worker, and then -- boom! -- this happens,'' he said. ''It was a low blow.'' He was back where he had started: phoning friends for job leads, filling out applications, waiting for calls. But by now his severance was gone. He would have to survive on his unemployment benefits: $353 a week.
Some nights, he couldn't sleep. Other times, he woke at 4 a.m., reached for his cellphone and played video games for an hour or two, until he grew so tired that the phone fell from his hand and he was dozing once again. It was hard to say exactly what caused the insomnia -- anxiety about unpaid bills, fear of never finding another job, an internal time clock accustomed to working the night shift -- but it was a problem he shared with many of his former co-workers.
Once, he woke at 3 a.m. and groped in the dark for his phone. ''Should be sleeping,'' he wrote on his Facebook page. ''I guess there's a lot on the mind.''
Dhyalma Diaz, a friend from Old London, responded, ''Don't worry teddy we all have a lot in our minds.''
That winter, Mr. Deare jumped on every lead that came his way. A friend told him about a laundry company looking for a truck driver. The job paid $10 an hour with no benefits, but Mr. Deare reasoned that he was in no position to be picky. So he pulled on his parka, headed over to the employment agency and spent an hour in the waiting room, only to learn that the company wanted someone with experience driving a truck, not a forklift.
Mr. Deare tried for months to get hired at a school for troubled children where his cousin works, in Westchester County. Finally, he managed to land an interview for a teacher's aide position. It sounded as if the job was his, as long as he didn't fail a drug test. He urinated into a cup, passed the test, then waited for the call. One week went by. Then two weeks. Then three weeks. He left messages, but nobody phoned back.
He was not one to complain, but the strain of not having a job was starting to show. His moods swung from frustration to depression to rage. To lift his spirits, his fiancee would tell him: ''You know the kind of worker you are -- and you know you're out there putting in the applications; you're doing the footwork. It's not you. This is what the country is going through.'' She made this point often, but it was hard not to take each rejection personally.
As week after week went by with no good news, his efforts became more scattershot. In March, he applied for a job at a shoe store. He also filled out forms for positions in health care and child care. At this point, he figured, he would take just about anything. It was the attitude of a desperate man: there was a certain logic to it, but, of course, finding a job in a field where you have no experience or personal contacts can be next to impossible.
Mr. Deare had kept in touch with about 25 co-workers from Old London, and by spring none had found new jobs. Still, he was determined to beat the odds. ''Somebody is hiring somewhere, and I'm going to find that person,'' he told himself.
He had stayed in touch with his former union, Local 1102 of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. During one conversation with a contact there in late March, he heard about a job opening: forklift driver at a coffee warehouse in Yonkers.
He got an interview, and the supervisor he met with sounded optimistic about his chances of being hired. But there was no formal offer. Day after day went by. For three weeks the wait stretched on. This time, however, he got the job. And it was a union job, with benefits. He started on April 11 -- 290 days after Old London laid him off.
''You're speaking to a happy man,'' he said after his first day. ''I am in my glory. I mean, today was wonderful.''
There was only one downside: The work paid $10 an hour, 40 percent less than he had made at Old London. After taxes, his paycheck was even less than the unemployment benefits he had been collecting. But he tried not to dwell on this. ''I don't let it bother me that I'm getting less, because of the simple fact I have something, and a lot of people have nothing,'' he said. ''You have to crawl before you can walk.'' Four and a half months later, he is still on the job.

HEADLINE: Sorting Through the Mystique of the Morgan

BYLINE: By JAMIE LINCOLN KITMAN

 BODY:
FEW motor vehicles have remained as true to their heritage as those made in England by Morgan Motor Cars. The new 3-Wheeler model, which the company has promised will arrive in American showrooms at the end of this year, may be the purest expression yet. 
Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about Morgan's distinctive models:
Q. What type of license is required to drive the 3-Wheeler?
A. In most of the United States, a motorcycle license is required to operate 3-wheel vehicles. But regulations vary greatly, so check with your state's motor vehicles department.
Q. Don't Morgans have wooden frames?
A. No. Morgans have always had a steel or aluminum chassis, the structure to which the suspension and drivetrain are attached. But their bodies have been built around wooden skeletons that support metal skin panels -- just like coachbuilt cars of the 1930s.
Q. Is the 3-Wheeler fast?
A. Definitely. Try 0 to 60 m.p.h. in 4.5 seconds, making it a very quick, and very sporting, vehicle.
Q. How's the gas mileage?
A. Morgan does not yet have E.P.A. fuel economy numbers for its United States-bound cars, but the company says buyers can expect to get up to 50 miles per gallon on the highway -- roughly the mileage of the Toyota Prius.
Q. Where can I buy one?
A. Morgan has eight authorized dealers in the United States; all will provide service and factory-authorized spare parts.
Q. What other models does Morgan make?
A. The company offers a variety of models in other markets, but in the United States only the 3-Wheeler and a SuperSport Junior pedal car are currently offered new, according to dealers. A model in development, the Eva GT, which is probably two years away from production, is also intended for American roads.
These cars are currently offered in England:
4/4 The entry-level 4-wheel Morgan, with a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine of 110 horsepower and classically spartan trimmings.
PLUS 4 The classic 4/4, with four inches of additional width to keep its occupants from getting too well acquainted and a 2-liter 145-horsepower in-line 4.
ROADSTER A 226-horsepower 3-liter V-6 in a still-wider body makes for a lustier classic Morgan, with 0-to-60 acceleration in less than 5 seconds.
FOUR-SEATER Available in either 2-liter Plus 4 or V-6 Roadster specification, this one, as its name implies, has a rear bench seat for friends and family and a folding top to keep everyone dryish.
AERO SUPERSPORTS Don't let its slightly odd, stylized '30s lines fool you. This car has an aluminum chassis and a 367-horsepower BMW V-8.
SUPERSPORTS JUNIOR PEDAL CAR For the child who has everything, a car built for 9-to-13-year-olds from traditional materials in the company's sheds to commemorate Morgan's centenary. The price -- about $4,000 -- is not to scale.

HEADLINE: Before Wal-Mart, There Was A.& P.

BYLINE: By NANCY F. KOEHN

 BODY:
THIS is the story of a retailer that because of its sheer size could command volume discounts from its suppliers -- and pass along the savings to customers. In the process, many mom-and-pop stores, unable to match its prices, went out of business.
Sound familiar? But this is not the story of Wal-Mart Stores. Rather, it is the story of a company that preceded it by about a century: the A.& P. grocery chain.
In ''The Great A.&P. and the Struggle for Small Business in America'' (Hill & Wang, $27.95), Marc Levinson tells of A.& P.'s expansion and the powerful backlash it engendered in a way that draws unmistakable parallels to the retail battles of today.
The rise of mass retailing is one of the most fascinating aspects of American business history. Beginning in the 19th century, the railroad and the telegraph helped create the means for products to be sold on a much larger scale. 
Mr. Levinson, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, describes how A.& P. expertly exploited these developments. But its success contributed to a clamor of anti-chain sentiment that dogged the company for decades and culminated in a 1946 antitrust ruling against it.
''A.& P. was at the center of a bitter political struggle that lasted for nearly half a century -- a struggle that went far beyond economics,'' he writes. ''At its root were competing visions of society.''
One vision favored the rationalism of big business, with its cost-cutting and wealth-creation possibilities. The other vision ''harked back to a society of autonomous farmers, craftsmen and merchants in which personal independence was the source of individual opportunity and collective prosperity.''
Today, more than 60 years after the government ruled against A.& P.'s size and market power, we remain caught between these contrasting archetypes. We want ''everyday low prices,'' but we feel great affinity for small, local businesses and, as recent controversies about Wal-Mart opening stores in big cities attest, we are often hostile to the large enterprises that make such prices possible.
Mr. Levinson, a clean and careful writer, opens his story around 1860, when George Gilman, a tanner, opened a tea and coffee trading business in New York. He aggressively marketed his products, and his business prospered.
In 1869, Mr. Gilman founded a related business, the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, which was destined to become what the author calls ''one of the greatest agents of creative destruction in the United States.''
But Mr. Gilman did not oversee A.& P.'s transformation. In the late 1870s, he passed the reins to his colleague George H. Hartford, who, with his sons, George L. Hartford and John Hartford, continued the strategy of aggressive growth. In the early 1880s, A.& P. broadened its product line and began selling sugar, baking powder and canned goods, branding some as its unique offerings.
The next three decades were heady ones for A.& P. Buoyed by swift store expansion and the Hartfords' astute attention to cutting costs, the chain grew to more than 9,200 outlets by the mid-1920s. In a 12-month period ended in 1925, it chalked up what was then an astonishing $352 million in sales.
Other retailers, like Kroger, Grand Union and F. W. Woolworth, also grew during this period and used their size to achieve considerable cost savings. But as Mr. Levinson convincingly argues, no large retailer pursued the strategic advantages of scale as forcefully as A.& P.
By the 1920s, the company was exploiting its heft to command volume discounts and charge ever lower prices. From 1925 to 1929, food prices fell 2 percent nationally, but prices at A.& P. dropped 10 percent. Small wonder that Americans flocked to it and other chains. As they did, their shopping and eating habits changed, too, since chains put more emphasis on variety and convenience.
Many mom-and-pop stores and small wholesalers became road kill in the transformation wrought by mass retailing. These players would fight back, enlisting state and federal governments to help curtail the large retailers' power. A.& P. became a main target.
Mr. Levinson describes the various efforts of politicians and regulators to fight what many saw as A.& P.'s domination of the food supply system. At virtually every turn between about 1920 and 1950, A.& P. was confronted with another assault from anti-chain forces, including efforts to impose onerous taxes on its individual outlets and restrictions on the price advantages that it could command from manufacturers.
In the author's reasoned telling, federal and state governments intervened in the chain-store wars ''not to promote competition, but to crush it.'' The stores' opponents were not interested in promoting low retail prices for American consumers, he argues, ''but precisely the opposite: they wanted to keep prices high so that an inefficient distribution system could survive.''
He might have made his argument even stronger by noting that preserving this inefficient system was a collective response to Americans' deep fear of consolidated power, which dates back to the nation's founding and continues today.
Ultimately, the chain stores won out, powered by consumers' concern with lower prices and by aggressive public relations campaigns. Even the 1946 antitrust ruling and other government attempts in the 1940s and early 1950s to reduce A.& P.'s power ultimately had little effect on the company's sales or size.
By the early 1950s, the legal and political environment was more conducive to large retailers, and the stage was set for a new kind of retailing: mass discounting. (Kmart, Target and Wal-Mart would all be founded in 1962.)
The book ends with the story of the rapid decline of A.& P. In the wake of the Hartford brothers' deaths in the 1950s, the company they did so much to build proved unable to deal with growing supermarket competition, Americans' movement to the suburbs and the rise of shopping malls.
The pre-eminent grocery retailer, Mr. Levinson writes, ''fell victim to the creative destruction it had once dispensed.'' In 1963, Sears, Roebuck overtook A.& P. as the world's largest retailer, a position Wal-Mart holds today.
By 1980, A.& P. was operating 2,000 stores, fewer than half its number in 1960. Today, A.& P. operates about one-sixth its 1980 number of stores and under several retail banners, including A.& P., Food Emporium and Pathmark. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in late 2010.
Mr. Levinson has written an absorbing history of one company's amazing rise -- and what such success means in a nation with conflicting ideals about big business. It is more than a rich business history; it is a mirror to our own conflicting wants and visions of who and what we should be.

HEADLINE: Where Budding Magnates Experiment With Recipes

BYLINE: By TAMMY LA GORCE

 BODY:
BRIDGETON, N.J.
WHEN Innocenzo and Michele Visceglia stopped making their pasta sauce at the Rutgers Food Innovation Center here in late August, it was the end of an era -- but not the kind of era would-be food entrepreneurs might feel reluctant to bid adieu. Every Wednesday since early this year, when the Visceglias first began using the compoundlike center's equipment and space, they rose at dawn and traveled 45 minutes to get here from their home in Williamstown, near Glassboro. By 7:30 a.m., they were suited up in the center's regulation white smocks, rubber boots and hairnets. Around 3:30 or 4 p.m., they emerged, exhausted and splattered in the day's yield of 600 quarts of tomato sauce.
Still, Ms. Visceglia said, when it came time to tell the Food Innovation Center staff they had found a commercial kitchen space of their own, complete with a storefront, in Williamstown, she had mixed feelings.
''I felt bad, I really did, telling them we were moving out,'' she said. ''They helped us a lot. But I know they expected us to go eventually.'' Now that the Visceglias are able to make sauce without relying on someone to open the doors for them in the morning, she said, ''they're happy for us.'' 
If the couple's pasta sauce -- labeled Visceglia's and sold in around 250 stores, including some ShopRites -- one day becomes as well known as Ragu, the Food Innovation Center team can claim some of the credit.
Since 2008, when the 23,000-square-foot center opened, food producers like the Visceglias have been bringing their recipes here in hopes of eventually churning out batches for the masses. Dr. Schar U.S.A., a European company, started using the center to bake its gluten-free hearty white and whole-grain breads for consumers in the United States two years ago; it is currently developing two frozen bagel products at the center.
The Visceglias were on a fast track to ''graduation'' -- mostly a series of informal goodbye-and-good-lucks from the staff, Ms. Visceglia said -- because of their level of experience as food entrepreneurs. Ms. Visceglia, 47, had already been working for about five years to get the sauce into wider distribution when she signed a contract with the center; it was formulated in 1997 by her husband at a deli they once owned in Washington Township.
But the center, a program of Rutgers' New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station in New Brunswick, mostly attracts budding entrepreneurs. Margaret Brennan-Tonetta, the executive director, estimated that the center, home to more than $1 million worth of food-processing equipment, has helped start 35 products to date.
Not everyone who arrives comes armed with a big idea and a secret recipe, though. Some need ''an entire strategy to get started,'' said Dr. Brennan-Tonetta, 53, of Vineland, who holds a doctorate in public policy and is an associate vice president of economic development at Rutgers. ''And we can provide it, soup to nuts.''
The beginning of that process often takes the form of one of the four-hour Food Business Basics Workshops organized several times a year by Diane Holtaway, the center's associate director of client services. (The next workshop will be held Oct. 12.)
A session last month attracted 24 hopeful or early-stage food or beverage producers, who heard Ms. Holtaway and guest lecturers, including Clarence Fullard, assistant director of the New Jersey Small Business Development Center at Rutgers-Camden, espouse their theories about what can make or break a pioneer.
''Are you entrepreneurial?'' Ms. Holtaway asked of the class members, who were all New Jerseyans except for two from New York; all had paid $100 a person or $149 a company to register. Their ideas included artisanal condiments made from local ingredients, authentic Mexican salsa and healthful spreads for sandwiches and snacks aimed at children.
Though some of the information in the workshop applied to would-be entrepreneurs in any category, much of the day's discussion involved identifying the appeal of successful products. A case in point: FatBoy's Cookie Dough, which played a part in Ms. Holtaway's presentation.
FatBoy's founder, Joel Ansh, 48, of Franklin Lakes, started working with the Food Innovation Center in 2005, five years after it was started. At that time, the center operated out of a small office in Bridgeton. It had no production center, and its primary purpose was to provide business mentoring, training and technical help.
''I started with a plain white box with a label stuck on it,'' Mr. Ansh said in a phone interview. ''They really helped me with the packaging.'' The cookie dough, which is made for the company in a commercial center in Fair Lawn, is now sold in around 100 stores in states including New Jersey, Virginia, Massachusetts, Maine and Ohio.
The box ''speaks to consumers on an emotional level,'' Ms. Holtaway told the workshop, holding up a retro-looking 12-pack of FatBoy's chocolate chunk. She pointed out that Mr. Ansh ''puts a statement above the nutrition information: 'If you have to read below, you don't want to know.' That's meant to tell the consumer that every once in a while, you need to treat yourself. It's O.K.''
Another Food Innovation Center client, Reuben Canada, 33, of Philadelphia, was on hand at the workshop to explain the trajectory of Jin-Ja, a carbonated drink made of green tea, ginger, lemon, mint, cayenne pepper and cane sugar.
Mr. Canada brought his recipe to the center in September of 2010. Jin-Ja is currently sold in 10 stores in Philadelphia, and one in the Finger Lakes region of New York.
Before learning about the center, Mr. Canada worked in a shared kitchen and needed to improve efficiency.
''I tried doing it on a larger scale, but the flavors were compromised -- the soul was missing,'' he said. ''I don't need to make 5,000 cases a day.'' At the Food Innovation Center, he added, ''I can make 150 cases a day.''
The center ''fills a gap in the food industry between a home kitchen and a high-volume facility,'' Mr. Canada said.
Before the center agrees to work with clients, it screens them ''to make sure their product is viable,'' Dr. Brennan-Tonetta said. Once a client is accepted, the rate for mentoring, including advice on marketing and packaging, is $85 to $125 an hour. Dr. Brennan-Tonetta said that an initial round of consultations typically runs 15 to 20 hours. Those further along in the product-launch process are charged $350 to $1,000 a day for use of the center, depending on the space needed and the size of the company.
The money is well spent, Ms. Visceglia said.
''People call me all the time wanting to know: 'How do you do this? How do you start a business?' I tell them, 'You've got to call Rutgers.' ''
And just because she and her husband have graduated, she said, does not mean they won't call on the Food Innovation Center again.
One of the Visceglias' next projects is a crab sauce, ''and to do it we'll need to fill out a bunch of paperwork,'' Ms. Visceglia said. ''I'll definitely look to them for help with that.''
The Rutgers Food Innovation Center is at 450 East Broad Street, Bridgeton. For information: (856) 459-1900; foodinnovation.rutgers.edu.

HEADLINE: Emerging Markets Are Down, Not Out

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine.

 BODY:
IN a global slowdown, it's only natural for investors to focus on parts of the world where economic growth remains strong -- for instance, the rapidly expanding emerging markets.
Yet so far this year, bets on stocks in developing nations like China, India and Brazil have produced far greater losses than those in the domestic market. The Morgan Stanley Capital International Emerging Markets index has plummeted more than 10 percent, versus a 6.7 percent decline for the Standard & Poor's 500 index of domestic stocks.
So have investors thrown in the towel on the emerging markets? Not in the least. In fact, between January and July, they plowed more than $12 billion in net new money into mutual funds that focus on developing-market stocks. 
As investors stuck with this asset class, though, they also tweaked their strategies.
Throughout much of the last decade, the way to win in emerging markets was to bet on producers. For instance, industrial companies throughout the developing world experienced a huge wave of growth as manufacturing left mature economies in the West.
So investors focused on parts of the industrial sector that benefited from the manufacturing boom. They bet on energy companies that powered factories and on commodity producers that met the rising demand for the raw materials needed to supply those factories and construction.
This year, though, the market has shifted. Industrial-oriented stocks have fallen 17 percent, or about seven percentage points more than the broad emerging markets.
Consumer-oriented companies, meanwhile, many of which are catering to the fast-growing middle class in places like China, have held up remarkably well. Shares of companies in emerging markets that make nonessential, or discretionary, consumer products are up around 3 percent this year.
''An overarching theme that's occurring across the emerging markets is that the consumer base is blossoming into an income level that allows them to spend money on things beyond the necessities,'' said Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.
China, for example, is on track this year to overtake Japan in the number of vehicles it has on the road, putting it second behind the United States.
Arjun Jayaraman, a portfolio manager for emerging markets at Causeway Capital Management, said it was not surprising that some consumer companies had held up better than industrial ones.
''Let's face it: this slowdown is based in the developed world,'' Mr. Jayaraman said. While companies that make and export goods to Europe and the United States will be hurt by slowing demand in the West, he said, ''a consumer company in India or China that's more dependent on the local markets will be more insulated from the global slowdown.''
To be sure, consumer companies aren't a huge segment of the emerging markets. Combined, consumer discretionary stocks and shares of consumer staples companies -- which make essential goods like food or toothpaste -- make up just 16.5 percent of the Standard & Poor's Emerging Broad Market index.
But Alec Young, international equity strategist at S.& P. Equity Research, said that these consumer-oriented companies could serve ''as a port in the storm for investors who want exposure to the emerging markets but want to achieve it in a more conservative way.''
Investors must still be careful, though, with this group of stocks.
''Stocks that are less sensitive to the global economy and that target local consumer demand have performed better, but as a result they've gotten more expensive,'' said Jeffrey A. Urbina, co-portfolio manager of the William Blair Emerging Markets Growth fund.
The average price-to-earnings ratio for consumer discretionary stocks in the MSCI Emerging Markets index, for instance, is 13.4, based on the last 12 months of earnings. By comparison, the ratio for the broad emerging markets stands at 10.9.
As a result, many strategists say a cheaper -- and less volatile -- way to gain exposure to emerging-market consumers is through shares of large domestic and European multinational companies that generate a sizable portion of their revenue from those regions.
As examples, Simon Hallett, chief investment officer at Harding Loevner, an asset management firm, points to McDonald's, whose shares are up 19 percent this year, and Colgate-Palmolive, up 12 percent.
These stocks have performed so well in this volatile market ''not just because they're defensive stocks,'' he said. ''It also has to do with their long-term growth opportunities in emerging economies.''

HEADLINE: Refinancing While Underwater

BYLINE: By VICKIE ELMER

 BODY:
MANY whose homes have fallen in value feel stranded with underwater mortgages.
''A lot of people have been sitting and not doing anything,'' said Cari Sweet-Kostoplis, a senior mortgage banker at Atlantic Home Loans in Lincoln Park, N.J.
But they may qualify to refinance their loans through a variety of programs aimed at avoiding late or partial payments or foreclosure. 
''I don't think a lot of people are aware that they have this option,'' said Jef Kinney, the vice president for innovation and development of Fannie Mae, who oversees refinancing activity. Because interest rates remain low, he said, refinancing may bring their payment ''to a level that is sustainable to them and put money in their pockets.''
In the New York region, according to Zillow.com, some 17.1 percent of single-family homes right now are considered underwater, which means the owners owe more on the mortgage than the home is worth. (The national average of underwater properties is 28.4 percent.)
Those looking to refinance through programs offered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government buyers of home loans, will first need to find out who holds or services their mortgage so they can determine whether they qualify. On their Web sites, both agencies provide links that show whether a particular address is in their portfolio.
Be careful, though, if you own an apartment. ''Sometimes the system doesn't recognize the unit'' number, said Matt Hackett, the underwriting manager of Equity Now, a direct mortgage lender based in New York.
If your loan is owned by Fannie or Freddie, you may qualify for the Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP. Some 2.5 million to 3 million homeowners may be eligible to use HARP, according to government estimates -- provided, among other things, that they have not been late on their payments more than once in the last 12 months.
Instead of the 80 percent loan-to-home-value required in most initial mortgages today (the remaining 20 percent comes from your down payment), HARP loans offer up to 125 percent, to cover the home's shrunken value. That means a home appraised at $500,000 could warrant a loan of up to $625,000, if the owner's income was sufficient to repay it, instead of the maximum $400,000 in most conventional mortgages.
Federal Housing Administration loans also have refinancing options. One of them, the F.H.A. Short Refinance option, requires the lender to write down at least 10 percent of the remaining balance of the loan and the homeowner to be current on payments, among other requirements. Still other programs are available for people who have lost their jobs.
If your loan is held by a bank or has been bundled up and sold to an investment group, your options may be more limited. ''It is case by case,'' Mr. Hackett said. You may need to call around to locate other lenders willing to refinance underwater loans.
Lenders like Atlantic Home Loans have started offering loans with lender-paid mortgage insurance, and will refinance at 95 percent of the value, Mrs. Sweet-Kostoplis said. She added that one of her clients reduced her mortgage payment by $850 a month when the rate came down to 4.5 percent from 6.7 percent.
When you meet with your mortgage officer, Mrs. Sweet-Kostoplis advised, don't hide anything in your financial situation. ''The mortgage person is on your team'' and wants to help you stay in your home, she said. If you need help sorting out your options, HUD lists agencies and counselors whose advice is generally free.
Fannie Mae also has a broader umbrella, called Refi Plus, that can be used by people whose mortgages finance second homes and income properties. The programs have flexibility; most of them run through June 30, 2012.
''Given where rates are,'' Mr. Kinney said, ''it would be a great time to avail themselves of these.''

HEADLINE: Fearing for the Coral in Miami

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
MIAMI -- As Miami prepares to dredge its port to accommodate supersize freighters, environmentalists are making a last-ditch effort to protect threatened coral reefs and acres of sea grass that they say would be destroyed by the expansion.
The state's Department of Environmental Protection is on the verge of granting a final permit to the Army Corps of Engineers, which will be free to conduct 600 days of blasting to widen and deepen the channel for the port of Miami, across from the southern part of Miami Beach. 
''It won't fare well for us, the bay, the coral reefs, the fish stocks and the sea grass,'' said Laura Reynolds, the executive director of the Tropical Audubon Society.
''You can bring this all back to the economy,'' Ms. Reynolds said. ''People come here to fish, boat, sail, snorkel and dive and go to the beach.''
Florida has seen steep declines in coral in the last 25 years, and last year's cold snap devastated the reefs closest to shore. Some of those lost 70 percent to 75 percent of their coral, said Diego Lirman, a University of Miami scientist who was part of a team that conducted a survey of the coral last year and published its findings in August.
Environmentalists also question whether the potential harm to Biscayne Bay, with its pristine waters and sea life, is too high a price for a port expansion that may not bring the economic windfall that is expected.
Shipping consultants say the port of Miami is in fierce competition with other Eastern ports -- including Port Everglades, just an hour away in Fort Lauderdale -- to receive the superfreighters that will sail through the Panama Canal in 2014 once it has been widened. South Florida, because of its location, is not likely to become a hub compared with cities farther north, like Savannah and Charleston, experts say.
''The prospect of Miami becoming a big hub, this is not going to happen,'' said Asaf Ashar, a ports and shipping consultant. ''Miami is the end of the peninsula. It's difficult to get into it.''
But with ports around the country moving forward with dredging plans, cities do not want to be left behind. In Miami, the actual dredging is expected to begin next year.
State environmental officials said there were plans to mitigate the damage to coral, sea grass and the bay, some of which is part of a state preserve. About seven acres of coral is expected to be directly affected by the blasts, and the Army Corps of Engineers will be required to transplant much of it to a trough between two reefs.
All stony coral larger than about 4 inches will be chiseled out and moved to the trough. All soft coral greater than about 10 inches will also be transplanted. Elkhorn and staghorn coral, which are categorized as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, may be sent to a coral nursery, according to the plan.
At the same time, nearly eight acres of sea grass will be damaged during the expansion. To make up for that, the corps will seed 25 acres in a large underwater hole a bit farther north.
The state also temporarily increased the threshold of just how milky the water can get in the area of the dredging -- another concern for environmentalists -- but officials said the silt and sediment plume would largely be contained, in part by underwater curtains.
''The damage is the minimum amount necessary to do the project,'' said Mark Thomasson, the director for the water resource management division at the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, which issues the permits. ''That's the directive we were given to do this project.''
Once abundant and diverse, the coral in Florida and the Caribbean has gradually declined. Last winter, as ocean temperatures dipped into the 60s, some coral species on near-shore reefs were killed off altogether.
''One-hundred-year-old corals were wiped out within a week,'' said Mr. Lirman of the University of Miami. ''These were the jewels of the Florida reef tract.''
One particular kind of coral, the elkhorn, which helps build and stabilize reefs, has been almost wiped out over the last 25 years because of storms, disease and warming ocean temperatures, which end up bleaching coral.
A new study by two biologists found that bacteria from human fecal waste had played a major role in choking elkhorn coral. For years, human waste from the Florida Keys seeped, or in some cases poured, into the ocean via septic tanks and pipes. The sewage system is now being upgraded.
''There were a couple of acres of this coral, and now there is enough to cover your desk,'' said Ken Nedimyer, president of the nonprofit Coral Restoration Foundation in the Florida Keys, which grows and restores coral through an underwater nursery.
In the last five years, scientists and environmentalists have worked to bolster and rebuild reefs in the area. The University of Miami operates one of a network of four nurseries that are growing elkhorn and other kinds of coral to transplant to reefs along South Florida's coast. The university also runs a coral reef research facility that investigates what makes coral sick and what makes it healthy.
''We can turn a chunk into a hundred chunks in a year or two,'' Mr. Nedimyer said of elkhorn coral.
Last month, Biscayne National Park managers proposed ambitious plans to further protect the area's marine life by creating a 16-square-mile reserve that would put large tracts of reef off limits to lobster hunters and fishing enthusiasts. The plan would call for new no-motor zones for boats and areas where speed must be reduced.
For environmentalists, the concern with the corps' mitigation plans is that some coral will be missed, that the transplanted coral and sea grass may not survive and that muddied waters from the dredging and hundreds of blasts will do long-term damage to the bay.
''You will have tremendous stress to the reef system for a project that may not even have any economic justification,'' said Blanca Mesa, a volunteer for the Sierra Club Miami. ''Biscayne Bay is actually a crystal-clear bay. It's that way because we have acres and acres of sea grass beds filtering silt and sand out. It's part of the beauty. It's a shallow tropical lagoon that was never contemplated as a deep-dredge port.''

HEADLINE: Elite for a Day, in Coach, for a Fee

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
FOR an American Airlines flight to Miami last month, my husband and I and our 16-month-old daughter were treated like celebrities. We were greeted at the curb at La Guardia Airport by an American representative, her hair swept back in a practical ponytail, who checked us in and handled our baggage, and then whisked us through security, bypassing a long line of disgruntled passengers whose looks read, ''Who the heck are you?''
Then she guided us into the airline's tranquil lounge, where we sank into leather chairs and were treated to bagels, apples, coffee and orange juice. While we waited, our daughter tested out some virtually soundproof glass-fronted mini-conference rooms by screeching at us from the other side, and our personal assistant worked on getting us better seats toward the front of the plane.
''I tried to block a seat next to you for the baby,'' she said apologetically, ''but the plane is oversold.'' When it was time to board, she walked us to our gate and up to the plane with the first-class and other elite passengers. 
It was then that our taste of the good life ended and we took our seats -- in coach.
So how did we gain such special treatment? We paid for it: $200 a couple in addition to the price of our tickets for myself and my husband to receive American's V.I.P. treatment (our baby received it free of charge) through the carrier's Five Star Service program. Once reserved for celebrities and V.I.P.'s traveling between New York, Los Angeles and Miami, American began offering the service to passengers at Kennedy Airport in 2007, and expanded it to 11 airports last year. The program is being promoted through an online sweepstakes that promises to get you through the airport ''like a star (jealous glances included).''
American isn't the only airline offering V.I.P. service to coach passengers willing to pay for it. In June, JetBlue introduced Even More Speed, which offers passengers who, depending on the flight, pay $10 to $75 extra for a seat with more legroom, as well as a spot in an expedited security line at 15 airports, including Newark Liberty, San Francisco and Kennedy. And United began selling a variety of perks a couple of years ago, like door-to-door baggage delivery ($79 to $99, depending on the flight) and expedited security and preboarding (from $9). Its Premier Travel package, which starts at $47 for short flights, bundles several add-ons, including Economy Plus seating with extra legroom ($9 to $163, depending on the flight), expedited security and priority boarding (from $9), and bonus miles (from $9). And practically every airline will sell you a day pass to its airline lounge for about $50, often less if you buy it online in advance.
These pay-as-you-go perks follow a recent spate of charges for services that used to be free on many carriers -- like checked bags, exit row seats and on-board meals -- as airlines continue to look for ways to boost revenue through add-ons. But unlike fees for baggage and similar amenities, these new a la carte options come with special treatment previously unavailable to coach passengers unless they were an elite frequent flier or a movie star.
For us, the extra treatment was well worth it. We did have a 10-minute wait outside at the curb while our assistant entered our daughter's passport details for security purposes into American's computer system (which, annoyingly, does not allow parents to enter the data online or over the phone for children traveling in their parents' laps). Otherwise, we didn't wait in a single line during the entire check-in, security and boarding procedures. Although we did, of course, have to take off our shoes and walk through the metal detector at security, we were not subjected to any of the usual rigamarole of pulling out our toiletries to verify that they complied with the three-ounce rule, or having our carry-on bags rifled through.
We had plenty of time to board and settle into our seats, and avoided the usual fight for the overhead bins. Simply put: for $200 we gained the exclusive privilege of a civilized airport experience. If we had gone a la carte, and just paid for two day passes to the lounge and expedited boarding, it would have cost $80 less.
We could have paid another $200 for assistance with our connecting flight in Miami and yet another $200 for help getting through customs and baggage claim at our final destination. At $125 a person or $200 a couple, it's a pricey proposition that doesn't really make sense for a savvy single traveler who knows her way around an airport. But for families traveling on a particularly tight schedule; people worried about, say, an elderly mother traveling alone; or those who simply don't want to deal with the usual stress of getting through the airport, taking advantage of this service can be worth it for one leg of the trip.
Airlines say they are offering such services as a way to address the aggravations of flying -- particularly at the airport itself. ''It's definitely designed to improve the overall airport experience and all those points that could potentially cause stress,'' said Nancy Knipp, managing director of premium services at American. ''It could be simply finding your way through the airport if it's not familiar, especially with a tight connection.''
Airlines also point out that they carefully limit the sale of certain perks to ensure availability to frequent fliers. Controlling the number of its Premier Travel packages and other perks sold individually, said Rahsaan Johnson, a United spokesman, ''ensures elites get an elite experience.''
There are other ways in which coach travelers can gain elite amenities. Credit card issuers are offering new airline benefits for globetrotting cardholders. Just this month, Delta added priority boarding and 20 percent off in-flight food, beverages and movies to its roster of benefits offered to Gold and Platinum Delta SkyMiles American Express credit card holders who pay $95 a year. That fee had already guaranteed the first checked bag free for the card member and up to eight traveling companions. In July, Citibank introduced the American Airlines-branded Citi Executive AAdvantage World Elite MasterCard, which carries a host of travel perks, including lounge access, priority screening and boarding, and free checked bags, for a $450 annual fee. Also in July, Chase introduced the United MileagePlus Explorer Card offering two United airport club passes a year, priority boarding, the first checked bag free and other perks for a $95 annual fee.
While all this is good news for those of us in the back of the plane, ultimately, offering such perks to the masses -- albeit for a price -- threatens to dilute airlines' loyalty programs and turn off their most valuable customers. Tim Winship, an editor for SmarterTravel.com and the publisher of FrequentFlier.com, said he had seen this dynamic play out at hotel check-ins, where there are more people in the frequent-guest line than in the regular one.
''If you give everyone access to the expedited security lane, there is the potential to create the opposite of the intended effect,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Application of First Strike Policy Is Questioned

BYLINE: By ANGELA CAPUTO. 
The Chicago Reporter covers social, economic and political issues in metropolitan Chicago, with an emphasis on race and poverty. www.chicagoreporter .com. Alexis Pope contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Nothing could have prepared Jessica Moore for the morning 19 Chicago police officers rushed her front door around 8 o'clock.
According to police reports, they found $48 of marijuana in her son Devonte's room and a $12 dime bag in her boyfriend's pocket. Police arrested her boyfriend, but not her son.
Years in the Cabrini-Green public housing project had taught Ms. Moore what to expect next. A few days after the September 2009 bust, the Chicago Housing Authority notified her that her lease would be terminated.
Ms. Moore, 39, is one of hundreds of low-income residents the housing authority has taken to eviction court since 2005 for violating the agency's one-strike policy. If residents get one strike -- exactly what that means -- the C.H.A. can try to evict them. The rule is part of federal guidelines created in 1996 to make public housing safer. 
But a study of the agency's administration of one strike raises questions about how it is being applied. An analysis of C.H.A. records by The Chicago Reporter found that the vast majority of the 1,390 cases in the last six years -- 86 percent from 2010 alone -- had nothing to do with the primary leaseholder. In more than half of the cases, the defendants were found not guilty, their cases were thrown out, or they were never prosecuted in the criminal courts.
By the C.H.A.'s standard, all arrests -- leaseholders, occupants or their guests -- are subject to one strike. The Chicago police pass arrest reports involving C.H.A. tenants or property to the housing authority, which has sole discretion to send the cases to eviction court.
Scott Ammarell, a lawyer for the housing authority, said that his agency took an across-the-board approach to carrying out one-strike cases. ''If we get an arrest report and the charge on the arrest report is an offense that will end somebody's eligibility to continue to receive a subsidy from the federal government, we pursue it,'' he said.
Jadine Chou, who oversees the agency's traditional public housing properties, said: ''We really do have to take into account the whole community. We have to look at what happens to the rest of the neighbors who live around it.''
In 2000, the C.H.A. announced it would tear down buildings under its plan to transform pockets of poverty into mixed-income neighborhoods. As the plan progressed, fewer public housing units remained. Yet the rate of one-strike cases increased and more residents faced evictions for low-level crimes involving misdemeanor charges rather than felonies.
Alderman Walter Burnett, whose 27th Ward includes Cabrini, chalked up the increase in misdemeanors to the growing pressure from newer middle- and upper-class residents.
Ms. Moore's 15-story building attracted attention. ''Just look at 1230 Burling,'' Mr. Burnett said. ''Those people complained about the building every day. Why? Because they wanted the building down. Why did they want the building down? One, because they thought it was affecting their property values.''
Nationwide, anti-crime policies are being applied inconsistently in public housing. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has not given clear direction to local housing authorities. In June, Secretary Shaun Donovan reminded housing authorities that only two types of people were prohibited from public housing: methamphetamine producers and registered sex offenders. HUD empowers local agencies to tailor rules as long as it preserves residents' peace and safety.
The C.H.A. adopted its own policy, known as the innocent tenant defense, to soften Chicago's one-strike program in the mid-1990s. The agency proposed eliminating the defense in June, but backed off after an uproar from residents and advocates of low-income housing.
Tenants who successfully invoke the defense typically end up barring the person described as the ''bad actor.'' Under a judge's orders, families stay on the condition that the person barred will never return to C.H.A. property.
Roughly a third of one-strike cases end with a barring, according to records.
Gloria Franklin, of Cabrini, was forced to choose between barring her youngest son, Tyran, and losing her apartment when, at 17, he was arrested with $10 worth of marijuana. Ultimately, his charge was thrown out in court. Still, she had to bar Tyran, who then dropped out of high school and began living on the streets. At times, Ms. Franklin sees him sleeping in a playground near her house, a sight she said was ''one of the most hurtful things.''
Publicly subsidized leaseholders in new mixed-income neighborhoods are not guaranteed the innocent tenant defense. While public money has been leveraged to finance construction, the private developments are not subject to the housing authority's lease agreement.
Meanwhile, more families are facing eviction based on low-level charges. In 2005, 40 percent of one-strike arrests involved a misdemeanor. By 2010 it was 76 percent. Fewer than 10 percent of the cases were attributed to the drug dealing that one-strike was intended, in part, to address.
Even within the C.H.A., the significance of arrests is inconsistent. Arrest alone does not preclude applicants from joining the agency's housing waiting list of roughly 40,000 names.
No community has experienced more recent one-strike cases than Cabrini. Roughly one in five of the arrests of C.H.A. tenants over the past six years involved its residents. A decade ago, nearly 13,000 people lived there; today, just 444 units are reserved for public housing.
Ms. Moore had lived in her Burling Street apartment for nearly five years before the police stormed in that day. Her paychecks never covered rent in the private market for her and her six children.
In its final days, her building was the sole remaining Cabrini high-rise and police presence intensified. Facing the prospect of losing an apartment costing $72 a month, Ms. Moore fought the C.H.A. The police testified at trial about her boyfriend's possession charges. She lost. A judge gave her seven days to move.
''I'm like, where I'm gonna go with six kids?'' she asked.
On June 30, 2010, Ms. Moore was evicted. Nine months later the building was razed.
Now Ms. Moore and her family are itinerant, although she will be eligible to reapply for public housing in three years. They squeezed into a two-bedroom in West Englewood for six months until it went into foreclosure. After that, she maxed out her student loans -- taking out $8,000 -- to cover the $750 rent for a new apartment.
Three children sleep in a sunroom with garbage bags full of clothes. There is mold in the kitchen, a leaky hole in the bathroom and no washing machine. Her children catch a train and a bus to get to their schools. Her eldest daughter is going to be a senior at Lincoln Park High School this fall, and when she starts worrying about college tuition and considers downgrading her plans for community college, Ms. Moore pushes her.
''I'm like, 'No, you're going to go out of Chicago,' '' she said. ''I want her to get a good education so she can go wherever she wants to go.''

 Severity of the Charges: In 2005, most one-strike cases involved felony charges, but in recent years they have involved less serious misdemeanor charges. Of the 1,444 arrests from 2005 to 2010, 1,307 were prosecuted in criminal courts. (Source: Chicago Housing Authority, Cook County Circuit Court)

HEADLINE: Novelists Predict Future With Eerie Accuracy

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
John Schwartz is the national legal correspondent for The New York Times.
GARY SHTEYNGART sounded like he was trying hard not to crow.
Last year, he had described, in his dystopian comic novel ''Super Sad True Love Story,'' a near future world in which economic chaos followed the United States' default on its debt, and Chinese creditors scolded America for its profligate ways.
Now the story seemed to have an echo in real life. Washington's extended impasse over raising the debt ceiling was resolved with a last-minute vote, but the nearness of the miss and the subsequent credit downgrade by Standard & Poor's sent markets on a wild ride. The admonition from China's official Xinhua news agency -- ''The U.S. government has to come to terms with the painful fact that the good old days when it could just borrow its way out of messes of its own making are finally gone'' -- might as well have come from Mr. Shteyngart's laptop. 
The cultural commentator Kurt Andersen asked Mr. Shteyngart on his radio program, Studio 360, what it was like to have, to an eerie extent, anticipated the future. ''I'll turn on the news, I'll vomit from nervousness,'' he joked, ''and then I'll wipe my chin and say: 'Oh, you know? I kind of got it right.' ''
The dirty little secret of speculative fiction is that it's hard to go wrong predicting that things will get worse. But while avoiding the nihilism of novels like Cormac McCarthy's ''The Road,'' in which a father and son wander a hopeless post-apocalyptic moonscape, a number of recent books foresee futures that seem more than plausible as the nation's ambient level of weirdness rises.
Albert Brooks, the actor and director, brought out ''2030,'' in which the nation's economy is sent into a spin by seemingly good news: cancer is cured. The bad-news twist: the resulting drain on national resources by an aging population that no longer conforms to the actuarial tables and continues to consume resources at baby-boomer rates, and a rather literal twist on the notion of intergenerational warfare. ''I chose not to go too far,'' Mr. Brooks said. ''I liked having more present in my future.''
In ''Ready Player One,'' the novelist Ernest Cline extrapolates from the ripples that rising energy prices and climate change send through the economy, and gives us a future where the suburbs die off and many people are packed into in high-rise urban trailer parks, spending their days on an increasingly addictive Internet instead of facing the quotidian squalor. Readers who spend so much time issuing updates via Twitter, Facebook and Google+ that they have forgotten what their spouses look like might see themselves reflected in Mr. Cline's funhouse mirror. ''I did try to envision it as a possible future,'' Mr. Cline said. ''I don't see it as a future we're necessarily headed for.''
In an interview, Mr. Shteyngart said he credited his own interest in the future to his childhood infatuation with the TV series ''Buck Rogers in the 25th Century.'' ''I wonder if writers are basically nostalgic creatures who pine for a past that has never been,'' he said.
He says he gets messages on his Facebook page almost daily from people who see his colorfully depicted future coming to pass, from smartphone applications that might help people hook up in bars to transparent clothing (he called the jeans ''Onionskins'').
When he read about a Paris fashion model in a transparent blouse over a see-through bra (the reviewer wrote, ''you could still make out the relevant parts'') he recalled thinking, ''Oh, my God, it's happening so fast.''
After publishing his book and watching the world catch up, he thought: ''Well, I think this is the last book about the future for a while. The present outdoes anything you set out to do.''
The prediction game has generally been the bailiwick of science fiction, and many authors have shown startling foresight. Jules Verne placed his launching site for shooting men to the moon in Florida -- Tampa, not Cape Canaveral, but let's forgive that as a rounding error. And William Gibson and Bruce Sterling have mined the near future for years, in novels like Mr. Gibson's ''Pattern Recognition'' and Mr. Sterling's ''Holy Fire.''
James E. Gunn, the director of the Center for the Study of Science Fiction at the University of Kansas, said science fiction could even help encourage the future by preparing minds. Hugo Gernsback, the creator of a pioneering scientific magazine in 1926, predicted radar and night baseball, among other things; Arthur C. Clarke described satellite communications.
But, Mr. Gunn added, while science fiction may deal with the future, its true commentary is almost always on the present: ''the human condition, experiencing change.'' The basic premise, he suggested, is ''something interesting might happen, and this would change the world in interesting ways.''
To Mr. Brooks, the predictive elements of gee-whiz classic science fiction appealed not at all. ''I didn't believe in flying cars,'' he said. ''I have seen how people drive on the freeways. I watched the way my stepfather drove. He wasn't going to be flying to work.''
The point was not so much to predict the future as to present a possible one. He envisioned tremendous destruction to an American city, but chose not to portray nuclear terror, which he calls a ''healthy possibility,'' explaining, ''I'm not interested in Armageddon stories.'' Of the book, he said, ''people ask, 'is this optimistic or pessimistic?' '' Mr. Brooks, whose work is rarely sunny but shows tremendous heart, suggested that the answer should be obvious.
''Hey! We're still here! We're still functioning!''

HEADLINE: One Path to Better Jobs: More Density in Cities

BYLINE: By RYAN AVENT

 BODY:
Ryan Avent is an economics correspondent for The Economist and author of the Kindle Single ''The Gated City,'' from which this essay is adapted.
''HELL is other people,'' wrote Jean-Paul Sartre. He nonetheless spent much of his life in Paris, the better to interact with other French intellectuals. Cities have long been incubators and transmitters of ideas, and, correspondingly, engines of economic growth.
That has never made the crowds less annoying. Maybe that's why people try to tame the city by chaining it down and limiting who can build what where along its quieter streets. We lobby leaders to fight development, aiming to protect old buildings and precious views, limit crime and traffic, and maintain high-quality schools. But what makes a city a city and a not-city a not-city is the fact that a city is dense and a not-city isn't. The idea of it may chill a homeowner's heart, but the wealth supported by urban density is what gives urban homes their great value in the first place.
And when it comes to economic growth and the creation of jobs, the denser the city the better. 
How great are the benefits of density? Economists studying cities routinely find that after controlling for other variables, workers in denser places earn higher wages and are more productive. Some studies suggest that doubling density raises productivity by around 6 percent while others peg the impact at up to 28 percent. Some economists have concluded that more than half the variation in output per worker across the United States can be explained by density alone; density explains more of the productivity gap across states than education levels or industry concentrations or tax policies.
Put two workers with similar skill levels in cities of different densities and the one in the denser place will be more productive, according to two decades' worth of research from economists. The resistance to greater density slows job creation in productive places. Take, for instance, the San Francisco Bay Area, a beautiful place, blessed with outstanding climate, scenery and culture. It's also an economic juggernaut, hub of the country's tech industry and home to some of America's highest wages. In 2009, the average Silicon Valley household earned about $85,000. Despite this, over 500,000 residents of the Bay Area moved elsewhere in the 2000s. Many of them left for places like Phoenix, which attracted over 500,000 residents from other American cities, despite wages 40 percent below Silicon Valley levels.
Factors like taste and taxes account for some of the migration, but the biggest reason for the shift is housing costs. The average Phoenix home is worth about 30 percent of the price of a house in San Jose. The difference in prices is mostly due to differences in building. In every year from 1992 to 2009, Phoenix granted permits for two to three times as many new homes as did the San Francisco and San Jose metropolitan areas combined. Around the San Francisco Bay, neighborhoods dead set against change successfully squeezed the housing supply, just as OPEC limits the supply of oil when it wishes to raise its price.
The ''Not in My Backyard'' philosophy sometimes, though by no means always, supports a high quality of life. Yet the effect is to raise housing costs and make rich cities more exclusive. Real trouble occurs when the idea-generators in cities with that NIMBY approach become so protective of their pleasant streets that they turn away other idea-generators, undermining the city's economic role. And that is happening. Entrepreneurship rates in Silicon Valley were below the national average during the tech boom because firms couldn't attract enough skilled workers.
Productivity and wages are rising in these growing Sunbelt cities, but not as fast as in the denser cities that workers are leaving. The average wage per job in Phoenix rose $10,700 from 2000 to 2009, while in San Francisco the increase was $14,500. But, while wages are growing in San Francisco, they would be growing faster if the city allowed the construction of more housing. More workers would be able to take advantage of the good job opportunities in the Bay Area, and the metropolitan and national economies would function better.
DENSITY isn't a magic elixir. One can't create wealth just by crowding people together; otherwise the super-dense metropolitan areas in emerging Asian countries would be richer than American cities. Density simply facilitates interaction. Interactions translate into wealth when a population is educated and local institutions support private enterprise and entrepreneurship.
The world's richest places tend to be dense, with well-educated residents and a free-market-orientation (or tax havens or oil-rich) -- think of New York and the Bay Area, of Singapore, Hong Kong and the Netherlands. Without a stock of skilled workers and a relatively open marketplace, density's impact on growth and productivity will be limited.
What is it exactly that dense cities are doing? Consider a simple example. Suppose that within a population one person in 100 develops a taste for Vietnamese cuisine, and suppose that a Vietnamese restaurant needs a customer base of 1,000 people to operate profitably. In a city of 10,000 residents, there aren't enough people to support a Vietnamese restaurant. The only restaurants that can operate profitably are those appealing to considerably more than one in 100 people -- restaurants offering less daring fare. In a city of 10,000 people, there is little room for specialization, and less for experimentation.
A city of one million people, by contrast, can support multiple Vietnamese restaurants. Not only will this larger city enjoy a specialty cuisine unavailable in less populous places, but its ability to support multiple producers of this cuisine allows for competition, improving the price and quality.
A city with multiple Vietnamese restaurants may attract sellers of the fresh ingredients used in Vietnamese cooking, who then invest in distribution of those products in the larger city. This, in turn, attracts the sort of discerning eaters who favor authentic, high-quality Vietnamese food, reinforcing the concentration of Vietnamese eateries. The larger market facilitates competition, which again boosts quality and reduces prices. This is good for consumers. But competition also means better service from suppliers and growth in the consumer market, which is good for the restaurants. The result is a stronger, more productive and higher-quality microeconomy than in the city of 100,000, where only one Vietnamese restaurant can survive, or the town of 10,000, where there is none at all.
Density doesn't work without talent. A small market may only support restaurants producing food that caters to a broad range of tastes. These restaurants will have to hire generalists -- cooks who can produce a broad range of cuisines. Specialization and fine-tuning of one's skills aren't rewarded; too few patrons will have the specific taste for the particular cuisine to appreciate the quality. Time spent nailing down the nuances of one cuisine is time a chef isn't using to maintain a good-enough command of a broad range of dishes.
In the larger market, supporting multiple niche cuisines, the calculus is different. Because there may be multiple Vietnamese restaurants competing for patrons, mastery of that specific style is necessary to maintain an edge against the competition. This is particularly true as the concentration of Vietnamese restaurants is likely to attract devotees of the cuisine with a well-developed knowledge of and taste for it. Hence, the larger marketplace pushes for, rather than against, specialization.
Meanwhile, a worker hoping to make a living as a Vietnamese chef will have a much easier time of things in the larger city. Labor turnover may be greater -- if there's only one Vietnamese restaurant in a town, then head-chef spots may only rarely open up -- and so the odds of finding employment are higher. The larger city also provides insurance against bad fortune. If you're a Vietnamese chef working at the one Vietnamese restaurant in a town and the one Vietnamese restaurant goes bankrupt, then you're obviously in a tough economic situation. You must either take another job for which you're less qualified, which may mean a reduction in compensation, or move. In the larger city, by contrast, competing restaurants can absorb and reemploy the labor and resources of defunct competitors.
This insurance function is important. It reduces the risks associated with specialization and therefore encourages more of it. By allowing workers to focus on tasks at which they're relatively better than others, specialization helps drive economic growth. It's also an engine of innovation. As workers focus on a specific task, they may well find better ways to do it. They might better schedule their days or invent something entirely new -- software code written to expedite repeated tasks, or a machine that automates portions of a task. Of course, existing companies can be resistant to innovation. Dense cities, by acting as a source of insurance, enable workers with good ideas to take risks and start new businesses. If these workers fail, they have a good chance of finding employment elsewhere in the city. And if they succeed, the task of staffing the company is made easier by the existing pool of talent, and odds are good that customers and suppliers are close to hand, as well. Big cities provide a climate in which innovation can flourish, and in which innovators have the resources they need to exploit new ideas.
WHAT'S true for Vietnamese cooking is true of skill-intensive industries. The American economy's famous upward mobility rested in part on middle-class access to rich, entrepreneurial cities. This machinery is breaking down, however, mostly because upward mobility strikes too many residents of rich places as too messy a pursuit to accommodate. During the Industrial Revolution, for instance, millions of workers flooded into fast-growing cities. This produced slums, but it also allowed poor workers to take advantage of opportunities in new industries, a process that helped create the middle class.
Rapid urban growth would mean denser neighborhoods, which makes many Americans uncomfortable. Preventing this density, however, denies workers access to the best opportunities, constraining the mechanism that helps support a strong middle class.
We can hope that as the Phoenixes and Houstons grow and attract skilled workers, their wage levels will converge with those of the slow-growing, high-wage coastal cities. Yet that may simply encourage their residents to pull up the ladder after them as coastal residents have. Eventually, Americans will learn that if they can't harness their cities as tools of growth and mobility, they'll have to find costlier ways to address the country's lingering economic ills.

HEADLINE: A New Home for Music Shines in Reykjavik

BYLINE: By JEANINE BARONE

 BODY:
After the economic meltdown and a couple of ash-spewing volcanoes, Iceland still has plenty to be optimistic about. 
For one: Harpa, the new abstract glass and steel edifice towering over Reykjavik's old harbor. Harpa (the name refers to the Icelandic word for harp) is the just-inaugurated conference center and concert hall that is home to the Iceland Symphony Orchestra and the Icelandic Opera.
The building's luminous facade was designed by Olafur Eliasson, creator of the much-discussed ''New York City Waterfalls'' installation in 2008. The facade reflects the ever-changing Nordic light, thanks to 1,000 hexagon-shaped bricks, and connects the building to the natural world, allowing scenic vistas of the sky, sea and mountains. (Colorful LED strips allow the building to glow in Iceland's dark winter afternoons.)
''It's an exciting building, but with the important role of music in Iceland, it's also about the identity of this country,'' Mr. Eliasson said.
Harpa (en.harpa.is) is booked with events through 2015.

HEADLINE: California Dreaming

 BODY:
California is on the brink of making a wise investment in its future and delivering a powerful rebuke to poisoned immigration politics at the national level. This week, the Legislature is expected to pass the California Dream Act, a bill to allow undocumented immigrants to receive state-financed college scholarships and loans. Earlier this summer, the state gave such students access to privately financed aid. The new bill should open even more doors to college degrees for young Californians, and Gov. Jerry Brown should quickly sign it. 
Making it easier for the undocumented to afford college does not give anyone citizenship or a green card. Only the federal government can do that -- for instance, through the federal Dream Act, which has long been stalled in Congress and would give undocumented young people a path to legalization. But passing the California Dream Act would be inspiring, not just for the opportunities it would grant thousands of deserving students, but also for the message it would send.
The response to unauthorized immigration today, at the federal level and in far too many states, conflates all illegal presence with criminality, and seeks to choke off all opportunity for the undocumented regardless of circumstance. California seems ready to say otherwise -- that it makes no sense to punish young people who bear no responsibility for their unlawful status, to stifle their education and ambition at the cusp of adulthood. Having grown up in this country, these are Americans in all but name.
The California bill is expected to cost $40 million, about 1 percent of the $3.5 billion that California spends on state college aid. A leader of an anti-immigration organization told a Times reporter that the measure was ''a really stupid allocation of limited resources.''
He had it ludicrously backward. Hopeful, striving, well-educated people are a resource any country needs. Consigning tens of thousands of bright minds to an illegal existence and dead-end jobs, spending millions to purge work forces and to arrest, imprison and deport people who are contributing to the economy -- that's the flagrant waste that too many Republicans are willing to perpetuate.

HEADLINE: Local Grocery Stores Try to Find Traction in Tough Times

BYLINE: By JESSE HIRSCH. 
hirsch.jesse@gmail.com

 BODY:
Bessie Morris went into Bayview's new Fresh & Easy supermarket for the first time last Sunday. She needed to pick up just some ground turkey and sandwich cheese, but one thing led to another.
''They've got so much healthy, different stuff here, and prices were pretty good; I just couldn't stop,'' Ms. Morris said, laughing and gesturing to her cart. It is almost full, with prepared meals, salad greens, even a few exotic spices.
Ms. Morris may not know it, but she is Fresh & Easy's model customer: someone who appreciates the well-curated selection of a specialty grocer but with the discount prices of a mainstream supermarket. Since March, the company has opened 11 stores in the Bay Area, with many more in the works. Fresh & Easy is rolling the dice that Ms. Morris's shopping patterns are not unique.
The company is trying to capitalize on the cultural and economic trends that have brought huge changes to the local grocery store business over the past five years. Squeezed by expensive purveyors of organic, local and artisanal products on the high end and discounters like Costco and Wal-Mart on the low end, as well as a slow economy, traditional supermarket chains are reeling, with store closings and bankruptcies sweeping the sector. 
The venerable Bay Area chain Andronico's Community Markets, a family-owned company with seven stores in the region, filed for bankruptcy protection two weeks ago and has just announced it will sell itself to a private equity firm through its Chapter 11 filing. Its troubles follow those of Delano's IGA, which closed last fall after a failed expansion effort that included taking over troubled Cala/Bell Foods. In 2006, the supermarket giant Albertson's began closing all its San Francisco stores.
The last traditional supermarket chain to open a branch in the city was Safeway, in the South of Market district, in 2004.
By contrast, the Whole Foods supermarkets chain, with its focus on high-end natural foods, is thriving, opening its fifth San Francisco store this spring. Many of the organic and specialty food stores that compete with Whole Foods are thriving, too. And Trader Joe's, with a range of specialty groceries at discount prices, will soon take over San Francisco's last Cala Foods, on Nob Hill.
Now Fresh & Easy, owned by the British retail giant Tesco, is entering the market with its own style of grocery. The company opened its first American store in November 2007; since then, the chain has rapidly built an empire of 177 stores in Arizona, California and Nevada. It often moves into areas where other grocery stores have failed or into historically underserved ''food deserts.'' Its recent opening in Bayview, for example, was the neighborhood's first new supermarket in over 20 years.
The company has sustained heavy losses on its United States operations thus far, but it says it has big plans for San Francisco. Besides the Bayview location, Fresh & Easy opened a store in the Outer Richmond in June, and has stores planned in Portola and the Mission. Brendan Wonnacott, Fresh & Easy's communications director, said more openings were coming.
Tesco's United States strategy is based on intensive market research. The company embedded researchers with 60 American families for weeks, inspecting their refrigerators and pantries, and videotaping them cooking and shopping.
The formula that emerged was a small-form, highly automated supermarket, with a split focus on low-cost traditional grocery items and locally sourced, healthy and natural foods.
Upon its arrival in San Francisco, Fresh & Easy opened an aggressive campaign against Whole Foods, with billboards bearing slogans like ''Wholesome food, not whole paycheck.'' The store also does a price-by-price comparison with Safeway next to many of its products.
''For us, our competition is anyone selling groceries,'' Mr. Wonnacott said.
Safeway, San Francisco's market leader in terms of sales volume and number of locations, is the ultimate big-box grocery store, with an average storefront of 47,000 square feet.
But while Safeway has been struggling to find sufficient real estate (for its SoMa store it settled for 33,000 square feet), Fresh & Easy has a standardized 10,000-square-foot template that allows it to squeeze easily into cramped urban spaces.
Safeway has taken note of the compact-sized competition, but does not consider it a significant threat, said Melissa Plaisance, senior vice president of finance and investor relations.
''We realized there would need to be 25 Fresh & Easy stores opened near a Safeway to provide the same competitive impact as one traditional supermarket,'' Ms. Plaisance said.
Fresh & Easy's smaller size is a key part of its strategy to be more approachable and easier to navigate.
The new store in the Outer Richmond is in a former Albertson's supermarket. But instead of using the whole space, the company is splitting it with a CVS drugstore.
''The day of the gigantic megastore has come and gone,'' said Phil Lempert, a supermarket trends analyst. ''These big stores have far more space and selection than anyone can actually use. People are realizing it's not that important to have 100 different varieties of olive oil.''
Armando Hernandez, a customer assistant at the Bayview Fresh & Easy, compared his store to a homey, neighborhood food purveyor. ''It's a return to the old days, like when you'd go to the butcher, or the neighborhood produce guy,'' he said.
But Mr. Hernandez's enthusiasm aside, Fresh & Easy stores do not actually employ butchers, produce workers or virtually any department-specific employees besides those in the bakery. The meat, seafood, sliced cheese, and much of the produce come pre-packaged from a massive distribution center in Riverside.
There also are no cashiers; as is the case with many other chain operations, automation is the name of the game.
The Bayview Fresh & Easy has 45 employees, though most other branches employ 20 to 30. By contrast, the upscale San Francisco grocer Bi-Rite Market, with one-third of the floor space, has an in-store staff of 90; there are workers in every food department.
''There's a big percentage of people that value convenience over quality, and that's one of our biggest challenges,'' said Sam Mogannam, the owner of Bi-Rite.
Nevertheless, the store is thriving and will open another branch in NOPA next year.
''A store like mine is about shopping every day, running into your neighbors, building relationships with my workers,'' Mr. Mogannam said.
Despite Fresh & Easy's intensive market research, and bullish projections before opening, the company has struggled since its inception. Last fall, it closed 12 stores in Las Vegas and Phoenix, and one in Southern California. Mr. Wonnacott attributed the closings to the housing crisis and projected developments that never materialized.
Still, Fresh & Easy has yet to see a profitable year, declaring losses of more than $300 million for its 2010-11 fiscal year.
Despite these difficulties, the company continues to expand, it broke ground on a Sacramento store on Wednesday. The company is, however, scaling back to 50 projected openings a year, from 200, and is ''becoming more thoughtful about each new location'' Mr. Wonnacott said.
Last Sunday at the Bayview Fresh & Easy, it appeared that such thoughtfulness had paid off. In a straw poll of nearly 20 respondents, no one had a negative thing to say about the new store.

HEADLINE: Potential Awaits Its Moment

BYLINE: By JAKE MOONEY

 BODY:
DECADES have gone by, but all around Mott Haven in the South Bronx, certain physical characteristics provide an echo of the bad years in the 1960s and '70s. Of the scores of lots emptied by fires and neglect back then, some have been transformed into lush community gardens, and some have been rebuilt into tidy subsidized town houses by nonprofit developers. Others are just empty, with signs on their fences advertising developments that never materialized.
They are as good a symbol as any of the area's current state, which enthusiasts describe as challenging but filled with potential. Public housing projects, more than a dozen in all, dominate the landscape, but in between are intimate blocks populated by recent immigrants, by adventurous and relatively prosperous newcomers, and by families who have been in the area for generations.
A move to gentrify late in the last decade stalled as the larger economy did, but officials and residents of Mott Haven, which is generally considered to cover about one and a half square miles between the Harlem River and the Bruckner Expressway south of East 149th Street, say the conditions are right for another resurgence. 
Housing stock and the income levels of the neighborhood's 48,000 residents are gradually diversifying, said Cedric Loftin, the district manager of Community Board 1, which represents the area. In particular, he said, the main commercial corridor, East 138th Street, is seeing new life. Also, the city's rezoning of industrial areas on the neighborhood's western edge, near the Grand Concourse and the river, represents an effort to promote new housing and to create access to the Harlem River.
Combined with the area's ample public transportation and proximity to Manhattan, Mr. Loftin said, that is reason for optimism.
''Housing stock is up, it's not that expensive, and there are a lot of opportunities here,'' he said.
Even a few years ago, those assets were in sufficient evidence to attract Yonette Davis, a Brooklyn native who is a geriatrician. Dr. Davis bought her three-story brownstone on East 140th Street for less than $200,000 in 2001, and moved in after a renovation and the birth of her daughter in 2007.
Given the South Bronx's reputation, her family feared for her safety. The reality, once she settled in, was different. One neighbor sweeps her sidewalk when she is away at work, and there are annual events and plenty of children for her daughter to play with.
''I keep telling people, it's the first neighborhood that I've lived in that feels like a neighborhood,'' Dr. Davis said. ''The residents seem to be really close to each other.''
One reason for that closeness, she said, may be a history of shared adversity: Almost half of the area's families, according to census figures, have incomes below the poverty line. And, while crime is far less prevalent these days, Dr. Davis says late nights on area streets can feel unsettling.
Still, she said that she had not felt out of place and that the neighborhood had revealed itself to her gradually, as her bond with her neighbors grew.
Whether she will remain, though, is an open question. She works in Brooklyn, commuting 40 minutes by car, and weighs going back. She says she may not be ready to part with the house, or the area.
''It reminds me of Fort Greene years ago, before Fort Greene became this really expensive place to live,'' Dr. Davis said. ''It has that feeling of something about to happen to it.''
WHAT YOU'LL FIND
There are three small historic districts: one, on Alexander Street between East 137th and East 141st, has a row of finely detailed brownstones, two churches, a police station and a library; another, on parts of East 139th and 140th between Willis and Brook Avenues, has 19th-century brownstones; the third, on 136th near Willis, is marked by two rows of yellow-faced brick town houses.
On East 138th and to the south is a fledgling artist community, Mr. Loftin said. Adrian Thompkins, an agent at Halstead Property who has sold in the area, says the scene reminds him of the Lower East Side, when he lived there years ago.
''It's a very sort of insular community, where a lot of things may not be broadcast to the entire five boroughs,'' he said. ''But people in Mott Haven know. A lot of painters are there, a lot of photographers -- a lot of them are having exhibits out of their own homes.''
To a casual visitor, their presence may not be apparent. Though East 138th Street at times teems with people, the focus of that activity is inexpensive retail and restaurants -- some Puerto Rican, Dominican and Mexican. Elsewhere, public housing towers stand on vast blocks; street life is sparse.
Still, Mr. Thompkins said, the newcomers do have their hangouts. Gradually, businesses are opening.
''Everything from florists to pet shops,'' he added. ''There's a lot there, and I think that when the market picks back up, this is going to be one of the first places that people look to that's still a bargain.''
Kouma Kpabla, an associate broker at Re/Max Voyage Homes, sees similar improvement. ''The place is quiet now,'' Mr. Kpabla said. ''Crime is down. Nights, there's no noise.''
WHAT YOU'LL PAY
Inventory has been low recently, brokers say, as property owners seeking to ride out the slow market hold onto their buildings. Mr. Thompkins says comparable-sales data is scarce, and prices can be hard to predict.
''The prices are a little bit all over the place now,'' he said. ''A lot of the times they have to do with what a person can afford to sell for, rather than trying to establish a market value.''
That means there are bargains. ''I think if you can get a beautiful house that's in move-in condition and has an income unit, for under $500,000 or $600,000, tops, that's going to be attractive in any economy,'' Mr. Thompkins said, adding, ''That would definitely be for a premium, move-in condition home, generally three units.''
Mr. Kpabla puts the average price for a two-family house around $425,000, and Patricia Rodriguez, an associate broker at Exit Realty Success, says prices can be far lower: about $275,000 for a one-family house, $300,000 for a two-family, and $400,000 for a four-family. One- and two-family buildings predominate, she added. Many went up in the late 1980s.
Two-bedroom rentals on Craigslist tend to range from $1,300 to $1,800 a month. One-bedrooms, which vary in size and can include spacious lofts, are in the same range -- though there are smaller units, listed for $1,000 or less.
THE COMMUTE
The 6 train runs under East 138th Street, stopping at Third, Brook and Cypress Avenues, and then turns north to East 143rd and 149th Streets. The 4 and 5 stop on the Grand Concourse at East 138th and 149th Streets. The 2 has two area stops.
According to Mr. Loftin of Community Board 1, express service to Midtown takes 10 minutes or less.
Mott Haven is ringed by highways: the Major Deegan Expressway to the west and south, and the Bruckner Expressway to the east. Both connect to the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, with easy access to three other boroughs.
WHAT TO DO
Among the hangouts cited by Mr. Thompkins are Alexander's Cafe, at the foot of Alexander Avenue near a cluster of antiques stores. The Bruckner Bar and Grill, a popular spot for burgers and beers, is two blocks to the west.
Since 2002, the Bronx Council on the Arts has run a free trolley-style bus through South Bronx neighborhoods including Mott Haven, to promote arts events and organizations along the route. It runs on Wednesdays once a month, and some Saturdays; Mr. Thompkins says at least one of his real estate clients was specifically interested in buying near the trolley route.
St. Mary's Park, with 35 acres of hills, lawns and athletic facilities, lies to the northeast. Its southern end is rocky and partly wooded, like the north end of Central Park. Farther north, it has an indoor pool and a running track.
THE SCHOOLS
Public elementary schools have struggled. They include No. 154, on East 135th Street, where last year 23.2 percent of tested students met standards in English and 43.5 percent in math, and No. 43, on Brown Place, where 39.7 percent met standards in English and 53.6 percent in math.
A number of charter schools have opened in recent years, including the Bronx Charter School for Children, the Bronx Success Academy, and, for students in the child welfare and foster care system, the Mott Haven Academy.
Among middle schools is No. 203, on Morris Avenue, where 11.4 percent of tested students were proficient in English and 13.6 percent in math.
Public high schools include Samuel Gompers Career and Technical Education High School, where in March students staged a demonstration to lobby for federal ''turnaround'' financing. SAT averages last year were 370 in reading, 385 in math and 354 in writing, versus 439, 462 and 434 citywide.
THE HISTORY
The neighborhood was named for Jordan Lawrence Mott, the owner of the J. L. Mott Ironworks, established in 1828. German and Irish populations predominated a century ago; these were largely supplanted by Puerto Ricans by midcentury. Many of today's residents are from Mexico or the Dominican Republic.

HEADLINE: Back to the Gym

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. GIARDINA. 
As told to Elizabeth Olson.

 BODY:
I WAS born in Queens. When I was a teenager, my parents moved to Florida because my father was tired of his commute to Manhattan, where he worked as a property loss adjuster.
We settled in New Port Richey, on the west coast of the state, and my father and uncle opened a delicatessen. My first job, at 14, was as a counter boy, serving customers. Three years later, my parents decided to sell the business so that my father could have more family time. He then went to work for the Postal Service as a letter carrier.
My dad lifted weights, and that gave me an interest in fitness. I was hired as a lifeguard at a local health club but was also responsible for maintenance and cleaning. I worked there after school on the days reserved for men: Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The alternate weekdays were designated for women. 
When I graduated from high school in 1975, I went to St. Joseph's College in Indiana on a football scholarship, but I sustained a serious injury in the first season and returned home to recuperate. Several months later, I enrolled at a community college and returned to my job at the local health club.
In 1979, I married my high school sweetheart, April, and we moved to Panama City, Fla., where I had been hired to build a new health club. But the area was not for us, so we returned to New Port Richey. That same year, 1981, we decided to move to New York, staying with family in Brooklyn while we looked for work. I got a job selling memberships for Town Squash, which rented squash courts in three clubs in New York and one in Washington. It was a low-paying position, but it got me back into the work force.
It was difficult to make the squash game business thrive, so we started converting squash courts into fitness facilities. That helped to increase membership, and in 1983 we started to acquire other clubs. By 1995, we had expanded to 28 clubs in New York and three other cities.
In the meantime, my wife and I moved to Edison, N.J., and our daughters, Allison and Jennifer, were born. We love to hike, swim and bike together. My youngest daughter is at Rutgers, and the oldest, who graduated from Rutgers, is studying to become a personal trainer and Pilates instructor, but we never pushed either of them into this field.
I moved up to chief operating officer in 1992, after holding nearly every company position and in 2002 became C.E.O. We expanded to 150 clubs -- with 500,000 members -- and went public in 2006. By that time, we were named Town Sports International, the umbrella group for New York Sports Clubs, Boston Sports Clubs, Philadelphia Sports Clubs and Washington Sports Clubs.
At the end of 2007, I was having some health problems and decided to leave the company. Two years later, I decided to get back in the work force and took a job at JTL Enterprises, a medical and surgical instrument company in Clearwater, Fla., which also allowed me to be near my father.
In March 2010, I was contacted by the Town Sports board. The company had been struggling because memberships were declining in the bad economy, and the board asked me to come back and help to turn it around.
Even though I oversee the largest number of health clubs in the Northeast, I find it hard to find workout time, just as everyone else does. So I have a piece of exercise equipment in my office -- right now, it's an Arc Trainer, which combines running, climbing and hiking -- and I slip in a workout each day. Every three months, I change the equipment, so I can try out the newest machine on the market before it goes into any of our clubs.

HEADLINE: A Brand Keeps Its Cool (And Endures)

BYLINE: By NICOLE LaPORTE. 
E-mail: proto@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Los Angeles
SEVERAL years ago, when Pinkberry and Red Mango -- sleek frozen-yogurt chains featuring the latest in designer flavors -- became all the rage, you might have thought that a strictly old-school fro-yo shop called the Bigg Chill would fold under the competitive pressure.
The Bigg Chill hasn't changed much since it opened in 1990 in a nondescript strip mall in the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. Its color scheme is still pink-on-aqua, like a Jane Fonda leotard. There is no dance track on the sound system. And the yogurt flavors veer toward variations of chocolate and vanilla, not green tea or pomegranate. 
And yet, even as the designer yogurt craze may be cooling in this city -- and even as a new trend, toward self-serve yogurt, arises -- business at the Bigg Chill is booming. On any given night of the week, a line forms out the door, sometimes 20 people long.
Cary Russell, co-owner of the shop with her mother, Diane Dinow, says the Bigg Chill averages 1,000 customers a day. On weekends, that number rises to 1,300, with cars angling for spaces in the tiny parking lot outside, and a line of customers craning their necks to see the day's flavors posted on the whiteboard above the counter.
These numbers are particularly impressive, given how many fads have blazed through this health food capital. Through it all, Ms. Russell has not only survived, but thrived, and her success raised this question: Can it be that sometimes anti-innovation, as it were, is the most innovative route of all?
First, I will say that in my humble opinion, the yogurt at the Bigg Chill, while very good, is hardly the most extraordinary I've ever tasted. Yet on a recent Saturday evening, the Bigg Chill was humming with people of all ages.
What had brought them there?
Casey Rea, 19, a Kappa Alpha Theta sorority sister at the University of Southern California, drove a half-hour from her school's downtown campus for an order of peanut butter and fudge brownie swirl. ''I've been craving it all week,'' she said. ''We're in rush right now, and whenever I crave something sweet, I always come here.''
Typically, when we think of good examples of branding, we think of companies like Apple, with its ever-changing products and relentlessly inventive marketing campaigns. But good branding can also be much simpler, boiling down to consistency of quality and, in some cases, just plain consistency.
Based on an informal poll, most Bigg Chill customers are aware that the store has been around ''forever,'' as one woman put it, and most proudly volunteer that they have been regulars for years.
This history has been unintentionally reinforced by Ms. Russell, who refuses to update the store's decor, not out of any desire to be fashionably retro, but because remodeling would mean that ''we'd have to close, and there's no way I would close.''
As a result, the Bigg Chill has a very strong sense of ''authenticity,'' an all-important ingredient in forming consumer connections, and a far more lasting one than the ''unique and pleasing sensory environment'' of a Pinkberry, according to C. W. Park, a marketing professor at the Marshall School of Business at U.S.C. and editor of the Journal of Consumer Psychology.
''The feeling of authenticity provides a company with trust and credibility, and other warm, emotional feelings that go with trust and credibility,'' he said. ''And that is a very powerful tool.''
That feeling is particularly potent during tough economic times, when people crave a connection to ''those good old days,'' Mr. Park said. Indeed, two customers likened the Bigg Chill to an old-time ice-cream parlor.
But, as Mr. Park clarified, it's possible to stay the same and be out of touch. The Bigg Chill has avoided that, he said, by subtly adapting to trends while maintaining the store's core identity.
Hence, when the Pinkberry craze hit in 2006, and briefly took a 30 percent bite out of the Bigg Chill's business, Ms. Russell spent six months coming up with a recipe for Chill Berry, a tart yogurt, and then heavily promoting it.
''We had our windows painted, saying, basically, 'Why have the other berry when you can have the Chill Berry?' We came out fighting.''
CONCESSION without compromise is the key to another enduring brand: L.L. Bean, the outdoor clothing company.
In his new book, ''L.L. Bean: The Man and His Company,'' James L. Witherell explains that one reason the company has been such a consistent success since it opened in 1912 is that ''the products stayed the same.''
This is most true of the company's popular ''Bean Boot,'' a style that is still available in almost the same form as it was a century ago -- at least to a customer's eye.
''About 10 years ago, they completed redesigned, modernized and updated the boot,'' Mr. Witherell said by telephone from Lewiston, Me. ''The material is now better, it's more comfortable, it lasts longer. But what was important to them was that it look exactly the same as it always has.
''It's like the old, original VW Beetle. It changes so gradually that it appears to stay the same,'' Mr. Witherell said, quoting Leon Gorman, the L.L. Bean chairman.
And so it is with the Bigg Chill, where, even though Irish mint, lemon cheesecake and red velvet are now among the flavors, people like Marilyn Lee Schneider -- an 11-year regular -- still come in on a Saturday night and order a small cup of classic vanilla.

WOUNDED IRAQI SOLDIERS
FACE A FRESH CONFLICT
It is hard to say which is a worse indignity to the thousands of Iraqi soldiers and police officers who have suffered crippling injuries fighting alongside the Americans: receiving subpar medical care from the government they fought to preserve, or a new law that could slash their paltry benefits. Page 6
NEW EUROPE CONSERVATISM
Bulgaria and its neighbor Romania, after developing a high-tech border operation, are hoping to join the European Union's visa-free travel zone, along with guarding some of the union's outer borders. A few years ago, such a move would probably have been routine, experts say. But now, there is a new conservatism at work in the bloc, and concerns about corruption. Page 6 
NORTH KOREA EYES TOURISM
Once touted as an experiment in reconciliation, a verdant, granite-strewn tourist park on the southeast coast of North Korea has become as much a symbol of the rising tensions between the two Koreas as the demilitarized zone that it abuts. Tourism has suffered since a South Korean visitor was shot dead in 2008 by a North Korean soldier while wandering one night into what North Korean officials said was a military zone. Now, the North Korean government is trying to attract foreign visitors to the region. Page 10
AFGHAN PARLIAMENT INDUCTED
The speaker of Afghanistan's Parliament swore in eight of nine new members as hundreds of police officers armed with riot gear and machine guns blocked the entrance to the building to keep out members who had been replaced by the commission's ruling. The ceremony was witnessed by only a few dozen Parliament members, though dozens more stood outside in solidarity with the ousted members. Page 12

TO PROTECT REEF, ACTIVISTS
TRY TO BLOCK BLASTING PERMIT
As Miami prepares to dredge its port to accommodate supersize freighters, environmentalists are making a last-ditch effort to protect the coral reefs and acres of sea grass that they say would be destroyed by the expansion. A permit is on the verge of being granted to the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct 600 days of blasting to widen and deepen the channel. Page 13
KAROAKE AND PANHANDLING
The weekly karaoke contest at Bar 107 epitomizes the evolution of downtown Los Angeles from slum to hip urban enclave. There is the self-conscious kitsch, the skinny jeans and the '80s tunes. But in a blend of karoake and panhandling, one off-and-on resident of the city's streets solicits donations before he begins to sing. Page 13
ENVIRONMENTALISTS' OPTIONS
Political analysts watching the Obama administration's pullback from the environmental agenda this past month say that in the current climate there is little chance that environmentalists or their allies will ever side with the Republicans.

NEW YORK'S BIG BREAK
IN SURFING COMPETITION
Quiksilver's decision to stage a world tour surfing contest in the waters of New York has become an incongruous stop on an annual odyssey that otherwise includes breaks of world renown along the Gold Coast of Australia, at Teahupoo in Tahiti and at the Banzai Pipeline in Hawaii. Set to take place during a nearly two-week window, the contest is a major coming-out for the New York surf scene. Page 1
THE EFFECTS OF THE LOCKOUT
The N.F.L. lockout, which barred players from even talking to coaches, upended the regimented routine on which the league thrives and caused a shift in the competitive balance. Because the lockout cut into preparation time, it may be more difficult for teams with new coaches or quarterbacks to turn from pretender to contender. Page 1
END TO N.F.L. PRESEASON
The third N.F.L. preseason game is often called a dress rehearsal for the regular season. The N.F.L. knows better than to shine the footlights on the final exhibition games, in which starters parade on the sidelines in baseball caps and coaches keep the real playbooks locked away. But now it is over, sparing fans and announcers the pain of scrub football. The Fifth Down. Page 11

HEADLINE: Wounded Iraqi Veterans Face a New Battle

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO and YASIR GHAZI; Duraid Adnan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- It is hard to say which is a worse indignity to the thousands of Iraqi soldiers and police officers who have suffered crippling injuries fighting alongside the Americans in a war that continues today: receiving subpar medical care from the government they fought to preserve, or a new law that could slash their already paltry benefits.
''We are defending the Iraqi people,'' said Ali Mohammad Heaal, who was a police trainee when he lost his left arm in a car bomb attack in 2005 and now works at a nongovernmental organization that advocates on behalf of wounded members of Iraq's security forces. ''Right now, we feel humiliated.'' 
Mr. Heaal's organization, the Lanterns of Mercy, is trying to overturn the new law, passed in July by Parliament, that raises the salaries of active-duty soldiers and police officers but reduces government payments to those who have been wounded, including those who have lost limbs and have been unable to obtain prosthetics to enable them to work again. The law could be put into effect as soon as this month.
His efforts appear to be paying dividends, as some members of Parliament now say they never intended to reduce compensation for war veterans and plan to consider amending the legislation. Even in Iraq, it seems, politicians are finding that there are risks to laws that appear to abandon veterans.
''We are studying it,'' said Abbas al-Bayati, a lawmaker and a member of the security committee. ''If we find there are problems, we are ready to modify it in a way that keeps the level of compensation for their sacrifices.''
As it is written now, the law would also reduce lump-sum payments to those who were severely wounded and rescind a provision from a previous law that awarded land to victims -- even though many have not received any property.
Mr. Bayati said that the intention of the law was to raise salaries for active-duty soldiers and police officers, and that he was unaware of the provisions that reduced compensation for veterans. ''This is an unintentional mistake, and we will address it through amendment as soon as possible,'' he said.
Another lawmaker, Najiha Abdulamir, a member of a parliamentary commission for wounded veterans, said that if Parliament did not change the law, then veterans should ''demonstrate and demand their rights.''
The controversy comes as the American military prepares to withdraw, leaving the fighting to Iraq's soldiers and police officers, who continue to take casualties from insurgent attacks almost daily, and who face those dangers without the comfort of knowing that their country will care for them and honor their sacrifices if they are hurt.
The new law that will reduce veterans' benefits has Iraq's wounded feeling dishonored and ignored. Many recall Saddam Hussein's time, when those who sacrificed to preserve a dictator's power were rewarded with land and money. ''If you compare now to the previous regime, it would have been better,'' Mr. Heaal said. ''And they call this a democracy.''
Many joined Iraq's new army after it was reconstituted in 2005 for a mix of motives, economic and patriotic.
''There were no opportunities for work in 2003,'' said Ali Jasim, 39, who fought alongside American soldiers and Marines before losing a leg in 2005 when he was struck by a roadside bomb while securing polling sites for a national referendum that year on Iraq's new constitution. ''I also felt I needed to protect my country.''
He and his sister, and their children, are squatters in a ramshackle and boxlike home constructed of concrete blocks in a poor Shiite neighborhood that is a maze of dirt alleys.
On a recent afternoon, Mr. Jasim was spending his day as he always does: lying on the floor, his head propped up on a pillow, sweltering from the lack of air-conditioning and surrounded by his children. Like many men in his position, he is experiencing a severe economic hardship that, with the passage of the new law, could get worse.
After his injury, Mr. Jasim continued to receive his full pay -- which had included a combat bonus and allowances for food -- of $700 a month. It was then reduced to $450 when the government stopped paying the extra danger pay. Under the new law, he said, his pay will fall to $200.
Mr. Heaal, the former police trainee, was forced to sell his house to pay for medical treatment after being wounded. He receives $530 a month, and he could see his compensation fall to under $200 a month.
The law has added a new layer of resentment toward politicians who operate in a sphere of corruption and favoritism, and who are widely seen as out of touch with most of the Iraqi people.
''I joined the police to protect my country in a time when you were afraid of going outside the Green Zone,'' said Falah Hassan Abed, who was displaced from his home because he could not work after losing his right leg in 2005, directing his rage at lawmakers. ''I was face to face with the ruthless killers, the terrorists. In return, I just want to live in dignity, me and my family, and not be forced to beg to feed my family. I want to feel that there is someone who is grateful for what I did and what I lost.''
In some ways the thousands of casualties among Iraq's army and police are the forgotten victims of the war, overshadowed in many accounts of the conflict's toll by the numbers of American troops and Iraqi civilians who have been killed or wounded. Those numbers are familiar and easily referenced: close to 5,000 American military personnel killed, and nearly 100,000 Iraqi civilians killed, according to some accounts. Among Iraq's security forces, more than 10,000 have been killed, according to the Iraq Index compiled by the Brookings Institution, and while there is no precise estimate for the number wounded, that figure is certainly in the tens of thousands.
A further grievance for these soldiers and police officers is the knowledge that the American soldiers and Marines who fought with them returned home to a country that may not have supported the war, but supported them. They have glimpsed television images of American presidents visiting the wounded in military hospitals.
''Here in Iraq, we don't have any officials visiting us,'' Mr. Heaal said. ''And now they are punishing us with this new law.''

HEADLINE: The Limping Middle Class

BYLINE: By ROBERT B. REICH

 BODY:
Robert B. Reich is the former secretary of labor, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of ''Aftershock: The Next Economy and America's Future.''
THE 5 percent of Americans with the highest incomes now account for 37 percent of all consumer purchases, according to the latest research from Moody's Analytics. That should come as no surprise. Our society has become more and more unequal.
When so much income goes to the top, the middle class doesn't have enough purchasing power to keep the economy going without sinking ever more deeply into debt -- which, as we've seen, ends badly. An economy so dependent on the spending of a few is also prone to great booms and busts. The rich splurge and speculate when their savings are doing well. But when the values of their assets tumble, they pull back. That can lead to wild gyrations. Sound familiar?
The economy won't really bounce back until America's surge toward inequality is reversed. Even if by some miracle President Obama gets support for a second big stimulus while Ben S. Bernanke's Fed keeps interest rates near zero, neither will do the trick without a middle class capable of spending. Pump-priming works only when a well contains enough water. 
Look back over the last hundred years and you'll see the pattern. During periods when the very rich took home a much smaller proportion of total income -- as in the Great Prosperity between 1947 and 1977 -- the nation as a whole grew faster and median wages surged. We created a virtuous cycle in which an ever growing middle class had the ability to consume more goods and services, which created more and better jobs, thereby stoking demand. The rising tide did in fact lift all boats.
During periods when the very rich took home a larger proportion -- as between 1918 and 1933, and in the Great Regression from 1981 to the present day -- growth slowed, median wages stagnated and we suffered giant downturns. It's no mere coincidence that over the last century the top earners' share of the nation's total income peaked in 1928 and 2007 -- the two years just preceding the biggest downturns.
Starting in the late 1970s, the middle class began to weaken. Although productivity continued to grow and the economy continued to expand, wages began flattening in the 1970s because new technologies -- container ships, satellite communications, eventually computers and the Internet -- started to undermine any American job that could be automated or done more cheaply abroad. The same technologies bestowed ever larger rewards on people who could use them to innovate and solve problems. Some were product entrepreneurs; a growing number were financial entrepreneurs. The pay of graduates of prestigious colleges and M.B.A. programs -- the ''talent'' who reached the pinnacles of power in executive suites and on Wall Street -- soared.
The middle class nonetheless continued to spend, at first enabled by the flow of women into the work force. (In the 1960s only 12 percent of married women with young children were working for pay; by the late 1990s, 55 percent were.) When that way of life stopped generating enough income, Americans went deeper into debt. From the late 1990s to 2007, the typical household debt grew by a third. As long as housing values continued to rise it seemed a painless way to get additional money.
Eventually, of course, the bubble burst. That ended the middle class's remarkable ability to keep spending in the face of near stagnant wages. The puzzle is why so little has been done in the last 40 years to help deal with the subversion of the economic power of the middle class. With the continued gains from economic growth, the nation could have enabled more people to become problem solvers and innovators -- through early childhood education, better public schools, expanded access to higher education and more efficient public transportation.
We might have enlarged safety nets -- by having unemployment insurance cover part-time work, by giving transition assistance to move to new jobs in new locations, by creating insurance for communities that lost a major employer. And we could have made Medicare available to anyone.
Big companies could have been required to pay severance to American workers they let go and train them for new jobs. The minimum wage could have been pegged at half the median wage, and we could have insisted that the foreign nations we trade with do the same, so that all citizens could share in gains from trade.
We could have raised taxes on the rich and cut them for poorer Americans.
But starting in the late 1970s, and with increasing fervor over the next three decades, government did just the opposite. It deregulated and privatized. It cut spending on infrastructure as a percentage of the national economy and shifted more of the costs of public higher education to families. It shredded safety nets. (Only 27 percent of the unemployed are covered by unemployment insurance.) And it allowed companies to bust unions and threaten employees who tried to organize. Fewer than 8 percent of private-sector workers are unionized.
More generally, it stood by as big American companies became global companies with no more loyalty to the United States than a GPS satellite. Meanwhile, the top income tax rate was halved to 35 percent and many of the nation's richest were allowed to treat their income as capital gains subject to no more than 15 percent tax. Inheritance taxes that affected only the topmost 1.5 percent of earners were sliced. Yet at the same time sales and payroll taxes -- both taking a bigger chunk out of modest paychecks -- were increased.
Most telling of all, Washington deregulated Wall Street while insuring it against major losses. In so doing, it allowed finance -- which until then had been the servant of American industry -- to become its master, demanding short-term profits over long-term growth and raking in an ever larger portion of the nation's profits. By 2007, financial companies accounted for over 40 percent of American corporate profits and almost as great a percentage of pay, up from 10 percent during the Great Prosperity.
Some say the regressive lurch occurred because Americans lost confidence in government. But this argument has cause and effect backward. The tax revolts that thundered across America starting in the late 1970s were not so much ideological revolts against government -- Americans still wanted all the government services they had before, and then some -- as against paying more taxes on incomes that had stagnated. Inevitably, government services deteriorated and government deficits exploded, confirming the public's growing cynicism about government's doing anything right.
Some say we couldn't have reversed the consequences of globalization and technological change. Yet the experiences of other nations, like Germany, suggest otherwise. Germany has grown faster than the United States for the last 15 years, and the gains have been more widely spread. While Americans' average hourly pay has risen only 6 percent since 1985, adjusted for inflation, German workers' pay has risen almost 30 percent. At the same time, the top 1 percent of German households now take home about 11 percent of all income -- about the same as in 1970. And although in the last months Germany has been hit by the debt crisis of its neighbors, its unemployment is still below where it was when the financial crisis started in 2007.
How has Germany done it? Mainly by focusing like a laser on education (German math scores continue to extend their lead over American), and by maintaining strong labor unions.
THE real reason for America's Great Regression was political. As income and wealth became more concentrated in fewer hands, American politics reverted to what Marriner S. Eccles, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, described in the 1920s, when people ''with great economic power had an undue influence in making the rules of the economic game.'' With hefty campaign contributions and platoons of lobbyists and public relations spinners, America's executive class has gained lower tax rates while resisting reforms that would spread the gains from growth.
Yet the rich are now being bitten by their own success. Those at the top would be better off with a smaller share of a rapidly growing economy than a large share of one that's almost dead in the water.
The economy cannot possibly get out of its current doldrums without a strategy to revive the purchasing power of America's vast middle class. The spending of the richest 5 percent alone will not lead to a virtuous cycle of more jobs and higher living standards. Nor can we rely on exports to fill the gap. It is impossible for every large economy, including the United States, to become a net exporter.
Reviving the middle class requires that we reverse the nation's decades-long trend toward widening inequality. This is possible notwithstanding the political power of the executive class. So many people are now being hit by job losses, sagging incomes and declining home values that Americans could be mobilized.
Moreover, an economy is not a zero-sum game. Even the executive class has an enlightened self-interest in reversing the trend; just as a rising tide lifts all boats, the ebbing tide is now threatening to beach many of the yachts. The question is whether, and when, we will summon the political will. We have summoned it before in even bleaker times.
As the historian James Truslow Adams defined the American Dream when he coined the term at the depths of the Great Depression, what we seek is ''a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone.''
That dream is still within our grasp.

HEADLINE: The Beauty Contest That's Shaking Wall St.

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale.

 BODY:
THE extraordinary surge of stock market volatility during the last month can't be explained by conventional means. Yes, hundreds of scholarly papers have tried to predict the size of such swings, and whole markets -- like those for futures and options -- thrive on these movements. Yet we still don't have a clear, mathematical understanding of volatility's source.
Last month, market watchers might have thought they were witnessing a gamma ray burst from outer space, with waves of sudden, crazy noise: On Thursday, Aug. 4, the market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, fell by almost 5 percent. The next day was quiet, but the following Monday, the index dropped almost 7 percent. In successive days, it rose 4.7 percent, fell 4.4 percent and rose 4.3 percent. Bigger-than normal changes have persisted since, though they haven't been quite as drastic. 
Let's put this into context. Since 1928, the daily change in the market has usually been no more than half of a percent. The kind of volatility we have just seen comes along only every five years or so, though there was an even more extreme episode at the peak of the financial crisis of 2008.
To be sure, at least some of the latest volatility has been linked to news events. Much of it came after S.& P., unsatisfied with the last-minute budget deal in Congress, downgraded the nation's long-term debt after the close of the market on Friday, Aug. 5. In effect, this unprecedented move connected the United States to the debt crisis already under way in relatively small European countries. Four days later, in a significant commitment, the Federal Reserve promised to keep short-term interest rates near zero for two more years.
It's tempting to think that the market has been responding rationally to these developments. But that isn't an adequate answer. Why did investors react so strongly to the rating change, which, after all, was merely the opinion of a few analysts on a committee? And why did the market swing so much day to day, even when there was no significant news?
John Maynard Keynes supplied the answer in 1936, in ''The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money,'' by comparing the stock market to a beauty contest. He described a newspaper contest in which 100 photographs of faces were displayed. Readers were asked to choose the six prettiest. The winner would be the reader whose list of six came closest to the most popular of the combined lists of all readers.
The best strategy, Keynes noted, isn't to pick the faces that are your personal favorites. It is to select those that you think others will think prettiest. Better yet, he said, move to the ''third degree'' and pick the faces you think that others think that still others think are prettiest. Similarly in speculative markets, he said, you win not by picking the soundest investment, but by picking the investment that others, who are playing the same game, will soon bid up higher. Keynes didn't say where and when he saw this beauty contest. The New York Times ran one very much like it in 1913. It was called the ''Girl of To-Day Contest,'' and readers were asked to submit a photograph of a young woman that they deemed ''most typical of the American girl.'' A panel of artists was asked to select a winner from these pictures.
The Times reported the ''dismay'' of the panel at the difficulty of its job. Snippets of the conversation were recorded: ''We are not here to select the prettiest girl of the lot,'' one judge said. ''Here's a face women would like,'' said another. ''They would not consider her dangerous.''
We see such dismay among stock market investors today. People are trying to guess whether other investors are thinking that yet others are thinking that the stock market is ''dangerous,'' or whether it is instead a great time to invest. And investors are making that decision with little more information than the ''Girl of To-Day'' judges had.
When you hear a conversation among professional investors -- including those who manage money for big institutions like university endowments and pension funds -- it often sounds as if they are engaged in just this kind of guesswork. You wonder how many people are actually basing their decisions on what is taught in business school: calculating an optimal portfolio based on a rational statistical analysis of fundamental economic data. If you believe in efficient markets, you have to conclude that some other investors are doing those calculations today, because they don't seem the main activity of the people I'm hearing.
In fact, the best explanation for the market's back-and-forth swings is that each day we are conducting a Keynesian beauty contest, and reassessing what others think that still others are thinking. On days without much news, the market is simply reacting to itself. And because anxiety is running high, investors make quick, sometimes impulsive, responses to relatively minor events.
Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, typified the concerns about other investors on ''Meet the Press'' on Aug. 7, the Sunday before the market's big drop of almost 7 percent. ''What I think the S.& P. thing did was to hit a nerve that there's something basically bad going on, and it's hit the self-esteem of the United States, the psyche,'' he said. ''And it's having a much profounder effect than I conceived could happen.'' He was talking about what other investors were thinking, not about the substance of the S.& P. downgrade.
Over that weekend, there was widespread speculation that the downgrade would push interest rates way up. But on Aug. 8, even before the Fed issued its statement, 10-year Treasury yields began to drop, not rise, and many people started to reassess what other people were thinking -- and what other people were thinking about other people, and so on.
This process creates uncertainty not only for the stock market, but also for the overall economy. The only thing to fear is fear itself, Franklin D. Roosevelt said of the Great Depression, and he was right. We are constantly trying to reassess the fear of others, and others' fear that others are also afraid.
This may sound like a crazy game, but if others are playing it, we must, too. The outlook for the economy depends on how this convoluted beauty contest plays out.

HEADLINE: Libya's Dark Lesson for NATO

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
Steven Erlanger is the Paris bureau chief of The New York Times.
PARIS
THE war in Libya may be one of those quietly telling moments in the history of more important nations. For the first time, the United States has taken a secondary role -- ''leading from behind,'' if ''leading'' is even the right word -- in a war prosecuted by the NATO alliance and driven by Britain and France, the two strongest military powers in Europe. 
But oh what a war! More than six budget-busting months against one of the weakest militaries in the world, with shortages of planes, weapons and ammunition that were patched over by the pretense that NATO was acting simply to ''protect civilians,'' when it was clear to everyone that the alliance was intervening on one side of a civil war. All resemblances to the Kosovo war, of course, are a priori inadmissible. That was the war -- 78 days of bombing Serbia and thousands dead before Slobodan Milosevic finally capitulated -- when NATO said: ''Such a success, never again!'' Yet here we are -- with the ''responsibility to protect'' the new mantra, replacing Kosovo's ''humanitarian intervention.'' Both are debatable, given the failure to intervene in the separatist Russian republic of Chechnya then and Syria, Bahrain or Yemen now.
Libya has been a war in which some of the Atlantic alliance's mightiest members did not participate, or did not participate with combat aircraft, like Spain and Turkey. It has been a war where the Danes and Norwegians did an extraordinary number of the combat sorties, given their size. Their planes and pilots became exhausted, as the French finally pulled back their sole nuclear-powered aircraft carrier for overdue repairs and Italy withdrew its aircraft carrier to save money.
Only eight of the 28 allies engaged in combat, and most ran out of ammunition, having to buy, at cost, ammunition stockpiled by the United States. Germany refused to take part, even in setting up a no-fly zone.
Although Washington took a back seat in the war, which the Obama administration looked at skeptically from the start, the United States still ran the initial stages, in particular the destruction of Libya's air defenses, making it safe for its NATO colleagues to fly. The United States then provided intelligence, refueling and more precision bombing than Paris or London want to acknowledge. Inevitably, then, NATO air power and technology, combined with British, French and Qatari ''trainers'' working ''secretly'' with the rebels on the ground, have defeated the forces, some of them mercenary, of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
The question, however, is whether European members of NATO will ever decide to embark on such an adventure again.
Either Europeans will develop the security and defense identity they have advertised for so long, so Europe can have its own credible voice in a world not only run by soft power, or given the expense and difficulties of defeating even Libya, they will simply stop trying. The jury is out, but the verdict is important.
Some defense experts, like Tomas Valasek of the London-based Center for European Reform, suggest that Washington's diplomacy worked, in that during the Libyan conflict ''the allies established a new division of labor for NATO operations on Europe's borders, which should be encouraged.''
Possibly. And just possibly, given the cost and strain of the Libyan operation, combined with the vital necessity to cut budget deficits at home to save both the euro zone and themselves, even the eight European nations that fought will decide that a real European security and defense identity is too expensive and that their already shrinking defense budgets will continue to shrink past the point of utility -- at least to Washington. After all, the European Union itself played no role at all in the war.
Francois Heisbourg, a French defense analyst with the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris, said that the decisions made in Washington to ''lead from behind'' and in Berlin not to participate at all will have ''major strategic consequences for both NATO and the European Union.''
The lack of a sustained American ''shock and awe'' campaign probably left more of Libya's infrastructure intact for the new government, he noted. But less happily, he said, ''if 'leading from behind' becomes the rule rather than the exception'' -- which he regards as likely given United States budget cuts -- ''then European force planners will have to invest'' in air-defense suppression and more close-air support.
How likely, after all, is that? And if France, Britain and others do invest more in those areas, they will have to cut in others and will be less likely to engage in over-the-horizon expeditions like the war in Afghanistan.
So Libya may be a dark model for NATO's future: internal coalitions of the willing, hemmed in by conditions and national ''caveats,'' running out of ammunition and targets, with inadequate means to achieve stated political goals.
The economic crisis has only exacerbated Europe's unwillingness to live up to its grand ambitions to play a global role in foreign and defense matters. The biting complaints of Robert Gates, the former United States defense secretary, about the fading of Europe and a ''dim if not dismal future'' for an increasingly ''irrelevant'' alliance, were only an echo, if said more harshly, of similar speeches that many NATO secretaries general have made before him.
In February, at the Munich Security Conference, Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen of NATO ominously noted that in the last two years alone European defense spending had shrunk by $45 billion -- the equivalent of Germany's entire military budget. Only France, Britain and Greece (which can't afford it), are spending the agreed 2 percent of G.D.P. on defense, and Britain is now cutting sharply. If those trends continue, Mr. Rasmussen said, ''we risk a divided Europe'' and ''a Europe increasingly adrift from the United States.'' He noted the rise of China and the impatience of Washington: ''If Europe becomes unable to make an appropriate contribution to global security, then the United States might look elsewhere for reliable defense partners.''
There is also the moral question. In Libya, NATO allies ran roughshod over the United Nations Security Council resolution authorizing military means to protect civilians -- not intervention on one side of a civil and tribal war. France and Britain dismiss that argument, saying that it is trumped by the defense of Benghazi and the need to remove Colonel Qaddafi from power and that every Qaddafi supporter with a weapon was a threat to civilians, even if they themselves were civilians.
But there is no example of NATO intervening to protect civilian supporters of Colonel Qaddafi from the rebels. And a strong case can be made that the commitment to the ''sideshow'' of Libya has meant the impossibility of getting Russia and China to act even with economic sanctions on Syria, where the moral argument and the ''responsibility to protect'' civilians is clearer.
The Atlantic alliance, like the European Union, is suffering from a predictable post-Soviet hangover, combined with the strains of rapid expansion to countries that have sharply divergent views about Moscow, Ukraine, Georgia, the Middle East and the real threats to Europe. NATO leaders, in their latest strategic doctrine, tried to find credible threats to Europe from matters like piracy, when the real rationale for the organization vanished along with the Soviet tanks along the Elbe.
As for Afghanistan, the less said, the better. NATO allies are having a long collective buyer's remorse over their post-9/11 declaration of war against Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Britain and France, still losing troops and spending more per day there than they did over Libya, can't wait to leave. Few in Europe, at least, any longer think that the war can be won in any traditional sense, that there will be any glorious ending or even that the impact of this latest Western involvement will be lasting.
Correction: September 11, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A news analysis on Sept. 4 about the consequences of the Libya intervention for NATO incorrectly listed Sweden as a member. Sweden has provided support for the NATO effort to remove Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, but is not a member of the alliance.

HEADLINE: In Classroom of Future, Stagnant Scores

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
CHANDLER, Ariz. -- Amy Furman, a seventh-grade English teacher here, roams among 31 students sitting at their desks or in clumps on the floor. They're studying Shakespeare's ''As You Like It'' -- but not in any traditional way.
In this technology-centric classroom, students are bent over laptops, some blogging or building Facebook pages from the perspective of Shakespeare's characters. One student compiles a song list from the Internet, picking a tune by the rapper Kanye West to express the emotions of Shakespeare's lovelorn Silvius.
The class, and the Kyrene School District as a whole, offer what some see as a utopian vision of education's future. Classrooms are decked out with laptops, big interactive screens and software that drills students on every basic subject. Under a ballot initiative approved in 2005, the district has invested roughly $33 million in such technologies. 
The digital push here aims to go far beyond gadgets to transform the very nature of the classroom, turning the teacher into a guide instead of a lecturer, wandering among students who learn at their own pace on Internet-connected devices.
''This is such a dynamic class,'' Ms. Furman says of her 21st-century classroom. ''I really hope it works.''
Hope and enthusiasm are soaring here. But not test scores.
Since 2005, scores in reading and math have stagnated in Kyrene, even as statewide scores have risen.
To be sure, test scores can go up or down for many reasons. But to many education experts, something is not adding up -- here and across the country. In a nutshell: schools are spending billions on technology, even as they cut budgets and lay off teachers, with little proof that this approach is improving basic learning.
This conundrum calls into question one of the most significant contemporary educational movements. Advocates for giving schools a major technological upgrade -- which include powerful educators, Silicon Valley titans and White House appointees -- say digital devices let students learn at their own pace, teach skills needed in a modern economy and hold the attention of a generation weaned on gadgets.
Some backers of this idea say standardized tests, the most widely used measure of student performance, don't capture the breadth of skills that computers can help develop. But they also concede that for now there is no better way to gauge the educational value of expensive technology investments.
''The data is pretty weak. It's very difficult when we're pressed to come up with convincing data,'' said Tom Vander Ark, the former executive director for education at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and an investor in educational technology companies. When it comes to showing results, he said, ''We better put up or shut up.''
And yet, in virtually the same breath, he said change of a historic magnitude is inevitably coming to classrooms this decade: ''It's one of the three or four biggest things happening in the world today.''
Critics counter that, absent clear proof, schools are being motivated by a blind faith in technology and an overemphasis on digital skills -- like using PowerPoint and multimedia tools -- at the expense of math, reading and writing fundamentals. They say the technology advocates have it backward when they press to upgrade first and ask questions later.
The spending push comes as schools face tough financial choices. In Kyrene, for example, even as technology spending has grown, the rest of the district's budget has shrunk, leading to bigger classes and fewer periods of music, art and physical education.
At the same time, the district's use of technology has earned it widespread praise. It is upheld as a model of success by the National School Boards Association, which in 2008 organized a visit by 100 educators from 17 states who came to see how the district was innovating.
And the district has banked its future and reputation on technology. Kyrene, which serves 18,000 kindergarten to eighth-grade students, mostly from the cities of Tempe, Phoenix and Chandler, uses its computer-centric classes as a way to attract children from around the region, shoring up enrollment as its local student population shrinks. More students mean more state dollars.
The issue of tech investment will reach a critical point in November. The district plans to go back to local voters for approval of $46.3 million more in taxes over seven years to allow it to keep investing in technology. That represents around 3.5 percent of the district's annual spending, five times what it spends on textbooks.
The district leaders' position is that technology has inspired students and helped them grow, but that there is no good way to quantify those achievements -- putting them in a tough spot with voters deciding whether to bankroll this approach again.
''My gut is telling me we've had growth,'' said David K. Schauer, the superintendent here. ''But we have to have some measure that is valid, and we don't have that.''
It gives him pause.
''We've jumped on bandwagons for different eras without knowing fully what we're doing. This might just be the new bandwagon,'' he said. ''I hope not.''
A Dearth of Proof
The pressure to push technology into the classroom without proof of its value has deep roots.
In 1997, a science and technology committee assembled by President Clinton issued an urgent call about the need to equip schools with technology.
If such spending was not increased by billions of dollars, American competitiveness could suffer, according to the committee, whose members included educators like Charles M. Vest, then president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and business executives like John A. Young, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard.
To support its conclusion, the committee's report cited the successes of individual schools that embraced computers and saw test scores rise or dropout rates fall. But while acknowledging that the research on technology's impact was inadequate, the committee urged schools to adopt it anyhow.
The report's final sentence read: ''The panel does not, however, recommend that the deployment of technology within America's schools be deferred pending the completion of such research.''
Since then, the ambitions of those who champion educational technology have grown -- from merely equipping schools with computers and instructional software, to putting technology at the center of the classroom and building the teaching around it.
Kyrene had the same sense of urgency as President Clinton's committee when, in November 2005, it asked voters for an initial $46.3 million for laptops, classroom projectors, networking gear and other technology for teachers and administrators.
Before that, the district had given 300 elementary school teachers five laptops each. Students and teachers used them with great enthusiasm, said Mark Share, the district's 64-year-old director of technology, a white-bearded former teacher from the Bronx with an iPhone clipped to his belt.
''If we know something works, why wait?'' Mr. Share told The Arizona Republic the month before the vote. The district's pitch was based not on the idea that test scores would rise, but that technology represented the future.
The measure, which faced no organized opposition, passed overwhelmingly. It means that property owners in the dry, sprawling flatlands here, who live in apartment complexes, cookie-cutter suburban homes and salmon-hued mini-mansions, pay on average $75 more a year in taxes, depending on the assessed value of their homes, according to the district.
But the proof sought by President Clinton's committee remains elusive even today, though researchers have been seeking answers.
Many studies have found that technology has helped individual classrooms, schools or districts. For instance, researchers found that writing scores improved for eighth-graders in Maine after they were all issued laptops in 2002. The same researchers, from the University of Southern Maine, found that math performance picked up among seventh- and eighth-graders after teachers in the state were trained in using the laptops to teach.
A question plaguing many education researchers is how to draw broader inferences from such case studies, which can have serious limitations. For instance, in the Maine math study, it is hard to separate the effect of the laptops from the effect of the teacher training.
Educators would like to see major trials years in length that clearly demonstrate technology's effect. But such trials are extraordinarily difficult to conduct when classes and schools can be so different, and technology is changing so quickly.
And often the smaller studies produce conflicting results. Some classroom studies show that math scores rise among students using instructional software, while others show that scores actually fall. The high-level analyses that sum up these various studies, not surprisingly, give researchers pause about whether big investments in technology make sense.
One broad analysis of laptop programs like the one in Maine, for example, found that such programs are not a major factor in student performance.
''Rather than being a cure-all or silver bullet, one-to-one laptop programs may simply amplify what's already occurring -- for better or worse,'' wrote Bryan Goodwin, spokesman for Mid-continent Research for Education and Learning, a nonpartisan group that did the study, in an essay. Good teachers, he said, can make good use of computers, while bad teachers won't, and they and their students could wind up becoming distracted by the technology.
A review by the Education Department in 2009 of research on online courses -- which more than one million K-12 students are taking -- found that few rigorous studies had been done and that policy makers ''lack scientific evidence'' of their effectiveness.. A division of the Education Department that rates classroom curriculums has found that much educational software is not an improvement over textbooks.
Larry Cuban, an education professor emeritus at Stanford University, said the research did not justify big investments by districts.
''There is insufficient evidence to spend that kind of money. Period, period, period,'' he said. ''There is no body of evidence that shows a trend line.''
Some advocates for technology disagree.
Karen Cator, director of the office of educational technology in the United States Department of Education, said standardized test scores were an inadequate measure of the value of technology in schools. Ms. Cator, a former executive at Apple Computer, said that better measurement tools were needed but, in the meantime, schools knew what students needed.
''In places where we've had a large implementing of technology and scores are flat, I see that as great,'' she said. ''Test scores are the same, but look at all the other things students are doing: learning to use the Internet to research, learning to organize their work, learning to use professional writing tools, learning to collaborate with others.''
For its part, Kyrene has become a model to many by training teachers to use technology and getting their ideas on what inspires them. As Mr. Share says in the signature file at the bottom of every e-mail he sends: ''It's not the stuff that counts -- it's what you do with it that matters.''
So people here are not sure what to make of the stagnant test scores. Many of the district's schools, particularly those in more affluent areas, already had relatively high scores, making it a challenge to push them significantly higher. A jump in students qualifying for free or reduced-price lunches was largely a result of the recession, not a shift in the population the district serves, said Nancy Dundenhoefer, its community relations manager.
Mr. Share, whose heavy influence on more than $7 million a year in technology spending has made him a power broker, said he did not think demographic changes were a good explanation.
''You could argue that test scores would be lower without the technology, but that's a copout,'' he said, adding that the district should be able to deliver some measure of what he considers its obvious success with technology. ''It's a conundrum.''
Results aside, it's easy to see why technology is such an easy sell here, given the enthusiasm surrounding it in some classrooms.
Engaging With Paper
''I start with pens and pencils,'' says Ms. Furman, 41, who is short and bubbly and devours young-adult novels to stay in touch with students. Her husband teaches eighth grade in the district, and their son and daughter are both students.
At the beginning of the school year, Ms. Furman tries to inspire her students at Aprende Middle School to write, a task she says becomes increasingly difficult when students reach the patently insecure middle-school years.
In one class in 2009 she had them draw a heart on a piece of paper. Inside the heart, she asked them to write the names of things and people dear to them. One girl started to cry, then another, as the class shared their stories.
It was something Ms. Furman doubted would have happened if the students had been using computers. ''There is a connection between the physical hand on the paper and the words on the page,'' she said. ''It's intimate.''
But, she said, computers play an important role in helping students get their ideas down more easily, edit their work so they can see instant improvement, and share it with the class. She uses a document camera to display a student's paper at the front of the room for others to dissect.
Ms. Furman said the creative and editing tools, by inspiring students to make quick improvements to their writing, pay dividends in the form of higher-quality work. Last year, 14 of her students were chosen as finalists in a statewide essay contest that asked them how literature had affected their lives. ''I was running down the hall, weeping, saying, 'Get these students together. We need to tell them they've won!' ''
Other teachers say the technology is the only way to make this generation learn.
''They're inundated with 24/7 media, so they expect it,'' said Sharon Smith, 44, a gregarious seventh-grade social studies teacher whose classroom is down the hall from Ms. Furman's.
Minutes earlier, Ms. Smith had taught a Civil War lesson in a way unimaginable even 10 years ago. With the lights off, a screen at the front of the room posed a question: ''Jefferson Davis was Commander of the Union Army: True or False?''
The 30 students in the classroom held wireless clickers into which they punched their answers. Seconds later, a pie chart appeared on the screen: 23 percent answered ''True,'' 70 percent ''False,'' and 6 percent didn't know.
The students hooted and hollered, reacting to the instant poll. Ms. Smith then drew the students into a conversation about the answers.
The enthusiasm underscores a key argument for investing in classroom technology: student engagement.
That idea is central to the National Education Technology Plan released by the White House last year, which calls for the ''revolutionary transformation'' of schools. The plan endorses bringing ''state-of-the art technology into learning to enable, motivate and inspire all students.''
But the research, what little there is of it, does not establish a clear link between computer-inspired engagement and learning, said Randy Yerrick, associate dean of educational technology at the University of Buffalo.
For him, the best educational uses of computers are those that have no good digital equivalent. As examples, he suggests using digital sensors in a science class to help students observe chemical or physical changes, or using multimedia tools to reach disabled children.
But he says engagement is a ''fluffy term'' that can slide past critical analysis. And Professor Cuban at Stanford argues that keeping children engaged requires an environment of constant novelty, which cannot be sustained.
''There is very little valid and reliable research that shows the engagement causes or leads to higher academic achievement,'' he said.
Instruct or Distract?
There are times in Kyrene when the technology seems to allow students to disengage from learning: They are left at computers to perform a task but wind up playing around, suggesting, as some researchers have found, that computers can distract and not instruct.
The 23 kindergartners in Christy Asta's class at Kyrene de las Brisas are broken into small groups, a common approach in Kyrene. A handful stand at desks, others sit at computers, typing up reports.
Xavier Diaz, 6, sits quietly, chair pulled close to his Dell laptop, playing ''Alien Addition.'' In this math arcade game, Xavier controls a pod at the bottom of the screen that shoots at spaceships falling from the sky. Inside each ship is a pair of numbers. Xavier's goal is to shoot only the spaceship with numbers that are the sum of the number inside his pod.
But Xavier is just shooting every target in sight. Over and over. Periodically, the game gives him a message: ''Try again.'' He tries again.
''Even if he doesn't get it right, it's getting him to think quicker,'' says the teacher, Ms. Asta. She leans down next to him: ''Six plus one is seven. Click here.'' She helps him shoot the right target. ''See, you shot him.''
Perhaps surprisingly given the way young people tend to gravitate toward gadgets, students here seem divided about whether they prefer learning on computers or through more traditional methods.
In a different class, Konray Yuan and Marisa Guisto, both 7, take turns touching letters on the interactive board on the wall. They are playing a spelling game, working together to spell the word ''cool.'' Each finds one of the letters in a jumbled grid, touching them in the proper order.
Marisa says there isn't a difference between learning this way and learning on paper. Konray prefers paper, he says, because you get extra credit for good penmanship.
But others, particularly older students, say they enjoy using the technology tools. One of Ms. Furman's students, Julia Schroder, loved building a blog to write about Shakespeare's ''As You Like It.''
In another class, she and several classmates used a video camera to film a skit about Woodrow Wilson's 14-point speech during World War I -- an approach she preferred to speaking directly to the class.
''I'd be pretty bummed if I had to do a live thing,'' she said. ''It's nerve-racking.''
Teachers vs. Tech
Even as students are getting more access to computers here, they are getting less access to teachers.
Reflecting budget cuts, class sizes have crept up in Kyrene, as they have in many places. For example, seventh-grade classes like Ms. Furman's that had 29 to 31 students grew to more like 31 to 33.
''You can't continue to be effective if you keep adding one student, then one student, then one student,'' Ms. Furman said. ''I'm surprised parents aren't going into the classrooms saying 'Whoa.' ''
Advocates of high-tech classrooms say computers are not intended to replace teachers. But they do see a fundamental change in the teacher's role. Their often-cited mantra is that teachers should go from being ''a sage on the stage to a guide on the side.''
And they say that, technology issues aside, class sizes can in fact afford to grow without hurting student performance.
Professor Cuban at Stanford said research showed that student performance did not improve significantly until classes fell under roughly 15 students, and did not get much worse unless they rose above 30.
At the same time, he says bigger classes can frustrate teachers, making it hard to attract and retain talented ones.
In Kyrene, growing class sizes reflect spending cuts; the district's maintenance and operation budget fell to $95 million this year from $106 million in 2008. The district cannot use the money designated for technology to pay for other things. And the teachers, who make roughly $33,000 to $57,000 a year, have not had a raise since 2008.
Many teachers have second jobs, some in restaurants and retail, said Erin Kirchoff, president of the Kyrene Education Association, the teacher's association. Teachers talk of being exhausted from teaching all day, then selling shoes at the mall.
Ms. Furman works during the summer at the Kyrene district offices. But that job is being eliminated in 2014, and she is worried about the income loss.
''Without it, we don't go on vacation,'' she said.
Money for other things in the district is short as well. Many teachers say they regularly bring in their own supplies, like construction paper.
''We have Smart Boards in every classroom but not enough money to buy copy paper, pencils and hand sanitizer,'' said Nicole Cates, a co-president of the Parent Teacher Organization at Kyrene de la Colina, an elementary school. ''You don't go buy a new outfit when you don't have enough dinner to eat.''
But she loves the fact that her two children, a fourth-grader and first-grader, are learning technology, including PowerPoint and educational games.
To some who favor high-tech classrooms, the resource squeeze presents an opportunity. Their thinking is that struggling schools will look for more efficient ways to get the job done, creating an impetus to rethink education entirely.
''Let's hope the fiscal crisis doesn't get better too soon. It'll slow down reform,'' said Tom Watkins, the former superintendent for the Michigan schools, and now a consultant to businesses in the education sector.
Clearly, the push for technology is to the benefit of one group: technology companies.
The Sellers
It is 4:30 a.m. on a Tuesday. Mr. Share, the director of technology at Kyrene and often an early riser, awakens to the hard sell. Awaiting him at his home computer are six pitches from technology companies.
It's just another day for the man with the checkbook.
''I get one pitch an hour,'' he said. He finds most of them useless and sometimes galling: ''They're mostly car salesmen. I think they believe in the product they're selling, but they don't have a leg to stand on as to why the product is good or bad.''
Mr. Share bases his buying decisions on two main factors: what his teachers tell him they need, and his experience. For instance, he said he resisted getting the interactive whiteboards sold as Smart Boards until, one day in 2008, he saw a teacher trying to mimic the product with a jury-rigged projector setup.
''It was an 'Aha!' moment,'' he said, leading him to buy Smart Boards, made by a company called Smart Technologies.
He can make that kind of decision because he has money -- and the vendors know it. Technology companies track which districts get federal funding and which have passed tax assessments for technology, like Kyrene.
This is big business. Sales of computer software to schools for classroom use were $1.89 billion in 2010. Spending on hardware is more difficult to measure, researchers say, but some put the figure at five times that amount.
The vendors relish their relationship with Kyrene.
''I joke I should have an office here, I'm here so often,'' said Will Dunham, a salesman for CCS Presentation Systems, a leading reseller of Smart Boards in Arizona.
Last summer, the district paid $500,000 to CCS to replace ceiling-hung projectors in 400 classrooms. The alternative was to spend $100,000 to replace their aging bulbs, which Mr. Share said were growing dimmer, causing teachers to sometimes have to turn down the lights to see a crisp image.
Mr. Dunham said the purchase made sense because new was better. ''I could take a used car down to the mechanic and get it all fixed up and still have a used car.''
But Ms. Kirchoff, the president of the teachers' association, is furious. ''My projector works just fine,'' she said. ''Give me Kleenex, Kleenex, Kleenex!''
The Parents
Last November, Kyrene went back to voters to ask them to pay for another seven years of technology spending in the district. The previous measure from 2005 will not expire for two years. But the district wanted to get ahead of the issue, and leave wiggle room just in case the new measure didn't pass.
It didn't. It lost by 96 votes out of nearly 50,000 cast. Mr. Share and others here said they attributed the failure to poor wording on the ballot that made it look like a new tax increase, rather than the continuation of one.
They say they will not make the same wording mistake this time. And they say the burden on taxpayers is modest.
''It's so much bang for the buck,'' said Jeremy Calles, Kyrene's interim chief financial officer. For a small investment, he said, ''we get state-of-the-art technology.''
Regardless, some taxpayers have already decided that they will not vote yes.
''When you look at the big picture, it's hard to say 'yes, spend more on technology' when class sizes increase,'' said Kameron Bybee, 34, who has two children in district schools. ''The district has made up its mind to go forward with the technologically advanced path. Come hell or high water.''
Other parents feel conflicted. Eduarda Schroder, 48, whose daughter Julia was in Ms. Furman's English class, worked on the political action committee last November to push through an extension of the technology tax. Computers, she says, can make learning more appealing. But she's also concerned that test scores haven't gone up.
She says she is starting to ask a basic question. ''Do we really need technology to learn?'' she said. ''It's a very valid time to ask the question, right before this goes on the ballot.''

HEADLINE: Refugee Camps: There's a Better Way

BYLINE: By TINA ROSENBERG. 
The co-author of Fixes, a series on social change at nytimes.com.

 BODY:
SOMALIA is now suffering its worst drought in 60 years. A quarter of the population has fled famine and conflict, heading west into Kenya. More than 1,300 people a day stream into the complex of refugee camps at Dadaab, Kenya, which is now housing more than 430,000 people in camps designed for 90,000. Many Somalis arrive near death after journeys of weeks with little food. Large numbers of them are children, often without parents.
At Dadaab they receive food, medical care, basic shelter -- the emergency relief they need. But they will probably spend years in that desolate grid of white tents, eating gruel that gets thinner toward the end of the month. The camp lacks the money to provide even subsistence rations. In exchange, the refugees give up their rights to move freely and to work.
The history of refugee camps tells us that they are likely to suffer cholera and other diseases and that rape and domestic violence are widespread. Refugees in Dadaab face lives of enforced idleness and dependency; children born there may grow up there. This is what we have come to expect for refugees: a place one step removed from hell. 
Contrast Dadaab with the situation of the roughly 1.6 million Iraqi refugees in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. Instead of living in camps, they live in Damascus, Aleppo, Beirut and Amman. They get help from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, including an A.T.M. card that allows them to withdraw money every month. Some can work legally, but others work in the informal economy, as do locals.
They buy their own food and rent their own apartments. They use the local schools and health clinics. In areas where Iraqi refugees are concentrated enough to strain those services, the refugee agency spends money to refurbish and supply them, helping both the refugees and their neighbors.
Most Iraqi refugees are educated and middle class. They fled to relatively prosperous cities, and they get an unusually large amount of aid because of donations from the United States. They are in a very different position from the destitute Somali farmers.
But the policy of self-settlement outside camps has also been successful with the poor. Because it has shown results, it should be tried in a systematic way on a much larger scale -- with Somali refugees, those now coming out of Syria and others who have already spent months or years in camps.
Self-settlement is sometimes achieved through official policy, but more often by refugees on their own -- they simply go where they want. If the United Nations refugee agency has programs to help them, they can register and get those services. But many simply choose to blend in with the local population. The vast majority of Angolans in Zambia and refugees in Uganda from South Sudan and elsewhere, for example, have chosen to avoid camps and live, without help, on their own; both cases are considered successful. In many countries, refugees can receive aid while living in cities or local villages. Self-settlement can allow refugees to acquire savings and skills that will make them more productive when they return home. (Refugee status is temporary. When their country is declared safe, that status expires, and with it the right to stay in their country of asylum.)
The most vulnerable and weakest might prefer camps. But most refugees, given a chance, prefer self-reliance, said Jeff Crisp, the head of policy development and evaluation at the United Nations refugee agency.
The camp model began at the end of World War II as a way to provide temporary housing for the displaced. ''Over the years, camps have become the standard response,'' Mr. Crisp said. ''But they should be a last resort.''
After World War II, most refugees in camps were quickly repatriated or resettled. The official fiction is that refugees today can expect the same. It is not true; the United States State Department says that more than 10 million refugees -- two-thirds of the world's total -- live in what are called ''protracted refugee situations.'' In 1993, refugee-producing situations like famine or war lasted an average of nine years each. By 2003, the average length was 17 years. For all their flaws, camps have persisted for powerful reasons. They are the most effective way to provide emergency aid to a vast number of people -- Dadaab is saving hundreds of thousands of lives. The problem comes later; once built and populated, camps stay.
Vast bureaucracies and networks of aid workers now revolve around camps, where refugees and their plight can easily be made visible. Most crucial, the countries that host refugees prefer camps, and they have a veto. Host countries assume enormous and unfair burdens. Fewer than 7,000 Afghans have settled in the United States; over time Pakistan has hosted five million. Camps are built in the middle of nowhere so they can keep refugees away from local society, which is what host governments demand.
Camps also ensure that the refugees will be the United Nations' problem. Wealthy countries might promise to pay the costs of helping refugees outside camps, but host governments don't believe them, said Lavinia Limon, president of the United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, which has led the campaign to end what it calls the ''warehousing'' of refugees. ''Host countries often say that the idea of self-settlement is a plot to have refugees integrated into society and disappear, sticking the local government with the bill,'' she said.
Iraqi refugees managed to avoid being settled in camps because many had left for Amman and Damascus before camps were even considered. Nor did the United States want to call attention to the fact that 40 percent of Iraq's professional class had fled.
The world has taken notice of the policy's success. In 2009, the refugee agency decided to help in urban areas, but host countries have resisted. Self-settlement would almost certainly cost less than camps: help would merely supplement what refugees earn, and there would be no need to feed them or build complex infrastructure.
It is a cruel irony that host governments have an interest in camps being miserable -- on the theory that the worse off the refugees are, the more likely they are to return home. But it's not clear that people in camps are more likely to repatriate than those who self-settle. The Committee for Refugees and Immigrants argues that refugees should be able to go where they want. They would get some special services -- counseling, support groups, drop-in centers. But they would use the same schools and health clinics as the local population. The government would send the bill to donors and with that money expand and improve those schools and clinics. Donors would also pay nongovernmental groups to run projects -- microcredit, for example -- that would help refugees and their hosts.
A State Department official said that American humanitarian aid is doing this in several countries -- notably in Pakistan. It is not easy work; in many cases a refugee becomes just one more resident of vast urban slums, and development projects in poor countries do not have a perfect record.
But it is at least the sort of help that offers a chance to produce something lasting; merely keeping people barely alive year after year does not.

HEADLINE: Across the Hall, Diversity

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
MARIETTA HILL lives in a luxurious studio in one of Manhattan's newest rental high-rises.
The building has a top-of-the-line fitness center and a lap pool in a pristine white-tiled atrium, and a yoga room with bamboo floors. The children have a playroom, and so do the adults -- a sleek lounge. A media room is outfitted with a 110-inch screen and plush white leather chairs. The apartments have high-end finishes in the kitchens and bathrooms, and two things every renter covets: ample closet space and a washer/dryer.
Ms. Hill, an orthodontic assistant, pays about $500 a month, even though the starting market-rate rent for a studio in her building is $2,950.
For her, luxury housing is also affordable housing. 
In the past, when a developer of market-rate residential buildings included affordable housing in exchange for tax incentives, the affordable units were often put in another complex or even in another borough altogether.
In 2008, however, a change in city regulations made it almost impossible for developers to sequester the affordable units away from luxury digs. And as apartment buildings become ever more extravagant, the diversity within the walls of a single structure can be striking.
Ms. Hill's building, the Emerald Green, at 320 West 38th Street, is one of dozens to go up under a program known as 80/20 in the last few years, in which people from both extremes of the income scale live across the hall from one another. These projects include Tribeca Green downtown, MiMA and Silver Towers on West 42nd Street, and the Legacy on the Upper East Side.
Ingrid Gould Ellen, a director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University, said that although it was unusual to have someone making $30,000 a year next door to a person making $500,000, it reflected a significant change in thinking about how to approach affordable housing. ''Over the past two decades,'' she said, ''there has been a movement around the country to have more income mix within neighborhoods.''
And in Manhattan, it is not just neighborhoods that are mixed, but the buildings themselves. In order to qualify for the program, developers must spread the affordable units throughout the building so as not to segregate low-income renters. To help ensure that the affordable units blend in, regulations cover everything from appliance sizes and access to common space, to an equitable distribution of views.
Gary Jacob, an executive vice president of Glenwood Management, the developer behind Emerald Green and one of the largest builders in Manhattan, says the effect is to make it difficult to tell who is paying market rate and who is not.
''We find that there is a very good social and economic mix,'' he said. ''If you are standing in the lobby watching people come in and out, I would challenge you to tell who is who. The affordable tenants are wonderful. To them, they have won the lottery.''
But that does not mean developers leave anything to chance.
In addition to meeting very strict financial criteria, which usually means making about $20,000 to $40,000 a year, applicants often have to provide references and credit histories; they are even subject to home visits.
The screening is often far more rigorous than the market-rate tenants undergo, and competition is fierce, with as many as 10,000 applications pouring in for every 100 available apartments, according to city officials. Some 60 percent of those applicants fail to qualify from the outset. Information about upcoming affordable-housing lotteries can be found on the Web site of the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
Ms. Hill said that after the developers accepted her application in June 2010, they immediately scheduled a home interview. At the time, she was living with her aunt and sleeping on the couch.
''They asked everything,'' she recalled. ''Where do you work? What do you do? Why are you leaving your family?''
In the seven years she had lived in New York since moving from the Dominican Republic, she had bounced between the apartments of friends and relatives and had all but given up hope of finding an affordable home.
''When you don't make a lot of money and you get a chance to live in a place like this you feel so blessed,'' she said. ''Programs like this, for people of low income, you give people energy to live.''
At Emerald Green, market-rate tenants are charged $350 a year to use the amenities. Those in affordable housing pay about half that.
Emerald Green was built under the auspices of 80/20 -- through which 80 percent of the apartments are rented for market-rate prices and then are subject to rent stabilization guidelines, and 20 percent are reserved for those making less than 50 percent of the area's median income, which varies by location and family size, but is in the ballpark of $80,000. More than 20,000 rental apartments have been built under this program over the years, 4,200 of them reserved for affordable housing.
A dozen city, state and federal programs subsidize housing, and the 80/20 program accounts for only a fraction of all affordable housing. The Bloomberg administration set a goal of creating 165,000 affordable units across the city and so far has created about 125,000.
However, in Manhattan, the 80/20 program plays a significant role in the overall rental market since developers say that without the incentives it affords, it would be all but impossible to build new large-scale rental buildings.
''I do not believe you can build a 100 percent rental building in Manhattan where you do not do an 80/20,'' Mr. Jacob said.
To make these projects work, developers say, the market-rate rentals have to command top dollar from the day the doors open. Although 80 percent of the apartments can be priced at the upper limits of what developers think the market will bear, they then automatically come under the rent-stabilization system, limiting how much rents can rise each year afterward.
So even though many New Yorkers shake their heads in bewilderment when they see one-bedroom apartments going for $4,000 a month, the reality is that, over time, those apartments may be considered deals, since the rents will rise very slowly.
These programs took shape during a dark period in the city's history.
In the depths of a recession in the 1970s, developers were given tax abatements to promote construction under a program known as 421-a. To encourage building in forlorn parts of the city, developers were offered a tax abatement allowing them to pay real estate taxes on the assessed value of the land before construction. For instance, if the property was worth $1 million unbuilt, but the new building increased the value to $10 million, they would pay taxes -- for 10 to 25 years, depending on the project -- on only the $1 million. Affordable housing did not have to be provided.
But as land in Manhattan between 14th and 96th Streets was extremely valuable even then, it was designated an excluded zone. One of the few ways that developers could get the 421-a tax abatement was to build affordable housing, the most common being 80/20 projects. Where the 421-a program can save millions in taxes for the length it is applied (usually 20 years in Manhattan), the 80/20 program allows developers to borrow money at extremely low rates, similar to those paid by the federal government.
For years, however, developers did not have to build the affordable units in the same building as the luxury rentals. Instead, they could buy certificates that they could then use to build the affordable housing components elsewhere, often in the outer boroughs.
During the building boom of the last decade, the system came under increasing fire as being too generous to developers. In 2008, the program was revised so that all of Manhattan and parts of the Brooklyn and Queens waterfront became excluded zones, meaning that to get the 421-a tax abatement, developers would have to build affordable housing -- 80/20 or some other variant -- in parts of the city where it had not been the norm. And since the certificate system was done away with, those affordable units usually had to be built in the same building as the luxury rentals.
Soon after the changes were implemented, however, the market collapsed and development stalled.
This year, development is again picking up and the impact of the rule changes is just beginning to be felt.
Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York, says at least six 80/20 projects are being planned in Manhattan. They will add some 1,500 affordable and rent-stabilized apartments.
While the 80/20 program has proved successful in prime Manhattan neighborhoods, he said, it remains to be seen if neighborhoods in Queens and Brooklyn can command the kinds of rents that make such development feasible.
Jeffrey Levine, the president of Levine Builders, said that the rule changes were already having an impact in an economy still very unfavorable to financing.
''You can see it in the outer boroughs, where there is little new construction planned,'' he said.
While building affordable housing in expensive neighborhoods may have societal benefits, he said, it often does not make economic sense since it can cost three times more and provides fewer apartments than a traditional midrise dedicated to affordable housing.
The heart of the problem, he said, is a system that places too much of the tax burden on new construction in order to keep property taxes on older buildings low. Without the 421-a abatement, he said, it is difficult to turn a profit on new construction.
The subsidizing of 80/20 projects also raises questions about how best to spread government subsidies.
For the lucky few who can score one of these apartments, it is a great deal.
But it best serves extremes of the spectrum -- the working poor and the affluent -- while leaving broad swaths of the middle class priced out of the Manhattan apartment market.
''We are building the luxury stuff for wealthy people and we are throwing in low-income housing,'' Mr. Spinola said, ''but nobody is building for the nurse who is married to a cop.''
The city is trying to address that concern in several ways; one is to require developers who are building on land bought from the city to have a broader array of mixed-income housing.
For instance, the Bloomberg administration recently announced an agreement with a developer to build Studio City, a new 1,238-unit rental building between 44th and 45th Streets along 11th Avenue, that will include units for people in three different categories: those who make 50 percent of the average area income, those who make 135 percent, and those who make 165 percent.
Still, given the cost of construction in Manhattan, said Ms. Ellen of N.Y.U., the challenge is daunting.
''How much are we willing to pay to create diversity?'' she said. ''When you have a lot of need, should you put all the resources on serving the very neediest? Or should you have a broader approach, one that includes the upper middle class? It is something the city has been trying to balance.''

HEADLINE: Do Happier People Work Harder?

BYLINE: By TERESA AMABILE and STEVEN KRAMER

 BODY:
Teresa Amabile, a professor at Harvard Business School, and Steven Kramer, an independent researcher, are the authors of ''The Progress Principle.''
LABOR DAY is meant to be a celebration of work. Yet, on this Labor Day, few have reason to rejoice. Even those who have jobs.
The Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, which has been polling over 1,000 adults every day since January 2008, shows that Americans now feel worse about their jobs -- and work environments -- than ever before. People of all ages, and across income levels, are unhappy with their supervisors, apathetic about their organizations and detached from what they do. And there's no reason to think things will soon improve. 
Employee engagement may seem like a frill in a downturn economy. But it can make a big difference in a company's survival. In a 2010 study, James K. Harter and colleagues found that lower job satisfaction foreshadowed poorer bottom-line performance. Gallup estimates the cost of America's disengagement crisis at a staggering $300 billion in lost productivity annually. When people don't care about their jobs or their employers, they don't show up consistently, they produce less, or their work quality suffers.
Over the past decade, we researched the micro-level causes behind this macro-level problem. To gain real-time perspective into everyday work lives, we collected nearly 12,000 electronic diary entries from 238 professionals in seven different companies. Our study charted each person's psychological state each day, and asked respondents to describe one event that stood out during that day. Our analysis revealed their inner work lives -- the usually hidden perceptions, emotions and motivations that people experience as they react to and make sense of events in their workdays.
The results were sobering. In one-third of the 12,000 diary entries, the diarist was unhappy, unmotivated or both. In fact, workers often expressed frustration, disdain or disgust. Our research shows that inner work life has a profound impact on workers' creativity, productivity, commitment and collegiality. Employees are far more likely to have new ideas on days when they feel happier. Conventional wisdom suggests that pressure enhances performance; our real-time data, however, shows that workers perform better when they are happily engaged in what they do.
Managers can help ensure that people are happily engaged at work. Doing so isn't expensive. Workers' well-being depends, in large part, on managers' ability and willingness to facilitate workers' accomplishments -- by removing obstacles, providing help and acknowledging strong effort. A clear pattern emerged when we analyzed the 64,000 specific workday events reported in the diaries: of all the events that engage people at work, the single most important -- by far -- is simply making progress in meaningful work.
As long as workers experience their labor as meaningful, progress is often followed by joy and excitement about the work. ''This time it looks good! I feel more positive about this project and my work than I've felt in a long time,'' one programmer wrote after she'd completed a small but difficult task. This kind of rich inner work life improves performance, which further supports inner work life -- a positive spiral.
Unfortunately, many companies now keep head count and resources to a minimum and this makes progress a struggle for employees. Most managers don't understand the negative consequences of this struggle. When we asked 669 managers from companies around the world to rank five employee motivators in terms of importance, they ranked ''supporting progress'' dead last. Fully 95 percent of these managers failed to recognize that progress in meaningful work is the primary motivator, well ahead of traditional incentives like raises and bonuses.
This failure reflects a common experience inside organizations. Of the seven companies we studied, just one had managers who consistently supplied the catalysts -- worker autonomy, sufficient resources and learning from problems -- that enabled progress. Not coincidentally, that company was the only one to achieve a technological breakthrough in the months we studied it.
Working adults spend more of their waking hours at work than anywhere else. Work should ennoble, not kill, the human spirit. Promoting workers' well-being isn't just ethical; it makes economic sense. Fostering positive inner lives sometimes requires leaders to better articulate meaning in the work for everyone across the organization. Sometimes, all that's required is that managers address daily hassles and help with technical problems. If those who lead organizations -- from C.E.O.'s to small-team leaders -- believe their mission is, in part, to support workers' everyday progress, we could end the disengagement crisis and, in the process, lift our work force's well-being and our economy's productivity.

HEADLINE: Teaching the Art Of Surviving the Duel

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
IT was a perfectly peaceful late summer evening in downtown Manhattan, but a few steps off the sidewalk on Broome Street, two swordsmen tilted heavy Spanish rapiers at each other. Each keenly focused on the other's three-foot-long steel blade. After a circular, predatory dance, they clashed, laying into each other with a great clanking as furious overhead chops led to slices toward the torso.
This is the scene three nights each week in a modest, first-floor dance rehearsal studio where the Martinez Academy of Arms holds group classes for about two dozen regular students. 
The academy is one of a few remaining places in the world where a nearly extinct tradition of European swordsmanship is studied and passed down from master to student, said its founder, Ramon Martinez, 57. Mr. Martinez -- everyone calls him Maestro -- holds a title esteemed among fencers: master of arms. His academy teaches styles and traditions for more than 20 weapons including the rapier, the dagger, the wooden cane and the military saber.
''We're preserving something here that is very rare,'' Mr. Martinez said. ''These are techniques that have vanished from modern fencing systems, and many styles are not even practiced anymore in the countries where they originated.''
Mr. Martinez says the traditional styles he teaches are a martial art rooted in dueling tradition. Unlike modern, Olympic-style fencing, which emphasizes athleticism and dramatic lunges, his academy's fencing focuses on an economy of movement, with a less-catlike stance, he said. Its style is more cagey and defensive, like the style one might adopt in a real duel with real swords and real lives at stake.
''We're not teaching a game,'' Mr. Martinez said. ''We're teaching them to duel as if their lives depended on it. The object is not to rack up points, but to survive the duel.''
On Wednesday evening, students trickled into the studio, with its wooden floor and large wall mirrors. They unpacked fantastic-looking weapons: heavy long swords, stealthy daggers and other, more ornate pieces that looked like something out of ''The Three Musketeers.'' Then they hung their weapons from on a big iron radiator whose slots fit the swords nicely.
The students were put through drills of synchronized footwork by Mr. Martinez's wife, Jeannette Acosta-Martinez, also a master of arms. They trained with wooden canes made of ash saplings, and then took up their swords, whose points are blunted with rubber. The students and teachers wear padded vests and protective headgear, but the action is vigorous, and the sword clashes are forceful and fast.
Mr. Martinez had just finished drilling some students in the use of the late-19th-century dueling sword. He wore a heavy black tunic of buffalo hide and a protective collar that rode up under his conquistador-style beard.
A staff instructor, Jared Kirby, 36, and Ms. Acosta-Martinez took out heavy steel Spanish rapiers, each more than a yard long, and practiced the subtle techniques of controlling an opponent's blade. Then, with northern Italian dueling sabers, Mr. Kirby defended himself with a series of lightning-quick parries and offered a snapping riposte: a return stab to Ms. Acosta-Martinez's chest. Mr. Martinez supervised carefully.
''These are forms that have evolved for more than 500 years,'' said Mr. Martinez, who keeps a huge library of old texts and treatises on dueling and swordsmanship.
He can also hold forth on the old swashbuckling movies in which stars often performed their own fights. Forget the sword work of Errol Flynn, he said. Treat yourself to some Douglas Fairbanks Sr. or, better yet, Basil Rathbone, who shows his blade prowess against Tyrone Power in the 1940 film ''The Mark of Zorro.''
The son of Puerto Rican-born parents, Mr. Martinez grew up in the South Bronx, where he says he saw his share of switchblade stabbings. ''It's a vulgar weapon, and these guys didn't know defense,'' he said.
He began fencing as a teenager, and studied with Frederick Rohdes, a master who studied under the great Marcel Cabijos and made his students spar blindfolded at his longtime academy on East 86th Street in Manhattan.
Now, Mr. Martinez passes that knowledge down to his students and instructors. Mr. Kirby said his interest in fencing was ignited by watching a duel in the film ''The Princess Bride.'' He promptly moved from Minnesota to study the long sword in Scotland, where he saw Mr. Martinez present a Spanish rapier workshop. ''He was the only person in the world I knew of who was teaching it,'' Mr. Kirby recalled. ''I immediately moved to New York to study with him, and I've been here ever since.''
Twelve years into his apprenticeship, Mr. Kirby is now an expert in the Spanish and Italian rapiers, and works as a film and theater consultant, training actors and arranging dueling scenes. He also teaches a college course in the northern Italian dueling sword and the French foil.
During the recent class, he and a student, a film producer named Ben Miller, took out massive long swords and began swinging and blocking, creating a clank and clash of steel that sounded fearsome, even for a drill.
The fencers began and ended each drill and scrimmage with a traditional salute and handshake. ''Someone is lending you their body, to help your art,'' Mr. Kirby said. ''You never want to take that for granted.''
Classes convene on Monday, Wednesday and Friday evenings. Beginners are welcome to take the first session free and to borrow equipment. After that, the cost is $30 a class, which runs for several hours.
A longtime student, Keena Suh, a Manhattan architect, said she enjoyed the mental and physical discipline that the classes imparted. ''I wasn't an athlete, but one day I walked in here 10 years ago and I knew immediately -- it was visceral -- that this was something I would not find anywhere else,'' she said. ''It's meditative and has taught me to focus on doing one thing perfectly, and keeping composure. People might think this is a wild and aggressive activity, but it's the opposite.''

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Which School Reforms Will Work Best?

 BODY:
Readers discuss teacher quality and curriculum as schools deal with budget cuts and mandates.
The Letter
To the Editor:
As we start a new school year with high hopes and excitement, it will be interesting to watch how several controversial education reforms play out across the nation.
The Common Core State Standards, adopted by all but a handful of states in the last year or so, provide specific guidelines about what should be taught in each grade. Although this approach has been criticized for usurping local control of education, that objection is far outweighed by the benefits of better preparing students for college.
The ''value added'' model, promoted by the federal Race to the Top program and now used by school systems in the District of Columbia and other major cities, evaluates teachers based largely on student progress as measured by standardized tests. Test scores alone are unreliable, but used as one of multiple measures, they can provide useful information.
As teacher unions have weakened, seniority is no longer the sole basis for layoffs in many districts. In California, a Superior Court earlier this year ruled that layoffs in the Los Angeles school system should be spread out more equitably. Although the intent is admirable, the ruling opens the door to favoritism by principals. 
Teachers don't choose a career in the classroom for money, power or fame. What they want more than anything else is to make a difference in the lives of their students. They don't always succeed, but they deserve more than the unrelenting criticism they've endured since the accountability movement began.
WALT GARDNER Los Angeles, Aug. 30, 2011
The writer is a former teacher whose Reality Check blog is published in Education Week.
Readers React
I would not say that I have high hopes for the coming year. Two factors will make the coming year a difficult one for students and teachers.
The continuing economic crisis that has destabilized many families will have a negative impact on children and their ability to learn. Studies show that such serious nonschool factors have a much greater impact on children's learning than even the quality of their teachers.
The other problem is that when children -- all children -- arrive at school, there will be fewer resources to meet their needs. Budget cuts in most states have led to layoffs of teachers, cuts in course offerings, elimination of afterschool programs, increase in class size, fewer supplies, less pre-K education, less technology and so on. It will be a major challenge to maintain the status quo in school performance.
JOHN C. FAGER New York, Sept. 1, 2011
The writer is a retired high school teacher and former education columnist for The Daily News.
American teachers and principals are being forced to cope with a tangle of contradictory, expensive, politically motivated school reform policies. The hubris of the elite class of education policy makers boggles the mind. How dare they claim that sending hundreds of millions of public dollars to testing corporations and textbook publishers will transform our neighborhood schools into efficient, happy college prep machines?
This approach did not work as advertised when it was called No Child Left Behind. Instead of learning from bitter experience, our leaders plunge ahead with Race to the Top, which has states competing for education funds, and expensive and terrifying ''value added'' testing.
My advice to Mr. Gardner and to all who care about teachers and schoolchildren is to visit one neighborhood school, offer to help, show up every week, and invest your humility, knowledge and wisdom in helping one school become a little bit better. Small causes can produce large effects.
CHRISTOPHER M. CLARK Tempe, Ariz., Aug. 31, 2011
The writer is a research professor at the Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College, Arizona State University.
Like Mr. Gardner, I am a former teacher, and I believe that much of the criticism of teachers is very much deserved. I say that because as teacher pay has continued to decline in relative terms, the best and the brightest opt for other more lucrative fields. Therefore, our teacher-education institutions have to constantly lower their entry standards to get teaching candidates.
And it's not too difficult to find candidates who have less ambition to teach so much as they appreciate having two extended midyear vacations (winter and spring breaks) and the entire summer off while receiving a year's pay, rarely using that time to improve their teaching skills.
I wish Mr. Gardner's statement that what teachers ''want more than anything else is to make a difference in the lives of their students'' were true. But we get what we pay for, teachers included.
HERB WEINBERG Colorado Springs, Aug. 31, 2011
Mr. Gardner writes that teachers deserve more than unrelenting criticism, yet he thinks that the Common Core State Standards and ''value added'' evaluation are positive reforms. To me, they are direct insults to teachers, giving them even less control over the direction of their classrooms.
The standards and accountability movement incenses teachers because it suggests that those who have undergone rigorous educational training and spend the most time with students have no idea how best to educate them, and that governors and bureaucrats -- many of whom have not entered a classroom since they finished school decades earlier -- know best.
GEORGE DARDEN Atlanta, Aug. 31, 2011
The writer is a public school teacher.
In the absence of a national consensus on the primary purposes of K-12 education, it is presumptuous -- and unwise -- for a handful of politicians and academics to mandate a curriculum.
The most interesting and successful teachers and schools I know build their curriculum carefully to create a coherent intellectual experience for their students -- rather than follow someone else's bland prescription.
For example, I hope that in the coming week many kids along the East Coast will be exploring hurricanes, and I hope that next fall teachers will make use of the fact that it's an election year, regardless of what the curriculum designers have in mind.
If we have our eyes on both the particular class we're teaching as well as the particular ideas we're exploring, we can't map it all out ahead of time. And the route followed ought to be decided by teachers in the field -- not ''curriculum experts.''
DEBORAH MEIER Hillsdale, N.Y., Aug. 31, 2011
The writer is a former teacher and principal, winner of a MacArthur Fellowship and author of several books about education.
Mr. Gardner writes that giving principals the ability to hire and fire teachers based on performance rather than seniority ''opens the door to favoritism by principals.'' This misses the point that principals are also held accountable for their performance and are unlikely to get rid of an effective teacher in favor of a less effective teacher.
Recruiting and training good people to be good teachers is expensive. Therefore, any evaluation system needs to reward good teachers, help struggling teachers and remove demonstratively ineffective teachers. Identifying teachers at either end of the performance spectrum isn't too hard, but identifying and assisting the teachers in the middle who have the potential to be good teachers is the key to building better schools.
One approach is the Peer Assistance and Review system in the Montgomery County, Maryland, public schools, which uses experienced teacher panels to evaluate and assist new teachers and even recommend firing of teachers.
BRUCE KITCHEN Alexandria, Va., Aug. 31, 2011
Mr. Gardner states that standardized testing is not an adequate measure of teacher performance. I would ask him what other measurements can be used that don't impinge on the teacher's freedom to guide student learning.
National comparisons do seem inappropriate as they miss local environmental, language and cultural differences such as parental engagement and general attitudes to the value of education, but local comparisons are absolutely valid in determining relative teacher performance, especially over time. Should they not be the basis for determining promotion, compensation and even continued employment?
As a country, we invest considerable money in education, and the results, as we measure them, seem to indicate that we should be achieving more. I can't imagine a better source for innovative solutions than the teachers themselves, and as a parent, I'm excited to see what happens when the best teachers are retained, rewarded and celebrated for their ability to help students achieve their best performance without being hamstrung by factors such as seniority.
NEAL DONAHUE Belmont, Mass., Aug. 31, 2011
The constant bureaucratic initiatives to ''standardize'' education fail to recognize the diversity of children and attempt to create a one-size-fits-all model for teaching (with the goal of preparing all students for college, which fails to prepare a great number of students for the lives they will ultimately lead). These initiatives ignore the effects of dysfunctional families and poverty, and too often throw the burden on the shoulders of teachers without the necessary structural and financial supports.
I believe that the current round of educational reforms, which have few philosophical differences from the attempted reforms of the last decade, will ultimately fail because they are misguided. And we, as a nation, will have wasted another decade of precious time and resources, and another generation of children will enter the work force without the tools necessary to compete globally.
Today's teachers are ready and prepared to bestow those tools on today's youth. They just need realistic and sensible support from above, and the blame game directed at teachers needs to stop.
TOM FRENCH Massena, N.Y., Aug. 31, 2011
The writer is a middle school teacher.
Many teachers will begin this school year making less in salary and receiving fewer benefits than the year before. Continual public assault on teachers, a lack of materials and decreasing job security may motivate far fewer people to enter the profession. This is tragic, because there has never been a greater need for talented and resilient teachers.
I salute my fellow educators this fall and hope that soon school reform will be led by those who manage to teach algebra in 100-degree classrooms without the necessary materials, and yet their students leave that classroom engaged, empowered and, most important, educated.
COLIN HOGAN Metuchen, N.J., Aug. 31, 2011
The writer is a public school teacher.
The Writer Responds
It's understandable why many teachers, caught between the new demands of the reform movement and the sharp budget cuts that Mr. Fager notes, are not returning to school with enthusiasm.
Mr. Darden thinks the Common Core State Standards constitute ''direct insults to teachers.'' But some teachers welcome them.
''Reaching the Goal,'' a new study by the Educational Policy Improvement Center, found that instructors at two- and four-year colleges across the country strongly support the standards as a way to improve college readiness.
Regarding what causes teachers to either leave the field or avoid it, working conditions, including lack of professional autonomy, not the low pay cited by Mr. Weinberg, are the main reason for dissatisfaction, according to a study by the National Center for Education Statistics.
Although, as Mr. Kitchen writes, principals are held accountable for the performance of their teachers, ego and personal conflicts can affect their judgment. Several years ago the former principal of an elite high school in Brooklyn harassed even teachers with stellar records, resulting in the departure of several star teachers.
To Mr. Donahue's question about what other measures besides standardized test scores I would propose, I'd stress the importance of attitudes and values regarding the subject taught. These can be assessed by anonymous questionnaires. You can teach a subject well but teach students to hate the subject in the process.
Despite the formidable challenges, I continue to believe that teachers will rise to the occasion to do the best they can for their students.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Has Room For a Briton In Need of It

BYLINE: By NICOLE LAPORTE

 BODY:
''I HAVEN'T become a Bridezilla,'' Petra Ecclestone cooed languidly over the phone in her British accent. ''I think I've been really relaxed. That's just my personality.''
It was mid-August, and Ms. Ecclestone, the 22-year-old daughter of the Formula One Management chief executive Bernie Ecclestone (net worth $4.2 billion), was in London refining details of her $5 million wedding on Aug. 27 to James Stunt, an entrepreneur and a reputed party boy, that was in the same medieval castle where Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes were married. Among the highlights: a $130,000 Vera Wang gown, performances by Eric Clapton and Alicia Keys and white roses from France.
Outside, the city was burning and world financial markets were plummeting, but Ms. Ecclestone, who has long platinum locks and a Barbie doll figure, had work to do. Not only were there the dreaded seating arrangements to deal with (''All the politics, who's going to sit next to who,'' she said), but she was preparing for the introduction of her new handbag line, Stark, at New York Fashion Week.
''So it's really manic right now,'' she explained coolly. 
In London, Ms. Ecclestone is an heiress-about-town who pals around with princesses (Beatrice and Eugenie) and is known for her anti-recessionista tendencies. She collects Hermes Birkin bags, favors fur and Alaia frocks and lives in a $90-million Chelsea manor. But on these shores, her profile has been practically nonexistent until recently.
Last month, Ms. Ecclestone staged the media equivalent of a debutante ball when she paid a reported $85 million in cash for Candy Spelling's Holmby Hills mansion in Los Angeles. Built in 1991 by Ms. Spelling and her husband, the television producer Aaron Spelling (''Dynasty,'' ''Beverly Hills 90210''), the house, known as the Manor or Candyland, is like a Disney fairy tale dwelling, with 123 rooms, a bowling alley, gift-wrapping suites and a beauty salon and barbershop. With a listing price of $150 million, it was one of the most expensive homes in the country.
Why would a 22-year-old want to live in such decadence, not to mention in a neighborhood whose residents include Hugh Hefner?
''I didn't want a modern kind of house,'' Ms. Ecclestone said, describing the 57,000-square-foot Manor as ''homey and livable.''
''It was a great investment at the end of the day,'' she added, reasoning that she paid ''kind of half-price.'' (She said that the reported $85 million cost was incorrect, but implied that the number was ''around that region.'')
There are also her five miniature dogs to consider: ''It's important for them to be able to have space.''
Whatever her reasons, the fact that a common outsider was buying a notable, if often ridiculed, property from Hollywood royalty shook the Los Angeles real estate world and turned all eyes on Ms. Ecclestone. ABC News wanted an interview. Radar Online pitted her against Pippa Middleton for the title of British It-girl.
''I would say she was definitely making a statement,'' said Kurt Rappaport, a real estate agent and an owner of the Westside Estate Agency. ''Usually, the people who buy these properties you know, or they're people you've heard of. Certainly, her father's someone that would be in the first category. But she, in her own right, other than running around the nightclubs of the world and spending a lot of money, is not known in high net-worth real estate. People were very surprised.''
Not that Ms. Ecclestone is the first ritzy Briton to be drawn to the city. From Vivien Leigh to Peaches Geldof, Los Angeles has long exerted a pull on the British, who revel in its gardening-friendly weather, indifference to social class and admiration of an old-world accent (witness the recent celebrity fawning over the young, telegenic Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at a black-tie gala held downtown at the Belasco Theater in July).
Los Angeles is also the land of reinvention, and Ms. Ecclestone is hoping that the move will help her shed her image as ''The Girl Whose Full-Time Job is Spending Daddy's Billions,'' as one Daily Mail headline stated.
''My full-time job isn't just blowing my parents' money,'' she said, pointing out that she has her own charity, the Meningitis Trust, and has been working since she was 18, when she turned down a spot at Central Saint Martins, the prestigious art school in London, in order to start a men's wear line, Form.
The line, which was inspired by the auto racing fashions she grew up with at events like the Monaco Grand Prix, was short-lived because of the recession, Ms. Ecclestone said, but she's now back with her handbags.
''The men's wear was a great line, but I think this is so much more exciting for her and much more her,'' said Margot Zucco, Stark's managing director. ''For one thing, it's women's wear, and the brand is very sort of luxury but still young and cool, which Petra is.''
It's also somewhat more accessible, with prices in a range of $300 to $2,000 for demure clutches with provocative names (Lady of Pleasure, Infatuation). The bags come in both understated black and grays, and Easter-egg pinks and oranges, the brighter colors inspired by Ms. Ecclestone's favorite artist, Tracey Emin.
Ms. Ecclestone's expectations are also more modest than they were with Form, whose laurel-wreath logo she once predicted would be ''as recognizable as the Ralph Lauren pony.''
''I don't want to set my aims too high,'' she said. ''I know how hard fashion is, and how hard it is to break into the market. But I've got a really good feeling.''
Despite the reports in the British tabloids of late nights at Annabel's and Tramp, Ms. Ecclestone describes herself as a ''homebody'' who favors dinner with friends and family to the club scene. Her best friend is her older sister Tamara, 27, a lingerie model and television presenter who is filming a British reality show about her life. She is also close with her mother, Slavica, a former Armani model from Croatia, who divorced Bernie Ecclestone in 2009.
''I go to the occasional party, if it benefits my business, or it's a charity, or a friend's party, that's fine,'' Ms. Ecclestone said. ''But, I mean, it's not like I go to parties Monday to Friday. I'm not on the social scene, particularly.''
Still, she seems comfortable in the spotlight. In a YouTube video showing Ms. Ecclestone and Mr. Stunt emerging recently from Boa, a trendy restaurant in West Hollywood, Calif., the socialite banters playfully with the paparazzi as she takes her time sliding into a silver sports car. The couple, who will begin splitting their time between Los Angeles and London after their wedding, has also been seen at the Beacher's Madhouse nightclub in Hollywood with Paris Hilton, who is a friend. (Ms. Hilton's father, the real estate agent Rick Hilton, negotiated the purchase of the Manor for Ms. Ecclestone.) In April, The New York Post reported that Mr. Stunt spent $200,000 on Cristal at the club.
''James has calmed down considerably since we met,'' Ms. Ecclestone said. ''He goes out much less. Obviously, if we go out to clubs, he does order Champagne for his friends to drink. But he's completely teetotal.'' (Ms. Ecclestone doesn't drink either, she said, sketching a vision of herself as a consummate professional.
''At the end of the day, I see myself as a businesswoman,'' she said.

HEADLINE: My Kailua

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE DOWNES. 
LAWRENCE DOWNES is an editorial writer for The New York Times.

 BODY:
WALKING to the beach with my family on a hot Kailua afternoon, let's say 1972. My toy foam surfboard clip-clopping against my knees, towel scratching my neck, rubber slippers squeaking on steamy blacktop. Around the corner of Kuuala Street, across Kalaheo Avenue, then down the skinny beach path, hugging a cinderblock wall under a thick, shady row of octopus trees and bougainvillea. Footfalls echoing on packed dirt.
Coming out onto Kailua Bay. A field of impossible blue, sky down to water. Squinting in the brilliance of the broad, white crescent beach.
My father swimming, in long, lazy lines parallel to shore. My mother sitting on the sand. Me, pondering the choices: sand castles or sand balls -- wet double handfuls smooth-coated with dry sand into hard, sugar-dusted spheres; such a pity to have to whip one at your brother. 
Kailua. The guidebooks say it's basically a beach. But there's a town wrapped around the beach, and, around that, a whole other side of the 600-square-mile island of Oahu -- the windward side, a world away from Honolulu. Kailua is barely half an hour from downtown and Waikiki, but separated by a soaring ribbon of razorback mountains, the Koolau Range. The green lava wall is pierced near its summit by two sets of highway tunnels, like airlocks in time and space. The Honolulu side is dry and sunny, its postcard loveliness folded among high-rises, offices, airport and freeways. The Kailua side, where I grew up, is greener, quieter, lower and slower, with marshes and palms and that perfect bay.
The windward Oahu I know best is three communities: Kailua, Lanikai and their next-door country cousin, Waimanalo. They're beachy but not snooty. Kailua has a downtown but no night life to speak of. It's less a spot for touristic stimulation than a place you nestle into, as Hawaiian royalty once did, escaping dusty Honolulu since long before King Kamehameha's day.
Two Beatles, John and George, mobbed in Waikiki, fled there once, in 1964. They were discovered, and so, eventually, was Kailua, although it and the rest of windward Oahu have managed to keep a reasonably low profile on Hawaii's well-worn tourist map.
That may be changing, especially now that President Obama has claimed Kailua as his. He grew up in Honolulu, but Kailua is where he returns. This is his place called Hope, his San Clemente, his Texas hill country. Every winter the Obamas stay at the same rented house at one end of the crescent bay, whose waters he knows from boyhood, as he wrote in his memoir, ''Dreams From My Father'':
''I still remember how, one early morning, hours before the sun rose, a Portuguese man to whom my grandfather had given a good deal on a sofa set took us out to spear fish off Kailua Bay. A gas lantern hung from the cabin on the small fishing boat as I watched men dive into inky-black waters, the beams of their flashlights glowing beneath the surface until they emerged with a large fish, iridescent and flopping at the end of one pole. Gramps told me its Hawaiian name, humu-humu-nuku-nuku-apuaa, which we repeated to each other the entire way home.''
In this story, either Gramps or young Barack was mistaken, since the humuhumu is a little reef fish, barely six inches long. But let's give Gramps a break on his fish names, and allow Barack his childhood lens of magnified wonderment: Hawaiians do still fish here with spears and nets, often in darkness, and are done by dawn.
Kailua is the kind of little town that makes for good memories. It has the best Fourth of July parade in the state, where Uncle Sam in his long white beard salutes the crowd with the wrist-flicking, thumb-and-pinky shaka sign, and at night there are fireworks over the beach. It has farmers' markets, with local tomatoes, papaya, torch-ginger blossoms and bananas. The windward side has local fishermen, dancers, musicians, artists -- native Hawaiian families rooted there for generations, with names like Mahoe, Aluli and Pahinui. Like anywhere else in Hawaii, it has the all-American children of immigrants, descendants of the last century's plantation era.
Kailua gives people who know it a deep sense of belonging, of roots in the sand. I moved away 30 years ago, but get back every chance I get. My own rituals of return, habits of haunting an old beloved home, could just as easily be yours.
Whether you start from the Honolulu airport or Waikiki, leave the freeway at the Pali Highway exit, make the quick turn north for Nuuanu Valley, the steady climb, with the green, fluted mountain walls closing in, silvered with mist and plunging waterfalls when it rains. When highway builders, in the 1950s, reached the knife-edged Koolau summit, or pali, they punched tunnels through it and all but did away with the meandering mountain-goat path down the other side, with its treacherous winds and rock slides.
Go through the second tunnel and then, ladies and gentlemen: the windward side, lush terrain of old fishponds, streams, marshes, soft volcanic cinder cones and the blue, isle-dotted bay, all laid at your feet. You're looking down from a thousand-foot precipice, a view that dazzled Mark Twain. This is where, in 1795, King Kamehameha's army, invaders from the Big Island, pushed the army of Chief Kalanikupule to the pali's brink. The only way out was to plummet, which hundreds did. That victory gave Kamehameha dominion over all the Hawaiian islands. There is a lookout point and plaque recounting the historic battle.
This is also the site of a strange moment in Obama family lore. His memoir retells a story his mother and grandparents often told him, of how his father once grabbed a friend and playfully dangled him over the edge, where the poor man had just accidentally dropped and lost the elder Mr. Obama's pipe. The story was meant for Barack's amusement: That dad of yours; what a nut. When you stand at the same railing and look over the terrifying, wind-whipped abyss, you might have a different thought. Mine was: I'd have pressed charges.
Not every trip back to Kailua takes me to the Pali Lookout, but each one begins and ends on the beach. The first morning I'm up before dawn, easily. East Coast jet lag puts you in prime shape for Pacific sunrise viewing. Kailua is a morning town; the bay looks east and first light brings out runners and ambling couples with dogs and cups of coffee.
The waves have shrunk since I was a boy: I wonder why. But the rest is the same, as I confirmed again in an April visit with my family. The sand is still cottony and cool by the naupaka shrubs at the top of the beach, sloping down to firm wet velvet under the foam. The beach still wears a light seaweed fringe and is dotted with crab burrows every few feet, like a highly unimaginative mini-golf course.
Overhead, great frigatebirds, 'iwa in Hawaiian, still hover in the whipping trade winds. Past the gentle shorebreak, Flat Island lies off to the right, close-in, temptingly swimmable. Beyond them, the Mokulua islets, Moku Nui and Moku Iki: a kayak trip away. Girding the bay to the left, a humpbacked volcanic crater, the Mokapu Peninsula, looking like the snake that swallowed an elephant in ''The Little Prince.'' It's a marine base, off limits to most of us, and the president's vacation gym.
Even at 6 a.m. the water is bathtub warm; I lie on my back with my feet pointing at the Mokuluas, and the sun rises behind my toes.
I met a fisherman, Randal Akiona, just after sunrise that morning at Kailua Beach Park. He was camping with his family by the park's boat ramp. His wife, Tracey, read a book in the back of their truck while their girls played in the sand. Tourists were beginning to arrive for a day of kayaking, kite surfing and paddleboarding.
We talked about fishing, and of unemployment and homelessness, twin scourges of today's native Hawaiians. He told me where I could buy the green, red and yellow flag of the Hawaiian sovereignty movement, like the ones decorating his truck. He told me that the homeless man I had seen wading under a nearby canal bridge, his belongings lashed to two surfboards, was a guy he knew.
Later I got breakfast, papaya with lime, at my mom's; you can go to old Kalapawai Market, by the park entrance, for Kona coffee, bagels and the morning paper, The Star-Advertiser. Or you can take the short walk into downtown Kailua, which hasn't changed much in 50 years, though it's beginning to. Last year they closed Don Quijote, an odd Japanese department store and supermarket where you could get groceries, the seasoned raw fish dish known as poke, Okinawan liquor, rubber slippers, bamboo fishing poles, rice cookers and macadamia nuts. Now it's going to be a Target.
Still, there's plenty of local flavor in the farmers' markets, a little independent bookstore, homegrown places for art and antiques. The library, the Chinese and Vietnamese and pizza restaurants, the thrift shop with old muumuus, the public park, with swimming pool and ballfields, all say: this is a real town. Gentrification and tourists are creeping in. Go while you can.
Kailua was a thriving population center before European contact, a playground for chiefs and rich in farming and fish, thanks to its many freshwater streams and wetlands and placid bay. The huge fishponds and abundant banana, sweet potato and taro patches were mostly gone by the mid-19th century, replaced by cattle grazing and commercial development, but relics remain.
For a plunge into antiquity, you can visit Ulupo Heiau, a massive temple built by old Hawaiians, lava stone by stone, near the YMCA. Once it was neatly terraced with wooden altars and statues and sacrifices. The surviving platform, 150 feet by 140 feet with walls up to 30 feet high, is a staggering work of ancient hand-to-hand rock laying, perhaps 400 years old.
Ho'omaluhia Botanic Garden, at the foot of the pali, is richly replanted in native species. A long walk along the levee traverses Kawainui Marsh, a good birders' spot. BookEnds, a bookstore in Kailua Shopping Center, has an excellent section on Hawaiian history and guidebooks for bird- and fish-spotting.
At some point, you take your books and spend all day at the beach. Kailua Beach Park is the main visitor magnet, where you can picnic, rent kayaks and try kite surfing and paddleboards, long surfboards that you stand on, using a long-handled, wide-bladed paddle to push yourself calmly around the bay. The far right side ends in a rocky point, where children can chase skipping gobies and black crabs in the sharp-edged tidepools.
Mr. Obama's house is way on the other side of the bay, at 57-A Kailuana Place; you can drive by and gawk if the guard booth is empty. If Kailua Beach Park feels too crowded, with boats and boards buzzing all around you, Kalama Beach Park, up Kalaheo Avenue closer to the Obama side, is far quieter and more secluded, and the waves are bigger.
We didn't use much water-sports equipment when I was little. A day of swimming and body surfing was thrill enough, starting with slow edging into the water, all cold around the ankles and shins, down in the little wave-carved depression, up the other side, then up past the waist and then the choice -- whether to let the prickly chill work slowly up to your neck or just plunge in. Usually a wave decides for you; you dive under and the snap-sweep of the breaker pulls you upright, and you bob, chilled but ready for the next wave.
I wish we'd had kayaks back then -- I would have gone more often to Flat Island, a bird sanctuary, to watch out for the hatchlings and eggs. You can also swim the quarter-mile, or paddle on a surfboard. I wish even more that we'd had Island Snow. It's the shave-ice store near Kailua Beach Park where the president takes his girls. His flavors are supposedly lime, guava-orange and cherry. I prefer coconut, with sweetened azuki beans.
The park gets crowded on weekends, so it's time to head out to Waimanalo, a short drive into a more Hawaiian state of mind. Here you'll see houses flying the Hawaiian sovereignty flag, salving wounds unhealed since the overthrow of the kingdom in 1893. This is the rural town known to admirers of the late Gabby Pahinui, a master guitarist widely loved as the soul of Hawaiian music. In April I made a drive-by pilgrimage to his family home, a tidy wooden house on Bell Street where the best musicians in Hawaii once played backyard jams. Gabby's sons Martin, Cyril and James, known as Bla, carry on the music in their own ways, not usually together.
A Hawaiian music festival dedicated to Gabby takes place in Waimanalo every August, and is one of the best places to hear and feel the Hawaiian soul. ''Waimanalo Blues,'' a classic local song recorded many times, most memorably by Bla, is a lament for a lost and paved-over Hawaii. I listen for it on the radio when I'm back; it never takes too long before it comes up. The real Hawaii is there, if you look for it and listen; it lingers strongest where tourists don't notice, all along the windward side.
The best way to get the lay of the land is with a short, mildly strenuous hike to a ridgeline along a smooth-sloped cinder cone just above Lanikai. We park on a dead-end road beside Mid-Pacific Country Club, where Mr. Obama golfs, walk along a short stretch of private driveway (is it trespassing if a sign points you to the trail?) and then clamber up the mountainside.
The red-dirt trail starts out crumbly and steep. My daughter, Sophie, and her brother, Zak, have cameras out. My wife, Pat, and I trade off on the backpack with the water bottles. We all step aside to let an extreme runner keep his heart rate up. ''Excuse me,'' he says, each time he comes and goes and comes again.
It's a dry, hot hike, with cactus flowers and pili grass and butterflies. All the water is below you: Kaelepulu Stream, leading to the bay. Kawainui Marsh, the island's largest. The cobalt blue beyond the reef. We watch a tour group in yellow banana-shaped kayaks begin their assault on the Mokuluas, slow and calm. In winter you can sometimes see whales; these tourists are probably looking out for honu: green sea turtles.
We reach the summit, and the hulks of two concrete pillboxes, built in World War II as coastal lookouts. They're a good place to rest, drink, soak it all in. People climb here in darkness to see the sunrise, but we're a little late for that.
A last stop at the beach before the airport, a last gathering of those sensations of surf and warmth, of sun squinting and salt smell, to take home to the mainland with you. Mr. Obama's memoir says that when tourists used to watch him playing on the beach, staring rudely at the dark-skinned boy with the white mother and grandpa, Gramps would play a joke at their expense. He would whisper to them that the boy with the sand bucket was the great-grandson of King Kamehameha, conqueror of all the islands. The tourists would gawk and snap, and Gramps told little Barack that there were probably photos of him in scrapbooks all over the country.
I suspect some of those moments must have happened at Kailua Beach. In the Obama childhood snapshots I've seen, the waves look just right, Kailua-ish, frothier than at any of the ripply Honolulu beaches his mother and Gramps could have taken him to. Someday I hope to ask him.
IF YOU GO
Kailua has no hotels, but it has bed-and-breakfasts, many of them illegal. (A law banning unlicensed short-term rentals is widely flouted.) Try Pat's Kailua Beach Properties (808-262-4128; patskailua.com), for clean, legal lodgings close to Kailua Beach Park and Lanikai, from $100 to $600 a night.
The turnoff to Nuuanu Pali Lookout is well-marked by signs on the Pali Highway (Route 61 north from Honolulu). Enter Kailua Beach Park at the corner of Kailua Road and South Kalaheo Avenue. You'll see Kalapawai Market (306 South Kalaheo Avenue), good for snacks and souvenirs, and, across the street, Island Snow (130 Kailua Road), where President Obama takes his daughters for shave ice, and also
Kailua Sailboards and Kayaks (888-457-5737; kailuasailboards.com) for rentals and lessons.
Kalama Beach Park (248 North Kalaheo Avenue) is on the same bay. The Lanikai Pillbox Trail starts just beyond the entrance to Mid Pacific Country Club (266 Kaelepulu Drive). Park on Kaelepulu, walk up the road; trailhead signs are on the left. Ulupo Heiau is a short walk from the YMCA (1200 Kailua Road). There's good bird-watching and bicycling along the levee of Kawainui Marsh (enter from Kawainui Neighborhood Park, at the end of Kaha Street). Hoomaluhia Botanical Garden (45-680 Luluku Road, Kaneohe) is rich with native plants at the foot of the Koolau Mountains.
Downtown Kailua is highly walkable; you can get your bearings and take a break at BookEnds(600 Kailua Road), a bookstore with a good selection of Hawaiian titles. For flowers and produce, the People's Open Market is open on Thursdays from 7:15 to 8:15 a.m. at Waimanalo Beach Park (41-741 Kalanianaole Highway) and from 9 to 10 a.m. at Kailua District Park (21 South Kainalu Drive).
For breakfast, my mom likes Cinnamon's (315 Uluniu Street; 808-261-8724), but Crepes No Ka Oi (131 Hekili Street; 808-263-4088) and Moke's Bread and Breakfast (27 Hoolai Place; 808-261-5565) are good, too. For lunch, try Kalapawai Cafe (750 Kailua Road), Ohana Bar-BQ (16 Kainehe Street) or Keneke's in Waimanalo (41-685 Kalanianaole Highway; 808-259-9811). Agnes' Portuguese Bake Shop (46 Hoolai Street) has the best malasadas (Portuguese doughnuts). For dinner, try Buzz's Original Steak House (413 Kawailoa Road; 808-261-4661) or Saeng's Thai Cuisine (315 Hahani Street; 808-263-9727).

HEADLINE: Mistakes Were Made

BYLINE: By JONATHAN CHAIT. 
Jonathan Chait is a senior editor for The New Republic.

 BODY:
This has been the summer that liberal discontent with Obama has finally crystallized. The frustration has been simmering for a while -- through centrist appointments, bank bailouts and the defeat of the public option, to name a few examples. But it has taken the debt-ceiling standoff and the threat of a double-dip recession to create a leftist critique of the president that stuck.
Obama's image as a weakling and sellout on domestic issues now centers on his alleged resistance, from the very first days of his presidency, to do whatever was necessary to heal the economy. ''The truly decisive move that broke the arc of history,'' wrote the Emory professor Drew Westen in this newspaper, ''was his handling of the stimulus.'' Just as the conservative repudiation of George W. Bush boiled down to ''he spent too much,'' the liberal repudiation of Obama has settled on ''he didn't spend enough.'' 
There's truth in that. President Obama underestimated the depth of the crisis in 2009 and left himself with bad options in the event the economy failed to recover as quickly as he hoped. And yet the wave of criticism from the left over the stimulus is fundamentally flawed: it ignores the real choices Obama faced (and the progressive decisions he made) and wishes away any constraints upon his power.
The most common hallmark of the left's magical thinking is a failure to recognize that Congress is a separate, coequal branch of government consisting of members whose goals may differ from the president's. Congressional Republicans pursued a strategy of denying Obama support for any major element of his agenda, on the correct assumption that this would make it less popular and help the party win the 2010 elections. Only for roughly four months during Obama's term did Democrats have the 60 Senate votes they needed to overcome a filibuster. Moreover, Republican opposition has proved immune even to persistent and successful attempts by Obama to mobilize public opinion. Americans overwhelmingly favor deficit reduction that includes both spending and taxes and favor higher taxes on the rich in particular. Obama even made a series of crusading speeches on this theme. The result? Nada.
That kind of analysis, however, just feels wrong to liberals, who remember Bush steamrolling his agenda through Congress with no such complaints about obstructionism. Salon's Glenn Greenwald recently invoked ''the panoply of domestic legislation -- including Bush tax cuts, No Child Left Behind and the Medicare Part D prescription drug entitlement -- that Bush pushed through Congress in his first term.''
Yes, Bush passed his tax cuts -- by using a method called reconciliation, which can avoid a filibuster but can be used only on budget issues. On No Child Left Behind and Medicare, he cut deals expanding government, which the right-wing equivalents of Greenwald denounced as a massive sellout. Bush did have one episode where he tried to force through a major domestic reform against a Senate filibuster: his crusade to privatize Social Security. Just as liberals urge Obama to do today, Bush barnstormed the country, pounding his message and pressuring Democrats, whom he cast as obstructionists. The result? Nada, beyond the collapse of Bush's popularity.
Perhaps the oddest feature of the liberal indictment of Obama is its conclusion that Obama should have focused all his political capital on economic recovery. ''He could likely have passed many small follow-up stimulative laws in 2009,'' Jon Walker of the popular blog Firedoglake wrote last month. ''Instead, he pivoted away from the economic crisis because he wrongly ignored those who warned the crisis was going to get worse.''
It's worth recalling that several weeks before Obama proposed an $800 billion stimulus, House Democrats had floated a $500 billion stimulus. (Oddly, this never resulted in liberals portraying Nancy Pelosi as a congenitally timid right-wing enabler.) At the time, Obama's $800 billion stimulus was seen by Congress, pundits and business leaders -- that is to say, just about everybody who mattered -- as mind-bogglingly large. News reports invariably described it as ''huge,'' ''massive'' or other terms suggesting it was unrealistically large, even kind of pornographic. The favored cliche used to describe the reaction in Congress was ''sticker shock.''
Compounding the problem, Obama proposed his stimulus shortly after the Congressional Budget Office predicted deficits topping a trillion dollars. Even before Obama took office, and for months afterward, ''everybody who mattered'' insisted that the crisis required Obama to scale back the domestic initiatives he campaigned on, especially health care reform, but also cap-and-trade, financial regulation and so on. Colin Powell, a reliable barometer of elite opinion, warned in July of 2009: ''I think one of the cautions that has to be given to the president -- and I've talked to some of his people about this -- is that you can't have so many things on the table that you can't absorb it all. And we can't pay for it all.''
Rather than deploy every ounce of his leverage to force moderate Republicans, whose votes he needed, to swallow a larger stimulus than they wanted, Obama clearly husbanded some of his political capital. Why? Because in the position of choosing between the agenda he came into office hoping to enact and the short-term imperative of economic rescue, he picked the former. At the time, this was the course liberals wanted and centrists opposed.
On two subsequent occasions, Obama faced this same choice. Last December, he could have refused to extend any of the Bush tax cuts on income over $250,000. Republicans vowed to let all the tax cuts expire if he did so. If Obama let this happen, it would have almost fully solved the long-term deficit problem, while at the same time setting back the recovery by raising taxes on middle-class and low-income workers. Obama decided to make a deal, extending all the Bush tax cuts and also securing a progressive payroll tax cut and an extension of unemployment benefits, both forms of stimulus that Republicans would never have allowed without an extension of upper-bracket tax cuts in return.
There is a decent argument that the president should have refused this deal. But if you make that argument, you have to accept the likelihood that nearly a million fewer jobs would have been created and that we would have been at risk of a double-dip recession back then. Yet the liberal critics most exercised about Obama's failure to secure more stimulus were, for the most part, enraged when he did exactly that. Take Robert Reich, the former secretary of labor under President Clinton. Last November, Reich pleaded for an extension of unemployment benefits, calling the plight of the jobless our ''single newest and biggest social problem.'' When Obama made his bargain, Reich called it ''an abomination,'' complaining that ''the bits and pieces the president got in return'' -- including the unemployment benefits previously deemed vital -- amounted to ''peanuts.''
And then, this summer, Obama let the G.O.P. hold the debt-ceiling vote hostage to extract spending cuts. I think he should have called the Republicans' bluff and let them accept the risk of a financial meltdown. But the reason Obama chose to cut a deal is that calling their bluff might have resulted in catastrophe. And Obama made a point of back-loading the G.O.P.'s budget cuts so as not to contract the economy. He may have chosen wrongly, but he chose exactly the priorities liberals now insist he ignored -- favoring economic recovery over long-term goals.
Liberal critics of Obama, just like conservative critics of Republican presidents, generally want both maximal partisan conflict and maximal legislative achievement. In the real world, those two things are often at odds. Hence the allure of magical thinking.

HEADLINE: In Schools, Perry Shuns Federal Influence

BYLINE: By MORGAN SMITH. 
msmith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
In May, during the waning days of the 82nd Legislature, Gov. Rick Perry made a rare trip to the Senate chamber to broker a deal.
Negotiators from the House and the Senate were struggling to cobble together a school finance plan that would slash state financing, integral to closing a multibillion-dollar shortfall in the state's 2012-13 budget. After about 90 minutes, Mr. Perry emerged from the closed-door meeting to tell reporters he felt ''very optimistic'' that lawmakers would reach an agreement.
Shortly, they did, agreeing to a change in the way the state allocates money to its schools that, in practical terms, meant a historic reduction of $4 billion in financing and an additional $1.4 billion cut in discretionary grants for public education.
How the budget will affect the state's public schools will be a cornerstone of Mr. Perry's legacy and could influence his fate as a presidential candidate. But he is likely to be remembered most for a far more public battle: staving off the federal government's influence -- and sometimes its dollars -- from invading Texas classrooms. 
When Secretary of Education Arne Duncan jabbed Mr. Perry on public schools in mid-August, it was only the latest skirmish between the governor and the Obama administration since late 2009, when Mr. Perry announced that the state would not sign on to common core-curriculum standards. Those criteria, though endorsed by the Obama administration, were developed by a consortium of 48 states and the National Governors Association.
The announcement was quickly followed by news that Texas would not participate in the administration's signature education program, a competition among states for $4.35 billion in grants, because of its emphasis on the adoption of the common curriculum. Texas public schools were eligible for $700 million through the grants.
''I am not prepared to sell control of our state's education system for any price,'' Mr. Perry said in January 2010. The common curriculum, he said, could lead to the ''dumbing down'' of the state's standards.
Mr. Perry's disdain for the federal government's role in public education, along with legal challenges to the Environmental Protection Agency and the federal heath care overhaul, fit neatly into his anti-Washington primary campaign against Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, who challenged him for the 2010 Republican nomination for governor. It can now also be seen as a preamble to his presidential run.
But unlike his positions on health care and environmental regulations, widely shared among conservatives, Mr. Perry's early opposition to the administration's education policies -- whose bipartisan backers include former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida -- make him something of an ideological outlier among Republicans.
Of his fellow presidential contenders, Mr. Perry ''probably has the most fully formed vision of what he would like the federal role to be'' in education, said Rick Hess, the director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization.
If Mr. Perry wins the nomination, Mr. Hess said, it could make public education more important in the general election. Proposals like the common core standards could suddenly become politically charged.
''What's going to happen is that prominent Republicans broadly supportive of Obama in education may be forced to choose a side,'' he said. ''Rather than remaining as reforms that both Republicans and Democrats can embrace, these things could be poisoned by association.''
Though federal issues have lately dominated Mr. Perry's discourse on education, in earlier years he actively backed education proposals popular among conservatives, like incentive pay for teachers and private school vouchers, with mixed success.
Vouchers failed several times to make it through the Legislature -- proving politically lethal for Kent Grusendorf, chairman of the House Public Education Committee, who strongly supported them -- and eventually lost momentum. The ''last grasp'' at passing a voucher program, said Senator Leticia Van de Putte, a San Antonio Democrat who opposed it, was in the 2007 legislative session.
When incentive pay also struggled for passage in the Legislature, Mr. Perry set up the state's first statewide program with an executive order in 2005. It earmarked $10 million in federal money for teachers who had shown progress with students in economically disadvantaged school districts over three years. Lawmakers expanded it in 2006 only to discontinue it 2009 after a three-year study commissioned by the Texas Education Agency found it had little effect on student achievement.
The problem, said Lori Taylor, a researcher at Texas A&M University, who was a co-author of the studies, was not with the concept of incentive pay but in the way the program implemented it, with every school choosing its own design. That meant that districts could, if they wanted, use the money to give every teacher an across-the-board raise regardless of student achievement -- and that is what many of them did.
The state's current incentive pay program fared better in its evaluation, but because the gains were so small among schools, it wasn't ''wholly persuasive,'' said Ms. Taylor. It's unlikely there will be a follow-up, Ms. Taylor said, because very little financing for the program survived the Legislative session.
Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for Mr. Perry, said in an e-mail that while the teacher incentive program was affected by the budget, it ''remains a priority.''
''The governor understands that we faced considerable budget challenges this last session,'' Ms. Frazier said. ''No agency was spared from reductions in spending, but ultimately he is proud of lawmakers' tough decisions to keep Texas living within its means without raising taxes.''
The governor has exerted influence through his appointments to the Texas Education Agency and the State Board of Education, where he has consistently picked from the board's faction of evangelical conservatives.
Mr. Perry has also not been afraid to use -- or let lawmakers know he was inclined to use, should they push him -- his veto pen. In 2009, he killed bipartisan legislation that would have required limits on class size and offered full-day programs in state kindergarten. In his veto statement, he said the money was better used to serve more children under the state's current half-day program than to create an additional program.
During the last legislative session, the governor opposed a bill that would have changed how end-of-course exams were factored into graduation requirements under the state's new accountability system. His office made it clear that if the measure passed, it would be subject to a veto, said Andrew C. Erben, of the Texas Institute for Education Reform, a business-oriented education advocacy group.
''While he and his staff weren't out front saying it's a horrible bill, they let it be known they did not support it,'' Mr. Erben said.
Mr. Perry was more publicly adamant in his promise that he would not sign a budget that used the state's Rainy Day Fund, a tactic that many called for to help ease deep cuts to public education. Lawmakers took him seriously, as was apparent during discussion between two House Republicans on an amendment that became one of the last efforts to use the money to help public schools.
''Is it possible,'' Representative Van Taylor of Plano said, ''if the amendment stayed in that the governor might veto the bill?''
Representative Phil King of Weatherford replied, ''Well, my impression of Governor Perry is that he usually does what he says that he's going to do.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Candidates Turn Attention To One Another

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
INDIANOLA, Iowa -- Gov. Rick Perry is privately being coached to come across as more presidential -- cautious in his comments, deliberate in defending his Texas record -- while building on his fast start by trying to consolidate support across the Republican spectrum, from the Tea Party and evangelicals to the party establishment.
Former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts is steeling for a long and combative fight for the Republican nomination, dropping his front-runner's strategy and preparing to confront Mr. Perry on immigration, his quarter-century in government and his claims of creating jobs in Texas.
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota is working to shatter the notion that the race is becoming a two-person contest, scaling back her campaign appearances to study Mr. Perry's spending record in Texas in an effort to raise skepticism about his candidacy among Tea Party supporters. 
The Republican field is entering a pivotal stage in the nominating contest as candidates increasingly move beyond criticizing President Obama and start to run against one another.
The outcome of three debates in the next three weeks -- starting Wednesday night, the first time Mr. Perry, Mr. Romney and Mrs. Bachmann will face one another -- will influence fund-raising, shape strategy and set perceptions as the candidates hurtle toward the start of voting early next year.
In both parties, there is now a sense that the president's political frailty, underscored by the report on Friday that showed zero net job creation in August and new projections that unemployment will remain elevated through Election Day next year, is even greater than it appeared at the start of the summer, injecting additional energy and urgency into the Republican primary race.
While many Democrats once hoped that perceived deficiencies among the Republican contenders could provide a lifeline to Mr. Obama, the prospect of losing the presidency is no longer summarily dismissed by his advisers.
With so much at stake, the lineup of candidates remains unsettled. Sarah Palin signaled during a weekend swing through Iowa and New Hampshire that she might still jump in, declaring, ''There's room for more.''
In an appearance here Saturday afternoon, Ms. Palin made clear that she had no intentions of simply falling in line behind one of the party's leading candidates. She urged voters to scrutinize Republican contenders, striking a populist tone as she warned against ''crony capitalism'' in both parties.
''Our challenge is not just to replace Obama in 2012,'' Ms. Palin said. ''But the real challenge is who and what we will replace him with?''
At the same time, there remains a debate within the party about whether the candidates are moving too far right in pursuit of their most ideologically committed voters, and about how to balance principles against the assumption that winning the White House requires the ability to appeal to centrist voters. In recent weeks, former Gov. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. of Utah has been making the case for moderation, attracting new attention.
''Republicans have to nominate someone better than the person they want to defeat,'' said Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor and 2008 presidential candidate. ''If they get so adamant that they will only support a candidate that believes everything on their checklist, they will re-elect Obama.''
There are interwoven crosscurrents coursing through the field, but Mr. Perry, who has reshaped the race since declaring his candidacy three weeks ago, is at the center of nearly every Republican strategy.
He is courting fund-raisers and reassuring potential supporters that he can withstand the intense scrutiny accompanying his new prominence, even as he scrambles to drain establishment support from Mr. Romney and erode enthusiasm for Mrs. Bachmann among Christian conservatives.
He invited a group of contributors to the Barton Creek Resort and Spa outside Austin, Tex., last week for a political briefing and dinner. One participant said the governor reassured his guests that he ''could take a punch and land a punch'' and survive the glare of a presidential spotlight.
He convened a separate meeting with evangelical leaders, where attendees told The Texas Tribune that Mr. Perry said, ''There is nothing in my life that will embarrass you if you decide to support me for president.''
His advisers are working with him on softening his language to avoid statements like the one that gained attention last month when he suggested the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, would get ''ugly'' treatment if he visited Texas. His aides, an all-Texas team, had grown accustomed to such comments over the last decade and were taken aback by the criticism, but are now instructing him to avoid questions that could provoke a pointed response or to deflect situations with humor.
He is devising answers to critiques of his Texas record and things he has written about in his books, studying foreign policy briefing papers and holding mock debating sessions. His performance, which is being carefully watched by Republicans, will set the tone for the fall.
''We don't need a nominee who's going to blur the differences between themselves and Barack Obama,'' Mr. Perry said Saturday during a stop in New Hampshire. ''We're going to have a nominee who draws a clear contrast.''
The string of debates will allow candidates to introduce themselves to a wider audience, even as they try to shape perceptions of one another. The primary channel of negative campaigning at this stage is shaping up to be outside groups that have multiplied since a Supreme Court ruling last year allowed groups to accept unlimited money and promote candidates.
In South Carolina, a group called Keep Conservatives United, which supports Mrs. Bachmann, opened the volley last week by questioning Mr. Perry's credentials as a fiscal conservative. ''He's supposed to be the Tea Party guy?'' the advertisement asks.
The advertisements, along with the rising tenor of the candidates' own words, provide a window into how they are preparing to challenge one another.
Interviews with a dozen advisers, including those inside campaigns and those aligned with outside groups, show lines of attack likely to emerge in the coming weeks.
For Mr. Romney, rivals are fixated on the health care bill he signed as Massachusetts governor and his 1994 Senate race against Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, where the two shared views on many issues, which are at odds with his positions today.
For Mr. Perry, rivals are already reminding voters of his time as a Democrat -- he switched parties two decades ago -- and his record as Texas governor. In 2007, he tried to require girls to receive vaccinations against a virus that can lead to cervical cancer.
The plan enraged many conservatives who saw it as an unwarranted intrusion by government and a bow to sexual promiscuity. He ultimately dropped the effort and apologized, telling a Des Moines radio station, ''I don't always get it right.''
While Mr. Romney's position as an early leader in the race has been shaken by Mr. Perry, it will almost certainly not be Mr. Romney who engages Mr. Perry first. He is already the subject of criticism from other rivals, including former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who questions Mr. Perry's credentials.
''We'll see how conservative Rick Perry really is,'' Mr. Santorum said.
Here in Iowa, where the caucuses start the nominating contest, Mr. Perry is placing a high priority on the state. Mr. Romney is planning to decide how aggressively to compete here based on three factors: whether Mrs. Bachmann can show she has staying power, whether Mr. Perry continues to gain strength and needs to be stopped, and if Ms. Palin runs. A Romney adviser said the campaign was prepared to ''play heavily and hard if our strategy dictates it.''
While Mr. Romney has significantly stepped up his campaign efforts in response to Mr. Perry, advisers said he was considerably more reserved and less prone to panicky shifts in strategy than four years ago. The fact that he is on his second presidential run, aides said, is among his biggest attributes.
''This is going to be a long, drawn-out primary,'' said Gov. David Heineman of Nebraska, a supporter of Mr. Romney. ''Mitt has been through this before. That's a significant asset.''

HEADLINE: Stung by the President on Air Quality, Environmentalists Weigh Their Options

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
For environmental groups, it was the final hard slap that brought a long-troubled relationship to the brink.
In late August, the State Department gave a crucial go-ahead on a controversial pipeline to bring tar sands oil from Canada to the Gulf Coast. Then on Friday, leading into the holiday weekend, the Obama administration announced without warning that it was walking away from stricter ozone pollution standards that it had been promising for three years and instead sticking with Bush-era standards.
John D. Walke, clean air director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group based in New York, likened the ozone decision to a ''bomb being dropped.'' 
Mr. Walke and representatives of other environmental groups saw the president's actions as brazen political sellouts to business interests and the Republican Party, which regards environmental regulations as job killers and a brick wall to economic recovery.
The question for environmentalists became, what to do next?
''There is shock and chaos here,'' Mr. Walke said, ''so I do not know. I can't answer that question.'' But he added that his group would resume a smog lawsuit against the government that it had dropped because it had been lulled into believing that this administration would enact tougher regulations without being forced to do so by the courts.
Political analysts watching the Obama administration's pullback from the environmental agenda this past month say that in the current climate there is little chance that environmentalists or their allies will ever side with the Republicans. After all, the Republican-led House of Representatives has been aggressively moving to curtail protections for endangered species and regulations for clean air and water, and most of the Republican presidential candidates have been intensely critical of any government effort to address climate change.
Still, they say, the president could face political repercussions in subtler but nevertheless corrosive ways: from losing volunteer enthusiasm to tying up his allies in fights with him instead of with his enemies.
''Energy from part of the base will now be directed at communicating with the White House and not with the public about the administration's record,'' said Daniel J. Weiss, director of climate strategy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group with close ties to the White House.
And Justin Ruben, executive director of MoveOn.org, a five-million-member online progressive political organization that played a significant role in President Obama's election in 2008, said he was sure that his members would be deflated.
''How are our members in Ohio and Florida who pounded the pavement in 2008 going to make the case for why this election matters?'' Mr. Ruben said. ''Stuff like this is devastating to the hope and passion that fuels the volunteers that made the president's 2008 campaign so unique and successful.''
Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication, who does extensive work on public perception and the environment, said the real threat to the president's reputation stemming from the ozone decision went far beyond environmentalists.
''It could play into an emerging narrative in his own party that he is caving too quickly to Republican pressure,'' Dr. Leiserowitz said. ''It is a dangerous narrative in your own base because it cuts down on enthusiasm and it is a narrative that his opponents will pick up on.''
In fact, it is a lesson that some environmental groups have already learned, and they are preparing to act accordingly.
''I think that two-plus years into Obama's presidency is more than enough time for him to have established a clear weak record,'' said Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, which has been battling the president on endangered species.
''The environmental movement needs to keep piling the pressure on and realizing playing nicey-nice won't work,'' Mr. Suckling said, adding that more public actions and lawsuits are the way to get Mr. Obama's attention.
His is not the only group going this way, but so far it is unclear that protests are being heard.
All last week across the street from the White House, Bill McKibben, a founder of 350.org, a grass-roots organization that advocates limiting carbon emissions, staged demonstrations to protest the Keystone XL pipeline, which would bring the tar sands oil from Canada.
As of Friday, Mr. McKibben said, more than a thousand people had been arrested in the previous days of protest, including Obama campaign staff members from 2008. Yet, he said of the White House, ''we heard not one word from them.''
One of those former campaign workers who was arrested was Courtney Hight, who was the youth vote director in Florida in 2008. She offered an explicit warning: ''If the president decides not to permit the pipeline, he will reignite the enthusiasm many of my friends and I felt in 2008. But if he approves it, it is just human nature that the disappointment will sap the enthusiasm that drove us to work so hard last time.''

HEADLINE: One And Done?

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
ONE day during the 2008 campaign, as Barack Obama read the foreboding news of the mounting economic and military catastrophes that W. was bequeathing his successor, he dryly remarked to aides: ''Maybe I should throw the game.''
On the razor's edge of another recession; blocked at every turn by Republicans determined to slice him up at any cost; starting an unexpectedly daunting re-election bid; and puzzling over how to make a prime-time speech about infrastructure and payroll taxes soar, maybe President Obama is wishing that he had thrown the game. 
The leader who was once a luminescent, inspirational force is now just a guy in a really bad spot.
His Republican rivals for 2012 have gone to town on the Labor Day weekend news of zero job growth, using the same line of attack Hillary used in 2008: Enough with the big speeches! What about some action?
Polls show that most Americans still like and trust the president; but they may no longer have faith that he's a smarty-pants who can fix the economy.
Just as Obama miscalculated in 2009 when Democrats had total control of Congress, holding out hope that G.O.P. lawmakers would come around on health care after all but three senators had refused to vote for the stimulus bill; just as he misread John Boehner this summer, clinging like a scorned lover to a dream that the speaker would drop his demanding new inamorata, the Tea Party, to strike a ''grand'' budget bargain, so the president once more set a trap for himself and gave Boehner the opportunity to dis him on the timing of his jobs speech this week.
Obama's re-election chances depend on painting the Republicans as disrespectful. So why would the White House act disrespectful by scheduling a speech to a joint session of Congress at the exact time when the Republicans already had a debate planned?
And why is the White House so cocky about Obama as a TV draw against quick-draw Rick Perry? As James Carville acerbically noted, given a choice between watching an Obama speech and a G.O.P. debate, ''I'd watch the debate, and I'm not even a Republican.''
The White House caved, of course, and moved to Thursday, because there's nothing the Republicans say that he won't eagerly meet halfway.
No. 2 on David Letterman's Top Ten List of the president's plans for Labor Day: ''Pretty much whatever the Republicans tell him he can do.''
On MSNBC, the anchors were wistfully listening to old F.D.R. speeches, wishing that this president had some of that fight. But Obama can't turn into F.D.R. for the campaign because he aspires to the class that F.D.R. was a traitor to; and he can't turn into Harry Truman because he lacks the common touch. He has an acquired elitism.
MSNBC's Matt Miller offered ''a public service'' to journalists talking about Obama -- a list of synonyms for cave: ''Buckle, fold, concede, bend, defer, submit, give in, knuckle under, kowtow, surrender, yield, comply, capitulate.''
And it wasn't exactly Morning in America when Obama sent out a mass e-mail to supporters Wednesday under the heading ''Frustrated.''
It unfortunately echoed a November 2010 parody in The Onion with the headline, ''Frustrated Obama Sends Nation Rambling 75,000-Word E-Mail.''
''Throughout,'' The Onion teased, ''the president expressed his aggravation on subjects as disparate as the war in Afghanistan, the sluggish economic recovery, his live-in mother-in-law, China's undervalued currency, Boston's Logan Airport, and tort reform.''
You know you're in trouble when Harry Reid says you should be more aggressive.
If the languid Obama had not done his usual irritating fourth-quarter play, if he had presented a jobs plan a year ago and fought for it, he wouldn't have needed to elevate the setting. How will he up the ante next time? A speech from the space station?
Republicans who are worried about being political props have a point. The president is using the power of the incumbency and a sacred occasion for a political speech.
Obama is still suffering from the Speech Illusion, the idea that he can come down from the mountain, read from a Teleprompter, cast a magic spell with his words and climb back up the mountain, while we scurry around and do what he proclaimed.
The days of spinning illusions in a Greek temple in a football stadium are done. The One is dancing on the edge of one term.
The White House team is flailing -- reacting, regrouping, retrenching. It's repugnant.
After pushing and shoving and caving to get on TV, the president's advisers immediately began warning that the long-yearned-for jobs speech wasn't going to be that awe-inspiring.
''The issue isn't the size or the newness of the ideas,'' one said. ''It's less the substance than how he says it, whether he seizes the moment.''
The arc of justice is stuck at the top of a mountain. Maybe Obama was not even the person he was waiting for.

HEADLINE: In Iowa, Palin Hints at Faults in Field

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
INDIANOLA, Iowa -- Sarah Palin did not say whether she would seek the Republican presidential nomination, but she made clear during a speech here on Saturday that she has no intentions of simply falling into line behind one of the party's leading candidates.
At times she sounded like a candidate. At times she did not. 
But in a 40-minute speech before a Tea Party rally here, which was one of her most expansive addresses since she accepted the Republican vice presidential nomination three years ago, she railed against ''crony capitalism'' in both parties. She suggested that the ''permanent political class'' -- Republicans, too -- needed to be rattled.
''You know that it's not enough to just change up the uniform,'' Ms. Palin said. ''If we don't change the team and the game plan we won't save our country.''
Her appearance at a Tea Party of America rally drew about 2,000 people on a rainy afternoon. A persistent downpour turned the grounds of the National Balloon Classic Field about 20 miles south of Des Moines into a soggy and muddy mess, but that did not deter the crowd from sitting outdoors for several hours to await her arrival.
In her speech, Ms. Palin assailed the Washington establishment, directing most of her criticism at President Obama, but saving plenty for Republicans. The themes carried familiar strains from her time as governor of Alaska, when she was known for an independent streak that aggravated both parties. ''The real challenge is who and what we will replace him with,'' Ms. Palin said, referring to her goal of making Mr. Obama a one-term president. She added, ''America is at a tipping point. This is a systemic crisis due to failed policies and incompetent leadership.''
She outlined economic proposals for creating jobs, including the elimination of all federal corporate income taxes. She said the cozy relationship between political contributions and government favors needed to be exposed and eliminated.
Ms. Palin criticized career politicians. She did not mention any candidates by name, but her aides have quietly pushed back against the conventional wisdom that she was considering endorsing Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. She said that it was not enough simply to replace Mr. Obama with an ordinary Republican administration.
''You must vet a candidate's record,'' Ms. Palin said, delivering an admonition to a crowd that traveled here from Iowa and points across the country. ''You must know their ability to successfully reform and actually fix problems that they are going to claim that they inherited.''
In a brief exchange with reporters as she shook hands, signed autographs and posed for pictures for more than 30 minutes after her speech, she smiled and did not answer when asked if her comments were directed at Mr. Perry.
''I want all of our GOP candidates to take the opportunity to kill corporate capitalism that is leading to this cronyism that is killing our economy,'' Ms. Palin said. ''They all have an opportunity to speak out against it. That's what I want them to do.''
Her comments suggested that she intended to play a role in the Republican nominating contest -- and the general election -- regardless of whether she is a candidate. Asked whether she would be letting her supporters down if she didn't enter the race, she said: ''Oh, these are such nice people.''
The rally took on the feel of a Palin reunion, with conservative bloggers and activists from across the country traveling to Iowa. A random sampling of conversations with people in the crowd found supporters who had driven from Alabama, Maryland, Texas, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania, New York and Wisconsin.
Ron Dahlberg, who owns a real estate company in Wisconsin, said he left his home at 2 a.m. for the 387-mile trip to Indianola. He came to the rally to show his support for Ms. Palin and hoped that she would join the presidential race. He said he was infuriated at Republican Party leaders for not backing her candidacy.
''Has there ever been a person of her stature that they have told not to run?'' Mr. Dahlberg said. ''They are afraid of her. If she wins, it will change the dynamic in the country. Women of all kinds will support her.''
In her speech, she drew laughs when she said that neither her message nor her political plans would be driven by public opinion polls. She said with a smile: ''Polls -- they're for strippers and cross-country skiers.''
She took a gentle swipe at Republican pundits who have admonished her to stay out of the presidential race. She did not directly name Karl Rove, the chief strategist to George W. Bush, but her point was made clear by the crowd's applause.
''I don't hire those political advisers, just so they say something nice about me on TV,'' Ms. Palin said. ''Like you, I'm not for sale.''
Her Labor Day weekend schedule also includes an appearance on Monday at a Tea Party rally in New Hampshire. With deadlines looming to raise money, build a campaign organization and start the process of collecting signatures to get her name on the ballot, she has said that she likely intends to make a decision by late September.
''I'm still not ready to make any kind of an announcement,'' Ms. Palin told Tthe Des Moines Register on Saturday. ''I'm still trying to figure it out -- if it's the right thing to do.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Pass, Fail and Politics

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
IT'S a foolish question, asking how smart a politician is.
It's too vague. It ignores all the different wrinkles of intelligence and ways to measure it, along with the debatable link between brain power as it's typically defined and skilled governance in terms of actual results. It's a vessel for prejudices, a stand-in for grievances.
And yet it comes back around almost every election cycle, as it's doing now.
Meet Rick Perry. At Texas A&M University, his grades were so poor he was on academic probation. He flunked advanced organic chemistry, which, in his defense, sounds eminently flunkable. He got a C in animal breeding, which doesn't. For a ''principles of economics'' course, he attained a glittering D, as The Huffington Post detailed. You won't be hearing him mention that much amid all his talk about Texas jobs creation. 
His academic background, coupled with his rejection of climate change and fondness for gauzy generalities, prompted a story in Politico last week with this subtle headline: ''Is Rick Perry Dumb?''
Based on grades alone, it seems so. But by that yardstick, even a politician as outwardly cerebral as Al Gore has some explaining to do. Gore got his very own college D -- in a course about man's place in nature, no less. Granted, this was at Harvard. But still.
Perry can't dazzle in policy discussions. That's also clear. The farther he ventures from Texas, the smaller he shrinks. When the radio talk show host Laura Ingraham recently tried to get him to say something specific -- anything specific -- about how America should deal with China, he clung so tightly to banalities that she was forced twice to plead: ''What does that mean?''
But he's savvy enough to have assembled a political team and adopted a political strategy that have him leading the (flawed) Republican field in a raft of recent polls. There's something to that. Something more than excellent hair.
I'm less troubled by how thickheaded Perry may be than by how wrongheaded we already know he is on issues like evolution, which he says is just a theory, and homosexuality, which he has likened to alcoholism.
President Obama has those issues right. And can talk authoritatively about them and most others. A former editor of the Harvard Law Review, he has that kind of mind, that kind of fluency. In this one poised man, erudition and eloquence join hands.
But they don't save him. Last week, he set himself up once again to look like the nation's deferrer in chief by proposing a date for his jobs speech that had the possibility of provoking Republican opposition and did precisely that, at which point he retreated. Is this the Mother-May-I presidency? With John Boehner in the role of paddle-wielding matriarch?
That many Republicans will viciously seize any opportunity to defy and undercut Obama is a lesson he should have learned by now. Regardless of who was being unreasonable, it was he who actually ended up sending an e-mail to supporters with the one-word subject line ''frustrated.'' The president of the United States is supposed to salve our frustrations, not meekly bemoan his own.
Shouldn't he or someone in his inner circle have foreseen the potential for events unfolding in such a humiliating fashion and made sure to avoid it? Apparently no one did, and that suggests a deficit of smarts by almost any definition of that ludicrously imprecise term.
Worse yet, this was only the latest in a long series of questionable calculations. Was it smart/prudent/pick-your-adjective to lavish all that precious post-election political capital on health care reform rather than economic revitalization and jobs creation, especially if it winds up being the first in a chain of dominoes that leads to defeat in 2012 and the repeal of that precise legislation?
Was it smart/prudent/pick-your-adjective not to head off a debt-ceiling showdown by settling the matter during last year's lame-duck session of Congress, before Republicans took the reins in the House? And, during the showdown, didn't Obama and his advisers misjudge both the zeal of some House Republicans and the magnitude of his own powers of persuasion?
Time and again, Obama hasn't been a prescient or brutal enough tactician and hasn't adjusted his high-minded ways to the low-minded sport of Congressional politics. That's a failure of some kind, and intelligence may be one word for it.
''Is Obama Smart?'' the Wall Street Journal columnist Bret Stephens asked in early August. That was the headline, and it's at least as good a question, in terms of the president's political efficacy of late, as the one Politico posed about Perry.
THAT Perry's headline contained the harsher adjective -- ''dumb'' -- is typical, say many Republicans, who complain that journalists tend to equate the anti-intellectualism and populist affects of many of their party's candidates with outright stupidity. They cite Ronald Reagan as an example of someone first dismissed as a dunce and understood only later to be wise in some basic, consequential ways.
And they say that Democrats get a greater pass on gaffes than Republicans do. There's merit to the argument. The recent verbal hiccup with which Joe Biden seemed to endorse China's one-child policy lengthened a formidable list of Bidenisms, including his statement in 2007 that Obama, as a presidential contender, was ''the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean.'' But Biden's intelligence is seldom questioned, not the way it would be if he had a Tea Party affiliation and Southern drawl.
Then there's the whole matter of whether we're well served by a brainy president. In an excellent piece in Slate in 1999, Jacob Weisberg explored a growing body of thought that a president's supposed brilliance (or lack thereof) has no bearing on success in office. By this theory, relatively ordinary smarts yielded extraordinary accomplishment (Reagan, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman) while extreme intelligence led to defeat (Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, Herbert Hoover).
Weisberg rightly noted the huge flaws with this analysis, including the small sample size and the subjectivity involved in judging achievement. Here's another: what makes Carter more brilliant than Roosevelt -- or, for that matter, Reagan?
That assessment reflects a narrow, traditional understanding of smarts as a sort of academic aptitude, a facility with facts and language. But a whole genre of best-selling books over the last decade and a half insist -- correctly, I think -- that there are various ways to be clever: ''Emotional Intelligence,'' ''The Wisdom of Crowds,'' a knack for gut responses formed in the span of a ''Blink.'' None require exemplary SAT scores.
Instead of talking about how smart politicians are or aren't, we should have an infinitely more useful, meaningful conversation about whether we share and respect their values and whether they have shown themselves to be effective. Someone who rates high on both counts is someone to rally unreservedly around.
Right now, neither Perry nor Obama fits that double bill.

HEADLINE: It's Time to Learn to Think Like Steve Jobs

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
James Warren writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative.
Rahm Emanuel should beckon America's army of grim, cost-cutting politicians to two Chicago spots -- eight miles apart and seemingly with nothing in common -- to remind them about something forgotten in this age of scarcity: imagination.
I thought about a downtown video sculpture and a nondescript white frame house in a working-class Latino neighborhood after hearing of the health-related resignation of Steve Jobs as chief executive of Apple Inc. 
Mr. Jobs was routinely likened to Thomas Edison and Henry Ford. Those comparisons may miss the mark since he's perhaps more akin to the American icon born in that Northwest Side two-flat, which bears no mention of him: Walt Disney.
The morning after Mr. Jobs's announcement, I watched our 2-year-old son lying on the kitchen floor and adroitly moving a finger here, a finger there, using an iPad's touch screen to find a Thomas the Train video and the wildly popular Angry Birds puzzle video game.
He is captivated by a product whose message is the same as that of Mr. Jobs's Macintosh, iPod and iPhone -- anything is possible. It's a legacy of Mr. Disney, who, even in the darkest days of the Depression, created an alternative world of pleasure via characters like Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Pluto and Donald Duck.
Mr. Jobs disdains most consumer research, like focus groups, since he believes that we don't really know what we want. He goes with his gut, unlike a research-driven political class obsessed with giving citizens what they claim to desire.
It's how he expanded Mr. Disney's notion of ''imagineering'' from movie houses and television to desktops, telephones and touch-screen tablets. Their democratic essence crosses demographic and ideological lines: products that Fox News Channel and MSNBC die-hards can agree on.
Sadly, politicians' inclinations to think small are accentuated as revenues decline. They can even turn callous, as did Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, when he argued against emergency aid for victims of Hurricane Irene unless offset by dollar-for-dollar cuts elsewhere.
If one can't help neighbors in need, it doesn't speak well of figuring out the future. Meanwhile, Mr. Jobs's notion of the ''insanely great'' need not be left to private-sector visionaries.
The Disney house, built by Walt's father, a carpenter, in 1892, is near the corner of Tripp Street and Palmer Avenue in Hermosa Park. There's an older couple on the second floor and an older lady and her grandson on the first. It's owned by Barbara Popovic, a journalist, and her husband.
Ms. Popovic is executive director of Chicago Access Network Television (CAN TV) and its five local public access channels. It's financed by the city's franchise cable operators and represents a nifty tool of creative expression for many thousands. New York City just announced a strong deal for its sister public access centers there, underscoring the value in which they're held.
But it's down to the wire on a new deal for CAN TV with RCN, one of Chicago's cable providers, that will set the stage for other franchise deals this decade.
Cable revenue has soared despite the recession, but financing for CAN TV, whose budget is $2 million, has declined. The RCN renewal is expected before the City Council shortly and the public could be shortchanged.
It's a coincidence that the Disney home is owned by someone with an appreciation of the nexus between public financing and creativity. But it's no coincidence that my favorite public space, Millennium Park, epitomizes the bond and is a huge draw.
On a hot summer day, can you top the delight of the once-disputed Crown Fountain by the Catalan artist Jaume Plensa?
Imagine if he'd asked focus groups about spending government money on a $17 million interactive art-video sculpture with water cascading down two 50-foot-tall glass brick towers onto a black granite reflecting pool.
On Thursday afternoon, the squeals of delight were unrelenting. Dozens of kids joyfully awaited the parsing of lips on the facial images and the pouring down of water.
Three of them -- a blond girl, a black boy and a Latino boy, who clearly had not known one another before -- frolicked together underneath one tower. They danced with their palms facing toward the sky, then slid onto the granite floor on their backs and flapped their feet in unison in the inch-high pool.
It was magic and sparkle and a reminder that even amid awful challenges, we need to invest in joy.
The scene was so Disney.

HEADLINE: The Jobs Crisis: Washington must engage in vast job creation, in the short term and beyond

 BODY:
The August employment report, released on Friday, is bleak on all counts, but at least it leaves no doubt that the United States is in the grip of a severe and worsening jobs crisis. That should lend a sense of urgency to the speech on jobs that President Obama plans to deliver this week.
The economy added no jobs in August -- zero -- and the anemic numbers for June and July were revised downward. The unemployment rate is stuck at 9.1 percent, but it would be 16.2 percent if it included the swelling ranks of those who find only part-time work and the millions who have given up looking for jobs that simply do not exist. 
In his speech on Thursday, Mr. Obama does not need to alert Americans to the dire situation; they have been telling pollsters for months that job creation -- not budget cuts -- should be policy makers' top priority. This is his chance to present a plan big enough to ramp up job growth in the near term, while initiating long-term fixes to improve the economy and sustain employment.
He should not calibrate his policies to fit what he hopes will be acceptable to his Republican opponents. The House Republicans are never going to give Mr. Obama anything, and they are ideologically opposed to the government's acting on the scale that is needed.
The American people will understand if Mr. Obama makes his case clearly and powerfully. The Republicans will refuse to, and the president should speak candidly about their disregard for workers. (Last week, the Republicans showed their disregard for the presidency by fighting over the timing of the address.)
The first step is to not make matters worse. The main cause of unemployment now is a lack of consumer demand. Americans -- unemployed, underemployed, underwater in their debts, and understandably anxious about the future -- are unwilling or unable to spend. To counteract that, it is vital to extend federal unemployment benefits and the temporary payroll tax cut for employees beyond year's end, a move that would put some $160 billion into Americans' pockets and preserve some 1.5 million jobs.
The next step is to create jobs. The highway trust fund must be reauthorized before it expires at the end of September, a step that would prevent furloughs of current workers and create some 120,000 jobs a year over the next three years via investments in transportation. In addition, a $50 billion school renovation program would employ 500,000 workers, out of 1.5 million unemployed construction workers, and could be easily scaled up.
The federal government must also stop the hemorrhaging of state budgets, which has led to the elimination of nearly 700,000 teaching jobs and other government positions in the last three years. Analysts estimate that for every government job lost, at least one job is lost in the private sector, as laid-off government workers stop spending and private contractors lose work. The fastest way to get aid to states is to increase the federal Medicaid share. The states will then have money to pay employees and contractors.
In August, joblessness was nearly 18 percent among Americans under 24. They need more federal jobs in parks, community centers and on college campuses, as well as in service programs like AmeriCorps.
It is vital that Mr. Obama push for mortgage relief, to boost consumer spending and help repair household balance sheets.
Mr. Obama cannot order Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-run mortgage companies, to refinance the mortgages of underwater borrowers in good standing. But he can apply pressure by making it clear that it is profoundly in the public interest that they do so. Mr. Obama should also support principal reductions for troubled borrowers in bankruptcy, in legal settlements, and in other loan modification efforts.
Immediate measures must be accompanied by long-term plans. In particular, Congress should heed Mr. Obama's call for an infrastructure bank, to combine public and private investment in large-scale projects.
Mr. Obama should explain that the efforts will be paid for, over time, by tax increases and spending cuts that will begin as the economy recovers. For now, they will require more borrowing, which is prudent, given the need and today's low interest rates.
Republicans will insist that the nation cannot afford to do the things necessary to create jobs. We can't afford not to. Mr. Obama must be clear about that on Thursday.

HIGHLIGHT: A remarkable record.

 BODY:
Rereading my old supply-side article, I was reminded of just how consistently, awesomely wrong the Journal opinion section has been for two decades now. Think about it (no time for full links); by reading that section you could have learned, either from the editorial page proper or from the paper's favorite op-ed guys, that
Clinton's tax hike would cause a recession and send stocks plunging
Dow 36,000!
American households are saving plenty thanks to capital gains on their houses
Interest rates will soar thanks to Obama's deficits
And much, much more.
What's remarkable is that the Journal does not seem to pay a price for this record of awesome wrongness. Maybe subscribers buy the paper for the reporting (although if you ask me, that's been going downhill since the Murdoch takeover). But as far as I can tell, lots of people still take the editorial page's pronouncements seriously, even though it seems likely that you could have made a lot of money by betting against whatever that page predicts.
I guess it's an affinity thing. The WSJ editorial page comes across as the work of people who love the rich (unless they support liberal causes), hate liberals and the poor, and feel personally affronted by lucky duckies too poor to pay income taxes; and a significant number of well-heeled readers see this and say, "those are my kind of people!"

HEADLINE: Hostility Among Voters as Politics Hurt Economy

BYLINE: JOHN HARWOOD


HIGHLIGHT: Both parties are playing with a politically combustible material: the hostility of voters who see them as compounding economic problems.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - President Obama's renewed engagement with Congressional Republicans this week may seem all too familiar, but it comes with a darkly unpredictable component.
That is because over the summer, the ideological battles and partisan maneuvers woven into the fabric of the capital began to exert their own damaging effect on the economy, analysts from Washington to Wall Street have concluded.
Typically, economic conditions frame the political debate. But in the fight over raising the federal debt limit, the political debate also influenced economic conditions - and not for the better. Last week's unemployment report showing no job growth in August provided new evidence that the simultaneous erosion of confidence in the economy and in the government has harmed prospects for American workers and businesses.
Thus in the post-Labor Day chapter of divided government, both parties are playing with this politically combustible material: the hostility of voters who see them as not merely failing to solve economic problems but, in fact, actively compounding them.

The immediate legislative question is whether rising anxiety can drive Republicans and Democrats toward consensus solutions. So far, there is scant evidence of that happening, as the squabble over scheduling the president's address to Congress made clear.
White House advisers say Mr. Obama, exasperated with Republicans' refusal to cooperate, is preparing to use his speech on Thursday to fight for an ambitious job-creation proposal costing hundreds of billions of dollars.
But Republicans, ridiculing the idea of another stimulus, show limited interest in bargaining - even on tax-cut ideas they previously backed.
Both of those calculations now involve heightened risks as the 2012 elections approach.
The president is in the most conspicuous jeopardy. But Congressional Republicans are heading into these new skirmishes with their careers on the line, too.
Eroding Confidence
What makes political attitudes so economically consequential now is the role that consumer and business confidence plays in determining whether the stalled recovery kicks into gear - or slips back into recession.
Since the 2008 financial crisis, Americans shaken by job losses, stagnant wages and falling home values have been borrowing less and spending less. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York calculated this year that this "deleveraging" has siphoned $480 billion annually from the cash flow of American consumers.
No one expects that lost spending to return. But the more pessimistic consumers feel, the less likely it is that businesses will see profit in hiring new workers and investing in additional production with the cash now filling their coffers.
Research by the Republican pollster Bill McInturff and his Democratic counterpart Peter Hart for the financial television network CNBC showed that confidence was weak even before the final negotiations over the debt ceiling last month. By June, just 29 percent of Americans expected their wages to rise in the next year; 50 percent called it a bad time to invest in the stock market; and 30 percent expected their home values to decrease soon, compared with just 15 percent who expected an increase.
Since then, Mr. McInturff said, the infighting in Washington has eroded consumer confidence further than economic conditions themselves might have warranted. Mr. Hart reached the same conclusion in separate research for Citibank that showed Americans with diminishing expectations for recovery even as their assessment of current conditions remained unchanged since January.
The combination of economic and political consequences represents the voters' version of the Standard & Poor's downgrade of United States debt. If the stock market volatility that followed the S.&P. downgrade is any indication, 2012 candidates face an unusual level of turbulence.
Hazards in Forecasting
The Obama administration's own midsession review of economic conditions projected growth of less than 2 percent in 2011, with unemployment remaining at 9 percent through 2012. That has Republicans recalling some iconic bad-news elections for White House incumbents.
In 1980, Ronald Reagan demolished President Jimmy Carter and led Republicans to a gain of 34 House seats and a takeover of the Senate.
In 1992, Bill Clinton defeated President George Bush. But the fact that Democrats lost nine House seats while winning the presidency that year should serve as a warning for Congressional Republicans. Sitting presidents may be the most natural targets for anti-incumbent sentiment, but they're not the only ones.
That is why Democrats increasingly favor the iconography of 1948, when President Harry S. Truman redirected voters' ire toward a "do-nothing" Republican Congress. He not only salvaged his own election but also helped Democrats win back control of Capitol Hill.
It's far from clear that Mr. Obama could reproduce such an outcome - or whether Republican lawmakers could adjust even if they saw it coming. At the moment, most House Republicans fear Tea Party opposition in primaries more than the anger of swing voters in November.
But forecasting this "new phase of the American political dialogue," as Mr. McInturff called it in a recent report, carries escalating hazards for strategists on both sides. "This type of deep voter anger, unease and economic pessimism," he wrote, "leads to unstable and unpredictable political outcomes."

HEADLINE: Romney Speaks at Tea Party Event, Drawing Sparse Protest

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER AND JOHN ELIGON


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney gave the keynote address at a Tea Party Express rally in Concord, N.H., drawing a sparse group of protesters and delivering a lively version of his standard stump speech.

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's keynote speech Sunday night at a Tea Party Express rally in Concord, N.H., was perhaps more notable for what did not happen - there were no fiery clashes with Tea Party protesters, or angry hecklers - than for what did - Mr. Romney delivered a lively version of his standard stump speech.
"I love this great land, I know we face extraordinary challenges, and I happen to believe that career politicians got us into this mess, and the career politicians can't get us out of this mess," Mr. Romney said. "It will take someone who understands how the private economy works because he's worked in the private economy, and I have. I'm a business guy."
Mr. Romney has never been a favorite of Tea Party supporters, who dislike the health care overhaul he carried out as governor of Massachusetts. And when he was announced as a speaker for the Tea Party Express national bus tour, FreedomWorks, a libertarian advocacy group that has fostered the growth of the Tea Party movement, withdrew in protest.
Along with a coalition of a dozen other Tea Party and liberty groups, FreedomWorks also organized a protest before Mr. Romney's speech Sunday. But attendance at the protest was sparse, drawing a little more than a dozen supporters. 
 "We don't want him portrayed as New Hampshire's Tea Party candidate," said Jerry DeLemus, chairman of the Granite State Patriots Liberty P.A.C.
The Romney camp, however, came prepared for the protesters, showing up with dozens of Romney supporters in blue "Romney" shirts, and carrying blue and white Romney signs. When the candidate arrived at the rally in Rollins Park, they surrounded him hooting and clapping, and crowded around as he took the stage, first standing and then sitting at the base of the stage. (Flipper Mitt, a man dressed in a dolphin costume passing out "Mitt Flops," also managed to snag a front-row seat.)
Mr. Romney, who was preceded by his wife, Ann, emphasized his business background and years in the private sector, but also hit some themes popular with the Tea Party movement - namely, freedom.
"I believe in America," Mr. Romney said. "I believe in our freedoms, our political freedom. I believe in our economic and personal freedoms. I believe in free enterprise, I believe in capitalism."
He also assailed President Obama on the new report that showed zero job growth last month: "Look, a shutout is O.K. in baseball - it's not good when you're talking jobs," he said.
FreedomWorks organizers circulated a seven-page memo detailing parts of Mr. Romney's record that they said were incompatible with Tea Party principles. The memo drew mostly on Mr. Romney's actions as governor of Massachusetts, focusing heavily on the healthcare legislation that he introduced in the state that conservatives criticize as being similar to Mr. Obama's federal healthcare legislation.
"When it comes to less government, which the Tea Party stands for, how could you possibly explain that with Romneycare?" said Tim Carter, a co-leader of the Lakes Region Tea Party in New Hampshire, referring to the term some conservatives have adopted for Mr. Romney's healthcare legislation. "It doesn't even compute."
Though he has firmed up his conservative stances, some Republicans view him is a flip-flopper, and until recently, Mr. Romney has made very little concerted effort to reach out to Tea Party groups.
 "It seems to me that Mitt Romney is treating this as a photo opp to check the box and to get the photo opp that he's cool with the Tea Party - and he's not cool with the Tea Party," said Adam Brandon, a spokesman for FreedomWorks. "All of our activists are pretty peeved he would even try to embrace the Tea Party message."
Mr. Brandon added: "I think the only reason is because he's slipping in the polls. He's ignored us until this point, he's ignored all our issues."
In recent days Mr. Romney has been ramping up his Tea Party outreach. Last week the Romney campaign announced that he would be attending a candidate forum over Labor Day weekend in Columbia, S.C., an event he had previously planned to skip. Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, the forum's host, is popular with social conservatives and Tea Party groups.
Jennifer Horn, the founder of We the People, a New Hampshire Tea Party group, also said Mr. Romney was the first candidate to accept an invitation to participate in a series of town-hall-style meetings her group is planning this fall.
Mr. Romney told Foster's, a New Hampshire newspaper, last month that he believed he could win the support of Tea Party voters.
"I want to appeal to the Tea Party voters," Mr. Romney told the paper's editorial board. "I don't know what folks here in New Hampshire would say, but my guess is most Tea Partiers, or a lot of them, would support my candidacy."

HEADLINE: A Never-Simple Job Of Steering A Striving Family

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN

 BODY:
Principal's Office is a new feature that will run regularly on SchoolBook, a Web site of news, data and conversation that launches Sept. 7.
Martha Polin ''wandered'' into education 24 years ago, and since 2002 has run one of the most challenging programs in the city: a transfer high school, for students who have struggled in or dropped out of traditional programs. Hers, the Lower East Side Preparatory High School, has 571 students, most of them recent Chinese immigrants. Ms. Polin, who is 60 and had a salary of $150,926 in 2010, sees her job as heading a large, striving family. (This interview has been edited and condensed.) MARIA NEWMAN
Q Did you start out in education? 
A I was a marketing executive in the entertainment industry, and I guess I reached the glass ceiling. One day I left and I never came back. I sat around my house for six months trying to figure out what did I really want out of life and out of a job, and I walked by 65 Court Street, and I wandered in there and I said, 'What do you have to do to be a teacher?' They asked what my degree was in, and I said economics, and they said, 'We have a little test that we're giving, and if you cross your T's and dot your I's, you, too, can be a teacher.' It was 1987, and they really needed teachers.
Q How did you go from being a teacher to a principal?
A One day Superintendent Anthony Alvarado came to me -- after I'd been teaching for 10 years -- and asked would I like to be an administrator. And I said, not particularly. And he said, I'll pay for everything. It was a dream for a teacher. I said yes.
Q How would you describe how you do your job to people outside of school?
A My job really is about being the head of a family, and trying to lead everybody in the right direction.
You have to feed the teachers or they're going to eat the students. You have to give teachers the tools they need to do their jobs, whatever it is or whatever they think it is, and then you have to make sure they know how to use the tools.
And at the same time you're having this kind of lovefest with your staff, you also have to be surgical and look at each individual member and help them be the best that they can be at their job. Occasionally that could mean telling that person that they should probably not be a high school teacher. Every principal has a vision of what a school should be. Finding people that share and want to be part of that vision and mission for the kids is part of it. Here, we want to create an environment where the kids want to be here all the time. I want the teachers here to make a serial with a cliffhanger every day so that the kids want to come back every day.
Q How have schools changed since you became a teacher?
A The bar was fairly low when I became a teacher. The bar is high now. You have to be smart. You can't just be adequate anymore.
Q How do you motivate your teachers?
A I'm not into meetings. We don't have an intercom system in this building, which has turned out to be the greatest thing in the world. Every day at 7:55 a.m. we assemble in the library and we talk about what we're going to do that day, what are the challenges, are we going to have a fire drill, have a great day. It takes maybe five minutes.
Q How is your job different than being chief executive of a company?
A The main way is that I like to think that C.E.O.'s of companies are empowered at least by their own board of directors. Even though they talk about empowering principals, we're not empowered.
For instance, what we went through this year with rollover money, and having to give back a big percentage of our budget to the Department of Education. Now I'm being told that I can only keep $20,000.
Q What does $20,000 buy you?
A Nothing. It buys you some paper. Not even enough paper. To buy a teacher is $80,000, at least in my world.
Q You share a building with two other schools. Does that arrangement work well?
A I'm not for this co-location thing. It doesn't make sense financially.
When you have so many small schools, it's very difficult to offer enough to the kids. How do you give them sociology and psychology and foreign language with limited amounts of resources? We in the building have started to share teachers. There's a teacher in the other school downstairs who likes to teach video. I pay him one-fifth of his salary and he comes to teach my kids, too.

HEADLINE: All-American, Floor to Roof? Not So Simple

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
BOZEMAN, Mont. -- Anders Lewendal, a general contractor who managed to survive the housing collapse, has hit upon a plan that he thinks will revive the construction industry and help lead the nation out of the economic wilderness: build houses using only American-made materials.
He is trying to do just that with a new home here on a side street a few blocks from downtown. But it is not as easy as it sounds.
Some things are simple enough. Wood literally grows on trees, of course, especially here in forested western Montana. And no one ships cement or concrete mix any farther than needed.
After that it can get tough. In a global economy, even American-assembled appliances probably have at least some foreign made or mined components, Mr. Lewendal said. 
Tiny components like nails, screws and light bulbs, mundane but crucial, are significantly cheaper if bought from China or other developing nations. High-end frills -- which tend to be imported, like Italian marble or mahogany -- may be doomed to stay on the dock or in the showroom.
And all that does not even address the question of whether using illegal immigrant labor, a mainstay of the construction industry around the nation, counts as foreign.
''Part of the impact of the recession has been healthy, in making people rethink what housing is for,'' said Mr. Lewendal, who conceded that perfection in his goal is probably not possible. The locally made cement, he suspects, could have some imported chemicals, for example, and the recycled glass from Yellowstone National Park that he laid down as a base layer under the garage could well have contained an imported beer bottle or two. As for his workers, he said, they are all here legally.
''The point is that little things can add up,'' he said. ''I think we could solve this recession if everyone shifted just 5 percent of their purchases to U.S.-made products.''
In some ways, it is an old idea, echoing a hard-hat refrain from the 1970s or earlier: Buy American. In other ways, though, it is as current as the environmental message that hangs over every urban farmers' market: Buy Local.
Mr. Lewendal said that because the 2,280-square-foot, three-bedroom house he is building will conform to high energy-conservation standards -- more points are awarded for materials obtained close to the site -- the economic and social implications all blur. And in a brutally competitive local market, he added, pitching all-American could also be a marketing niche in tune with the times.
''I don't see any politics to it at all,'' said Mr. Lewendal, 51, who described himself as a conservative and is the chairman of the local homebuilder association's green building committee. ''It's about jobs.''
The house's owner, Kat Quinn, also has a complex agenda. For health reasons, she wanted a house built to strict environmental standards, and after she met Mr. Lewendal and heard about the all-American home idea, she became convinced that buying American could put pressure on foreign companies to raise wages for their workers.
She said she does plan, though, on having a Canadian-made trampoline in the house, to use in therapy for a daughter with cystic fibrosis.
Bozeman's economy was not devastated across the board by the recession. Montana State University, a big local employer, created a base of stability, and the proximity to Yellowstone, about 90 minutes south, kept up a flow of tourists.
But where bad times bit, they bit hard, and that was in construction. The vacation- and second-home market that plumbers, roofers and framers depended on dwindled to almost nothing starting in 2007, taking out more than a third of all the construction work here in Gallatin County in just 24 months, according to state figures.
Justin Tribbitt, a former general contractor now working in computer software, lost his company; three of his five former employees left town. Mike Wilhelm, an electrician, went from six employees to two. Rock Larocca, also a contractor, survived with the aid of a chainsaw, helping cut down trees killed by a beetle infestation.
''It's kind of like getting a drink out of the garden hose and suddenly the valve shuts off and it's dry,'' said Mr. Tribbitt, 32. ''It was gone just like that.''
Some who managed to hang on said that whether the all-American home idea is good marketing for Lewendal Construction or good economics for the country, or both, it feels right to them. Mr. Lewendal, admirers said, is taking action.
''More power to him,'' said Ryan Engbretson, a builder who said that his company had survived mainly by doing repair work.
Economists say it is hard to verify Mr. Lewendal's assertion that about 75 percent of the average American home is made in the United States already, mainly because it does not appear to be something anyone has deeply studied. His estimates that going American will add only 2 percent to 3 percent to the $265,000 construction cost of the Bozeman house by the time final purchases are done -- he is still shopping for things like light fixtures -- are also difficult to independently confirm.
''The truth is that we are in a global economy and it's very interconnected, for good or bad,'' said Albert Saiz, an assistant professor of real estate at the University of Pennsylvania and co-editor of the journal Housing Economics. ''It's very hard to know the impact of your purchasing decisions and the consequences of what you do.''
Professor Saiz said the fluid nature of labor markets could also make the implications of all-American more complicated. In much of the nation, for example, though less so in this working-class corner of Montana, houses are built with Mexican or other foreign-born labor, which is a kind of foreign input since a part of the wages often goes back across the border.
And if demand for, say, nails or screws made in the United States did go up, Professor Saiz said, the basic manufacturing industry jobs created -- low skill and probably low pay -- are the kind that American workers are often disinclined to take anyway.
But Mr. Lewendal, who earned an undergraduate degree in economics before going into construction, said costs and benefits are more complicated than a spreadsheet can convey. The nails he bought from a company in Illinois are about $5 more per box, for instance, but he said they jam the nail guns less often than the cheaper Chinese brands, which are less uniform.
''If a guy has to get down three times a day to clear the gun, that's time wasted,'' he said.
Some elements of his experiment are certain to endure, if only inside the home itself. Mr. Lewendal, in showing a reporter around the house, which he hopes to complete this fall, repeatedly illustrated his ideas with diagrams and math equations, scrawling with a black marker on the bare beams and panels -- writing that will be preserved, like a time-capsule message to the future, behind the wallboard when the work is done.

HEADLINE: This Labor Day

 BODY:
There is something a little puzzling about Labor Day. On Thanksgiving we do give thanks, but on Labor Day we do not labor. To the proverbial visitor from outer space, the name of the holiday might suggest 24 hours of national housekeeping, a communal exertion of effort toward some unspecified end. 
Many Americans of a certain age grew up in households where every Saturday was labor day, a day of chores, projects, burdensome errands and visits to the dump. And yet, Labor Day itself became a day of rest.
Historically, the holiday is a direct result of the bloody Pullman strike, which pitted the railroads against striking railway workers in 1894, and it celebrates the labor movement, then and now. This is not a history that crosses the minds of most Americans during a three-day weekend that feels like the border between summer and fall. (On Labor Day, we try our best to remain unaware that stores have already stocked up for Halloween.)
But change the emphasis from labor to jobs and you come upon a subject that is very much on the minds of Americans, and not merely among the 14 million officially unemployed people in this country, a number equivalent to the population of Illinois, Wyoming and Vermont.
Perhaps Labor Day should be a day to consider the struggles of so many Americans eager to work but unable to find jobs. Perhaps it should be a day for parades of the unemployed, to remind us of the dignity of work and the indignity of being out of it.

HEADLINE: China's Challenge at Sea

BYLINE: By AARON L. FRIEDBERG. 
Aaron L. Friedberg, a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton, is the author of ''A Contest for Supremacy: China, America and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia.''

 BODY:
Princeton, N.J.
AMERICA'S fiscal woes are placing the country on a path of growing strategic risk in Asia.
With Democrats eager to protect social spending and Republicans anxious to avoid tax hikes, and both saying the national debt must be brought under control, we can expect sustained efforts to slash the defense budget. Over the next 10 years, cuts in planned spending could total half a trillion dollars. Even as the Pentagon saves money by pulling back from Afghanistan and Iraq, there will be fewer dollars with which to buy weapons or develop new ones.
Unfortunately, those constraints are being imposed just as America faces a growing strategic challenge. Fueled by economic growth of nearly 10 percent a year, China has been engaged for nearly two decades in a rapid and wide-ranging military buildup. China is secretive about its intentions, and American strategists have had to focus on other concerns since 9/11. Still, the dimensions, direction and likely implications of China's buildup have become increasingly clear. 
When the cold war ended, the Pacific Ocean became, in effect, an American lake. With its air and naval forces operating through bases in friendly countries like Japan and South Korea, the United States could defend and reassure its allies, deter potential aggressors and insure safe passage for commercial shipping throughout the Western Pacific and into the Indian Ocean. Its forces could operate everywhere with impunity.
But that has begun to change. In the mid-1990s, China started to put into place the pieces of what Pentagon planners refer to as an ''anti-access capability.'' In other words, rather than trying to match American power plane for plane and ship for ship, Beijing has sought more cost-effective ways to neutralize it. It has been building large numbers of relatively inexpensive but highly accurate non-nuclear ballistic missiles, as well as sea- and air-launched cruise missiles. Those weapons could destroy or disable the handful of ports and airfields from which American air and naval forces operate in the Western Pacific and sink warships whose weapons could reach the area from hundreds of miles out to sea, including American aircraft carriers.
The Chinese military has also been testing techniques for disabling American satellites and cybernetworks, and it is adding to its small arsenal of long-range nuclear missiles that can reach the United States.
Although a direct confrontation seems unlikely, China appears to seek the option of dealing a knockout blow to America's forward forces, leaving Washington with difficult choices about how to respond.
Those preparations do not mean that China wants war with the United States. To the contrary, they seem intended mostly to overawe its neighbors while dissuading Washington from coming to their aid if there is ever a clash. Uncertain of whether they can rely on American support, and unable to match China's power on their own, other countries may decide they must accommodate China's wishes.
In the words of the ancient military theorist Sun Tzu, China is acquiring the means to ''win without fighting'' -- to establish itself as Asia's dominant power by eroding the credibility of America's security guarantees, hollowing out its alliances and eventually easing it out of the region.
If the United States and its Asian friends look to their own defenses and coordinate their efforts, there is no reason they cannot maintain a favorable balance of power, even as China's strength grows. But if they fail to respond to China's buildup, there is a danger that Beijing could miscalculate, throw its weight around and increase the risk of confrontation and even armed conflict. Indeed, China's recent behavior in disputes over resources and maritime boundaries with Japan and the smaller states that ring the South China Sea suggest that this already may be starting to happen.
This is a problem that cannot simply be smoothed away by dialogue. China's military policies are not the product of a misunderstanding; they are part of a deliberate strategy that other nations must now find ways to meet. Strength deters aggression; weakness tempts it. Beijing will denounce such moves as provocative, but it is China's actions that currently threaten to upset the stability of Asia.
Many of China's neighbors are more willing than they were in the past to ignore Beijing's complaints, increase their own defense spending and work more closely with one another and the United States.
They are unlikely, however, to do those things unless they are convinced that America remains committed. Washington does not have to shoulder the entire burden of preserving the Asian power balance, but it must lead.
The Pentagon needs to put a top priority on finding ways to counter China's burgeoning anti-access capabilities, thereby reducing the likelihood that they will ever be used. This will cost money. To justify the necessary spending in an era of austerity, our leaders will have to be clearer in explaining the nation's interests and commitments in Asia and blunter in describing the challenge posed by China's relentless military buildup.

HEADLINE: China Aims To Rein In Car Sales

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
TIANJIN, China -- After a decade of nurturing China's auto industry to become the largest in the world, this country's leaders are having second thoughts.
A succession of government officials at a weekend conference called for China's automakers to shift their focus from making ever more cars and toward producing more fuel-efficient and more advanced models, including gasoline-electric hybrids and all-electric cars.
''The government must take the leading role in controlling unrealistic growth'' of the auto industry, Jiang Kejun, the influential director of the Energy Research Institute at the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planning agency, said Sunday during a speech at the conference.
Lu Shize, director of air pollution control at the Ministry of Environmental Protection, echoed Mr. Jiang, saying that ''for the auto industry to develop, we should not try to sell more, but to improve the units sold.'' 
The government officials did not say how they would restrict growth. But growth has already slowed partly because of limits on the number of new cars that can be registered each month in Beijing, and mostly because government incentives expired at the start of this year. Those incentives were subsidies for rural buyers and a two-year reduction in the sales tax on new family vehicles.
The officials' remarks strongly suggested that the Chinese auto industry's lobbying for the reinstatement of the incentives would fail and that restrictions on registering new cars would be extended to more cities.
Any slowdown in growth is likely to shock the world's automakers. Practically every American, European, Japanese and South Korean automaker is expanding in China, including General Motors, Ford Motor, Nissan Motor and PSA Peugeot Citroen. Chinese automakers are building assembly plants even faster.
Years of double-digit expansion have increased Chinese auto production to almost 17 million cars, minivans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles last year, from fewer than two million in 2000, making it almost twice the size of the United States or Japanese industries and far larger than any European country's auto manufacturing sector.
Growth in China culminated in a burst of sales in 2009 and 2010 as the government cut taxes on car sales to stimulate the economy during the global economic downturn.
J.D. Power & Associates, the global consults, estimated last month that China would have a manufacturing capacity of 31 million vehicles by 2013. Yet the domestic market has decelerated sharply this year, with sales of family vehicles up just 5 percent in the first seven months, compared with the period a year earlier. By contrast, sales had soared 33 percent in 2010, compared with 2009.
Much slower sales growth this year has prompted strong lobbying by the auto industry for a renewal of government incentives. But if anything, policy makers seem to be leaning toward more limits to address China's steeply rising dependence on imported oil and its traffic jams, air pollution and shortages of land in many areas for more road construction.
Officials in Beijing have urged the auto industry to improve technology for years. But they clearly shifted their tone at the conference this weekend in calling for curbs on the industry's overall growth in sales and production.
Many Chinese automakers are partly or entirely owned by municipal or provincial governments, however, and these lower tiers of government have pushed their manufacturers to expand as fast as possible to maximize jobs and economic output.
But limits on car sales in big cities may pressure Chinese automakers to slow down. The municipal government of Beijing, China's largest single market with 4 percent of sales last year, stunned the industry last December by imposing stringent limits on the number of new-car registrations each month, effectively imposing a decline in sales of close to 70 percent.
Industry executives argued that this was purely a response to severe traffic jams in Beijing and lobbied for the central government not to let other cities take the same course.
Shanghai is unusual in having limited car registrations since 1994 because its historic city center has many narrow old streets. But with the exception this summer of Guiyang in southern China, most Chinese cities have been awaiting signals from Beijing on whether to follow suit.
Mr. Jiang said during a brief interview Sunday on the sidelines of the conference in Tianjin that he expected other cities to do so. ''Beijing is a very typical city from which other cities may learn,'' he said.
Zhao Hang, the president of the China Automotive Technology and Research Center, a government-affiliated complex of laboratories based here that organized the conference and that collaborates closely with automakers, expressed misgivings about further limits on car registrations. He said that the limits could discourage the replacement of older cars.
China has moved rapidly to adopt Western standards for automotive pollution control, gas mileage and safety. So cars just a few years old may pollute more, burn more gasoline and fare extremely badly in crashes.
Limits on car registrations have also meant that those who do win the right in lotteries to buy a car may be more likely to buy a large car than a small, more fuel-efficient model.
Mr. Zhao acknowledged that rapid growth in vehicle ownership had created problems.
Traffic accidents are the single biggest reason people in the Beijing area go to physical rehabilitation centers, he said.
Xiang Dihai, the director of economic construction at the Finance Ministry, said that the government would soon issue new subsidies for the auto industry, but that they would be aimed at high technology vehicles with very low fuel consumption. China already has national and local subsidies of 123,000 renminbi, or $19,300, for each all-electric car, but virtually none are sold.
Mr. Xiang said that China would proceed with plans to impose stricter fuel-economy standards by 2015, following recent moves by the United States, Japan and the European Union to require better gas mileage.
Auto executives from domestic and foreign automakers alike said in speeches at the conference and during interviews that they would do more to adopt advanced technologies, although domestic Chinese automakers tend to have modest research budgets and rely on multinational partners for their vehicle designs.
Largely unaddressed at the conference was what would happen to the industry's emerging overcapacity.
The government has prohibited Chinese automakers from making big jumps into the American market and severely restricted their entry into the European market. They have also demanded that automakers increase vehicle quality considerably, and have suggested that high-volume exports may not be allowed to start until 2015 or so.
The goal has been to make sure that when large-scale exports begin, Chinese cars do not initially acquire the same reputation for shoddy quality that bedeviled the South Korean industry when it entered the American market and that took many years and offers of long, costly warranties to overcome.
Wu Song, the deputy general manager of the Guangzhou Automobile Group, which has alliances with a several Japanese automakers, said that President Hu Jintao of China had visited the company on Aug. 14 and told executives to improve technology.
The company plans to do that and start selling cars under its own brands, Mr. Wu said, adding, ''We must own our own brands to compete in the international market.''

HEADLINE: Catholic School Teachers Wrestle With Faith And Obedience in Negotiating a Contract

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

 BODY:
Wednesday morning, on the first day of the new school year at St. Paul's Roman Catholic School in East Harlem, Gertrude Zagarella expects to arrive, as always, at 7:05. By 7:45, the children -- mostly Hispanic, black and poor -- will be done with breakfast, and then it is Ms. Zagarella's responsibility to lead all the students, from kindergartners to eighth graders, into the gym for morning prayers.
The rest of Wednesday she will spend in Room 11, teaching the new first graders where to find the bathroom, when to wash their hands and how to properly stand in a lunch line. That first day, they feel smaller than they expected, but lucky for them, no one is more experienced at calming first-grade jitters than Ms. Zagarella.
Of the 56 years she has taught in Catholic schools, 55 have been in first grade. At 77, she can think of little that she does not love about it. First graders learn to read. First graders notice when she changes her hairstyle. First graders speak from the heart. 
Ms. Zagarella once taught a boy who stood up in the middle of a lesson and announced he wasn't going to grow up because he wanted to stay with her in first grade. ''That's better than money,'' she said.
Not completely. Ms. Zagarella earns $56,000 a year. When she retires, her annual pension will be $20,974. In New York's public schools, teachers reach a maximum salary of $100,000 after 22 years, with a pension of $60,000.
Ms. Zagarella is a member of the Federation of Catholic Teachers, which is currently working without a contract. Members tend to be respectful of church leaders and not very threatening. ''I know the archdiocese doesn't have a lot of money,'' Ms. Zagarella said, ''but once in a while, if they could throw us something, the teachers would be grateful.''
Or as Patricia Gabriel, the union's president, put it, ''When it comes to asking for more, it's hard for our teachers to do it.''
Unions for public school teachers are sometimes criticized for wielding too much power, but teachers in Catholic schools suffer because theirs do not.
Alan Engram, 34, a science teacher at Monsignor Scanlan High School in the Bronx who makes $49,000 a year, lives with his father and brother and drives a 2004 Chevy Malibu. ''We're not asking a lot,'' he said. ''We'd just like them to meet us halfway.''
The union, which represents 2,600 teachers at 173 schools on Staten Island and in Manhattan, the Bronx and several upstate counties, has asked for raises of 2 percent each year for three years.
The church has offered the teachers no raise the first year and 1 percent the second -- the same as the nonunion employees in the Archdiocese of New York.
Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said financial pressures, declining enrollment and the closing of 30 schools last year made it difficult. Officials, he said, do not want to raise tuition, which averages $4,500 at elementary schools, because two-thirds of archdiocesan students are at or near the poverty level. ''If we raise tuition,'' he said, ''studies show more will drop out.''
Mr. Zwilling pointed out that teachers would still receive annual 2.7 percent step raises, though those end after 17 years, with a maximum salary of $60,641.
That's what Matthew Tomasulo was making when he retired in June, after 40 years at Transfiguration Middle School in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Tomasulo attended Transfiguration, too. He was baptized and was an altar boy at Transfiguration Church. Ten years ago, he was married there to another Transfiguration teacher. His two best men were former students he had taught in sixth grade, Michael Mah and Ginsen Yee.
''I was educated by priests,'' Mr. Tomasulo said. ''They are the Catholic Church. What they say has to go. You feel like you can't ask for more money -- it's the church.''
Mr. Engram, the teacher at Monsignor Scanlan High, said the faculty was under awful pressure. When his school was facing layoffs last spring, he said, there were teachers in the principal's office crying.
Their jobs are getting harder. Ms. Zagarella had 28 children last year, a lot for first grade. ''They want to keep the numbers built up so they don't close the school,'' she said.
Catholic school teachers do not have the same protections as public school teachers. When a parochial school is closed, everyone is laid off. Teachers can be hired back, in order of seniority, if they can find a school that needs their expertise. The best job security is to be in a school that doesn't close.
The union initiated negotiations in May with hopes of having an agreement before the contract expired Aug. 31. The teachers' side of the table is mainly women. A majority on the diocesan side are men -- including a monsignor and a Christian brother.
Jennifer Fleckenstein is a teacher at St. Philip Neri School in the Bronx. She attended St. Philip Neri, as did her father, an uncle and several cousins; now, her two children go there.
''Zero,'' she said. ''Zero makes me feel like the diocese is saying we're worth zero.''
Teachers said that during negotiations a labor lawyer for the archdiocese called their proposal ''unrealistic'' and ''silly.''
''To be told it's silly,'' said Mary Ann Driscoll, one of the teachers at the table, ''when these are such tough economic times for everyone, is not right.''
Mr. Zwilling, the spokesman, said: ''I spoke with the labor lawyer. He knows he said 'unrealistic,' and does not believe he said 'silly,' but can't swear to it.''
Ms. Gabriel, the union president, said that at negotiating sessions, archdiocesan officials don't seem to be listening. ''I was speaking and they kept looking at the watches,'' she said. ''They kept rolling their eyes.''
The teachers' Catholic education has taught them to be respectful, but has also made them smart and disciplined. In 2008, they went for months without a contract. Then, on April 4 that year, teachers at 10 archdiocesan schools held a surprise one-day strike. On April 7, teachers at eight schools struck; on April 8, five schools. At every school, every teacher walked out.
Three days later, they had a new contract providing a 15 percent raise spread over four years.
Which is a prime lesson for Labor Day. There are times when people in power will not listen until confronted by people with power.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The On Education column on Sept. 5, about the union for New York City Catholic school teachers, misstated the terms of pensions for public school teachers in the city. After 30 years on the job, a city public school teacher can expect to collect a pension of up to $60,000, which can continue to climb with more service. Teachers do not qualify for a $60,000 pension after 22 years (the point at which the maximum teacher salary, $100,000, is reached).

HEADLINE: China Is Serious About Shale Gas

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER SWANN

 BODY:
China has a chance of challenging the United States for shale supremacy. So far, only the United States has significantly exploited domestic reserves of shale gas. But Sinopec, China's major state-run oil company, is now taking shale seriously and lacks many of the roadblocks that have held back developers in other countries.
Many nations have energy trapped in their rocks, but shale gas extraction, born in the U.S.A., has all but stayed here. France moved to ban hydraulic fracturing, the contentious drilling technique used to extract energy from shale, earlier this year. In Europe mineral rights often belong to the government, making it difficult for landowners to profit from shale development and thus hardening public opposition. Only in Poland is much progress being made. 
China, however, may be best suited to shale. In New York and New Jersey, authorities have halted drilling in response to public unease, at least temporarily. Such sentiments are unlikely to stand in the way in China, where over 1.2 million people were moved to make way for the Three Gorges Dam.
There is good reason to develop shale, too. About 71 percent of China's power comes from coal, creating an acute need for lower-carbon sources of energy. And while the low price of natural gas may slow drilling in the United States over the coming year, China's state oil companies have proved willing to operate at a loss to ensure domestic supply.
China's emerging enthusiasm for domestic shale may be partly a hardball tactic for negotiating with Russian suppliers, with which the country has been struggling to agree on a price for gas imports.
Moreover, geologic deposits are an unknown. While China may have about 50 percent more shale gas than the United States, according to the Energy Information Administration, it has yet to uncover formations like the vast Marcellus or Eagle Ford deposits. But don't count China out: in the shale race, abundant capital, determination and political will go a long way.
Backing Off Air Rules
President Obama's environmentally minded backers had every reason to feel let down last week. By blocking a new Environmental Protection Agency rule on smog, the White House has bowed to critics in Congress and industry who said new air quality rules would kill jobs.
With the United States creating zero jobs in August, economic scare tactics are bound to register. And America's big emitters -- the coal, oil and chemical industries -- are masters of the art. They have been fighting hard to prevent the E.P.A. from tightening a number of emissions rules. Dow Chemical, for instance, has claimed that updated smog rules alone would cost as much as $90 billion.
The Edison Electric Institute, speaking for electricity generators, warns that the E.P.A.'s full slate of proposals could compel the industry to spend $129 billion on upgrades, force the closing of a fifth of coal generators, and lead to blackouts. Republican critics have branded the new rules job-killers and a brake on business activity and hence the economy.
But dire predictions from affected industries in the past have proved wildly exaggerated -- or just plain wrong. During the Clean Air Act debate 20 years ago, the Edison Electric Institute warned that tightened standards would lift electricity prices by up to 13 percent by around 2009. In fact they fell by some 20 percent as of 2006.
And in 1997 the American Petroleum Institute, an oil industry group, warned that smog rules would wreak economic havoc. Yet regions that might have been affected actually had slightly better job creation rates on average than the nation as a whole in following years, according to a study by the Center for American Progress.
Dropping the new rule also undermines electricity generators that have tried to clean up ahead of time, including Exelon and GenOn Energy.
Then there are the benefits that would have come with stricter standards. The E.P.A. estimates new emissions regulations could save as much as $100 billion in health care costs. Such numbers are also open to question. But the case for savings is strong.
By giving in to polluters, Mr. Obama may deflect criticism over red tape and the rule could come back into consideration in 2013. But barring possible tiny, short-lived effects, the supposed economic benefits of caving in are a smokescreen for political maneuvering.

HEADLINE: Neither Smurf Nor Wizard Could Save Summer Movie Attendance

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- It was the summer that North American movie attendance continued to slide, Hollywood's reliance on overseas ticket sales intensified, the Smurfs flexed their minimuscles and a cadre of A-list stars flopped -- again.
From the first weekend in May to Labor Day, a period that typically accounts for 40 percent of the film industry's annual ticket sales, domestic box-office revenue is projected to total $4.38 billion, an increase from last year of less than 1 percent, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office data.
The bad news: higher ticket prices, especially for the 18 films released in 3-D (up from seven last summer), drove the increase. Attendance for the period is projected to total about 543 million, the lowest tally since the summer of 1997, when 540 million people turned up.
Hollywood has now experienced four consecutive summers of eroding attendance, a cause for alarm for both studios and the publicly traded theater chains. One or two soft years can be dismissed as an aberration; four signal real trouble. 
But there was a silver lining. ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2,'' ''Transformers: Dark of the Moon'' and a spate of superhero films, including ''Captain America: The First Avenger'' and ''Thor,'' generated enough interest to reduce the box-office hole created by winter flops like ''Mars Needs Moms.'' After the first quarter, ticket sales were down a staggering 20 percent compared with the same period in 2010. Sales lag 4 percent for the year.
''In an economy that has been unfortunately pretty depressing, the marketplace expanded to accommodate big pictures stacked back to back to back,'' said Dan Fellman, president for domestic distribution at Warner Brothers.
The studio, owned by Time Warner, released two of North America's top three summer movies. Its final Harry Potter installment was No. 1 with about $375 million in ticket sales and ''The Hangover Part II,'' which took in over $254 million, was third. ''Transformers: Dark of the Moon,'' released by Paramount, a division of Viacom, was second with about $350 million in sales.
On a global basis, three movies took in more than $1 billion, the industry's new threshold of smash success. Those films were ''Deathly Hallows -- Part 2,'' ''Dark of the Moon'' and Walt Disney's ''Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.''
However, the old Hollywood power source -- star wattage -- continued to dim. Audiences still turned out for Johnny Depp in the Pirates series, but stars otherwise failed to draw crowds.
Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks flamed out ''Larry Crowne.'' Jim Carrey, who almost seems to be adopting a creepy public persona of late, flopped in ''Mr. Popper's Penguins.'' Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig fell off their box-office horses in ''Cowboys & Aliens.'' The careers of Kevin James (''Zookeeper'') and Ryan Reynolds (''Green Lantern'') also cooled off.
Three movie companies managed to breathe life into aging or moribund franchises or seed new ones -- Hollywood's equivalent of home runs. Marvel Studios, a division of Disney, already has sequels to ''Thor'' and ''Captain America'' in the works, while Sony's movie studio has moved a follow-up to ''The Smurfs,'' which came out of nowhere to sell over $132 million in tickets in North America (and is closing in on $400 million worldwide).
Efforts by 20th Century Fox, owned by the News Corporation, to restart its ''X-Men'' and ''Planet of the Apes'' franchises were particularly impressive. Fox took creative risks with ''X-Men: First Class'' and ''Rise of the Planet of the Apes,'' and it was rewarded with hits that will spawn sequels.
''The lesson for us is that different and original is always hard and always a risk but has great upside,'' said Tom Rothman, co-chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment. ''While both of those films had genetic material in common with their original franchises, both were very, very original pieces.'' Notably, ''First Class'' and ''Rise'' received some of the summer's best reviews.
Though the United States remains the world's largest movie market, one of the summer's lessons centers on the growing importance of overseas ticket sales, particularly in Russia and China. Several films -- including ''Stranger Tides,'' ''Kung Fu Panda 2'' from DreamWorks Animation, and Disney-Pixar's ''Cars 2'' -- disappointed at home, but generated big returns internationally.
This phenomenon helps explain why studios keep churning out bland sequels despite an erosion of interest in them at home; fatigue does not set in as fast internationally, in part because moviegoing in many foreign countries is less of a habit, studio executives say.
''Stranger Tides,'' for example, took in almost $70 million less in North America than its 2007 predecessor, ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.'' But ''Stranger Tides'' took in $145 million more than ''At World's End'' overseas.
''America used to set the course -- if a movie disappointed here, then it was done,'' said Phil Contrino, editor of BoxOffice.com. ''That's simply not the case anymore. America is just another territory now.''
The summer of 2011 provided another lesson in Hollywood's sleight-of-hand economics. ''Stranger Tides'' may have taken in over $1 billion, but Disney must give half to theater owners; Jerry Bruckheimer, that film's producer, and Mr. Depp also get a portion. Take what's left and subtract costs -- Disney spent an estimated $400 million on production and global marketing -- and the profit is rather thin. (Disney also profits from sales of DVDs and related merchandise, however.)
Which of the summer's two major bombs, ''Cowboys & Aliens'' and ''Green Lantern,'' was the bigger financial calamity? Both will lose tens of millions, but ''Green Lantern'' is by far the larger loss. Warner, confident that it could create a new franchise with that film, decided not to bring in a financing partner to reduce risk. Universal hedged its bet by teaming with DreamWorks Studios and Relativity Media.
Thematically, R-rated comedies ruled. Crude humor helped turn ''Bridesmaids'' into a surprise smash for Universal; that film, notably built around a female ensemble, took in $281 million worldwide, a staggering total for a movie that cost about $33 million to make. Sony's ''Bad Teacher'' and Warner's ''Horrible Bosses'' also plowed this ground to impressive results. ''The Hangover Part II'' was the granddaddy of the genre.
But audiences may be growing weary of extreme vulgarity. ''The Change-Up,'' a Universal comedy that opens with a baby defecating in Jason Bateman's mouth, flopped, costing $52 million to make (and tens of millions more to market) and selling about $40 million in tickets worldwide.
Amid all of the special effects and computer animation, two old-fashioned films aimed at adults turned in impressive results. ''The Help,'' a DreamWorks Studios adaptation of a best-selling novel, has ridden strong reviews to $122 million in ticket sales and counting. Earlier in the summer, ''Midnight in Paris,'' distributed by Sony Pictures Classics, became an outsize hit for Woody Allen, selling $53 million in tickets.
''It's always kind of funny to see Hollywood surprised that movies aimed at adults succeed in the summer,'' said Mr. Contrino of BoxOffice.com. ''If you don't feed them garbage -- surprise -- they buy tickets.''

HEADLINE: Amazon Pushes Hard To Kill a Tax

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- The struggling state of California thinks it has found gold in taxing e-commerce. But that money is proving much more elusive than it seemed just a few months ago.
Amazon.com, the Seattle-based retailer that is the state's chief target, is fighting back with all the resources of a company whose stock market valuation is nearly $100 billion. In an unusual move that opponents say is a violation of the state constitution, Amazon is taking directly to voters its argument that it should not be required to collect sales tax.
Infuriated state lawmakers are responding with what some observers are calling ''the nuclear option'': writing new legislation that goes after Amazon and other online retailers under an ''urgency'' clause. If they can get the new measure passed by a two-thirds vote before the end of the legislative session on Friday, it will trump Amazon's efforts toward a voter referendum.
To sway a few legislators, Amazon is making a counterproposal: if California drops the tax issue for a few years, the retailer says it will build two warehouses in the state and hire 7,000 workers. In a state with 12 percent unemployment, that might seem an attractive offer. 
''This is a game of chess with ultimately billions of tax revenues at stake across the country and strong competing values on either side,'' said Tracy Westen, chief executive of the Center for Governmental Studies, a Los Angeles research group. ''High drama for policy wonks.''
At its heart, the standoff between Amazon and California is simple: the state passed a law at the beginning of the summer requiring online retailers with a physical presence in the state to collect sales taxes. Amazon denies that its subsidiaries in the state, which include a unit that designed the Kindle, constitute such a presence.
The stakes go far beyond the $200 million the state is hoping to get from Amazon and other online retailers, money it has already put into its new budget. (Local communities stand to reap an additional $100 million.) Amazon fears that a defeat in California will sway legislators across the country, and that it will lose a critical pricing advantage. It is fighting a similar measure in New York in the courts.
Opposing Amazon are traditional retailers as big as Wal-Mart and as small as the neighborhood bookstore -- the few that are left. ''Amazon is killing our business in bricks-and-mortar stores,'' said Bill Dombrowski, head of the California Retailers Association, which was the driving force behind the original law.
Amazon easily collected the half-million signatures necessary to put the issue on ballots next June. Since people will in essence be voting on whether to pay an additional 8 or 9 percent when they buy online, Amazon could easily triumph among voters who are watching their wallets. Democrats in the Legislature responded with an urgency bill, a rare tactic used only a few times a year.
''We're not doing this lightly,'' said State Senator Loni Hancock, a Berkeley Democrat. ''But it seems like Amazon doesn't really care about the State of California or the people whose lives are affected by whether or not we have enough money for schools and roads and to keep the libraries and parks open.''
Any Californian who buys a book or a DVD player from Amazon is supposed to pay a use tax when filing state taxes. In practice, however, few do. For years, the issue has been simmering. Then came the withering recession, and the economic calculus changed.
In the two months since the law took effect, Amazon has declined to start collecting sales tax in California. Once it submits the signatures for the referendum and they are verified, the law will be suspended until the vote.
Senator Hancock and other Democrats say they have stopped shopping at Amazon. ''This is getting pretty acrimonious,'' said the California treasurer, Bill Lockyer, who said he was also boycotting the retailer. ''It's snarly.''
Amazon, which declined to comment for this article, is trying to head off the urgency measure by drafting new legislation that is more to its liking. The warehouses it is offering to build would ordinarily be the kind of physical presence in the state that would clearly require it to collect sales taxes, but Amazon's proposed measure would guarantee the retailer an exemption. Gov. Jerry Brown and the Democrats have already rejected the offer.
To pass the urgency bill, the 25 Democrats in the State Senate all need to support the measure and persuade at least two of the 15 Republicans to join them, a difficult prospect but not an impossible one. If the legislation fails -- or if Democrats, sensing they do not have the votes, do not bring it up -- it will be at least a moral victory for Amazon.
But not a final one. The California Retailers Association will most likely sue to have Amazon's referendum canceled, arguing that the state constitution forbids using a referendum to tamper with the budget.
The struggle is proving divisive. Immediately after the law was passed at the end of June, Amazon cut off its California affiliates. These were the thousands of Web sites that referred customers to the retailer's site in return for a cut of the transaction. If they constituted a physical presence under the law, Amazon wanted to be rid of them.
For some of the affiliates abruptly cast adrift, this was merely irritating; for others, it was a threat to their livelihood. Glenn Richards, an Orange County musician, is in the first group, but he is nevertheless angry at Amazon.
''I used to spend thousands and thousands of dollars with Amazon on computers and musical equipment,'' said Mr. Richards, 40. Not anymore: ''People have to look in the mirror and ask themselves, 'Are these short-term fixes of saving a dollar here and a dollar there the right thing to do?' ''
Sabrina Nelson, who lives in suburban Los Angeles, is the opposite: full of rage at the state. She and her husband, Jeff, are the proprietors of Vegsource.com, a resource for vegans, and they say Amazon's move deprived them of a healthy chunk of their income.
''Why didn't these legislators who supposedly represent me care about us?'' asked Ms. Nelson, who is in her mid-40s. ''They did this law for Wal-Mart and Macy's and Target. But the genie is not going back into the bottle. You're not going to stop people from buying on the Internet.''
Nick Loper, 28, forced to choose between being an Amazon affiliate and being a Californian, decided to move. He says his shopping comparison and referral site, ShoeSniper.com, was on track to do $250,000 in revenue this year. When Amazon said it would no longer pay Mr. Loper his commission, most of that disappeared.
''I always figured my own stupid decisions would put me out of business, not some stupid law that doesn't benefit anyone,'' Mr. Loper said.
A few weeks ago, Mr. Loper took his virtual store and his physical body 200 miles to the east, just over the Nevada state line. He now lives in a one-room apartment. On weekends, he commutes back to his wife in Livermore, not far from San Francisco.
Despite all the trouble the issue has caused him, he says he sees both sides of the argument -- and no simple resolution. ''In the two months since the law passed, no online store has said they're going to comply,'' Mr. Loper said. ''The state is chasing money that doesn't exist.''

HEADLINE: Concentration in Wireless Markets

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
In its suit to block AT&T's $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile, the Justice Department leans heavily on the argument that consolidated market power is bad for consumers. More companies in an industry mean more competition and all the benefits that flow from competition -- lower prices, more choices and more innovation. 
That is a basic principle of economics and antitrust - and it is seemingly irrefutable. The yardstick that the Justice Department applied to its merger analysis is a standard, if complex, tool to measure market concentration, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, or HHI for short. Markets with HHI readings above 2,500, the government's complaint states, are ''highly concentrated.''
The merger would increase the concentration of the cellular industry in the United States to 3,320, by the HHI scale, up from 2,744 before. But note that even if AT&T does not acquire T-Mobile, the American wireless market is and will remain highly concentrated. An international comparison of market concentration, published this week by the Columbia Institute for Tele-Information, shows that the wireless markets in most nations are highly concentrated.
In fact, the merger would move the United States from ''toward the bottom to well in the middle of the pack'' in terms of consolidated market power in the wireless industry, said Eli Noam, an economist at the Columbia University Business School and director of the telecommunications research institute.
The research group's data show the historical trends in landline and wireless phone service. In wireless, the story in the United States is one of a patchwork of regional businesses being rolled up over the years.
In telecommunications, the market concentration itself is not surprising. The telephone business, after all, has long been one of the classic examples of an industry that exhibits the forces that lead toward ''natural monopolies,'' or at least oligopolies. Those forces include high fixed costs - the investment needed to build out networks - and the efficiencies that come from providing services to millions of customers.
The drive to build out more sophisticated, higher-speed wireless networks will considerably increase the capital costs for network carriers. ''That will almost certainly increase the natural forces of market concentration,'' Mr. Noam noted.
But if markets are inevitably concentrated, Mr. Noam said, the policy challenge is to make the big players compete in the interests of consumers. ''There are ways,'' he said, ''to prevent monopolists or oligopolists from becoming lazy.''
The three options, Mr Noam explained, are regulation, antitrust and doing nothing -- betting that technological change will shake up markets.
The Justice Department is betting on options two and three. By blocking the merger, it hopes to keep the assets of T-Mobile out of AT&T's hands. Those assets -- in whole or in part -- will pass to one or several companies, enhancing competition and choice, in theory.
If the Justice Department succeeds, there may not be a lot more competition. But at least, the government asserts, AT&T will be forced to compete on its own rather than by removing a rival from the marketplace.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Losing Billions, Postal Service Is Near Default

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The United States Postal Service has long lived on the financial edge, but it has never been as close to the precipice as it is today: the agency is so low on cash that it will not be able to make a $5.5 billion payment due this month and may have to shut down entirely this winter unless Congress takes emergency action to stabilize its finances.
''Our situation is extremely serious,'' the postmaster general, Patrick R. Donahoe, said in an interview. ''If Congress doesn't act, we will default.''
In recent weeks, Mr. Donahoe has been pushing a series of painful cost-cutting measures to erase the agency's deficit, which will reach $9.2 billion this fiscal year. They include eliminating Saturday mail delivery, closing up to 3,700 postal locations and laying off 120,000 workers -- nearly one-fifth of the agency's work force -- despite a no-layoffs clause in the unions' contracts. 
The post office's problems stem from one hard reality: it is being squeezed on both revenue and costs.
As any computer user knows, the Internet revolution has led to people and businesses sending far less conventional mail.
At the same time, decades of contractual promises made to unionized workers, including no-layoff clauses, are increasing the post office's costs. Labor represents 80 percent of the agency's expenses, compared with 53 percent at United Parcel Service and 32 percent at FedEx, its two biggest private competitors. Postal workers also receive more generous health benefits than most other federal employees.
The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee will hold a hearing on the agency's predicament on Tuesday. So far, feuding Democrats and Republicans in Congress, still smarting from the brawl over the federal debt ceiling, have failed to agree on any solutions. It doesn't help that many of the options for saving the postal service are politically unpalatable.
''The situation is dire,'' said Thomas R. Carper, the Delaware Democrat who is chairman of the Senate subcommittee that oversees the postal service. ''If we do nothing, if we don't react in a smart, appropriate way, the postal service could literally close later this year. That's not the kind of development we need to inject into a weak, uneven economic recovery.''
Missing the $5.5 billion payment due on Sept. 30, intended to finance retirees' future health care, won't cause immediate disaster. But sometime early next year, the agency will run out of money to pay its employees and gas up its trucks, officials warn, forcing it to stop delivering the roughly three billion pieces of mail it handles weekly.
The causes of the crisis are well known and immensely difficult to overcome.
Mail volume has plummeted with the rise of e-mail, electronic bill-paying and a Web that makes everything from fashion catalogs to news instantly available. The system will handle an estimated 167 billion pieces of mail this fiscal year, down 22 percent from five years ago.
It's difficult to imagine that trend reversing, and pessimistic projections suggest that volume could plunge to 118 billion pieces by 2020. The law also prevents the post office from raising postage fees faster than inflation.
Meanwhile, the agency has had a tough time cutting its costs to match the revenue drop, with a history of labor contracts offering good health and pension benefits, underused post offices, and laws that restrict its ability to make basic business decisions, like reducing the frequency of deliveries.
Congress is considering numerous emergency proposals -- most notably, allowing the post office to recover billions of dollars that management says it overpaid to its employees' pension funds. That fix would help the agency get through the short-term crisis, but would delay the day of reckoning on bigger issues.
The agency's leaders acknowledge that they must find a way to increase revenue, something that will prove far harder than simply slicing costs.
In some countries, post offices double as banks or sell insurance or cellphones. In the United States, the postal service is barred from entering many areas. Still, the agency is considering ideas, like gaining the right to deliver wine and beer, allowing commercial advertisements on postal trucks and in post offices, doing more ''last-mile'' deliveries for FedEx and U.P.S. and offering special hand-delivery services for correspondence and transactions for which e-mail is not considered secure enough.
Mr. Donahoe's hope is to cut $20 billion of the $75 billion in annual costs by 2015. To do that, he wants to close many post offices and slash the number of sorting facilities to 200 from 500 and trim the agency's work force by 220,000 people, from its current 653,000. (A decade ago, the agency employed nearly 900,000.)
The postal service has the legal authority to close facilities, although community opposition can make the process difficult. To placate critics and cut costs, officials say they would seek to run some postal operations out of stores like Wal-Mart or to share space with other government offices.
Cutting the work force is more difficult. The agency's labor contracts have long guaranteed no layoffs to the vast majority of its workers, and management agreed to a new no layoff-clause in a major union contract last May.
But now, faced with what postal officials call ''the equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy,'' the agency is asking Congress to enact legislation that would overturn the job protections and let it lay off 120,000 workers in addition to trimming 100,000 jobs through attrition.
The postal service is also asking Congress for permission to end Saturday delivery.
Given the vast range of stakeholders, getting consensus on a rescue plan will be difficult.
Senator Susan Collins of Maine, like many lawmakers from rural states, vigorously opposes ending Saturday delivery, which would trim only 2 percent from the agency's budget. Ms. Collins, the ranking Republican on the committee overseeing the postal service, said the cutback would be tough on people in small towns who receive prescriptions and newspapers by mail.
''The postmaster general has focused on several approaches that I believe will be counterproductive,'' she said. ''They risk producing a death spiral where the postal service reduces service and drives away more customers.''
The post office's powerful unions are angry and alarmed about the planned layoffs. ''We're going to fight this and we're going to fight it hard,'' said Cliff Guffey, president of the American Postal Workers Union, which represents 207,000 mail sorters and post office clerks. ''It's illegal for them to abrogate our contract.''
Senators Carper and Collins do back several of the postal service's main ideas to avoid default, including recovering around $60 billion that some actuaries say the agency has overpaid into two pension funds. Although the Obama administration is working closely with the senators to find a solution, it has signaled discomfort with the pension proposals, questioning whether the postal service really overpaid.
Meanwhile, Representative Darrell Issa, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Oversight Committee, says the pension proposals would amount to an unjustifiable bailout that would not solve the agency's underlying problems. He is pushing a bill that would create an emergency oversight board that could order huge cost-cutting and void the postal service's contracts -- a proposal that not just the unions, but Senators Carper and Collins oppose.
Fredric V. Rolando, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, warned of disaster if partisanship keeps Congress from acting.
''This is about one of America's oldest institutions,'' he said. ''It survived the telegraph, it survived the telephone, and we have to do everything we can to preserve it and adapt.''

HEADLINE: Japan's Latest Prime Minister: We hope he surprises his country with strong and creative leadership

 BODY:
Little remains of the bright promises of reform that swept Japan's Democratic Party to power two years ago. The ruling Democrats' choice of Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda to become prime minister -- the party's third since that historic election -- is uninspired and unlikely to provide the strong and creative leadership Japan needs to recover from the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster or its longer-term economic malaise. 
Mr. Noda was the party politicians' choice, not the public's. He avoided stumbles as finance minister over the last year, but his positions on broader policy issues are not reassuring.
His unrepentant nationalism -- he argues that Japan's World War II leaders were not war criminals because they were convicted by an international court, rather than a Japanese one -- will further fan tensions with China and South Korea. He wants good relations with Washington, but his low-key leadership will make it hard for him to rally support for the deeply unpopular agreement to relocate the American Air Force base on Okinawa.
Worst of all, he offers no bold solutions for Japan's chronic economic problems -- two decades of sputtering growth, compounded by a global crisis, a rising yen and this spring's disasters. The tax increases he favors to pay for rebuilding should be deferred until the economy strengthens. Right now, they would plunge Japan into deeper recession and set back global recovery.
Mr. Noda is right to insist that Japan reduce its huge debt burden, but his immediate priority must be reconstruction and reviving domestic demand. He will need to re-energize the drive for market and regulatory reform.
Japan's last effective prime minister was Junichiro Koizumi, a Liberal Democrat, who retired five years ago. Since then, five undistinguished successors have rotated through the job. We hope Mr. Noda can break that trend.
Washington is weary of dealing with Japan's revolving-door prime ministers. When Mr. Noda attends the United Nations General Assembly this month, President Obama should invite him to the White House. They need to talk about managing relations with China, how to roll back North Korea's nuclear program and preventing a double-dip global recession. That is more than can be handled in a courtesy visit on the sidelines of U.N. meetings.

HEADLINE: Inmate Visits Now Carry Added Cost In Arizona

BYLINE: By ERICA GOODE

 BODY:
For the Arizona Department of Corrections, crime has finally started to pay.
New legislation allows the department to impose a $25 fee on adults who wish to visit inmates at any of the 15 prison complexes that house state prisoners. The one-time ''background check fee'' for visitors, believed to be the first of its kind in the nation, has angered prisoner advocacy groups and family members of inmates, who in many cases already shoulder the expense of traveling long distances to the remote areas where many prisons are located.
David C. Fathi, director of the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, called the fee ''mind-boggling'' and said that while it was ostensibly intended to help the state -- the money will be used to repair and maintain the prisons -- it could ultimately have a negative effect on public safety. 
''We know that one of the best things you can do if you want people to go straight and lead a law-abiding life when they get out of prison is to continue family contact while they're in prison,'' he said. ''Talk about penny-wise and pound-foolish.''
One woman, whose brother is a prisoner at the Eyman complex in Florence, said that most of her family lives out of state, so the fee is an additional burden on top of the travel costs.
''What will happen is that people will just stop visiting,'' said the woman, adding that most prisoners ''live for'' visits from relatives. Because some friends of the family still do not know of her brother's incarceration, she asked to be identified only by her first name, Shauna. She was one of several dozen family members of inmates who complained to Middle Ground Prison Reform, a group based in Tempe, about the fee.
In a lawsuit filed last month against the Corrections Department, Middle Ground said the fee was simply a pretext for raising money ''for general public purposes'' and as such was unconstitutional because it amounted to a special tax on a single group.
Middle Ground has also filed suit over another provision of the law, which imposes a 1 percent charge on deposits made to a prisoner's spending account.
Donna Leone Hamm, executive director of Middle Ground, said she thought that state legislators created the background check fee ''out of sheer financial desperation'' at a time when the state faces huge budget shortfalls.
''This was a scheme -- in my mind, a harebrained scheme -- to try to come up with the money,'' she said.
Wendy Baldo, chief of staff for the Arizona Senate, confirmed that the fees were intended to help make up the $1.6 billion deficit the state faced at the beginning of the year.
''We were trying to cut the budget and think of ways that could help get some services for the Department of Corrections,'' Ms. Baldo said. She added that the department ''needed about $150 million in building renewal and maintenance and prior to this year, it just wasn't getting done and it wasn't a safe environment for the people who were in prison and certainly for the people who worked there.''
Ms. Baldo said the money would not actually pay for background checks but would go into a fund for maintenance and repairs to the prisons.
Barrett Marson, a spokesman for the Corrections Department, said in an e-mail that it was the department's policy not to comment on pending litigation.
Although there have been some calls and letters from potential visitors inquiring about the fee and how to pay it, no complaints had been reported from inmates, Mr. Marson said. The department has not determined whether the number of visitors to the prisons has changed since the charge went into effect, he added.
''Maintenance funds for our buildings are scarce in this difficult economic time,'' he said. ''A $25 visitation fee helps to ensure our prisons remain safe environments for staff, inmates and visitors.''
Ms. Hamm, the Middle Ground director who is also a retired lower court judge and married to a former inmate, said that an earlier proposal presented to a legislative committee would have imposed the background check fee on everyone who visited inmates, including babies and children. But in the end, the Legislature limited the fees to people over 18.
The law also allows the Corrections Department to waive all or part of the background check fee in certain circumstances -- for example, when an applicant just wants permission to telephone an inmate.
Ms. Hamm said that research by her organization could not find any other example of a state prison system imposing a fee on visitors.
The Arizona Corrections Department, Ms. Hamm said, has run perfunctory checks on visitors for years. In its application form, the department requires visitors to provide their name, date of birth and a driver's license or other photo identification number. Providing a Social Security number on the application is optional, and no fingerprints are required.
Another state agency, the Department of Public Safety, conducts free background checks for people who want to review their own records and who provide fingerprints, said Carrick Cook, a spokesman.
The Public Safety Department charges $20 for criminal background checks of people who are hired as volunteers for state agencies, and $24 for checks on paid state workers, both of which involve fingerprinting. A fingerprint clearance card, required for child care and foster care workers in Arizona, costs $65 for volunteers and $69 for paid employees.
Shauna, whose brother is at the Eyman complex, said she learned about the fee after she filed applications for her brother's son, a Mormon missionary in Kentucky who wanted to visit his father, along with a friend and two other relatives.
She was told that the best way to pay the fee was electronically, through Western Union, but was unable to get the system to work, she said.
She was then advised to send a money order. Despite confirmation by United Parcel Service that the package had been delivered, the Corrections Department told her that the $100 payment -- four $25 money orders for four visitors -- had not been received, she said.
Another $100 payment was sent, and on Friday -- months after she began the application process -- she finally got confirmation of the payment from the department.
''I have now spent $200 of my own money to get family in,'' she said, adding that it could take up to 60 days for the department to approve the applications.

HEADLINE: A Dilemma, a Promise, a Voice: After the Storm: In North Jersey, Obama Vows Federal Help, Not Washington Politics

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN; Elizabeth A. Harris contributed reporting from New York, and Jackie Calmes from Washington.

 BODY:
PATERSON, N.J. -- President Obama, surveying some of the most crippling flood damage from Tropical Storm Irene, vowed on Sunday that budgetary wrangling in Washington would not delay federal aid to stricken communities.
In a three-hour visit to North Jersey, which is struggling to clean up the muddy mess left last week by the area's worst flooding in more than a century, Mr. Obama went house to house meeting with residents who pointed out the high-water marks that stained the walls of their living rooms.
Later, standing on a bridge spanning the still-swollen Passaic River, the president assured flood victims that they did not have to doubt whether the federal government would follow through with disaster aid. The House majority leader, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, and other Republicans have suggested that additional aid money must first be offset by equal spending cuts, a prospect that Mr. Obama rejected. 
''The entire country is behind you,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I want to make it very clear that we are going to meet our federal obligations.''
For as much as the White House and lawmakers throughout the Northeast have asserted that the government's response to the storm should not be a political issue, Mr. Obama's visit carried an unmistaken political subtext on several fronts.
After Air Force One landed at Newark Liberty International Airport, Mr. Obama, a Democrat, was greeted warmly by Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, whom some Republicans have all but begged to enter the race to try to unseat Mr. Obama next year.
Talk of Mr. Christie's viability as a presidential candidate again flared up on Sunday, as Michael Gerson, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, suggested during an appearance on ABC's ''This Week'' that Mr. Christie was ''actively'' considering whether to seek the Republican nomination. People close to Mr. Christie continued to deny that was the case.
And here in Paterson, New Jersey's third-largest city and once a prosperous factory hub, Mr. Obama found the kind of economic desolation that his administration has been unable to turn around. The president spent part of the weekend polishing a job-creation address that he was scheduled to deliver to a joint session of Congress on Thursday, the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said.
Flood-stricken communities have seen visits in recent days from a phalanx of federal officials, who have seemed determined to convey a level of attentiveness that was notably absent after Hurricane Katrina. The federal homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, and the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, W. Craig Fugate, surveyed the flooding here and in the Catskill region in New York on Wednesday, and Mr. Fugate accompanied the president on his visit Sunday.
Mr. Obama landed at Newark at noon on Sunday, flew by helicopter to Essex County Airport and then headed to flood-stricken Passaic County. One person along his car route held up a sign that pleaded, ''Help Us.''
In Wayne, just to the west of here, Mr. Obama walked along Fayette Avenue, where waterlogged dry wall, carpeting and household appliances lined the residential street. Mr. Obama talked with several residents about the flooding, telling one of them, ''Just want to let you know we're going to be here.''
The president arrived in downtown Paterson about 1:30 p.m., where orange-and-white plastic barriers blocked off streets and hundreds of people lined the sidewalks along Main Street to greet Mr. Obama's motorcade, cheering loudly when it passed. Later, the president visited a Lowe's home-improvement store where volunteers handed out food and supplies to victims of the flood.
Standing alongside the Passaic River, Mr. Obama praised Mr. Christie, FEMA personnel and local officials for their farsightedness in responding to the storm, saying that their response ''helped to avert even worse tragedies.''
On Sunday, FEMA expanded its major disaster declaration for New Jersey to include the entire state, and the president said his main message in visiting was to stress that no one had to worry about the federal government's following through with its promises of aid to people affected by the storm.
''We're one country, and when one part of the country gets affected, whether it's a tornado in Joplin, Mo., or a hurricane that affects the Eastern Seaboard, then we come together as one country and we make sure that everybody gets the help that they need,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And the last thing that the residents here of Paterson or the residents of Vermont or the residents of upstate New York need is Washington politics getting in the way.''
Mr. Christie has been a blunt critic of the president in the past. But he has had nothing but praise for the president in recent days, complimenting his administration's focused response to the storm. He also split from Mr. Cantor and other Republican leaders last week in saying it would be inexcusable to delay federal disaster aid until other spending cuts could be achieved.
Representative Steven R. Rothman, a Democrat from North Jersey, praised both Mr. Obama and Mr. Christie, saying they had clearly put aside their political differences.
''To the credit of both gentlemen, they are dedicated public servants, doing their best to meet their responsibilities,'' Mr. Rothman said. ''It was just as it's supposed to be: a showing of support.''

CABLES OFFER GLIMPSES
INTO U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS
A July 2009 cable posted on the WikiLeaks Web site last week is one of hundreds from the American Embassy in Beijing that offer a glimpse into the depths, and heights, of relations between the United States and Chinese governments. The cables cover topics ranging from China's claims on the South China Sea to the daily exercise regimen that the Chongqing Communist Party secretary, Bo Xilai, designed for himself. Page A4
SOCIAL DEMOCRATS' VICTORY 
Parties on the German left prevailed in a regional election in the northeastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, with the center-left Social Democrats swept back to power and the Greens elected to the regional parliament for the first time, according to preliminary results.

Iceland has taken an unusual step in the strange annals of the world financial crisis: it is pursuing criminal charges against a politician, former Prime Minister Geir Haarde, for his government's failure to avert the nation's fiscal collapse. If found guilty by a special court, Mr. Haarde, a stalwart of the conservative Independence Party, faces a maximum sentence of two years in prison. Page A7
NUCLEAR PLANT OPERATIONAL
Iran's first nuclear power plant has finally begun to provide electricity to the national grid, the official news media reported, a long-delayed milestone in the nuclear ambitions of a country the West fears is covertly trying to develop atomic weapons. The start-up will come as a relief to Tehran after many years of delays and false starts. It hopes the plant it hopes will show the world it has joined the nuclear club. Page A9

FOR VERMONT DAIRY FARMERS,
THE FLOOD CRISIS CONTINUES
The flooding unleashed a week ago by the remnants of Hurricane Irene played havoc with farms across Vermont. Rushing waters left fields of silt-caked corn matted down on its side. But for livestock farmers -- especially the dairy farmers who are a symbol of Vermont -- the toll has been more gut-wrenching, and the crisis has lasted longer, as they have struggled to take care of their animals.

HOSTILITY AMONG VOTERS
Typically, economic conditions frame the political debate. But in the fight over raising the federal debt limit, the political debate also influenced economic conditions -- and not for the better. Thus, both parties are playing with this politically combustible material: the hostility of voters who see them as not merely failing to solve economic problems but, in fact, actively compounding them.

ROMNEY AT TEA PARTY RALLY
Mitt Romney's keynote speech at a Tea Party Express rally in a Concord, N.H., park was perhaps more notable for what did not happen -- there were no fiery clashes with Tea Party protesters, or angry hecklers -- than for what did -- Mr. Romney delivered a lively version of his standard stump speech.

PERSON: Julio Casas Regueiro 

HEADLINE: Julio Casas Regueiro, Cuba's Defense Chief, Dies at 75

BYLINE: By VICTORIA BURNETT

 BODY:
HAVANA -- Gen. Julio Casas Regueiro, the Cuban defense minister, who spent two decades at the helm of the military's powerful complex of businesses and was a close associate of President Raul Castro, died Saturday in Havana. He was 75.
The cause was heart failure, according to a statement issued by the Cuban Communist Party's Politburo and published in several state-run newspapers. 
General Casas was also a vice president of the Council of State, Cuba's highest governing body. His death is a reminder of the cloud of mortality over Cuba's aging leadership as it tries to reinvigorate the island's weak socialist economy by culling public sector jobs and allowing more private enterprise.
Mr. Castro is 80, as is his top deputy, Jose Ramon Machado Ventura. The president's brother, Fidel Castro, who led the country for decades but who no longer holds any official position, turned 85 last month.
While General Casas was not among the famous heroes of the Cuban revolution, he occupied an important place close to Raul Castro, who has brought more of the country's state-owned enterprises under the military's umbrella since he formally took over from his ailing brother in 2008.
The Cuban military runs real estate businesses, factories, supermarkets and even a large tour operator, Gaviota. Its companies, many of which generate much-needed hard currency, enjoy a reputation for efficiency in a country dogged by mismanagement and a bloated bureaucracy.
When he announced General Casas' promotion to defense minister in 2008, Raul Castro praised his ''brilliant'' work and fiscal prudence.
According to a transcript published on the Web site of Granma, the Cuban Communist Party newspaper, Mr. Castro said he could not ''remember once saying anything critical of our friend Julio Casas, except that he is -- as we Cubans say -- stingy.''
General Casas was the only person authorized to overrule President Castro on economic issues, and he often did, Mr. Castro added, rejecting pet projects that would absorb scarce state money.
Julio Casas Regueiro was born in Mayari Arriba, in eastern Cuba, on Feb. 16, 1936.
He enrolled at a business school, and as a student he began collaborating with the rebels who were trying to overthrow the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista.
Mr. Casas went on to work as an accountant at a bank in Santiago de Cuba, but in June 1957 he left the city to help the revolutionary forces, eventually joining their ranks and fighting under Raul Castro.
After the Castros swept to victory on Jan. 1, 1959, Mr. Casas joined the leadership of the National Revolutionary Police, with whom he fought against the Cuban exiles who took part in the United States-backed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961.
He moved that year to the armed forces, where he rose through the ranks to become deputy defense minister and chief of the military's economic activities, including its sprawling business interests, in the late 1980s.
During a military career that was shaped by Fidel Castro's cold war alliances and his interventions in Africa, he was trained at a Soviet military academy and served in Ethiopia in the late 1970s.
In February 2008, General Casas became the only person to fill the top military post since the 1959 revolution other than Raul Castro, who had held the job for nearly 50 years before giving it up to succeed his brother as president. During the Communist Party's sixth congress in April, General Casas was also elected to the 15-member Politburo.
He was cremated, according to his wishes, Granma said. The government declared three days of mourning, and his ashes will sit in state on Monday at the Defense Ministry on Havana's vast Revolution Plaza.

HEADLINE: Hostility Among Voters As Politics Hurt Economy

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - President Obama's renewed engagement with Congressional Republicans this week may seem all too familiar, but it comes with a darkly unpredictable component.
That is because over the summer, the ideological battles and partisan maneuvers woven into the fabric of the capital began to exert their own damaging effect on the economy, analysts from Washington to Wall Street have concluded.
Typically, economic conditions frame the political debate. But in the fight over raising the federal debt limit, the political debate also influenced economic conditions - and not for the better. Last week's unemployment report showing no job growth in August provided new evidence that the simultaneous erosion of confidence in the economy and in the government has harmed prospects for American workers and businesses. 
Thus in the post-Labor Day chapter of divided government, both parties are playing with this politically combustible material: the hostility of voters who see them as not merely failing to solve economic problems but, in fact, actively compounding them. The immediate legislative question is whether rising anxiety can drive Republicans and Democrats toward consensus solutions. So far, there is scant evidence of that happening, as the squabble over scheduling the president's address to Congress made clear.
White House advisers say Mr. Obama, exasperated with Republicans' refusal to cooperate, is preparing to use his speech on Thursday to fight for an ambitious job-creation proposal costing hundreds of billions of dollars.
But Republicans, ridiculing the idea of another stimulus, show limited interest in bargaining - even on tax-cut ideas they previously backed.
Both of those calculations now involve heightened risks as the 2012 elections approach.
The president is in the most conspicuous jeopardy. But Congressional Republicans are heading into these new skirmishes with their careers on the line, too.
Eroding Confidence
What makes political attitudes so economically consequential now is the role that consumer and business confidence plays in determining whether the stalled recovery kicks into gear - or slips back into recession.
Since the 2008 financial crisis, Americans shaken by job losses, stagnant wages and falling home values have been borrowing less and spending less. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York calculated this year that this ''deleveraging'' has siphoned $480 billion annually from the cash flow of American consumers.
No one expects that lost spending to return. But the more pessimistic consumers feel, the less likely it is that businesses will see profit in hiring new workers and investing in additional production with the cash now filling their coffers.
Research by the Republican pollster Bill McInturff and his Democratic counterpart Peter Hart for the financial television network CNBC showed that confidence was weak even before the final negotiations over the debt ceiling last month. By June, just 29 percent of Americans expected their wages to rise in the next year; 50 percent called it a bad time to invest in the stock market; and 30 percent expected their home values to decrease soon, compared with just 15 percent who expected an increase.
Since then, Mr. McInturff said, the infighting in Washington has eroded consumer confidence further than economic conditions themselves might have warranted. Mr. Hart reached the same conclusion in separate research for Citibank that showed Americans with diminishing expectations for recovery even as their assessment of current conditions remained unchanged since January.
The combination of economic and political consequences represents the voters' version of the Standard & Poor's downgrade of United States debt. If the stock market volatility that followed the S.&P. downgrade is any indication, 2012 candidates face an unusual level of turbulence.
Hazards in Forecasting
The Obama administration's own midsession review of economic conditions projected growth of less than 2 percent in 2011, with unemployment remaining at 9 percent through 2012. That has Republicans recalling some iconic bad-news elections for White House incumbents.
In 1980, Ronald Reagan demolished President Jimmy Carter and led Republicans to a gain of 34 House seats and a takeover of the Senate.
In 1992, Bill Clinton defeated President George Bush. But the fact that Democrats lost nine House seats while winning the presidency that year should serve as a warning for Congressional Republicans. Sitting presidents may be the most natural targets for anti-incumbent sentiment, but they're not the only ones.
That is why Democrats increasingly favor the iconography of 1948, when President Harry S. Truman redirected voters' ire toward a ''do-nothing'' Republican Congress. He not only salvaged his own election but also helped Democrats win back control of Capitol Hill.
It's far from clear that Mr. Obama could reproduce such an outcome - or whether Republican lawmakers could adjust even if they saw it coming. At the moment, most House Republicans fear Tea Party opposition in primaries more than the anger of swing voters in November.
But forecasting this ''new phase of the American political dialogue,'' as Mr. McInturff called it in a recent report, carries escalating hazards for strategists on both sides. ''This type of deep voter anger, unease and economic pessimism,'' he wrote, ''leads to unstable and unpredictable political outcomes.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Debate Arises on Job Creation vs. Environmental Regulation

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH and JOHN BRODER

 BODY:
Do environmental regulations kill jobs?
Republicans and business groups say yes, arguing that environmental protection is simply too expensive for a battered economy. They were quick to claim victory Friday after the Obama administration abandoned stricter ozone pollution standards.
Many economists agree that regulation comes with undeniable costs that can affect workers. Factories may close because of the high cost of cleanup, or owners may relocate to countries with weaker regulations.
But many experts say that the effects should be assessed through a nuanced tally of costs and benefits that takes into account both economic and societal factors. Some argue that the costs can be offset as companies develop cheaper ways to clean up pollutants, and others say that regulation is often blamed for job losses that occur for different reasons, like a stagnant economy. As companies develop new technologies to cope with regulatory requirements, some new jobs are created.
What's more, some economists say, previous regulations, like the various amendments to the Clean Air Act, have resulted in far lower costs and job losses than industrial executives initially feared. 
For example, when the Environmental Protection Agency first proposed amendments to the Clean Air Act aimed at reducing acid rain caused by power plant emissions, the electric utility industry warned that they would cost $7.5 billion and tens of thousands of jobs. But the cost of the program has been closer to $1 billion, said Dallas Burtraw, an economist at Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research group on the environment. And the E.P.A., in a paper published this year, cited studies showing that the law had been a modest net creator of jobs through industry spending on technology to comply with it.
The question of just how much environmental regulation hurts jobs is a particularly delicate one as leaders in Washington debate the best ways to address the nation's stubbornly high unemployment rate. As President Obama prepares for an important speech on Thursday focusing on job creation, Republicans are pushing for a rollback in environmental regulations that they say saddle companies with onerous costs that curtail jobs without leading to significant improvement in environmental or public health.
Part of the problem in evaluating the costs of regulation is that there have been few systematic studies of such costs after regulations are imposed.
''Regulations are put on the books and largely stay there unexamined,'' said Michael Greenstone, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''This is part of the reason that these debates about regulations have a Groundhog's Day quality to them.''
Mr. Greenstone has conducted one of the few studies that actually measure job losses related to environmental rules. In researching the amendments to the Clean Air Act that affected polluting plants from 1972 and 1987, he found that those companies lost almost 600,000 jobs compared with what would have happened without the regulations.
But Mr. Greenstone has also conducted research showing that clean air regulations have reduced infant mortality and increased housing prices, and indeed many economists argue that job losses should not be considered in isolation. They say the costs of regulations are dwarfed by the gains in lengthened lives, reduced hospitalizations and other health benefits, and by economic gains like the improvement to the real estate market.
Business groups also tend to cite regulation even if other factors are involved, critics say. The cement industry is currently warning that as many as 18 of the 100 cement plants currently operating in the United States could close down because of proposed stricter standards for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, resulting in the direct loss of 13,000 jobs.
An E.P.A. analysis of the proposed rules projects a much smaller effect, ranging from as few as 600 jobs lost to 1,300 jobs actually added in companies that make cleaner equipment.
Some cement plants could be at risk simply because of the economy. With the housing market on its knees, demand for cement is down by about 40 percent from its prerecession peak. According to Andy O'Hare, vice president for regulatory affairs at the Portland Cement Association, a trade group, about a third of the cement plants in the country are being shut off every other month.
That's precisely why imposing new regulations right now could be tricky. ''Even if these rules have benefits that justify the costs, there is still a separate question on when is the right time to impose these regulations,'' said John Graham, dean of the Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs and the head of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under President George W. Bush. ''These benefits, which are often quite substantial, tend to be long term before they are incurred. They don't necessarily help in this short-term precarious situation that we're in.''
As much as timing, many companies are seeking clarity, saying they are more concerned about knowing what the rules are -- and when and how much they will change -- than eliminating the rules altogether.
''The environmental regulations are a moving target,'' said Spencer Weitman, president of the National Cement Company of Alabama, a cement maker in Ragland, Ala. The company has suspended a $350 million project to build a new kiln because, it says, it cannot figure out which of three proposed standards it must meet. The firm has been cited by House Republicans as a case study in how environmental rules kill jobs, as National Cement estimated that it would take about 1,500 construction workers to build the kiln and then 20 to operate it on a permanent basis.
Mr. Weitman said the company, which has been asking the E.P.A. for clarification, worried that it would not be able to afford the technology required to comply with new standards. But, he said, ''we agree that we need to protect the environment and we need regulations in place to make sure that we all do it right. That's not the argument that we're coming up with. We do need regulations that are achievable and that make sense.''
For now, the Obama administration is moving ahead with plans for a number of other environmental rules, including regulations governing industrial emissions that cross state lines and toxic air pollution from power plants and factory boilers.
In issuing new regulations, the administration says it weighs job creation and economic growth as carefully as it does health, safety and environmental impacts, a commitment enshrined in an executive order signed by the president earlier this year.
House Republicans say the administration is engaged in a spasm of rule-making that is retarding the nation's economy and exacerbating persistently high unemployment. They have announced plans to review and repeal a catalog of environmental, labor and health care rules beginning this week.
Finding a middle ground is difficult, especially in the midst of heated political wrangling over how to cope with the sputtering economy. Businesses are focusing almost entirely on the costs. Environmental groups, meanwhile, tally up the benefits without paying much heed to the costs.
''My view is that the Republican claim that 'job-killing regulation' is a redundancy is as ridiculous as the left-wing view that 'job-killing regulation' is an oxymoron,'' said Cass Sunstein, head of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. ''Both are silly political claims that have no place in a serious discussion.''

HEADLINE: Back in France, Strauss-Kahn Is Eye of Media Tornado

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Alison Smale and Jonathan J. Li contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PARIS -- It was not quite like the arrival of a pope, with a kiss of the tarmac, but the press attention was comparable on Sunday morning when a relieved Dominique Strauss-Kahn returned to France.
With charges of attempted rape against him dropped, but having had to resign his job as managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Mr. Strauss-Kahn was free to come home to a country still shocked and mystified about how a potential president on the verge of a carefully planned political campaign could have been so reckless as to have had a sexual encounter, consensual or otherwise, with a hotel chambermaid.
With his Socialist Party deep into the presidential primary campaign and most of his closest allies having joined with other politicians, Mr. Strauss-Kahn's homecoming left the party uneasy. Even the party secretary, Martine Aubry, a candidate who would not have run if Mr. Strauss-Kahn had done so, distanced herself from him for the first time, telling French television last week, ''I think the same thing as many women regarding Strauss-Kahn's attitude to women.'' 
But from the moment that Mr. Strauss-Kahn and his wife, Anne Sinclair, stepped off Air France Flight 007 here, they were the smiling, silent eye of a media tornado, which was echoed in the nonstop, live television coverage on French cable news channels.
At the airport, surrounded by police officers who tried to keep the photographers and reporters at bay and serenaded by a man trying to sing Verdi, they smiled, waved and greeted a few supporters, but said nothing.
Nor did they speak when they arrived at the door of their apartment building on the chic Place des Vosges, though they were nearly crushed as he tried to press the code to open the door. Even once inside the courtyard, suddenly Mr. Strauss-Kahn noticed another television crew, and again he and Ms. Sinclair gave waves and big silent smiles of the kind they perfected in New York when faced with the press. Afterward, three men busied themselves with the luggage.
While a spokesman said that Mr. Strauss-Kahn, 62, would not speak to the news media on Sunday, nearly every other politician in France found the time to do so.
Francois Pupponi, an ally and mayor of the Paris suburb Sarcelles, where Mr. Strauss-Kahn had been mayor, said that Mr. Strauss-Kahn, known here as DSK, had no intention of joining the October primary for the May 2012 presidential race, but needed time to consider the future and relax.
''What's important is that he's back in France,'' Mr. Pupponi said. ''He's going to be able to think about the future with more clarity.'' He has much to offer France, Europe and the world in the future, Mr. Pupponi added.
Pierre Moscovici, a close ally who decided after the arrest to become campaign coordinator for the Socialist front-runner, Francois Hollande, said he had phoned to welcome the couple home after an ordeal that was, ''as he said himself, a test, a nightmare.'' Mr. Strauss-Kahn ''will speak to the French at a moment he will decide, and will do it, I think, without too much delay,'' Mr. Moscovici said. ''I wish him freedom to spend time with his friends and family, to rediscover France and also to reconstruct himself.'' In the future, he added, Mr. Strauss-Kahn ''will be useful to his country, useful to the left, and his recognized skills will find a new use.''
Gilles Finchelstein, who runs a research institution associated with his mentor, Mr. Strauss-Kahn, has been planning Mr. Strauss-Kahn's return to France, including how and when to speak to the news media. ''He owes an explanation to the French, and the French are waiting for it,'' he told Le Figaro. An unidentified friend of Mr. Strauss-Kahn's told the newspaper: ''It's simple. Dominique will have to answer two key questions: what happened in the Sofitel, and what is he going to do in politics.'' The maid worked at the Sofitel Hotel in New York; Mr. Strauss-Kahn was arrested May 14, and charges were dismissed Aug. 23.
Mr. Strauss-Kahn ''will not come back to a classic political life for several months, in any case,'' said another close ally, Jean-Marie Le Guen, a Socialist legislator who also joined Mr. Hollande. ''But DSK was one of the few people capable of helping Europe escape the crisis in which it is sinking, and we have need of men and women like DSK to get out of it.''
But others were less solicitous, especially at the summer conference of President Nicolas Sarkozy's party, Union for a Popular Movement. Xavier Bertrand, the labor minister, said Mr. Strauss-Kahn's return was a matter for the Socialists. ''I've got a lot of other things on my mind,'' he said.
Chantal Brunel, an outspoken U.M.P. legislator, said that Mr. Strauss-Kahn ''is going to be an indelible stain on the Socialist Party'' and will harm the chances of Ms. Aubry. ''When American justice annulled the charges against him, that shocked the French, and especially women,'' she said. ''It was three steps backward in the battle against violence against women.''
Another Socialist presidential candidate, Arnaud Montebourg, said that Mr. Strauss-Kahn should apologize to party colleagues and voters as he did to the International Monetary Fund staff in Washington. ''He should make the same gesture after the toll we have all had to bear in this affair,'' Mr. Montebourg said.
Mr. Strauss-Kahn's legal troubles are not over. He faces a civil trial in the United States brought by the hotel maid, and prosecutors here are investigating a complaint of attempted rape made against him in July by a novelist, Tristane Banon, for an encounter that took place in 2003. Mr. Strauss-Kahn denies it. Prosecutors will decide whether to prosecute the case, drop it or open a further judicial inquiry, and it is likely he will be called to testify.
The unease around Mr. Strauss-Kahn will not go away soon. Whatever his accomplishments, his name is now associated with a hotel maid and many tales of his promiscuity that have emerged since then. A former Socialist prime minister, Michel Rocard, caused a ruckus last week when he said that Mr. Strauss-Kahn ''obviously has a mental illness, trouble controlling his impulses.'' Mr. Rocard, 81, added: ''He's out of the game. It's a shame, he had real talent.''
But others think that if the Socialists win the presidency, Mr. Strauss-Kahn might be brought into government again as a minister. And as the election campaign unfolds, he is likely to be an influential critic of Mr. Sarkozy's policies while helping the Socialists build credibility on economic issues.
Still, feelings remain quite raw. After Mr. Strauss-Kahn and Ms. Sinclair arrived home, Reuters reported, a resident of their building could be heard shouting in the interior courtyard: ''You are a disgusting creature. Go and get cured somewhere else.''

HEADLINE: At a New Hampshire Tea Party Rally, Romney Speaks and Sparks Do Not Fly

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER and JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's keynote speech Sunday night at a Tea Party Express rally in Concord, N.H., was perhaps more notable for what did not happen - there were no fiery clashes with Tea Party protesters, or angry hecklers - than for what did - Mr. Romney delivered a lively version of his standard stump speech.
''I love this great land, I know we face extraordinary challenges, and I happen to believe that career politicians got us into this mess, and the career politicians can't get us out of this mess,'' Mr. Romney said. ''It will take someone who understands how the private economy works because he's worked in the private economy, and I have. I'm a business guy.'' 
Mr. Romney has never been a favorite of Tea Party supporters, who dislike the health care overhaul he carried out as governor of Massachusetts. And when he was announced as a speaker for the Tea Party Express national bus tour, FreedomWorks, a libertarian advocacy group that has fostered the growth of the Tea Party movement, withdrew in protest. Along with a coalition of a dozen other Tea Party and liberty groups, FreedomWorks also organized a protest before Mr. Romney's speech Sunday. But attendance at the protest was sparse, drawing a little more than a dozen supporters.
''We don't want him portrayed as New Hampshire's Tea Party candidate,'' said Jerry DeLemus, chairman of the Granite State Patriots Liberty P.A.C.
The Romney camp, however, came prepared for the protesters, showing up with dozens of Romney supporters in blue ''Romney'' shirts, and carrying blue and white Romney signs. When the candidate arrived at the rally in Rollins Park, they surrounded him hooting and clapping, and crowded around as he took the lectern, first standing and then sitting at the base of the stage. (Flipper Mitt, a man dressed in a dolphin costume passing out ''Mitt Flops,'' also managed to snag a front-row seat.)
Mr. Romney, who was preceded by his wife, Ann, emphasized his business background and years in the private sector, but also hit some themes popular with the Tea Party movement - namely, freedom.
''I believe in America,'' Mr. Romney said. ''I believe in our freedoms, our political freedom. I believe in our economic and personal freedoms. I believe in free enterprise, I believe in capitalism.''
He also assailed President Obama on the new report that showed zero job growth last month: ''Look, a shutout is O.K. in baseball - it's not good when you're talking jobs,'' he said.
FreedomWorks organizers circulated a seven-page memo detailing parts of Mr. Romney's record that they said were incompatible with Tea Party principles. The memo drew mostly on Mr. Romney's actions as governor of Massachusetts, focusing heavily on the healthcare legislation that he introduced in the state that conservatives criticize as being similar to Mr. Obama's federal healthcare legislation.
''When it comes to less government, which the Tea Party stands for, how could you possibly explain that with Romneycare?'' said Tim Carter, a co-leader of the Lakes Region Tea Party in New Hampshire, referring to the term some conservatives have adopted for Mr. Romney's healthcare legislation. ''It doesn't even compute.''
Though he has firmed up his conservative stances, some Republicans view him is a flip-flopper, and until recently, Mr. Romney has made very little concerted effort to reach out to Tea Party groups.
''It seems to me that Mitt Romney is treating this as a photo opp to check the box and to get the photo opp that he's cool with the Tea Party - and he's not cool with the Tea Party,'' said Adam Brandon, a spokesman for FreedomWorks. ''All of our activists are pretty peeved he would even try to embrace the Tea Party message.''
Mr. Brandon added: ''I think the only reason is because he's slipping in the polls. He's ignored us until this point, he's ignored all our issues.''
In recent days Mr. Romney has been ramping up his Tea Party outreach. Last week the Romney campaign announced that he would be attending a candidate forum over Labor Day weekend in Columbia, S.C., an event he had previously planned to skip. Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, the forum's host, is popular with social conservatives and Tea Party groups.
Jennifer Horn, the founder of We the People, a New Hampshire Tea Party group, also said Mr. Romney was the first candidate to accept an invitation to participate in a series of town-hall-style meetings her group is planning this fall.
Mr. Romney told Foster's, a New Hampshire newspaper, last month that he believed he could win the support of Tea Party voters.
''I want to appeal to the Tea Party voters,'' Mr. Romney told the paper's editorial board. ''I don't know what folks here in New Hampshire would say, but my guess is most Tea Partiers, or a lot of them, would support my candidacy.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: It's Still The 9/11 Era

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
Osama bin Laden is dead. So is Saddam Hussein, and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and too many Qaeda No. 3's to count. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is awaiting his military tribunal. George W. Bush is home on the ranch, Dick Cheney is on book tour, and even Gen. David Petraeus is a general no more, having traded in his stars for a civilian position atop the Central Intelligence Agency.
But 10 years to the week after the twin towers fell, we are still living in the 9/11 era. The names and faces are different, the White House has changed hands, and the country has turned its gaze from our distant wars to the economic crisis on the home front. But American foreign policy is still defined by the choices our leaders made while ground zero smoldered, and the objectives they set. Our approach to the world was fundamentally altered by 9/11, and nothing that's happened since has undone that transformation. 
Part of this transformation was tactical: a shift from a criminal justice approach to counterterrorism that emphasized investigations, arrests and successful prosecutions, to a wartime approach that emphasized detention, interrogation and assassination. The other part was strategic: a decision that America's national security required promoting democracy across the Muslim world -- by force of arms, if necessary -- rather than accepting the kind of stability that various dictators had promised to supply.
Taken together, these two shifts gave us the Bush administration's most controversial policies, from Guantanamo Bay and ''extraordinary rendition'' to the invasion of Iraq and the nation-building effort that followed. Some of those policies were walked back in the second Bush term. (The waterboard vanished from our interrogation repertoire, and there were no further wars of choice.) But the overall transformation endured.
It has endured under Barack Obama as well, his campaign promises notwithstanding. We are still fighting a war on terrorist groups, complete with the indefinite detention, drone attacks and covert warfare that infuriated civil libertarians during the Bush presidency. Meanwhile, Obama's first term has featured an expanded nation-building effort in Afghanistan, a regime-change operation in Libya, a possibly permanent military footprint in Iraq -- and the gradual adoption, amid the ferment of the Arab Spring, of Bush's freedom agenda rhetoric as well.
The question is whether this continuity is evidence of success or an example of the stay-the-course bias to which all governments are prone. Here it's worth asking a version of Ronald Reagan's famous question: Are we better off than we were 10 years ago?
The case for answering yes is strongest on the counterterrorism front, where our shadow war has clearly diminished our enemies' capacity to do us harm in ways that our pre-9/11 efforts never did.
There are significant moral costs to a policy that depends on routinized assassination and detention without trial. But 10 years without a major attack, the death of Osama bin Laden and the steady degradation of Al Qaeda and its affiliates are not achievements to be taken lightly. The United States will always be vulnerable to terrorists, but in the decade since we were blindsided by Mohammed Atta's team of hijackers, our spies and SEALs and interrogators have dramatically improved our odds.
On the strategic front, though, it is extremely difficult to argue that America's geopolitical position is stronger today than it was 10 years ago.
Some of this weakening was inevitable: Our extraordinary post-cold-war dominance couldn't last forever, and the rise of rival powers is a phenomenon to be managed rather than resisted. But our post-9/11 attempts to transform the Muslim world have cost trillions of dollars and thousands of lives, and won us -- well, what? A liberated Iraq that's more in Iran's sphere of influence than ours, an Afghan war in which American casualties keep rising, an Arab Spring that threatens to encircle Israel with enemies, a Middle East where our list of reliable allies grows thin ...
This list doesn't account for various counterfactuals (how much worse off we might be with Saddam Hussein in power, for instance). Nor does it account for democracy promotion's long-term benefits.
But after 10 years of conflict, we aren't exactly in short-term territory anymore. And pointing out that things could have been worse doesn't change the fact that our post-9/11 grand strategy has been associated with a steady erosion of America's position in the world.
In this context, the fact that President Obama has kept the United States enmeshed in occupations and interventions across the Muslim world isn't evidence that our strategy is working. It's a sign that he doesn't know how to get us out.
In my Aug. 22 column, I should have said that the Texas-Mexico border is 1,250 miles, not 1,969 miles. Also, Texas's black eighth graders were tied with their peers in Massachusetts for best score on the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress math exam. They did not beat all other states.

HEADLINE: Their Hopes Rising, Republicans Seek a Winner

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER and JEFF ZELENY; Ashley Parker reported from Manchester, N.H., and Jeff Zeleny from Des Moines.

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Roy Barbuto is on the hunt. For the past few months, he has been searching for the perfect Republican candidate, and he shows no signs of flagging.
Mr. Barbuto, 61, a service technician here, had already seen Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota (''She was excellent''), the former pizza executive Herman Cain (''He intrigues me, because here is a man who clearly knows what to do businesswise'') and former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts (''If he was elected, he could certainly do the job''). Now, he was finishing up dinner at a house party in Chichester, N.H., waiting to take a measure of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas.
''I'm not just looking for a candidate to beat the president,'' he explained. ''For me, the purpose of the next president is to restore the pride that this country has always had.''
In interviews with more than two dozen people in New Hampshire and Iowa over the Labor Day weekend, voters said they sensed a new vulnerability to President Obama. 
But while they expressed a strong sense of optimism in the prospect of winning the White House, they were looking for a candidate who could not only prevail in a general election, but be a forceful conservative leader for a tumultuous time.
''I'd like somebody who is really conservative, but can they beat Obama?'' asked Earl Rinker, 76, of Manchester, as he waited for a Perry event to begin. ''I do think that because of the nature of the economy and what's going on, a more conservative candidate may still well be electable.''
With an important Republican debate looming this Wednesday, what is apparent among those who have followed the early stages of the primary campaign closely is the strong level of energy and enthusiasm about the Republican candidates and of voters' dismay at the direction of the country.
''With everything that's gone wrong so far in this country, it sure gives a Republican a better shot at getting this fellow out of office,'' said Hank Marion, 69, a retired independent from Manchester. ''I'm looking for someone who can create jobs.''
Again and again, Republicans said they were looking for a candidate with strong leadership skills, someone who could speak up and restore the nation's standing in the world -- a clear contrast to Mr. Obama, whom they perceive as being weak and ineffectual.
''We have a leader right now who isn't really a leader,'' said Fred Bestwick, 66, a retired federal government employee who lives in Chichester and had just watched Mr. Perry speak at a house party.
''I don't want our Republican candidate to be someone weak,'' he said. ''I like Perry because he doesn't seem to take any guff, and that's important to me.''
For all the consternation among some party leaders about the strength of the field of candidates, the conversations with Republicans and independent voters revealed a sense of satisfaction at their array of choices. The interviews reflected a marked shift in the mood from only months ago, when many Republicans were openly skeptical that Mr. Obama could be defeated.
''Obama is pretty much beating himself,'' said Charles Whitney, 65, a truck driver from Des Moines. ''Don't you think anybody can beat him?''
Republicans' belief that they have a real shot at winning the White House has made many of them more receptive to a principled conservative as their nominee -- ''The more conservative, the better,'' said Jerry Benuck, a semi-retired Web developer who lives in Bedford, N.H. -- but the push to the right is also tempered by a desire to settle on a candidate who can unseat the current president.
Still, several voters said that the candidates had spent too much time criticizing the president, rather than outlining their own visions.
''The sentiment against Obama gives the Republicans a lot of fuel, but they need to come forth with concrete proposals and not just attack the current administration,'' said G. P. Foote, 68, who works in a campus ministry in Ames, Iowa, and has seen several of the candidates.
A government report Friday that showed zero net job creation in August, coupled with an already fragile economy, has pushed jobs and fiscal concerns to the forefront of the minds of most voters interviewed.
''I'm looking for an economic fix,'' said Don St. Germain, 49, the executive vice president of St. Mary's Bank, who lives in Wolfeboro, N.H. ''To me, it's about getting the economy back on track and getting some jobs created, and that's why Romney has some appeal. He's done that.''
His ideal candidate, he added, is ''Romney with a little more pizazz.''
Last week, Mr. Obama faced yet another setback, when he and Speaker John A. Boehner quibbled over the date when Mr. Obama could deliver his jobs address to a joint session of Congress. The president eventually capitulated, and the episode only highlighted the president's weakened political state.
''We need to get back the respect that this country deserves around the world,'' said Maureen Gauthier, 54, a retired civil servant in Manchester. ''I think we need to certainly turn things around economically, and I'm looking for someone who isn't afraid to say it like it is. I'm done with political correctness.''
Bonnie Duarte, 56, a registered nurse at the Veteran's Administration hospital in Manchester, said that ''job growth right now, the economy'' are the issues most important to her. But she echoed the sentiment that the Republican nominee should be a bold leader.
''I'm also looking for a candidate who is not afraid to speak up and say, 'I'm a total conservative. This is what I believe in and if you don't like it, too bad,' '' she said.
Ms. Duarte, who is married to State Representative Joe Duarte, said her ideal candidate would be ''a mixture of Perry, Romney, Bachmann, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul.''
Recent polls have placed Mr. Perry ahead of Mr. Romney at the front of the pack, and they are the two candidates whom voters most frequently say they are considering.
''Somebody like Perry is a very reputable candidate, he has a very serious record, he's demonstrated a lot of ability to do what needs to be done,'' said Denise Dahlberg, 55, a campus minister at Dartmouth. ''Romney seems to know his economics, too.''
Kathy Benuck of Bedford, N.H., who, like her husband, Jerry, is semi-retired and working in Web development, said they like both Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney, though they have concerns about each -- what they called Mr. Perry's previously soft stance on illegal immigration, for instance, and the health care plan Mr. Romney passed as governor of Massachusetts.
Though many voters also mentioned that they thought Mrs. Bachmann was an appealing candidate, the Benucks were not impressed with her or Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska who is still flirting with a run.
''Both of them tend to have a lot to say, but not a ton of substance, I think,'' Ms. Benuck said.
And, of course, while most voters said they were happy with the current slate of candidates, there is still a craving for more alternatives.
''If Chris Christie got in, I'd be straight behind him, because I think he knows what he's doing and he's doing it in a rough state like New Jersey,'' Mr. Benuck said, referring to New Jersey's governor, a Republican. ''That would change some things.''

HEADLINE: The Fatal Distraction

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Friday brought two numbers that should have everyone in Washington saying, ''My God, what have we done?''
One of these numbers was zero -- the number of jobs created in August. The other was two -- the interest rate on 10-year U.S. bonds, almost as low as this rate has ever gone. Taken together, these numbers almost scream that the inside-the-Beltway crowd has been worrying about the wrong things, and inflicting grievous harm as a result.
Ever since the acute phase of the financial crisis ended, policy discussion in Washington has been dominated not by unemployment, but by the alleged dangers posed by budget deficits. Pundits and media organizations insisted that the biggest risk facing America was the threat that investors would pull the plug on U.S. debt. For example, in May 2009 The Wall Street Journal declared that the ''bond vigilantes'' were ''returning with a vengeance,'' telling readers that the Obama administration's ''epic spending spree'' would send interest rates soaring. 
The interest rate when that editorial was published was 3.7 percent. As of Friday, as I've already mentioned, it was only 2 percent.
I don't mean to dismiss concerns about the long-run U.S. budget picture. If you look at fiscal prospects over, say, the next 20 years, they are indeed deeply worrying, largely because of rising health-care costs. But the experience of the past two years has overwhelmingly confirmed what some of us tried to argue from the beginning: The deficits we're running right now -- deficits we should be running, because deficit spending helps support a depressed economy -- are no threat at all.
And by obsessing over a nonexistent threat, Washington has been making the real problem -- mass unemployment, which is eating away at the foundations of our nation -- much worse.
Although you'd never know it listening to the ranters, the past year has actually been a pretty good test of the theory that slashing government spending actually creates jobs. The deficit obsession has blocked a much-needed second round of federal stimulus, and with stimulus spending, such as it was, fading out, we're experiencing de facto fiscal austerity. State and local governments, in particular, faced with the loss of federal aid, have been sharply cutting many programs and have been laying off a lot of workers, mostly schoolteachers.
And somehow the private sector hasn't responded to these layoffs by rejoicing at the sight of a shrinking government and embarking on a hiring spree.
O.K., I know what the usual suspects will say -- namely, that fears of regulation and higher taxes are holding businesses back. But this is just a right-wing fantasy. Multiple surveys have shown that lack of demand -- a lack that is being exacerbated by government cutbacks -- is the overwhelming problem businesses face, with regulation and taxes barely even in the picture.
For example, when McClatchy Newspapers recently canvassed a random selection of small-business owners to find out what was hurting them, not a single one complained about regulation of his or her industry, and few complained much about taxes. And did I mention that profits after taxes, as a share of national income, are at record levels?
So short-run deficits aren't a problem; lack of demand is, and spending cuts are making things much worse. Maybe it's time to change course?
Which brings me to President Obama's planned speech on the economy.
I find it useful to think in terms of three questions: What should we be doing to create jobs? What will Republicans in Congress agree to? And given that political reality, what should the president propose?
The answer to the first question is that we should have a lot of job-creating spending on the part of the federal government, largely in the form of much-needed spending to repair and upgrade the nation's infrastructure. Oh, and we need more aid to state and local governments, so that they can stop laying off schoolteachers.
But what will Republicans agree to? That's easy: nothing. They will oppose anything Mr. Obama proposes, even if it would clearly help the economy -- or maybe I should say, especially if it would help the economy, since high unemployment helps them politically.
This reality makes the third question -- what the president should propose -- hard to answer, since nothing he proposes will actually happen anytime soon. So I'm personally prepared to cut Mr. Obama a lot of slack on the specifics of his proposal, as long as it's big and bold. For what he mostly needs to do now is to change the conversation -- to get Washington talking again about jobs and how the government can help create them.
For the sake of the nation, and especially for millions of unemployed Americans who see little prospect of finding another job, I hope he pulls it off.

HEADLINE: Tough Times in the Second City

BYLINE: By HAROLD A. POLLACK. 
Harold A. Pollack is a professor of social service administration at the University of Chicago.

 BODY:
Chicago
THIS Labor Day should be an uncomfortable day for our political leaders, and for comfortable readers of this newspaper, too. Working people are enduring hard times, maybe the hardest in decades. Meanwhile, our national political debate seems utterly out of touch with the economic pain now being endured by millions of precariously employed, under-employed and jobless people across America.
Consider where I live and work: greater Chicago. Forty-five percent of mortgaged single-family homes are underwater, meaning people owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. Foreclosure epicenters like the Austin and West Englewood communities are checkerboarded with abandoned and decaying properties, many stripped bare by vandals for scrap. Joblessness among African-Americans exceeds 20 percent -- almost 50 percent among black youths. 
Numbers don't fully capture the impact of the downturn. Some of the toughest challenges arise in small suburban localities like Hazel Crest, a short bicycle ride from my house. A destination for Chicagoans hoping to move up the economic ladder, the village of Hazel Crest has been hard hit by unemployment, white flight and the housing crisis.
I went to a recent church supper for the needy there. Kimberly Wilk, a bright and acerbic 55-year-old woman, came over. She'd had a stroke and needed assistance walking. Her husband had heart problems and needed an implantable defibrillator. His condition required him to give up his commercial trucking license. Since May, their weekly income has been about $150.
Like many among the downwardly mobile, Ms. Wilk seemed disengaged. She is a Republican and didn't vote for President Obama, but she wants her party to give him more of a chance. She's isn't excited by health reform. In fact, she hasn't followed it. She said the new law was irrelevant to her. (Her stance is understandable, because the most pertinent provisions for her don't kick in until 2014.) She lamented the area's bad schools. She said people received undeserved benefits and tax breaks because of local corruption. She couldn't recall a single politician who had helped people like her: ''It's all talk. There's never any action.''
She's not the only one disenchanted with politics. The Rev. Gregory Seal Livingston ministers to Chicago's struggling Roseland community. We took a two-hour walk down Michigan Avenue, some 120 streets south of tourist destinations like Millennium Park. We passed successful businesses, as well as boarded-up buildings and trash-strewn empty lots. We stopped in a jewelry store. I asked the proprietor about his big sellers. ''Nothing,'' he said. ''People have no money. They used to buy gold. Now all they buy is silver and the fake stuff.''
Mr. Livingston was charming and ebullient about almost everything -- except politics. He wanted investments to beautify the place and to plant community gardens. That hasn't happened. He mentioned summer jobs that never materialized. ''A lot of the crusaders were bought off or got tired,'' he said. I asked him about federal mortgage assistance programs. ''These have been failures,'' he said. ''People go to them for modifications. They can't do anything for them.''
The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson Sr. had tales of foreclosed churches, of parks with locked gates, of embarrassed professionals quietly approaching him for help during his gym workout.
He noted the shame evident in people whose upward mobility had been thwarted. Millions of African-Americans ploughed their savings into their homes -- only to be lacerated by the real-estate meltdown and the recession. ''People had nice homes, where they hosted family picnics,'' he told me. ''They were the first generation to break out.''
Too humiliated to seek help, many fell deeper into trouble. No one is helping them. Our nation increasingly treats their misfortune as sad conditions to be endured, rather than as urgent problems to be addressed.
I used to wonder why so many voters seem uninterested in the foreclosed and jobless, why poor people seem politically passive. Now I think those questions are misplaced. Disaffected voters worry about their own jobs, if they are lucky enough to have one. They don't see concrete evidence in their own lives that government will help. It's hard to blame them for tuning out.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Jackson said he hoped the crisis would spark political action. ''Private shame must become collective resentment,'' he said, ''and a thrust for collective dignity.'' He had choice words for banks and for Tea Partiers, whom he called ''kamikaze zealots.'' His bluntness is jarring. National politicians don't talk like that.
Maybe they should. Mr. Jackson brings an urgency, an identification with struggling people that is otherwise lacking in the national conversation. Lambasting the debt ceiling agreement, he said: ''They'll raise the roof, but the cracks in the floor will go unrepaired.''
It's too late this political season to repair many of the cracks. But President Obama and others can lay the foundation for an angry but civil liberal populism to provide an alternative to passivity and the Tea Party.
Whatever we decide, I hope the new bipartisan Congressional supercommittee charged with finding $1.5 trillion in additional cuts over 10 years comes here to speak with hurting and disappointed Chicagoans who have tuned out. Its members can tell people to their faces whether America will really help them, and what kind of country we really are.

HEADLINE: Public Job Creation

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: The federal government must do more to create jobs -- and to ensure that women get a fair share of them, an economist writes.

 BODY:
President Obama has signaled a new commitment to combating unemployment, with a major speech planned for later this week. The big question is whether his battle plan will go beyond indirect means of encouraging long-run employment growth (such as tax incentives) to include public job-creation programs that could significantly lower unemployment over the next year.
His Republican critics take a "been there, done that, didn't work" approach to economic stimulus. But President Obama's stimulus plan, the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, relied primarily on tax cuts and increases in aid to the states, shying away from direct federal job-creation efforts that were considered politically risky. (Jared Bernstein, chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at the time, provides a clear account of the administration's rationale).
The stimulus helped the economy toward recovery. Increased aid to the states temporarily buffered the impact of state and local budget cuts. But over all, the Obama administration has been characterized by public job elimination rather than creation. The latest estimates of government employment (preliminary estimates for July 2011) show a significant decline since 2008, to about 22 million from about 22.5 million.
This decline in public employment will inevitably be intensified by further cuts in public spending and has particularly ominous implications for women, who make up a disproportionate share of state and local payrolls.

As Eileen Appelbaum points out, men were harder hit by job losses in 2009 than women but also faster to regain jobs as private sector hiring revived. A recent report from the Institute for Women's Policy Research provides a vivid, up-to-date graph of these trends.
As of August 2011, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for men 16 and older was 9.6 percent; that for women, 8.5 percent. A new Economic Policy Institute report notes that persistently high unemployment has lowered the earnings and family income of a wide swath of American families.
Democrats to the left of President Obama have long argued the need for direct job creation through new federal programs, targeted transfers to state and local governments or both. Robert Reich, who served as secretary of labor under President Clinton, has offered a model speech along with a model plan.
The National Urban League, a prominent civil rights organization, has outlined a 12-point proposal, Putting America Back to Work.
Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, has introduced several legislative proposals, most recently the Local Jobs for America Act. Money would go directly to eligible local communities and nonprofit community organizations that would decide how best to use them. The act would also underwrite approximately 50,000 additional private-sector on-the-job training positions to help businesses put people back to work.
Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, has sponsored the Emergency Jobs to Restore the American Dream Act, which puts more explicit emphasis on money for schools, health care and community service. This program would be fully financed through separate legislation creating higher tax brackets for millionaires and billionaires, elimination of subsidies for major oil companies and closing of corporate tax loopholes that encourage offshoring of American jobs.
In a post last year, I described several specific proposals to create jobs in home-care services, including a voucher program to help subsidize the cost of home aides for the elderly, moving them out of nursing homes and back to their own homes.
Last week, Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women's Policy Research, mobilized an online discussion of participants in the Womens Scholars Forum (including me). The resulting briefing paper summarizes a number of additional ideas, such as expanding the length of the school day and school year to improve educational outcomes and developing an Urban Conservation Corps.
The briefing paper emphasizes a longstanding concern of women's organizations: the need to make sure that "women get their fair share of jobs that are nontraditional for women, for example technical and craft jobs in construction, transportation, and green energy and that are supported by federal dollars or federally guaranteed loans."
A good example of targeted spending in this area is a small grant that the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor recently awarded to Austin Community College in Texas to recruit women to a renewable energy training program.
A strong public job-creation effort could help qualified graduates of programs like these find jobs improving the energy efficiency of schools and other public buildings. The employment impact would be both quicker and more reliable than subsidized loans or tax breaks for renewable energy companies.
Right now, the unemployed themselves represent an important form of renewable energy that is going to waste. That's why President Obama should take a close look at proposals to put them to work in a variety of publicly financed jobs.

HEADLINE: Romney Plays Down G.O.P.-Tea Party Strife

BYLINE: JOHN ELIGON


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney told supporters in New Hampshire that the differences between the Tea Party and traditional Republicans were not as wide as many people seem to believe.

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. - Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, tried to bridge the gap between himself and the Tea Party on Monday morning, telling a gathering of supporters that the differences between the Tea Party and traditional Republicans were not as wide as many people seem to believe.
Speaking at a country club here after serving pancakes to hundreds of supporters, Mr. Romney said the public's desire for tales of political conflict had led people to misconstrue the relationship between the Tea Party and so-called mainstream Republicans.
"There's great interest to say, 'Oh, the Tea Party, oh, and the mainstream Republicans, oh they're fighting and they're different,' " Mr. Romney said in response to a question from a supporter. "The Tea Party has at its center core a belief that government is too big. Sound familiar? That's what we've been saying for years and years as a Republican Party, and they're saying it well and loud. The Tea Party is a powerful movement, saying government's too big, and I couldn't agree more."
Mr. Romney's comments came just a day after his first appearance at a Tea Party rally, where a smattering of protesters accused him of courting the party out of political expediency. Mr. Romney's critics in the Tea Party say that his record as governor of Massachusetts - notably his passage of a universal health care law that has been likened to the federal legislation passed by President Obama - does not jibe with Tea Party principles.
Mr. Romney did not address that criticism directly on Sunday, and he was surrounded by many supporters as he came and went, all but assuring that there would be no clash with the few protesters in attendance.
In recent days Mr. Romney has made increasingly strong appeals to supporters of the Tea Party movement. After Monday's pancake breakfast, he was headed to a candidate forum in Columbia, S.C., an event he had planned to skip. The forum's host, Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, is popular with social conservatives and Tea Party groups.
On Monday, Mr. Romney seemed to take a veiled jab at the small number of detractors in attendance, saying, "What you want is, 'Mr. Romney came to speak at this group, and there were two protesters that yelled at him.' "
Democrats are to blame for the perception that there is a divide between the Tea Party and traditional Republicans, Mr. Romney said.
"They're going to try and tear us down, make it look like we're at each other's throats," he said.
That will not work, Mr. Romney said.
"All of us are convinced that government is out of control," he said, "that it needs to get out of the way of the private sector, that more freedom for enterprise and for individuals will put more Americans to work than a federal government jobs program ever can. And those principles, combined with lowering taxes for the American people, those things will unite us."
Mr. Romney also gave a preview of a jobs speech he is scheduled to give in Nevada on Tuesday.
"It talks about a fundamental restructuring of our economy, getting our tax rates competitive globally," he said. "We'll talk about bringing our regulations in line with other nations and much lower than it's been over these last two and a half years. I'll talk about opening trade, opening opportunities for us to sell goods other places and cracking down on the cheaters. China's No. 1 on that list. I'll talk about energy independence and energy security."

HEADLINE: Palin Praises Influence of the Tea Party

BYLINE: JOHN ELIGON


HIGHLIGHT: While again giving no clear indication of whether she intends to run for president, Sarah Palin used an appearance in Manchester, N.H., to urge Tea Party supporters to remain open to candidates who are now embracing the party's views even if they had not done so in the past.

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. - While again giving no clear indication of whether she intends to run for president, Sarah Palin on Monday urged a spirited crowd of Tea Party supporters to remain open to candidates who are now embracing the party's views even if they had not done so in the past.
"It was the Tea Party movement that shifted the entire fiscal debate in Washington, D.C.," Ms. Palin, the onetime Alaska governor and Republican vice presidential nominee, said during a rally organized by the Tea Party Express at Veterans Memorial Park. "And now we're seeing more and more folks realize the strength of this grassroots movement, and they're wanting to be involved. I say right on. Better late than never, for some of these candidates, especially."
Ms. Palin's comments came as Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and a leading contender for the Republican nomination, sought to reverse skepticism among some Tea Party activists in this state that he truly stood with them. Mr. Romney spoke at a smaller Tea Party Express gathering on Sunday evening in nearby Concord, his first time appearing at a Tea Party event.
Although Ms. Palin seemed to be tamping down expectations that she might compete for the Republican nomination by instructing her troops on how to vet the candidates before them, the hundreds in attendance made clear their desire to see her add her name to the list.
"Announce!" several spectators yelled.
At one point during Ms. Palin's nearly 25-minute speech, the crowd broke out in a synchronized chant of "Run, Sarah, run!"
Ms. Palin paused and smiled. "I appreciate your encouragement," she said. "I do."
Ms. Palin stuck to her standard stump speech, heavily criticizing President Obama and what she called politics as usual in Washington. She said the root of the country's economic problems was "crony capitalism," summoning terminology that she brought out during a lengthy speech in Iowa last week.
She said she was pleased that the Tea Party movement had withstood attacks from the news media and from politicians, and she said she hoped to see the movement continue to grow.
"Let's invite those candidates in who are bold enough to take on the tough challenges caused by an out of touch, out of control centralized government," she said, "and those who are humble enough to admit that they need you and they have seen the light."
The great thing about the Tea Party, Ms. Palin said, is that there was no one leader, though many of its members might disagree.
"She won't say this, but I'll say it: She's the acknowledged leader of the leaderless Tea Party movement," said Peter Bearse, 70, of North Hampton, N.H.
During her speech, Ms. Palin laid out the basic principles of the party, which are a reliance on people, markets, the Constitution and limited government, Mr. Bearse said.
"So she set an agenda for a campaign," he said. "That's what you heard. If she doesn't run, I'm going to be very sorely disappointed."
Others who supported Ms. Palin said they preferred to see her continue playing the role of antagonist from the sideline.
"I think that she's keeping the Republican candidates on their toes," said Sally Anderson, a 59-year-old Manchester resident who attended the rally with her husband, John. "I think she's a very good speaker, and she's ruffling up everybody. I personally wouldn't like to see her run."
But one Manchester resident, Angelo Mullen, said he believed Ms. Palin was "a joke" and said he lost respect for her after she "bailed on the good people of Alaska," referring to when she left her position as governor in the middle of her term.
Mr. Mullen, 56, voted for Mr. Obama in the last election but said he was supporting Mr. Romney this time around. The Tea Party and Mr. Romney are not compatible, Mr. Mullen said, adding that he believed there was a clear gap between the Tea Party movement and traditional Republicans.
"I don't like the Tea Party's hard-line stance," he said. "I don't think compromise is in their vocabulary."

HEADLINE: What Should Obama Say?

BYLINE: STANLEY FISH


HIGHLIGHT: Part of the president's speech on the economy should involve unilateral action.

 BODY:
Everyone else is giving President Obama advice, so why not me?
Like most non-economists (and most economists, for that matter) I don't really understand how the economy works and I have nothing to offer in the way of substantive suggestions. No doubt, the president and his advisers know more than I do (at least let's hope so), and one must assume that they are busily trying to figure out what he should say when he speaks to the Congress and the nation on Thursday. Already the newspaper columnists and TV pundits are speculating about what mix of cuts and revenue enhancement he will propose, whether he will go small or big, whether he will challenge the opposition or attempt to placate it, whether he will speak generally or offer wonkish details. 
But this drumbeat of pre-publicity, a feature of the 24/7 news cycle, creates a now-familiar problem: because so much is already known about the speech, it will be discounted in advance and come across as ho-hum. At a moment when everyone agrees that the president needs to make a forceful impression - especially in the light of the "invitation-gate" fiasco - that would be a disaster.

What might he do? Well, it may already be too late for one piece of advice - don't leak. I know that Washington is the most porous town on the planet; everything is known sooner or later, and usually sooner. But at least the administration could refrain from helping their adversaries by letting their cats out of the bag. Let the opposition and the media do the intelligence work; don't do it for them. Instead try some of the discipline - characterized by Democrats as secrecy and autocratic behavior - attributed to the Bush administration back in the day.
Assuming that the don't-leak boat has already sailed, here's another suggestion. After all the boiler-plate points have been made, and the array of policy suggestions has been presented, and the ritual blaming of everyone under the sun has been performed, do something immediate and peremptory. At the end of the speech, in the context of the obligatory call to action, act. Don't just recommend initiatives, perform a few, right there and then.
If we have learned anything in the past few years (and decades), it is that presidential powers are elastic. Often it's a matter of what the president can get away with. (If Roosevelt had gotten away with his court-packing plan, it wouldn't be called the court-packing plan.) I haven't the slightest idea of what they might be, but I would bet that there are things Obama could do immediately without Congressional consultation or agreement, things that might arguably free up credit or create jobs or stimulate spending or jump-start the housing industry. 
I say "arguably" because it is always possible that the actions the president announced - not as promises but as deeds done in the uttering of them - wouldn't accomplish anything; and of course that's what his opponents will immediately say in addition to saying that he hasn't got the authority he claims to be exercising.
But it won't matter. The point is not to offer something that is invulnerable to criticism (not a possibility anyway); the point is to display leadership by taking unilateral action, by delivering a succession of sentences that begin, "I hereby ." Whatever the content of those sentences and however effective or ineffective the initiatives they at once announce and perform, the mere fact that they have been spoken on a national stage will do considerable work, including the work of reminding Americans - and perhaps Obama himself - what presidential authority looks like.

HEADLINE: Can Obama Escape the Alberta Tar Pit?

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama has a responsible route around the intense fight over a proposed oil pipeline. 

 BODY:
President Obama is in a situation right now somewhat akin to that facing the creatures that once prowled the edges of the La Brea tar pits -- a sticky trap that caught and consumed the least wary or agile members of many species.
For Obama, the physical tar pit lies far away in northeastern Alberta province, Canada, but a rhetorical one surrounds him in Washington as the fight to shape his position on an oil pipeline draws toward a climax. He has a way out, but it's a tricky path. Here's the situation: 
Later this year Obama needs to decide if it is in the nation's interest to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which would be able to carry more than half a million barrels a day of a tarry oil precursor from Saudi-scale deposits in Alberta to American fuel refineries. (The administration's approval is required because the pipeline crosses an international border.)
There are signs that, despite impassioned opposition by environmentalists who were once important Obama allies, he will give the project the green light. Passion isn't matched by response, in part, because environmental concerns cannot compete as an issue with persistent economic stagnation and joblessness. The most recent evidence was the White House decision Friday to hold off on tightening standards for air pollutants that form smog.
The most visible protest on the pipeline plan has been a weeks-long demonstration outside the White House that culminated on Saturday. In the action, more than 1,200 campaigners, scientists (including NASA's Jim Hansen), students and other concerned citizens -- mainly brought there by the project's climate impacts -- sat down and waited for handcuffs:
You can read reams of valuable context on the issues surrounding the Alberta resource and the pipeline in Foreign Policy (a particularly illuminating new tour of North American energy prospects by Charles Homans) The Times, The New Yorker, The Economist and more reams of blog and editorial commentary. (The Times editorial board has repeatedly criticized the pipeline plan.) I also encourage you to read analysis by the Canadian economist Andrew Leach for help in distinguishing hype from fact.
My views are close to those of Michael Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations, who's been providing analysis of the climate, security and economic issues since 2009 and who leans toward Obama approving the pipeline while pursuing energy and climate policies that would, in the end, render it insignificant and uneconomical.
For me the pipeline, in isolation, is in the national interest if we have any interest in not contributing, through our driving habits, to the despoliation of far-flung parts of the planet.
This method of extracting petroleum leaves an unholy mess, even as conveyed by a libertarian writer like Ronald Bailey visiting the Alberta oil-sands mines on a junket paid for by oil companies. Consider his recent description of the vast amounts of residual material that persist for decades:
Mature fine tailings are the big problem for oil sands extraction. They consist of a gel-like suspension of very fine clay, which for chemical reasons refuses to solidify in less than 30 years. Consequently, oil sands mines are surrounded by vast tailings ponds.... The ponds shimmer with a oily sheen since not all bitumen can be extracted from the sand.
But that's my stance on the project outside of broader contexts. Overall, I think Obama should stand in the way of the pipeline. While it's a potent symbol and convenient rallying point for campaigners, it's a distraction from core issues and opportunities on energy and largely insignificant if your concern is averting a disruptive buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
The pipeline plan doesn't exist in isolation. With the economy in its own tar pit and a presidential election approaching, it's very much in the national interest for Obama to avoid saddling himself with an unnecessary issue that would be easy for his foes to distort into an Obama anti-jobs position.
This particular pipeline has a good chance of dying on the vine in any case if and when easier, less expensive sources of transportation fuel come online, including domestic oil and natural gas (and there are competing pipeline options and routes).
The greenhouse impact of the oil sands is also far less significant than some claims, particularly given the reality that oil consumption rates are what matters -- not the amount of gigatons of carbon sitting in deposits of this sort in the ground.
Environmentalists' statements about the massive greenhouse impact from oil-sand carbon don't mention that it would take a millennium or more, even at a breath-taking rate of extraction of, say, 5 million barrels a day, for that CO2 impact to be fully realized (as if no new energy options, or methods for sopping up CO2, will arise in the future), as pointed out by Andrew Leach last June:
In the fight against climate change, every bit counts, but to make an argument that is based on a leverage ratio of somewhere between 90 and 500 times the actual damage caused by a particular project is not the right way to go about it.... [I]f you want deep cuts to [greenhouse gas] emissions, you need a broad-based policy, not a hopelessly leveraged argument against a single project. In my opinion, those are the arguments most likely to be ignored as alarmist.
I think that Americans are eager for a serious American energy policy that could both erode the economics of this pipeline and marginalize the "drill baby drill" crowd as childish and irresponsible. If Obama cast all of this the right way, such a policy would incorporate the need for more domestic energy exploration and development (done responsibly) with a long-term plan that also stresses conservation, efficiency and innovation.
These same issues arose when Obama faced the BP gusher in the Gulf.
Read my 2010 post on "Obama's Oil and Energy Opportunity" to get my view of a sustainable policy path.
In an interview taped earlier this summer, I discussed some of the core issues related to oil sands on The Agenda, the Canadian public affairs program. The interview ran last week as part of a five-day package focused on global energy issues and opportunities:
In a post on Friday, Michael Levi wrote of the limited significance of the Keystone XL pipeline and the primacy of policies that curb demand for oil:
Slash oil demand and oil sands development goes away; keep oil demand on its current trajectory and we've got huge climate problems regardless of whether Keystone XL is approved.
I agree completely. Levi, who has exposed overstatements on both sides of the polarized debate, sees the pipeline as meriting approval mainly because its impact on climate -- whether approved or denied -- would be minimal when placed in global context.
Levi and I discussed the pipeline on Friday via Skype. Here are some highlights:
One of his points in our chat was that a reduction in demand kills the economics that make such marginal and expensive sources of fuel remotely feasible:
The goal of climate policy should be to reduce demand for fossil fuels and if we do that the oil sands will become superfluous.
In an e-mail before our exchange, I asked him the core question facing Obama: Is the pipeline in the national interest. Here's Levi's reply:
I've been studiously avoiding coming down one way or the other on the national interest issue, in part because I'm pretty ambivalent, but I guess it's time to get off the fence. I think that approval is ultimately in the U.S. national interest, so long as U.S. regulators ensure that the pipeline is operated safely.
I do not buy the argument that the pipeline would be a massive windfall for U.S. security.
I also think that climate change needs to be taken seriously. That said, reducing emissions by blocking the pipeline would likely be far more costly (primarily in terms of higher world oil prices but also, potentially, in terms of reduced Bakken production) than almost any other emissions-cutting approach that serious people contemplate. Let's focus on those other approaches. (Targeting oil sands production also has very limited potential, since total oil sands production emissions are a tiny fraction of total U.S. emissions.) There is no realistic scenario where the oil sands are the difference between success and failure in addressing climate change. [.]
I recognize that Bill McKibben, Jim Hansen and others see this particular project as crossing their moral line in the (tar) sand. I respect their decision to pursue civil disobedience. But I haven't joined them because -- while I would love to see America and the world cut oil appetites - I see more promising routes to meaningful progress on that front. And once the appetite is cut, there is less pressure to push the limits of oil extraction, both toward dirty, hard-to-extract deposits like Alberta's, the deep-sea bed, the Arctic and elsewhere.
I also think Bryan Walsh and Michael Grunwald at Time Magazine are right in pointing out the perils that could come if environmental groups keep beating up on Obama.
As Walsh wrote a week ago:
If greens want to sit out the election and help a President Rick Perry or a President Michele Bachmann become a reality, go ahead. It might even feel good. But the consequences would be far, far, far worse than any single pipeline.
In the meantime, the Tar Sands Action organizers are poised to announce phase two of their movement.

HEADLINE: Adjusting, More M.D.'s Add M.B.A.

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Under heavy pressure from government regulators and insurance companies, more and more physicians across the country are learning to think like entrepreneurs.
As recently as the late 1990s, there were only five or six joint M.D./M.B.A degree programs at the nation's universities, said Dr. Maria Y. Chandler, a pediatrician with an M.B.A. who is an associate clinical professor in the medical and business schools at the University of California, Irvine. ''Now there are 65,'' she said.
Mark V. Pauly, a longtime leader of the health care management program at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said, ''A light bulb went off and they realize that health care is a business.''
Dr. James S. Kuo, 47, said he was a third-year medical student at Penn when he decided to go to business school, too. After receiving his M.D. and master of business administration degrees, he jumped to a Wall Street job with a large health care venture capital firm. 
Dr. Kuo went on to manage several heath care funds and later led several small health care companies.
Now he is chief executive of Adeona Pharmaceuticals, a company based in Ann Arbor, Mich., that is developing innovative medicines for the treatment of serious diseases of the central nervous system.
He is also nonexecutive chairman of MSK Pharma, a private company in La Jolla, Calif., that is led by his wife, Dr. Geraldine P. Kuo.
She is a specialist in muscular-skeletal medicine at the Veterans Affairs health care system in San Diego.
''In her work, she came across a medical need and an innovation to solve that need,'' he said.
One of the latest universities to consider a combined program is Creighton, a Jesuit university in Omaha, which plans to begin offering a joint degree next summer.
Anthony R. Hendrickson, dean of Creighton's school of business, said the program would be flexible, based on each student's academic and business experience and personal goals.
He said total tuition would be $191,688, including four years of medical school and a year of business studies. At Duke, the total cost of tuition for medical school and a year and a half of business studies is $235,244.
Creighton, like many universities with business schools, also offers part-time courses for physicians alongside its classic short courses for executives of all types.
Statistics about the joint programs are sparse, said Dr. Chandler, who is president of the Association of M.D./M.B.A. Programs. But she estimated there were as many as 500 students total in the programs.
Some, like Tufts and Texas Tech, offer the combined program in four years, she said, and many programs offer special aid packages.
''All physicians need some kind of business training,'' she said. ''For example, some physicians with large research grants don't know how to manage the money.''
As for the nation's troubled health system, ''we are not running the business side very well,'' Dr. Chandler said. ''Part of the problem is we don't have physicians sufficiently involved. They have a fuller insight about what is needed.''
''Cue the theme music from 'Jaws,' '' said Professor Pauly, of Wharton. ''Entrepreneurs have to know how to navigate with the desire of payers to hold down prices and control uses in health care.''
He added: ''They have to know how to please pointy-headed bureaucrats. This is going to be one of the survival skills in the future in health care.''
Not all physician entrepreneurs come from the joint programs, of course. There are also business school graduates like Dr. Wendye Robbins, a fourth-generation doctor, who did her undergraduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and later earned her M.D. at the Medical College of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
Now she is president and chief executive of Limerick BioPharma, a small start-up in South San Francisco that works on transplant-associated metabolic diseases, specifically Type 2 diabetes. She founded Limerick with business partners in 2005.
With strong grades and support from the head of her medical faculty, she said, she was accepted as an intern at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and then for a postgraduate residency at Johns Hopkins University. Then she was hired as an anesthesiologist and pain doctor at the University of California, San Francisco. Through her husband, who has a business degree from Wharton, she met venture capitalists. ''They offered to fund the stuff coming out of my lab,'' she said.
She left academics and started her first company, NeurogesX, which commercializes pain medicines.
After five years, she left the company and took a teaching job at Stanford because, she said, she wanted to stay in touch with students and patients.
Her advice to entrepreneurs-in-waiting: ''Take a risk, step into the unknown. Don't be afraid to fail. I've made plenty of mistakes and had plenty of disappointments.''
Dr. Barry R. Silbaugh, chief executive of the American College of Physician Executives, a professional society that provides medical education courses and career counseling, said more start-ups were being run by doctors.
Most of its 10,000 members work in hospitals and insurance companies as chief medical officers and medical directors.
''Many others are focused on adapting technology to health care, not just electronic medical records,'' he added. ''The use of social media is of great interest to many younger physicians, and so is health care analytics,'' which is the study of data and information to help predict patterns of chronic illness.
''Physicians are bright people,'' said Dr. John E. Prescott, chief academic officer at the Association of American Medical Colleges, a trade group in Washington that represents more than 150 medical colleges. ''They want to make a difference. Some do it one patient at a time. Others see a bigger impact in business applications.''
''We are in a challenging environment for physicians to practice in,'' he added. ''Some are looking for ways to modify it or to leave it. Most want to modify it.''
Dr. Lisa Beth Ferstenberg teaches entrepreneurship on a grant from the National Science Foundation at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. After graduating from McGill's medical school, a residency at Mount Sinai Hospital and studies at New York University's Bellevue Hospital Center, she had a succession of pharmaceutical industry jobs.
Her students start every class session by practicing their pitches to sources of financing, like venture capitalists. She tells students: ''No one will fund you if they don't understand what you just said.''
In the hospital world, Dr. Silbaugh said, many hospital boards are asking for physician candidates, a reversal from a few years ago when nondoctors were preferred.
''Physicians bring a unique perspective,'' said Dr. Prescott. ''They understand patients and their needs. They also look at ways to improve overall effectiveness and efficiency.''
In the medical device industry, for example, ''physicians are the customers and can provide valuable insights to improve products,'' said Aaron K. Chatterji, who teaches strategy at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke. He returned to the university in August after working for 16 months in Washington as a senior economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers.
Professor Chatterji said his course on commercializing medical devices typically drew significant numbers of physicians, some in M.D./M.B.A. programs, and many biomedical engineers, along with other business students.
Dr. Prescott quoted a saying he hears quite often these days: ''Healing is an art, medicine is a profession, health care is a business.''

HEADLINE: Fukushima's Long Link To a Dark Nuclear Past

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
ISHIKAWA, Japan -- Kiwamu Ariga skirted the paddies of ripening rice, moving briskly despite his 81 years to reach a pile of yellowish rocks at the foot of a steep, forested hillside.
It was here that, as a junior high school student in the final months of World War II, Mr. Ariga and his classmates were put to work hacking rocks out of the hill's then exposed stone face until the blood ran from their sandaled feet. The soldiers told them nothing beyond instructing them to look for stones with brown or black spots.
Then one day, Mr. Ariga recalled, an officer finally explained what they were after: ''With the stones that you boys are digging up, we can make a bomb the size of a matchbox that will destroy all of New York.'' Mr. Ariga said he did not learn other details of Japan's secrecy-wrapped efforts to build an atomic bomb until years after the war. 
''We had no idea what we were doing here, in our bare feet, digging out radioactive uranium,'' Mr. Ariga said, standing between cedar saplings as spindly as his aging legs. ''Now, 66 years later, we are exposed to radiation again.''
This quiet mining town, nestled amid gentle green mountains, is located in Fukushima Prefecture, the rural district that is home to the radiation-spewing nuclear plant that bears its name, just an hour's drive over mountains to the northeast. The accident five months ago has prompted aging residents like Mr. Arigato speak out about how Fukushima, a name that has now become synonymous with civilian nuclear disaster, also has an older, lesser-known link to an even darker side of atomic energy.
Now in their 80s, the former schoolchildren who worked Ishikawa's uranium mines find themselves making increasing appearances in major Japanese media.
''Maybe it is Fukushima's unlucky mission to stand as a warning against the dangers of nuclear power,'' both civilian and military, said Etsuo Hashimoto, a retiree and amateur historian who volunteers at Ishikawa's one-room mineral museum, where rocks with printed labels collect dust on shelves.
Mr. Hashimoto stood before the museum's single display panel describing the imperial army's attempt here in 1945 to mine uranium and develop ways of refining it for use in building a bomb. Compared with the United States' vast Manhattan Project, historians describe Japan's two bomb-building programs -- the imperial navy also ran a separate project -- as minuscule, last-ditch efforts, hindered by a lack of resources and pessimism among the projects' own scientists that such a weapon could actually be completed.
As Mr. Hashimoto spoke, sirens began to wail, in one of the routine checks of emergency-response systems that this town of almost 18,000 residents has held since the accident in March at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, 36 miles away. Officials also regularly measure the fallout that has blown this way from the stricken plant, though they say radiation levels are not high enough to endanger health.
Still, the irony of Ishikawa's current predicament has proven rich enough to draw renewed attention to Japan's wartime atomic bomb programs, which are not well known here.
The programs were revealed soon after the war, but for decades Ishikawa's role went largely unnoticed, as an economically resurgent Japan tried its best to put its wartime past behind it. Since the 1990s, major media have become less inhibited about discussing the war, including Japan's atomic bomb programs. However, the programs still seem to be easily forgotten in a nation that is more accustomed to thinking of itself as the victim of the deadly American atomic attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Mr. Ariga, who in recent years has begun telling his story to local schoolchildren, says that most Japanese are shocked to hear that their nation also tried to build an atomic bomb. ''I have no doubt Japan would have used it if it succeeded,'' he added.
Historians say Japan never got as far as even designing, much less actually building, an atomic weapon. Indeed, its wartime efforts can seem woefully insufficient for the task: in Ishikawa, about 130 schoolchildren were put to work digging for uranium ore because the adult men had all been sent off to war.
''Ishikawa is a symbol of how inanely inadequate it was, using schoolchildren to build an atomic bomb,'' said Masayasu Hosaka, a historian who has written on Japan's atomic bomb projects.
For years after the war, no one in Ishikawa talked about the uranium mines, residents say. Fortunately, they add, no one got sick from radiation exposure. However, many feared they might face the same discrimination as survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, who were denied marriage and jobs out of fear that radiation was contagious.
''The mines were the town's secret,'' according to Kuniteru Maeda, 81, who also worked at the uranium mine.
Mr. Maeda and Mr. Ariga, who both became schoolteachers in Ishikawa after the war, said their silence continued until after retirement two decades ago, when they had time to ponder their wartime experiences. In 1993, they pooled their money to self-publish a small book on the bomb project in Ishikawa.
Sitting on the tatami floor of his two-century-old farmhouse, under the black-and-white photographs of recent ancestors, Mr. Ariga grows angry describing the parallels he sees between the wartime bomb projects and Japan's current nuclear crisis. The biggest similarity, he says, is that in both cases, the public was deceived by what he called hubris-filled leaders.
During the war, he said, generals and admirals believed their own propaganda about Japan being a sacred country that could defeat its foes with spiritual purity alone, and thus allowed themselves to fall behind the United States in the race to build the bomb. Now, he said, the Fukushima Daiichi accident exposed how Japan had let itself be led astray once again, this time by economic planners who promoted a ''safety myth'' that Japanese technology could never fail.
''We were brainwashed during the war, and we were brainwashed again after the war,'' Mr. Ariga said. ''Maybe we will get wise the third time.''

HEADLINE: Goodbye August, Beware September

BYLINE: By AGNES T. CRANE and RICHARD BEALES

 BODY:
Investors who spent August on the beach were fortunate to miss a bout of roller-coaster trading. And they will be rested for the next round, a taste of which came on Friday. The concerns behind the last volatile patch still have not been addressed.
European debt trouble, the weakness of economic growth in the United States -- underlined by the zero jobs created in August -- and political conflict spell more wild rides. 
Out of 45 developed and emerging stock markets tracked by S.& P. indexes, August left all but two underwater, by an average of 7.7 percent globally. Anyone who packed up at the end of July, sold stocks and bought Treasuries can at least count themselves lucky. After all, even those who stuck around for live deals have seen initial public offerings abandoned and one huge merger deal, AT&T's $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA, put in jeopardy.
But returning players shouldn't forget that, at the end of August, 44 of those same 45 markets were also still down from the end of August 2008 (the exception is Peru's). Then, the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the worst of the crisis was still in the future, but by only two weeks. A lot can go wrong.
The euro zone remains a basket case -- at least in places. That is belied by its currency, which has remained remarkably strong against the dollar at around $1.42. Yet shaky sovereign debt tucked away in the region's banking system makes it the biggest potential flashpoint for global markets.
The crisis has moved well beyond Greece. There is a metaphorical bull's-eye on too-big-to-rescue Italy. In August, 10-year Italian bond yields soared above 6 percent before the European Central Bank stepped in and agreed, reluctantly, to buy Italian debt. Italy has to refinance a record 62.4 billion euros of debt due for repayment in September, and that could put the central bank's calming influence to the test.
And there is still a question over European bank financing. In August, fear erupted again about the banks' access to short-term sources of finance like United States money market funds. The funds are still lending, but for shorter periods. The shorter the term of lending -- and it can get down to day-by-day -- the easier it is for the funds and other lenders to pull out, leaving European banks to scramble.
Between Europe's sovereign debtors, its banks and its currency, there is a credible systemic threat. And despite the ray of hope for private sector answers provided by a Greek bank merger in the last days of August, no one has come up with a comprehensive plan to right the European financial ship.
Meanwhile, worries over a double-dip recession in the United States are overshadowing earlier concerns about a slowdown in global growth. Chinese expansion has held up so far, though its policy makers face the challenge of maintaining that expansion while trying to cool parts of the economy and control bank lending. But for America, the latest gloomy data point was the stark jobs report for August, released on Friday.
The Federal Reserve on Aug. 9 pledged to keep short-term interest rates near zero for at least two years, and it looks as if the central bank, led by Ben Bernanke, is weighing round of quantitative easing. Any new measures are sure to be contentious. With three Federal Open Market Committee dissents over the low-rate promise last month, Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues have plenty to debate. This month's meeting, now extended to run Sept. 20-21, will be scrutinized closely by investors.
Mr. Bernanke referred in an Aug. 26 speech to a third big theme for markets: the seeming inability of Washington's political leaders to agree on anything. Such dysfunction played a part in Standard & Poor's landmark downgrade of United States debt at the end of July. And President Obama and Republican leaders even managed to bicker over a date for Mr. Obama to tell Congress about new job creation ideas, an event now set for Thursday.
But America isn't the only place with a political credibility problem. Europe's leaders, including Angela Merkel of Germany and Nicolas Sarkozy of France, are struggling for a way to escape from the region's debt troubles. That is partly because the disparate interests within the euro zone make it difficult to force weaklings like Greece to take austerity medicine, and just as tough to persuade the bloc to help out. With politicians everywhere as well as markets floundering, investors could be in for a bumpy ride.

HEADLINE: Europeans Talk Of Sharp Change In Fiscal Affairs

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and MATTHEW SALTMARSH; Louise Story reported from New York and Matthew Saltmarsh from London.

 BODY:
As leaders in Europe try to contain a deepening financial crisis, they are also increasingly talking about making fundamental changes to the way their 17-nation economic union works.
The idea is to create a central financial authority -- with powers in areas like taxation, bond issuance and budget approval -- that could eventually turn the euro zone into something resembling a United States of Europe.
Officials have been hesitant to publicly endorse such a drastic change. But privately they say the issue has gained urgency in recent months, as it has become clear that Europe's current approach, which requires unanimity on any significant moves, is unwieldy and inefficient. The idea is being promoted by some global financial officials, who worry about the risks that continued uncertainty in Europe poses to the global economy.
Recently, for instance, when an official from a European central bank met with a financial official in Washington, his host brandished the Articles of Confederation, the 1781 precursor to the United States Constitution, to use as an example of why stronger unions become necessary. 
The story of America's failed early effort to operate as a loose confederation of 13 states is looking increasingly relevant for many European officials. The lack of strong central coordination of the euro zone's debt and spending policies is a crucial reason Europe has been unable to resolve its financial crisis despite more than 18 months of effort.
The lack of progress has contributed to steep declines in European stocks recently, sending tremors through markets in the United States as well. On Monday alone, several major European markets fell more than 4 percent while markets were also down on Tuesday morning in Australia and Japan.
And that is why, despite all the political obstacles, Europe appears to be inching closer to a more centralized approach, and some officials are going public on the issue.
''If today's policy makers want to successfully stay the course, they will have to press ahead with structural changes and deeper economic integration,'' Antonio Borges, director of the International Monetary Fund's European unit, said in a recent speech. ''To put the crisis behind us, we need more Europe, not less. And we need it now.''
Nothing happens quickly in Europe, however. For the most part, such efforts are still being made behind the scenes. But several longtime financial and central bank officials and staff members said there had been a substantial step-up in planning for a closer European fiscal relationship to match the unified monetary union under which the euro zone has operated for more than a decade.
For now, officials are mainly talking in generalities.
''The crisis has clearly revealed the need for strong economic governance in a zone with a single currency,'' Jean-Claude Trichet, the departing president of the European Central Bank, said in a speech Monday, repeating earlier calls for greater fiscal discipline.
Officials, who spoke anonymously because their discussions were politically charged, said a major overhaul of the way Europe conducts fiscal policy was likely to take a long time and require changes in the treaties governing the euro. But they pointed to the smaller changes that were already taking place as evidence that euro area financial ministries see that they have little choice but to move together if they want to avoid a catastrophic breakdown.
With the new bailout for Greece that was agreed upon by European leaders in July still awaiting approval from each country in the euro zone, the fractionalized way that Europe runs fiscal decision-making risks setting off yet another crisis at each step along the way. Every plan requires agreement among finance ministers and the Parliament of any member country can veto the deal.
Many economists say that the Continent's debt crisis, which began in early 2010 with the threat that Greece might have to default on its loans, could have been resolved far more quickly if there were some sort of central financial body, akin to the Treasury Department in the United States.
''If they had the equivalent of the U.S. Treasury, then this treasury could have formulated proposals with the collective objective in mind, rather than 17 national objectives competing with each other,'' said Garry J. Schinasi, a former official with the International Monetary Fund who now privately advises European central banks and governments. ''Instead, they fumbled around and took two baby steps forward and three backward.''
The idea of a European Treasury that would enforce fiscal discipline on wayward countries, while also having the power to spread European Union wealth from healthier countries to ones struggling to pay their debts, is fiercely unpopular among voters in many countries. Those in prosperous nations like Germany do not want to see their taxes used to bail out countries that borrowed their way into trouble. And those in weaker nations are reluctant to allow outsiders to dictate how their governments spend their money and tax their citizens.
Europe's currency union has its roots in the agreement signed in 1992 known as the Maastricht Treaty, which set in motion the rules for creating the euro and for joining the euro zone. A later agreement established the European Central Bank, which manages interest rates much like the United States Federal Reserve.
But the Maastricht Treaty stopped short of telling countries how to handle spending or taxation, leaving them loose rules on budget deficits to follow -- or break, as many did, including Germany and France in the early days of the euro.
In the United States, of course, agreements between Congress and the White House on budget measures can be extremely difficult to reach. But the European process is even more arduous. The problems were highlighted Friday when talks between the Europeans, the I.M.F. and Greece were put off because Athens was coming up short in its plans for meeting budget targets. Stock markets promptly fell on the news.
This week, more challenges await. The top court in Germany is scheduled to rule Wednesday on whether it is legal for that country's leaders to make such an agreement. While it is expected to allow Germany to participate in the bailout, the constitutional court could surprise the experts.
On Thursday, officials in Finland are supposed to make a statement outlining their conditions for approving the deal, which will probably set the pattern for other countries seeking guarantees from Greece that their loans will be paid back.
The heavy lifting involved in approving the new deal for Greece illustrates how difficult it would be to create a European Treasury.
But that has not stopped some officials from calling for moves in that direction. Last month, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, proposed new financial transaction taxes for the euro zone, as well as standards for corporate tax laws, so no country could lure businesses at the expense of others with exceptionally low tax rates. They also proposed that each country enshrine in its constitution rules that would limit deficits, a process that is now under way in Spain, Portugal and elsewhere.
Last Thursday, Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, told the newspaper Bild that he would like to see the European Union's treaty revised -- an arduous process -- to enable the union to make common fiscal policies.
An official in the German Finance Ministry, who was not authorized to speak on the matter publicly, said the ministry was trying to avoid terms like fiscal union because it would alienate voters. But he acknowledged that it saw such a union as both necessary and inevitable.
''You could call it a fiscal union, but the minister won't do that,'' the official said. ''What we are talking about is pooling our fiscal policy and doing to fiscal policy what we've done with monetary policy.''
The euro zone is also moving to increase oversight of countries' budget plans earlier in the process and to give the European Commission greater power to propose financial penalties on countries that violate the rules, unless blocked by a large majority of members.
If and when that happens, said Graham Bishop, an independent financial analyst who has advised the British and European Parliaments, it ''would be the moment of collective control of an errant state -- the final step toward a de facto political union.''

HEADLINE: Banks Lead Sharp Declines in Global Shares

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY AND BETTINA WASSENER; David Jolly reported from Paris and Bettina Wassener from Hong Kong. Floyd Norris contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Fears of a new financial crisis and worries about the health of the United States economy sent share prices tumbling in Europe on Monday and also led to declines in Asia. Markets in the United States were closed for the Labor Day holiday, but sharp declines in the overseas trading of stock index futures indicated the sell-off was likely to continue on Tuesday.
Financial shares led the declines in Europe. Royal Bank of Scotland gave up more than 12 percent, while Barclays, Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas and Societe Generale each fell more than 6 percent. 
''The banking sector is at the center of this turmoil,'' Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels, said.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, fell 5.1 percent, while the FTSE 100 index in London closed 3.6 percent lower following a poor trading day in Asia. Futures on the Dow Jones industrial average were down 200 points in American trading, or 1.8 percent.
In addition to growing expectations that many financial institutions will need to raise capital -- as the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, suggested last month -- banks have also been hit by a lawsuit filed by United States against 17 financial institutions that sold the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac nearly $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities that later soured.
The Deutsche Bank chief executive, Josef Ackermann, said market conditions felt similar to those in 2008 as the world financial system seemed to be teetering on the brink.
''The 'new normal' is characterized by volatility and uncertainty -- not only in respect to market developments, but also in consideration of the future of the financial branch,'' Mr. Ackermann was quoted by Bloomberg News as saying at a conference in Frankfurt. ''All this reminds one of the fall of 2008, even though the European banking sector is significantly better capitalized and less dependent on short-term liquidity.''
Just how well Europe's banks are capitalized has become a topic of debate. While most banks performed well in European stress tests this summer, those tests were widely denounced for not taking into account the effects of possible sovereign defaults.
Though most European leaders have said banks were well capitalized, Ms. Lagarde told a conference of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo., two weeks ago that European banks needed ''urgent recapitalization.''
Without new capital, she said, ''we could easily see the further spread of economic weakness to core countries, even a debilitating liquidity crisis.''
In the United States, the share price of Bank of America leaped after Warren E. Buffett's conglomerate agreed to invest $5 billion in it on Aug. 25. But nearly all the gains have since evaporated, in part because of new suits against the bank. The shares closed Friday at $7.25, above the $6.99 price before Mr. Buffett invested, but far below the $8.29 price at which the shares opened after the investment was announced.
The German market did worse than its European counterparts, with the DAX index declining 5.3 percent to 5,246.18, a two-year low.
In local elections over the weekend, voters disillusioned with Germany's role in supporting Greece and other troubled euro zone countries dealt Chancellor Angela Merkel's party its fifth defeat this year, raising questions about whether she can muster the votes to expand the fund.
In Asia, the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong fell almost 3 percent, while the Shanghai composite index dropped almost 2 percent. The Nikkei 225 stock average fell 1.9 percent in Tokyo, while in Sydney the S.& P./ASX 200 index fell 2.4 percent.
In Tokyo, exporters like Sony and Panasonic, which derive a large part of their earnings from sales in the United States and Europe, fell more than 3 percent.
On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average slid 2.2 percent after an employment report showed that the United States economy added no jobs at all in August, renewing worries that the country might be heading for a recession.
The United States jobs data suggest that economic growth will ''stall in late 2011, with at least a 40 percent risk of recession,'' Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London, wrote in a research note. He predicted the Federal Reserve would announce measures to speed recovery when its policy board meets Sept. 20-21.
Investors will be watching meetings this week of the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan, as well as a speech by President Obama on job creation plans. Finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of 7 nations are scheduled to meet Friday and Saturday in Marseilles.
Investors expect a new round of so-called quantitative easing, in which central banks buy government bonds in order to add liquidity to the financial system.
Mr. Gijsels said it was unclear how much help additional liquidity would provide, but said risky assets had taken off after previous infusions.
''I think the markets will be very nervous and very volatile in the autumn,'' Mr. Gijsels said, noting that September and October have traditionally been dangerous months for stocks.
Gold was at $1,873.70 an ounce, up 2.6 percent, having risen sharply Friday. Crude oil futures in the United States for October delivery fell 2.5 percent to $86.45 a barrel on speculation of a slowdown in economic growth.
The dollar was mixed against other major currencies. The euro declined to $1.4195 from $1.4258 late Friday in New York, while the British pound rose to $1.6216 from $1.6178.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Elite Schools Rethink Saving Seat for Little Sister

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
Here's a back-to-school math problem: There are 62 kindergarten seats at the Trinity School this fall, and 756 children wanted them. What percentage made the cut?
The answer seems straightforward: 8.2 percent. But private-school admissions are hardly straightforward.
Of those 62 spots at Trinity, one of New York's most competitive schools, 33 were taken first by qualified siblings of Trinity students. An additional 11 went to children of alumni, who also get a leg up in the process, and one more belongs to the child of a staff member. That left 17 spaces for families with no ties to Trinity, giving those without connections a 2.4 percent shot at the prize.
Never has getting into Harvard -- acceptance rate: 6.2 percent -- seemed so easy.
Now, amid soaring demand and a weak economy, Trinity and other elite New York schools are beginning to change longstanding admissions practices as they try to balance often incongruous priorities, including institutional loyalty and a diverse student body. 
Trinity, which is on the Upper West Side and took the rare step of sharing its admission figures, has relaxed its application deadline and enlarged its capacity for open houses in recent years. Ethical Culture Fieldston and Riverdale Country no longer do siblings the favor of early notification of admissions, according to those schools. The same is true at Horace Mann, according to preschool directors and one parent at the school (Horace Mann did not respond to repeated calls and e-mails). Some families fear that the insiders' advantage they were counting on may soon disappear.
''With ever-growing numbers of siblings and legacies, admissions decisions have become more selective,'' Ethical Culture says on its Web site, ''in an effort to continue to provide access to families new to the school and who represent the school's mission and goals.''
Gabriella Rowe, head of the Mandell School, a well-known preschool and kindergarten-through-eighth-grade program, said, ''There's not a school out there that doesn't have a stricter admissions policy for siblings today than they did last year or the year before that.''
Broadly speaking, the schools want to take siblings and legacies, both because it makes life easier for families and because it deepens relationships, which many believe results in long-term generosity. But as schools look to bolster endowments amid the poor economy, some have begun to question that approach.
''The thing no one wants to talk about is development,'' said one head of school, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ''You get more money from five families than two families with five children.''
Diversity seems to be the biggest driver of the change. Over all, according to the National Association of Independent Schools, 29 percent of students at 31 private schools in New York City were minorities in the last school year, up from 20 percent a decade earlier (nationally, the latest figure is 25 percent, up from 17 percent).
Minority students make up half of Fieldston's lower school now, officials said. Dalton's 2011-12 kindergarten class is 47 percent minority, Trinity's 45 percent.
One of the lucky 17 who got into Trinity's kindergarten class with no previous connection to the school, and who helps make it diverse, is the daughter of Rajeev Bhaman, a portfolio manager, and Gala Rabhu, a management consultant. The low acceptance rate led the couple to apply to nine schools in a process Mr. Bhaman described as ''my full-time job for four months'' and ''way more difficult than anything I've done academically in my life, including applying to university in America from India.''
''The problem with the process is the data is fuzzy and the people involved seem to want to keep it fuzzy,'' he said. ''The uncertainty leads to greater angst and leads to precisely the behavior you see in this city: insane behavior.''
The scary admissions math is not the only thing causing the shift. As every parent knows, siblings are rarely carbon copies, and what school officials try to say ever so delicately is that just because Sophia made the grade doesn't mean Liam will too. Saying no to an applicant can save a lot of grief down the line if the child is unlikely to succeed.
''It's easier than when they are there,'' said Roxana Reid, director of Smart City Kids, a consulting company. ''It's taxing on teachers and creates resentment among the families that their second child is not being treated well.''
Robin Aronow, another admissions consultant, said schools often had more siblings and legacies than seats, ''so they make sure to say 'look elsewhere.' ''
Not all schools. Grace Church, a competitive school downtown, has studied the issue, and concluded that student performance improves when families feel institutional ownership -- and that keeping siblings together increases that sense of ownership.
''The success of this school is based on the fact that it is a primary community for families,'' said George Davison, who has run Grace for a quarter-century. ''The question with siblings is 'Why shouldn't we take this child?' not 'Why should we?' ''
Mr. Davison said his pre-K classes of 32 generally included 24 to 26 siblings. About 100 families compete for the remaining seats, putting its admissions rate on par with Harvard's. (For kindergarten, Grace adds 16 spots, and gets about 250 applications: 6 percent again. Partly because of the intensifying demand, Grace is starting a high school next year.)
Administrators at several schools, along with consultants, said the sibling crunch had intensified in recent years both because families have gotten larger and because families are staying in the city longer. The increased demand has led schools to rethink not only sibling and legacy preferences, but everything about the application process.
At Trinity, open houses used to be in the lower-school library, where attendance was limited to about 80. Last year, officials used the upper school's chapel, but still limited capacity to 300, for two events. This year, the director of admissions, Jennifer Levine, said she would let in everyone who showed up.
''You really are juggling and trying to balance the different contingencies,'' Ms. Levine said. ''It's not easy.''
Trinity used to consider only the first 400 applications it received, because officials had time to conduct only that many interviews. The limit resulted in a race to get paperwork to the school's door on West 91st Street the first day it would be accepted. Once the school started allowing online submissions, it became a who-can-cut-and-paste-fast-enough competition.
Mr. Bhaman recalled this vividly. The Trinity application was meant to be available online at midnight on Labor Day. At 11:45 p.m., a friend from his daughter's preschool called to say it was up. ''This is truly New York,'' Mr. Bhaman said. ''Not only do they not wait until midnight, but there are actually people who are online then.''
Now, Ms. Levine and her staff promise to consider all applications until they have selected 400 for interviews (free hint: most likely the end of October).
Echoing a sentiment heard across the city, Ms. Levine said her main goal was to ''find students that will thrive and parents who will add breadth and depth to our community.''
About 60 of them. ''I can't create more spaces,'' she said.

HEADLINE: F.D.A. to Review Safety Of Popular Bone Drugs

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON

 BODY:
Two advisory panels of the Food and Drug Administration will consider on Friday whether to recommend requiring women who use popular bone drugs like Fosamax to take ''drug holidays'' because of rising concerns about rare side effects with long-term use, according to people involved in the review.
The panels and F.D.A. staff members are also expected to conduct a comprehensive safety review of the medical evidence to date, after 16 years of growing use of the drugs, to determine whether they have proved to be safe and effective in use longer than three to five years. The recommendation could affect many of the estimated four million women in the United States who take the drugs, called bisphosphonates. Bisphosphonates inhibit a bone renewal process called resorption, adding bone mass, but possibly causing brittleness as well.
Fosamax was first approved in 1995 to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis and Paget's disease of the bone, conditions that weaken bones. It has also been marketed, controversially, for a pre-osteoporosis condition called osteopenia. The Fosamax patent expired in 2008 and generics have flooded the market. 
The F.D.A. announced in July that it would convene a joint meeting of advisory committees on drug safety and reproductive health to reconsider osteoporosis drugs after evidence surfaced linking long-term use with unusual breaks of the femur or thigh bone, bone death in the jaw, and possibly esophageal cancer.
This summer, the F.D.A. has formulated the questions it will ask the panels of scientific advisers, which are often central to shaping the debate and outcome. The panels meet Friday in Adelphi, Md. The agency usually follows its advisory panels' advice.
Bisphosphonates reduce hip and spine fractures in some postmenopausal women. They include Fosamax from Merck, Boniva from Roche Therapeutics, Actonel and Atelvia from Warner Chilcott, and growing numbers of generic copies.
Worldwide sales of bisphosphonates were $7.6 billion last year, down from a peak of $8.8 billion in 2007, with more than 75 percent of sales aimed at osteoporosis and the remainder at tumor-related calcium disorders, according to the data firm IMS Health. Dollar sales fell after Fosamax faced generic competition in 2008.
Ronald Rogers, a spokesman for Merck, said the company was responding to two questions from the F.D.A. One is whether the drugs have been proved to be safe and effective for longer term use, he said, while the other is whether to restrict that use or require ''drug holidays.'' Most research on the drugs is for three to five years, but many women take them indefinitely. Merck is planning to issue its report later this week, Mr. Rogers said.
His account of the questions was confirmed by a bone expert briefed on the F.D.A. plan, who declined to be identified because the F.D.A. is trying to keep it quiet until later this week.
Jeff Ventura, an F.D.A. spokesman, said the agency would disclose its questions and a staff report possibly on Wednesday. He declined further comment.
Last October, the F.D.A. ordered the makers of bisphosphonate drugs to add a warning to their labels about a small increased risk of atypical femur fractures. In 2005, it added a warning about the rare jaw disease called osteonecrosis.
Because the risks may increase with the length of time the drug is taken, whether to impose a stronger warning or even a ban on long-term use is the chief issue facing the advisory panels and the government. There is not a consensus among experts, leaving some clinicians and women uncertain about what is best in individual cases. The F.D.A. recommends women continue taking the drugs as prescribed pending the safety review.
''The risk-to-benefit ratio strongly favors bisphosphonate therapy,'' said Dr. Elizabeth J. Shane, a Columbia University professor and bone specialist who was co-chairwoman of task forces on the femur and jaw issues for the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. ''And while we are upset and worried and do not want to do anything that would cause anybody harm, we don't want to go back to 1990 and just have nothing for osteoporosis.''
Dr. Shane said the F.D.A. responded well to a society report last year by adding the label warning on atypical femur breaks. But she said other groups had not adopted the society's recommendations to develop a specific diagnostic code and national registry to track them.
''We need to figure out who is at risk to have these strange fractures,'' Dr. Shane said in an interview. Merck and other companies finance her research projects at Columbia.
Dr. Susan M. Ott, an associate medical professor and bone specialist at the University of Washington, who takes no research funds from industry, summarized the current science in a 12-page review article published by the Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine on Thursday.
''In my opinion, after five years in most cases it ought to be stopped,'' Dr. Ott said in an interview. She prescribes the drugs for shorter periods, but said evidence shows growing risks and no proven benefits after five years.
''The longest anybody could have taken this drug is 15 years now,'' Dr. Ott said. ''It's an ongoing experiment, and there are a few million women in the country who are participating in it. I keep wanting to say, 'You're all guinea pigs after five years because that's when the studies stopped.' ''
Dr. Richard S. Bockman, a member of the F.D.A. Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee, one of the two considering the drugs, said he thought the panels might recommend a ''drug holiday'' for some women. But he termed it ''kind of a weak escape'' without the benefit of better science.
Dr. Bockman, who is a professor at the Joan and Sanford Weill Medical College of Cornell University, said he did not think there was convincing evidence of harm related to duration of treatment.
As the F.D.A. is issuing its report next Wednesday, lawyers will be selecting a jury for a bellwether Fosamax trial at the United States District Court in Manhattan. Linda Secrest, a Florida woman who used Fosamax from 1998 to 2005, is suing Merck for product liability. She has osteonecrosis of the jaw.
Merck is facing about 1,115 lawsuits over jaw damage and 535 over unusual femur fractures and other bone injuries, the company said last month in a quarterly report. Merck has won three of the first cases to go to court on the jaw damage and lost one, in which the jury awarded $8 million. Merck is appealing. Mr. Rogers said the company was defending all the cases vigorously.
Timothy O'Brien, a lawyer from Pensacola, Fla., who represents Ms. Secrest and the woman who was awarded $8 million, said the F.D.A. panels' safety review was long overdue. ''I'm very glad they're finally doing a safety review after 16 years,'' he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 8, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about a Food and Drug Administration review of the safety of bisphosphonate drugs to build bone mass, misattributed remarks of a member of one of two advisory panels considering the issue. It was Dr. Richard S. Bockman, a professor at the Joan and Sanford Weill Medical College of Cornell University, who said a proposed ''drug holiday'' for longer-term users of the drugs was not warranted by current scientific evidence. The point was not made by Dr. Paul D. Blumenthal, a Stanford University professor and another member of the same panel.

HEADLINE: The Season for Optimism

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
''HOPE you enjoyed the Labor Day weekend. Did you know there are only 109 shopping days left until Christmas?''
O.K., perhaps the pitches retailers intend to deliver, beginning this week, will not be that blunt. But there is no underestimating their anxiety as they face a holiday shopping season hobbled by a struggling economy, a gyrating stock market and diminished consumer confidence.
Even so, few plan to stop or cut back on wooing shoppers, particularly because the weeks before Christmas are too crucial to their economic health to wave a white (or red and green) flag. And there were glimmers of hope last week when many retail chains reported better sales for August than had been expected. 
An example of the determination among retailers can be found in the September issue of Real Simple magazine. There are advertisements from a dozen retailers, among them Eileen Fisher, Gap Kids, Lord & Taylor, Nordstrom, J. C. Penney and Zappos.com. (And if readers shop with sufficient enthusiasm, there is also an ad for California Closets.)
Another example is a decision by Coldwater Creek, a retailer of apparel for older women, to run its first national television advertising campaign, which will promote its new fall merchandise. Upbeat commercials by DeVito/Verdi in New York, which are to begin appearing on Tuesday, present confident women of a certain age dressing for occasions like dates and class reunions.
''We are optimistic,'' said Ellis Verdi, president and co-founder of DeVito/Verdi, because whatever economic conditions may be, these women ''are not going to bum around in schleppy clothes.''
Another indication of how ardently retailers will pursue shoppers is an extensive campaign by Uniqlo, part of the Fast Retailing Company of Japan, that is to begin this week. The budget is estimated at $10 million to $15 million.
The campaign seeks to encourage visits to two large stores that Uniqlo plans to open in the fall in Manhattan, joining a store that was opened in SoHo in 2006. One new store will be on Fifth Avenue, at 53rd Street, and the other on 34th Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues.
The print, outdoor and online campaign also includes temporary ''pop-up'' stores, events, partnerships with organizations like Friends of the High Line and the Museum of Modern Art and social media like Facebook.
The campaign carries the theme ''Made for all,'' underlining the Uniqlo brand philosophy as a purveyor of ''high quality at a competitive price,'' said Shin Odake, chief executive of Uniqlo USA.
The cheap-chic approach -- a men's cashmere V-neck sweater costs $99.90 -- ought to strike a chord with frugal consumers.
To demonstrate the ''all'' in the campaign's theme, representing that Uniqlo can be ''worn by anyone,'' Mr. Odake said, ''no matter what age, gender, race, income,'' the ads present a wide variety of New Yorkers -- well-known, somewhat known and unknown -- modeling Uniqlo clothing.
Among the models are the actors Darren Criss, John Leguizamo, Laura Linney and Susan Sarandon; the co-founders of Friends of the High Line, Joshua David and Robert Hammond; Carlos Mendes of the Red Bulls soccer team; the chef David Chang; technology entrepreneurs like David Karp of Tumblr; and arts figures like the jazz musician Esperanza Spalding and Gregg Breinberg, director of the Public School 22 chorus of Staten Island.
Uniqlo is making charitable donations on behalf of those appearing in the campaign, but declined to discuss the amounts.
''Their business philosophy, that clothes don't have to be for a select few, happens to align with some of our business principles,'' said Mr. Chang, the owner of the Momofuku restaurants.
Mr. Chang said he had previously turned down offers to show ''my mug'' in ads. The reason he posed this time, he said, was not because he occasionally shops for T-shirts and jeans at Uniqlo, but because Uniqlo promised to ''donate money to a charity of our choice,'' a garden at P.S. 216 in Gravesend, Brooklyn, that is the first New York affiliate of the Edible Schoolyard program. Mr. Hammond described the Uniqlo contribution to the High Line as ''very generous'' and said he was enough of a fan of its cashmere sweaters to ''give them to my family.''
''They think they're expensive,'' he added, laughing. ''They don't have Uniqlo in Texas. They think it's $250; they don't know they're under $100.''
The campaign was created by Todd Waterbury in his capacity as consulting creative director for Uniqlo. He is a creative consultant who spent 16 years at Wieden & Kennedy.
The ads are intended to convey that Uniqlo is ''a social brand'' rather than ''a fashion brand,'' Mr. Waterbury said, adding that ''exclusivity'' is the hallmark of a fashion brand and ''inclusivity'' is the hallmark of a social brand.
The ads are written in an offbeat, poetic style evocative of a manifesto. For instance, Mr. Chang is described thusly: ''He flavors his food with life. He always thinks up fresh ideas. He is a staple of goodness. He reinvents tradition.''
And ads in a teaser campaign referred to Uniqlo as ''a toolbox for living,'' ''how the future dresses'' and ''clothing in the absolute.''
The language is meant as ''a signal this is a very different way to think about clothing,'' Mr. Waterbury said, and highlight ''the amount of thinking'' Uniqlo employees ''bring to everything they make.''
Asked if the language echoed Gap campaigns -- notably, ''What Fits?,'' a 1992 commercial with the poet Max Blagg, and pants ads about celebrities who wore khakis -- Mr. Waterbury replied: ''What this is is a different concept, a different idea,'' centered on New Yorkers who ''challenge conventional thinking, create change.''
''What it is they stand for and contribute is what we're excited about,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Time to Revive Home Ec

BYLINE: By HELEN ZOE VEIT. 
Helen Zoe Veit, an assistant professor of history at Michigan State University, is the author of the forthcoming ''Victory Over Ourselves: American Food in the Era of the Great War.''

 BODY:
East Lansing, Mich.
NOBODY likes home economics. For most people, the phrase evokes bland food, bad sewing and self-righteous fussiness.
But home economics is more than a 1950s teacher in cat's-eye glasses showing her female students how to make a white sauce. Reviving the program, and its original premises -- that producing good, nutritious food is profoundly important, that it takes study and practice, and that it can and should be taught through the public school system -- could help us in the fight against obesity and chronic disease today.
The home economics movement was founded on the belief that housework and food preparation were important subjects that should be studied scientifically. The first classes occurred in the agricultural and technical colleges that were built from the proceeds of federal land grants in the 1860s. By the early 20th century, and increasingly after the passage of federal legislation like the 1917 Smith-Hughes Act, which provided support for the training of teachers in home economics, there were classes in elementary, middle and high schools across the country. When universities excluded women from most departments, home economics was a back door into higher education. Once there, women worked hard to make the case that ''domestic science'' was in fact a scientific discipline, linked to chemistry, biology and bacteriology. 
Indeed, in the early 20th century, home economics was a serious subject. When few understood germ theory and almost no one had heard of vitamins, home economics classes offered vital information about washing hands regularly, eating fruits and vegetables and not feeding coffee to babies, among other lessons.
Eventually, however, the discipline's basic tenets about health and hygiene became so thoroughly popularized that they came to seem like common sense. As a result, their early proponents came to look like old maids stating the obvious instead of the innovators and scientists that many of them really were. Increasingly, home economists' eagerness to dispense advice on everything from eating to sleeping to posture galled.
Today we remember only the stereotypes about home economics, while forgetting the movement's crucial lessons on healthy eating and cooking.
Too many Americans simply don't know how to cook. Our diets, consisting of highly processed foods made cheaply outside the home thanks to subsidized corn and soy, have contributed to an enormous health crisis. More than half of all adults and more than a third of all children are overweight or obese. Chronic diseases associated with weight gain, like heart disease and diabetes, are hobbling more and more Americans.
In the last decade, many cities and states have tried -- and generally failed -- to tax junk food or to ban the use of food stamps to buy soda. Clearly, many people are leery of any governmental steps to promote healthy eating; Michelle Obama's campaign against childhood obesity has inspired right-wing panic about a secret food police.
But what if the government put the tools of obesity prevention in the hands of children themselves, by teaching them how to cook?
My first brush with home economics, as a seventh grader in a North Carolina public school two decades ago, was grim. The most sophisticated cooking we did was opening a can of pre-made biscuit dough, sticking our thumbs in the center of each raw biscuit to make a hole, and then handing them over to the teacher, who dipped them in hot grease to make doughnuts.
Cooking classes for public school students need not be so utterly stripped of content, or so cynical about students' abilities to cook and enjoy high-quality food.
A year later, my father's job took our family to Wales, where I attended, for a few months, a large school in a mid-size industrial city. There, students brought ingredients from home and learned to follow recipes, some simple and some not-so-simple, eventually making vegetable soups and meat and potato pies from scratch. It was the first time I had ever really cooked anything. I remember that it was fun, and with an instructor standing by, it wasn't hard. Those were deeply empowering lessons, ones that stuck with me when I first started cooking for myself in earnest after college.
In the midst of contracting school budgets and test-oriented curricula, the idea of reviving home economics as part of a broad offensive against obesity might sound outlandish. But teaching cooking -- real cooking -- in public schools could help address a host of problems facing Americans today. The history of home economics shows it's possible.

HEADLINE: Online Courses for College Credit: Boon or Bane?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Online Enterprises Gain Foothold as Path to a College Degree'' (front page, Aug. 25):
This online evolution is a natural extension of higher education and something that should be embraced. 
Our nation faces the challenge of preparing workers for a dynamic global economy. If we are to succeed, we will need creative approaches.
Early on, career colleges made online education available to students working full time, as well as single parents and members of the military, who did not always have time to travel to a campus to pursue their education. These schools found that learning could exist outside the campus and that students benefited from the flexibility.
Today, we need to push beyond our traditional thinking of higher education. It should not be limited to a student's physical proximity to a campus. The more we focus on preparing students for in-demand jobs, the stronger our nation will become.
I believe that students who pursue online programs will find their future as bright as the digital revolution itself.
JONATHAN FANTON Fairfield, Conn., Aug. 30, 2011
The writer is former president of both the MacArthur Foundation and the New School for Social Research and serves on the board of advisers to the Coalition for Educational Success.
To the Editor:
Convenience, price and speed to degree seem to be the emerging benchmarks for higher education in the United States. In other words, the consumer model has carried the day. University education has gone from being a calling (note its roots in educating the next generation of clergymen) or an intellectual apprenticeship to being a tacky food court of empty-calorie academic junk food.
''Receiving Credit for Job Experience,'' a sidebar to your article about online learning, describes Learning Counts, which teaches students to create a portfolio to document and justify the inclusion of nonacademic experiences in college credits. But photographs and work memos are hardly a substitute for reading and research experience in a rigorous liberal arts class.
Programs like these make me wonder how long America's higher education system will remain the world's principal research engine.

HEADLINE: Troubled Schools Mimicking Charters

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Classrooms are festooned with college pennants. Hallway placards proclaim: ''No Excuses!'' Students win prizes for attendance. They start classes earlier and end later than their neighbors; some return to school on Saturdays. And they get to pore over math problems one-on-one with newly hired tutors, many of them former accountants and engineers.
If these new mores at Lee High School, long one of Houston's most troubled campuses, make it seem like one of those intense charter schools, that is no accident.
In the first experiment of its kind in the country, the Houston public schools are testing whether techniques proven successful in high-performing urban charters can also help raise achievement in regular public schools. Working with Roland G. Fryer, a researcher at Harvard who studies the racial achievement gap, Houston officials last year embraced five key tenets of such charters at nine district secondary schools; this fall, they are expanding the program to 11 elementary schools. A similar effort is beginning in Denver. 
''We can't sit idly by and let parents think that only the quality charter schools can educate poor kids well,'' said Terry Grier, Houston's hard-charging superintendent. ''If you see something good, why not try to replicate it?''
When first conceived 20 years ago, charter schools -- which are publicly financed but independently operated -- offered two distinct promises: to serve as an escape hatch for children in failing schools, and to be incubators of innovation that, through market forces, would invigorate neighborhood schools. There are scores of examples of the former, but almost none of the latter. Instead, years of bickering have ensued among charter advocates, school boards and teachers' unions.
''One of the rationales for charters was that they would figure out practices that could be adopted by school districts,'' said Grover J. Whitehurst, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and former federal education official. ''I hope Roland succeeds, because if he does it'll be a very important demonstration that bad public schools can be fixed.''
Houston is an apt laboratory. It is the birthplace of the Knowledge Is Power Program, or KIPP, a national charter chain, as well as home to 105 charters that compete with the district's 300 schools for students and tax dollars. Texas also bars union shops, so school districts often have more leeway in managing teachers' work than elsewhere.
The experiment, which is known as Apollo 20 and cost $19 million in its first year, has had mixed results: Lee High School saw double-digit gains on state tests last spring, moving to ''acceptable'' on the Texas school report card system after many years of being rated ''unacceptable.'' But four of the nine Apollo schools remained on the unacceptable list, and at some the percentage of students passing state tests actually dipped.
Dr. Fryer, an economist and head of Harvard's EdLabs, a research group, has gained national attention in recent years as the architect of incentive programs that offered students cash for improved performance, including one in New York City that was discontinued after being deemed ineffective. In recent years, he has visited scores of charter schools nationwide. ''Some should be closed down this afternoon,'' he said, but others have virtually erased the achievement gap between poor minority students and their white peers.
In 2009, Dr. Fryer identified five policies common to successful charters, including those run by KIPP and the Harlem Children's Zone: longer school days and years; more rigorous and selective hiring of principals and teachers; frequent quizzes whose results determine what needs to be retaught; what he calls ''high-dosage tutoring''; and a ''no excuses'' culture.
He then set about trying to find a public schools superintendent willing to embrace them. Neither Joel I. Klein in New York nor Michelle Rhee in Washington bit; officials in Omaha decided the political risks of copying charters were too high.
But in February 2010, Dr. Fryer spoke by phone with Dr. Grier, who had been on the job in Houston for six months. As a superintendent in eight other districts over 25 years, Dr. Grier had won plaudits from some educators for trying things like pay for performance and teacher bonuses. ''How soon can you get down here?'' Dr. Fryer recalled him asking.
Over the next six months, the two men selected the Apollo schools, hired several new principals and scores of new teachers and recruited and trained about 200 math tutors. In the process, the district paid $6 million in severance to 100 teachers who chose to retire rather than participate, and agreed to pay others for working extra hours (something charters often do not do). The Houston Federation of Teachers, the city's largest union, took no formal position on the project.
The preparations were intense: half an hour before Dr. Fryer's wedding in June last year, Dr. Grier called his cellphone to review some details.
''Literally, I said, 'Terry, I've got to go, I've got to get married. I'll call you back,' '' Dr. Fryer recalled.
One person watching the experiment closely is Mike Feinberg, who co-founded the first KIPP school here in 1994, and now serves on the program's national board and runs its 20 Houston-area charters. Mr. Feinberg sees Houston's education marketplace as akin to when FedEx emerged to challenge the United States Postal Service. The result: Priority Mail.
''They've been trying to fix Lee High School for 20 years,'' he said. ''But up until now, there's been no competitive pressure for them to really get crazy and do transformational things.''
One of those transformational things at Lee High was hiring 50 full-time math tutors, who are paid $20,000 a year -- less than $14 an hour -- plus benefits and possible bonuses if their students do well.
''I don't get this,'' Jennifer Martinez, a junior wearing an ''I love boys'' bracelet, told her tutor, Gerald Frentz, an engineer, one day last week.
They were talking about integers. Mr. Frentz, 56, retired from the Navy in 1986 and has since worked at Wang Computer and been a tae kwon do instructor and substitute teacher. Jennifer's puzzlement visibly faded as he explained how negative 7 and positive 7 have the same absolute value -- definition: distance from zero -- but are separated by 14 ticks along a number line.
''It's an addictive experience,'' Mr. Frentz said of the tutoring.
Lee High's new principal, Xochitl Rodriguez-Davila, described a torrent of challenges, including the exhaustive review of transcripts and test results to organize class schedules and tutoring for 1,600 students; persuading parents to sign KIPP-style contracts pledging that they would help raise achievement; and replacing about a third of Lee's 100 teachers.
''Teachers by far have been the biggest struggle,'' said Ms. Rodriguez-Davila, 39, who previously was a middle school principal.
In faculty meetings, she said, some people insisted that Lee's immigrant students would never master biology or physics. Other veterans, though, told the complainers to stop belly-aching and get on with the turnaround.
Dr. Fryer, who has made 17 trips to Houston over the past year, is watching not only the Apollo schools but a parallel control group of other Houston schools with similar demographics and prior test results, to rigorously analyze the effectiveness of the three-year experiment.
Even without the formal study, Dr. Grier knows that the mimicking of charter practices is, at best, partial. The academic year started Aug. 15 at the nine Apollo secondary schools, a week ahead of the rest of the district -- and the same day as KIPP. But even with Apollo's lengthened days, KIPP students had still more instructional hours last year: about 1,735, compared with about 1,435 at Lee High School.
''We got close, but we didn't get there completely,'' Dr. Grier said.

HEADLINE: Pakistan and U.S. Hail New Qaeda Arrests

BYLINE: By SALMAN MASOOD; Eric Schmitt and Jackie Calmes contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- American and Pakistani officials celebrated their cooperation on Monday as Pakistan announced the arrests of three men they identified as senior operatives of Al Qaeda who had been planning attacks on American and other Western targets. 
The shift in tone was particularly noticeable for Pakistan, which has been bitter toward the United States in the four months since its military was surprised, humiliated and infuriated by the Navy Seals raid in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden.
''This operation was planned and conducted with technical assistance of United States intelligence agencies with whom Inter-Services Intelligence has a strong, historic intelligence relationship,'' the Pakistan's military said in a statement, referring to Pakistan's top military spy agency. ''Both Pakistan and United States intelligence agencies continue to work closely together to enhance security of their respective nations.''
One of the men arrested was identified as Younis al-Mauritani, who was captured in southwestern city of Quetta, which has long been thought of as a safe haven for Taliban and Qaeda leadership. American officials said Monday that he had a central role in planning attacks in Europe.
The Pakistan military said he was ''responsible for planning and conduct of international operations'' for Al Qaeda. ''Al-Mauritani was tasked personally by Osama bin Laden to focus on hitting targets of economical importance in United States of America, Europe and Australia,'' the military said. ''He was planning to target United States economic interests including gas/oil pipelines, power generating dams and strike ships/oil tankers through explosive-laden speed boats in international waters.''
In Washington, the deputy White House press secretary, Joshua Earnest, praised his capture and the collaboration behind it. ''We applaud the actions of Pakistan's intelligence and security services that led to the capture of a senior Al Qaeda operative who was involved in planning attacks against the interests of the United States and many other countries,'' he said.
The last time Pakistan announced the arrest of a Qaeda operative, in mid-May, the relationship between Pakistan and the United States risked spiraling out of control as the Pakistan Army and NATO helicopters exchanged fire on the Pakistan side of the border with Afghanistan. Two Pakistani soldiers were wounded in the firefight, which came as some in Washington questioned the $3 billion a year in aid to the country.
Tensions have run high since the May 2 raid on Bin Laden's compound, which inflamed Pakistani sensitivities over sovereignty while at the same time heightening distrust of Pakistan in the United States.
Monday's announcement sought to strike a note of respect for a relationship portrayed as longstanding. ''The intimate cooperation between Pakistan and United States intelligence agencies has resulted into prevention of number of high-profile terrorist acts not only inside Pakistan/United States but elsewhere also in world,'' the Pakistan Army statement said.

HEADLINE: Where The Jobs Aren't

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
With the economy stagnating and unemployment high, where are the jobs of the future going to come from? A few years ago, it seemed as though the Green Economy could be a big part of the answer.
New clean-energy sources could address environmental, economic and national security problems all at once. In his 2008 convention speech, Barack Obama promised to create five million green economy jobs. The U.S. Conference of Mayors estimated in April 2009 that green jobs could account for 10 percent of new job growth over the next 30 years.
Alas, it was not to be. The gigantic public investments in green energy may be stimulating innovation and helping the environment. But they are not evidence that the government knows how to create private-sector jobs. 
Recently, Aaron Glantz reported in The Times on some of the disappointments. California was awarded $186 million in federal stimulus money to weatherize homes. So far, the program has created the equivalent of only 538 full-time jobs. A $59 million effort to train people for green jobs in California produced only 719 job placements.
SolFocus designs solar panels in the United States, but the bulk of its employment is in China where the panels are actually made. As the company spokesman told Glantz, ''Taxes and labor rates'' are cheaper there.
There's a wealth of other evidence to suggest that the green economy will not be a short-term jobs machine. According to Investor's Business Daily, executives at Johnson Controls turned $300 million in green technology grants into 150 jobs -- that's $2 million per job.
Sunil Sharan, a former director of The Smart Grid Initiative at General Electric, wrote in The Washington Post that the Smart Grid, while efficient and environmentally beneficial, will be a net job destroyer. For example, 28,000 meter-reading jobs will be replaced by the Smart Grid's automatic transmitters.
A study by McKinsey suggests that clean energy may produce jobs for highly skilled engineers, but it will not produce many jobs for U.S. manufacturing workers. Gordon Hughes, formerly of the World Bank and now an economist at the University of Edinburgh, surveyed the landscape and concluded: ''There are no sound economic arguments to support an assertion that green energy policies will increase the total level of employment in the medium or longer term when we hold macroeconomic conditions constant.''
Many of the most celebrated green tech companies are foundering despite lavish public support. Evergreen Solar, the recipient of tens of millions of dollars in state support, moved its manufacturing facility to China before filing for bankruptcy protection.
The U.S. Department of Energy poured $535 million in loans into Solyndra, a solar panel maker backed by George Kaiser, a major Democratic donor.
The Government Accountability Office discovered that Solyndra had been permitted to bypass required steps in the government loan guarantee process. The Energy Department's inspector general criticized the department for not maintaining e-mails that discussed how the loan guarantee winners were chosen.
Late last month, Solyndra announced that it was ceasing operations, laying off its 1,100 employees. The Department of Energy placed the wrong bet, potentially losing the taxpayers half-a-billion dollars.
All of this is not to say that the government shouldn't be doing what it can to promote clean energy. It is to say that the government isn't very good when it tries to directly create private-sector jobs.
In 2009, Josh Lerner of Harvard Business School published a useful book called ''Boulevard of Broken Dreams.'' He found that for each instance in which the government has successfully promoted entrepreneurial activity, there is a pile of instances in which it failed.
Lerner details case after case where public investments produced little or nothing. But he also makes an important distinction between government efforts to set the table for entrepreneurial activity and government efforts to create jobs directly. Setting the table means building an underlying context for innovation: funding academic research, establishing clear laws, improving immigration policies, building infrastructure and keeping capital gains tax rates low. Lerner notes that one of the most important government initiatives to encourage innovation was the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, which gave universities automatic title to research paid by the federal government.
These table-setting efforts work. The problem is the results are indirect, the jobs take a long time to emerge and the market may end up favoring old-energy sources instead of shiny new ones. So politicians invariably go for the instant rush. They try to use taxpayer money to create private jobs now. But they end up wasting billions.
We should pursue green innovation. We just shouldn't imagine these efforts will create the jobs we need.

HEADLINE: The Clock Is Ticking: Washington needs a strategy to build up a government that Afghans will fight for

 BODY:
A minimally successful end to the Afghan war depends on weakening the Taliban militarily and helping Afghanistan build up a government that won't implode as soon as American troops are gone.
President George W. Bush gave the war -- and the rebuilding -- shockingly short shrift. President Obama has devoted far more troops and resources, and the United States and NATO have made progress in clearing militants from southern strongholds and building up Afghan security forces. Afghanistan is still a very dangerous place. While overall violence is down, August was the deadliest month of the war for American troops, including several Navy Seal commandos who were killed when their helicopter was shot down.
At this point, we are skeptical that the administration has a comprehensive strategy to help build up a government that Afghans would be willing to fight for.
Mr. Obama has ordered home 33,000 of 100,000 troops by the end of next summer, with Afghans to take full responsibility for their security in 2014. We support that decision. After a decade of fighting, 1,700 American lives lost and $450 billion spent, it is time for the troops to start coming home. But no one should minimize the risks. 
Afghans have no love for the Taliban's brutality. They show extraordinary courage every day when they send 2.5 million of their daughters to school. Still, if the president's withdrawal timetable has any chance at all, Washington will have to do a lot more to try to build up a government that can deliver basic services and minimal security; one that doesn't steal its people blind and offers all Afghans -- including women -- a real opportunity to participate in the country's political life.
And while the State Department this year finally tripled the number of civilians in the field -- there are now more than 1,100 -- to oversee aid and development, there is already talk of bringing some of them home.
There isn't a lot of time left. Here are some of the major issues that must be addressed:
GOVERNANCE President Hamid Karzai is more difficult to work with than ever. The government was paralyzed for months after he named a special court to review last year's fraud-tainted parliamentary election, which gave his Pashtun clan far fewer seats than expected. Under Western pressure, Mr. Karzai recently agreed to a compromise. But his unchecked power and frictions with Washington are serious problems.
Some ministries, like health, perform reasonably well because competent people were found to run them and the Americans provided technical advice. But that is the exception. The truth is that Afghanistan still lacks a functioning government, Parliament or banking system.
Washington has a chance to set a fresh tone with the new American team in Kabul -- Ambassador Ryan Crocker; Gen. John Allen, the commander for the war; and Marc Grossman, the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan -- respected veterans who don't have the same history of tensions with Mr. Karzai as their predecessors.
To clear the way for a new generation of politicians, and break the lock of cronyism, Mr. Karzai has to step down in 2014, as the Afghan Constitution demands. He says he will. The Americans should use all of the levers they have to make sure that he keeps his word. The Americans must also press him to make political reforms that will help develop credible candidates and make it harder to tamper with the 2014 vote.
There are some competent officials at the local and provincial levels, many encouraged by the Americans and assisted by military and technical advisers. But many have been targets of Taliban violence. There must be more effort on building this level of governance, including providing more security for officials.
RECONCILIATION In February, after much resistance, American officials publicly endorsed the idea of negotiations with the Taliban on a political settlement. Washington held several preliminary meetings with a representative of Mullah Muhammad Omar. While there was little apparent progress, in a statement issued Tuesday, the Taliban leader acknowledged the contacts and left open the door for more.
We are skeptical that there is a deal to be had, but the Americans should keep looking for openings. At a minimum, talks with Taliban leaders may make it easier for lower-level fighters to decide to come in from the cold, especially if NATO continues to pound away at them. Washington should consider supporting the appointment of an international mediator who might be better able to bring more insurgent groups to the table.
ECONOMIC SUPPORTAccording to the World Bank, an estimated 97 percent of Afghanistan's roughly $28 billion gross domestic product comes from military and development aid and the in-country spending of foreign troops.
An awful lot of that money has been stolen or wasted, but not all of it. Sixty-four percent or more of Afghans now have some access to health care, up from 9 percent under the last year of Taliban rule; eight million children are in school, up from one million in 2001; infant mortality is down; adult longevity is up; half of all Afghan families have cellphones.
What the aid has not built is a stable and viable country. The Afghan government is still struggling to develop the capacity to run -- and finance -- programs on its own. Revenues cover only one-third of the government's $4.5 billion budget. Officials fear the economy could contract by 40 percent as the troops leave.
International donors will need to keep underwriting Afghanistan for years to come. But self-sufficiency has to be the goal.
The most immediate question is where will Afghanistan get the $6 billion to $8 billion per year that it needs to maintain a planned 379,000-man security force that is now paid for by foreign donors? Or keep countless other projects and jobs afloat? What will happen if thousands of armed young men are unemployed?
Washington needs a plan to address these challenges. It also needs to spend smarter by investing in projects that are achievable and sustainable but will still strengthen governance and services. One success story: the National Solidarity Program that pays for local projects developed and managed by Afghans themselves.
Over the long term, the country's huge mineral resources, if developed right, could produce significant jobs and revenue. One short-term idea worth considering: channeling billions of dollars in remittances -- sent home by Afghans working in the gulf and in Iran -- into Afghan banks to underwrite loans. Afghanistan will first need to build a functioning banking system; the corruption and near-collapse of the Kabul Bank is a reminder of how much effort that will take.
PAKISTAN Afghanistan will never have a chance at lasting stability if Pakistan continues to harbor and support the Taliban and other extremist groups. If negotiations with the Taliban ever get real traction, Pakistan will have leverage -- for good or ill.
The biggest problem, for both Afghanistan and Pakistan, is that Pakistan's military leadership still sees the Taliban as a proxy for ensuring its influence in Afghanistan, and any move it makes against the extremists as a favor to Washington -- rather than also a fight for its own survival.
Relations between Washington and Islamabad have not recovered since the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The administration needs to keep searching for ways to revive a working relationship and change the self-destructive mind-set of Pakistan's leaders. Ending all aid would be a serious mistake, but withholding certain military aid, as the administration has done, could help.
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY The withdrawal of American troops must not be an invitation for a revival of the 19th century's ''Great Game.'' For the sake of their own stability, Pakistan, India, Iran and others need to agree to respect Afghanistan's (and each other's) sovereignty and forswear interference and conflict.
Turkey will test its leadership skills when it holds a regional conference in November aimed at producing some agreement along those lines. In December, a bigger international meeting in Bonn is supposed to lay out economic initiatives that could help stabilize Afghanistan. Ideas include new investments as well as a broad vision for a ''new silk road'' that would create jobs and foster economic integration through trade and energy projects.
The United States and its allies have to marshal their best arguments and diplomatic skills to ensure that those meetings produce real results and a persuasive message that is heard by all people in Afghanistan and Pakistan. As we said, there is not a lot of time.

HEADLINE: European Bankers Urge Leaders to Move Quickly on Debt Crisis

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN AND JAMES KANTER; Liz Alderman reported from Paris and James Kanter from Brussels. David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris, Jack Ewing from Frankfurt and Stephen Castle from Brussels.

 BODY:
PARIS -- As the stock and bond markets seem eerily similar to the dark days of 2008, Jean-Claude Trichet and Mario Draghi, the current and incoming chiefs of the European Central Bank, pointedly urged European leaders to move quickly to ensure that the euro zone's debt crisis does not become seriously worse.
Europe needs to ''make a quantum step up in economic and political integration,'' Mr. Draghi said as the bond yields of Greece, Italy and other countries with weak finances jumped Monday amid investor fears that such efforts might be failing. He and Mr. Trichet addressed a forum in Paris that focused on the world three years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. 
President Obama will deliver a jobs speech on Thursday, a day before the Group of 7 wealthiest nations meet in Marseille to discuss the European and American economies. Washington wants to make sure that headwinds from Europe's crisis do not cross the Atlantic while the United States economy remains weak.
Mr. Draghi's call goes to the heart of what politicians now acknowledge is a root cause of Europe's crisis, but that few seem ready to change: the lack of a federal fiscal union that would make the euro zone look more like the United States. The idea is something that Germany and others are wary of because it could undermine their national authority.
The calls for what defenders of sovereignty have called the ''F word'' -- federalism -- are growing louder, however, as investors warn that volatile financial markets are starting to look similar to the days surrounding Lehman Brothers' collapse.
Mr. Trichet, who turns over the central bank presidency to Mr. Draghi at the end of October, renewed calls for a federal European government, with a federal finance ministry. Those institutions would have the power to ''impose decisions on countries'' whose own policies threaten the rest of the euro union, Mr. Trichet said at the Paris conference, sponsored by the Institut Montaigne, a research group.
In Brussels, meanwhile, an unusual gathering of former European leaders, academics and industrialists urged politicians to recognize that part of the answer to Europe's ills was to give up some sovereignty to keep the euro alive.
''It has become clear that a monetary union without some form of fiscal federalism and coordinated economic policy will not work,'' the group said in a statement. Its members include a former German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder; a former Finnish prime minister, Matti Vanhanen; and Nouriel Roubini, a New York University economist.
''Either the Europeans move forward,'' Mr. Roubini said, or face ''a situation of potential breakup or disintegration.''
Benoit d'Anglelin, a former Lehman banker for 15 years who is now a manager at Ondra Partners, a financial advisory firm in Paris, said he was seeing ''extreme risk aversion now'' by pension funds and institutional investors, who have been dumping ''everything risk-related,'' since March.
''It's becoming unsustainable,'' Mr. d'Anglelin said. ''Imagine what will happen if the selling gets more serious.''
Despite pledges by European leaders in July to pump billions of euros more into a European Union bailout fund for debt-stricken countries, known as the European Financial Stability Facility, it is not so clear that parliaments in the 17 countries in the euro zone will approve an expansion.
It is also possible that a German constitutional court could throw the euro into chaos when it issues a ruling Wednesday on Germany's participation in the rescue mechanism for fiscally troubled euro members. Analysts say the judges are likely to impose restrictions on the German government that could make decision making in the zone even more cumbersome than it already is.
It would be surprise if the panel of judges banned Germany from taking part altogether, a drastic step that would deprive the rescue fund of its biggest contributor and undermine the integrity of the euro. But the court could well require a vote by the German Parliament every time the bailout fund makes a big move.
Members of the advisory group that gathered Monday in Brussels, including Mr. Schroder, expressed strong support for euro bonds. Despite a fierce debate in Germany, Mr. Schroder said the German public could accept them -- as long as there were strict controls placed on how and when they were issued.
Even if euro bonds win wider backing, there are other issues that threaten to upend plans for a tighter monetary union to support the euro. Finland has cast doubt on pledges of European unity by insisting that it receive collateral from Greece in return for aid, another issue that threatens to upset plans to expand the bailout fund. Finland's prime minister, Jyrid Katainen, pledged Monday to resolve the issue quickly.
Europe's leaders are acting like firefighters, Felipe Gonzalez, a former Spanish prime minister, said at the briefing held in Brussels. ''They try to deal with the current fire but not prevent the next.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Fallacy Behind Tax Holidays

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
As President Obama confronts the nation's dismal unemployment problem - stubbornly stuck at 9.1 percent with, shockingly, zero net jobs created in August - Wall Street and corporate America are working behind the scenes in Washington to push for a series of temporary tax breaks, which they insist will help create jobs.
Of course, businesses want an overhaul of the corporate tax code that would reduce rates for the long term. But for now they are seeking a series of tax holidays, including a payroll tax break for employers, not just employees, and a tax break to let companies repatriate about $1 trillion that is sitting overseas. In turn, they say, they will spend it on new recruits, perhaps as many as 2.9 million of them, according to a letter the United States Chamber of Commerce sent to the president on Monday. 
Consider it a form of horse trading - tax cuts for jobs. There is only one small problem with this strategy: temporary tax cuts rarely result in new jobs and always result in less tax revenue.
''Tax policy is not a great lever for adjusting short-term growth,'' explained Howard Gleckman, a resident fellow at the Tax Policy Center , who has reviewed dozens of studies on the subject. Most temporary tax holidays ''reward people for what they are going to do anyway,'' he said, adding that ''the bang for the buck is very low - you're subsidizing companies that were already going to hire.''
A seminal study by John H. Bishop and Mark Montgomery that looked at the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit bill from 1977, which was aimed at temporarily giving employers an incentive to hire disadvantaged workers, showed that ''at least 70 percent of the tax credits were claimed for hiring workers who would have been hired even in the absence of the tax credit.'' Companies claimed more than $4.5 billion in credits as a result.
That is not to suggest that tax policy cannot help with long-term growth - virtually every academic study says it absolutely can - but that tax policy is a lousy way to stimulate the economy on a temporary basis.
Let's be honest, even if it is an uncomfortable truth: The jobs crisis is not really a function of tax policy; it is a function of economics. Right now, there is too little demand for products.
R. David McLean, a visiting assistant professor of finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management, published a new study last week that showed companies were sitting on trillion-dollar piles of cash, not because they are hoarders or greedy, but because they are worried about the economy and that their businesses might not be as strong as they hope in the future.
Mr. McLean said the volatility of cash flow had gone up over the last 30 years. For every dollar that companies have raised in recent years by issuing new shares, they have saved 60 cents, he said. ''My study suggests that firms are saving more of their share issuance proceeds as cash because they have greater needs for precautionary cash savings than before,'' he added.
To Mr. McLean, the lesson is that public policy toward business must be about creating as much certainty on regulations as possible, given that economic cycles will most likely create their own uncertainty. ''If they know the rules of the game, it's easier to play ball - even if you don't like the rules,'' he said.
Devising short-term tax incentives is the antithesis of creating long-term certainty - sticking to the rules of the game. Indeed, such holidays can create perverse incentives. The debate over a tax break for companies to repatriate cash from overseas, for example, has already created a new moral hazard of sorts. When Congress provided a one-time tax break in 2004 for this purpose, it said such a holiday should never be repeated.
''If Congress enacts a second tax holiday, rational corporate executives will conclude that more tax holidays are likely in the future,'' Chuck Marr and Brian Highsmith of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities recently wrote. ''That will make corporations more inclined to shift income into tax havens and less likely to make investments in the United States.''
John T. Chambers, chief executive of Cisco Systems, has been a longtime proponent of such a tax holiday. ''We believe that at least temporarily reducing the incremental tax rate on foreign-earned profits would encourage companies to invest in the U.S.,'' he wrote on his blog last year. The company does not seem so interested in investing here at the moment; it is in the process of eliminating some 10,000 workers in the United States.
''They already have a lot of money now - they're not going to start spending it because of a tax holiday,'' Reuven S. Avi-Yonah, an international tax lawyer who teaches at the University of Michigan and has regularly testified in front of Congress, said of American companies pushing for the tax break.
One of the other ideas floating around is a temporary break on payroll taxes for employers - in addition to extending the current payroll tax holiday for employees past Jan. 1. The tax holiday for employees may make some sense: it provides extra cash directly to workers, who may put it back into the economy by spending it. A payroll tax holiday for employers is a different story. It would lower the 6.2 percent tax they pay on the wages of every worker they employ, in the hope that this would give them an incentive to hire workers.
But again, there is that little problem with demand. ''Every C.E.O. and C.F.O. will tell you they will only hire when they are confident they can get sales,'' Mr. Gleckman said. ''They say to themselves, 'How much can we sell with the workers we have?' But there's nothing a C.E.O. hates more than not being able to fill an order. Only then will they hire.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Yes, We Need Jobs. But What Kind?

BYLINE: By PAUL OSTERMAN. 
Paul Osterman, an economist at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, is the co-author of ''Good Jobs America: Making Work Better for Everyone.''

 BODY:
Cambridge, Mass.
ON Thursday, President Obama will deliver a major speech on America's employment crisis. But too often, what is lost in the call for job creation is a clear idea of what jobs we want to create.
I recently led a research team to the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, where Gov. Rick Perry, a contender for the Republican presidential nomination, has advertised his track record of creating jobs. From January 2000 to January 2010, employment in the Valley grew by a remarkable 42 percent, compared with our nation's anemic 1 percent job growth. 
But the median wage for adults in the Valley between 2005 and 2008 was a stunningly low $8.14 an hour (in 2008 dollars). One in four employed adults earned less than $6.19 an hour. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas reported that the per capita income in the two metropolitan statistical areas spanning the Valley ranked lowest and second lowest in the nation.
These workers aren't alone. Last year, one in five American adults worked in jobs that paid poverty-level wages. Worker displacement contributes to the problem. People who are laid off from previously stable employment, if they are lucky enough to find work, take a median wage hit of over 20 percent, which can persist for decades.
To understand the impact of low wages, in the Valley and elsewhere, we interviewed a wide range of people, including two directors of public health clinics, three priests, a school principal and four focus groups of residents. Everyone described a life of constantly trying to scrape by. One month they might pay for the phone, another, for utilities. Everyone knew how long each company would carry unpaid bills before cutting service. People spoke not only of their fear of an unexpected crisis -- an illness, a broken car -- but also of the challenge of paying for basic needs like school supplies. Many used the phrase ''one paycheck away from homelessness.''
Because their parents cannot afford child care, children move among relatives and neighbors. They watch too much TV. They don't finish their homework. Older children grow up too fast from parenting their younger siblings. As one person observed, ''All you think about is which bill is more important.''
Economic stress strains marriages. Parents cannot afford quinceaneras for their daughters. In church youth groups, teenagers ask why they should stay in school if all they can get are low wages.
Many children are latchkey kids. Accidents are frequent; we heard of an elementary school student who badly burned himself in a science experiment, with his older brother watching. Their father couldn't take time off from work to visit his son in the hospital. Children come to school sick. Parents miss teacher conferences because they can't afford time off. Type 2 diabetes is a scourge in the Valley. Since Type 2 diabetics can be asymptomatic for years, many don't buy medicine; as time passes, they become severely ill, often losing sight or a limb.
The director at one clinic, with nearly 70,000 visits a year, estimated that half of its patients had anxiety or depression. Often people can't get to the clinic because they cannot afford to lose work time or because gas costs too much. When they go, they take their families, because they have no child care.
And yet the Valley is not hopeless. Teachers stay late to help with homework. They make home visits to meet parents. Health clinic employees work overtime. The community organization Valley Interfaith has pushed for training opportunities and living-wage jobs. There is no ''culture of poverty,'' but the low-wage economy has corrosive and tragic consequences.
Must we choose between job quality and quantity? We have solid evidence that when employees are paid better and given more opportunities within a company, the gains outweigh the costs. For example, after a living wage ordinance took effect for employees at the San Francisco International Airport, in 1999, turnover fell and productivity rose.
Contrary to the antigovernment rhetoric, there is much that the public sector can do to improve the quality of jobs.
A recent analysis by the Economic Policy Institute reported that 20 percent of federal contract employees earned less than the poverty level for a family of four, as opposed to 8 percent of traditional federal workers. Many low-wage jobs in the private sector (notably, the health care industry) are financed by taxpayers. The government can set an example by setting and enforcing wage standards for contractors.
When states and localities use their zoning powers to approve commercial projects, or offer tax incentives to attract new employers, they can require that workers be paid living wages; research shows this will not hurt job growth.
Labor standards have to be upgraded and enforced, particularly for those employers, typically in low-wage industries, who engage in ''wage theft,'' by failing to pay required overtime wages or misclassifying workers as independent contractors so that they do not receive the benefits to which they are entitled.
Americans have long believed that there should be a floor below which job quality does not fall. Today, polls show widespread support for upgrading employment standards, including raising the minimum wage -- which is lower, in inflation-adjusted terms, than it was in 1968. It's time for the federal government to take the lead in creating not just more jobs, but more good jobs. The job-growth mirage of the Rio Grande Valley cannot be our model.
