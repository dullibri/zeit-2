American Express's Net Jumps 72.2%

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Coming off a year of financial turmoil in its main lines of business, the American Express Company said yesterday that its earnings rose 72.2 percent last quarter, bolstered by record results in its consumer financial and information services business. But analysts viewed the overall results as poor.
The financial services company said its quarterly profits rose to $237.4 million, or 47 cents a share, compared with $137.9 million, or 28 cents a share, in the comparable period of 1990. 
 For all of 1991, earnings more than quadrupled, to $788.7 million, or $1.59 a share, from $181.5 million, or 34 cents a share, the year before.
 
 
Effect of Shearson Revamping
 But the apparent turnaround in the yearly results is not as strong as it appears. The 1990 results were weighed down by a charge of $837 million to pay for a reorganization of Shearson Lehman Brothers, the brokerage subsidiary of American Express. In 1989, without such large special charges, the company earned $1.16 billion.
Indeed, analysts said that despite the increase in earnings over the last year, the company's results were poor over all. "This is a lousy end to a lousy year," said John Keefe, an analyst with Lipper Analytical Services. "Many of its businesses were really weak."
American Express also bolstered its earnings last year by booking about $200 million worth of tax benefits earned in previous years. Many of those tax benefits stemmed from losses at Shearson.
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of American Express closed yesterday at $22.50, down 12.5 cents each.
 
 
Decline in Travel Division
 In a breakdown of the company's yearly earnings, American Express's largest business, the Travel Related Services division, which oversees the green, gold and platinum American Express charge cards, provided the biggest contribution for 1991, but was far from the money machine it has been in recent years. Earnings for the year in the division totaled $396 million, a 59 percent decline from the $956 million earned in 1990.
The division, the financial heart of American Express, had its first loss in decades in the third quarter of 1991 as defaults jumped among holders of its Optima credit card. For the year, the travel division increased provisions for credit losses to $697 million before taxes, with $123 million taken in the fourth quarter.
Operating expenses climbed by $323 million before taxes. The company also had a one-time charge in the year of $110 million to pay for a reorganization of the division.
Despite the recession, the travel division reported higher revenue for the year, at $9.9 billion, up from $9.7 billion in 1990.
 
 
Less Growth in Cards
 The division also reported some results that could present trouble in the future, analysts said. After years of explosive growth, the number of charge cards in force remained relatively flat. American Express reported 36.6 million active cards, with no domestic growth and slim overseas growth of 1.2 percent. The smaller IDS Financial Services division, the company's consumer finance unit, turned in the best performance in its history. The division's earnings reached $248 million for the year, a 20 percent increase from the $207 million reported in 1990.
Shearson reported net income of $207 million in 1991, compared with a loss of $966 million in the previous year. Analysts were surprised by the relatively poor performance, coming off of revenues of $11.2 billion, compared with $10.2 billion in 1990.
The Shearson results were driven down by several charges totaling $171 million to account for losses.

HEADLINE: Florio Says He May Back Sales-Tax Cut

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Having angered Republicans on Monday by announcing details of a budget that seemed to ignore their plan to cut the sales tax, Gov. Jim Florio went before the Legislature today to say that he would be happy to sign a tax-cut bill if his budget goals could be met.
"I know that many of you would like to reduce our sales-tax revenues," he said during his annual budget speech to the Republican-controlled Legislature. "I've never been fond of the sales tax, and I'm not here to mount a defense of it. 
 "But also understand that budgets are not made without a spirit of compromise. I would be very happy to achieve our goals and still reduce the sales tax by a penny. I'm willing and anxious to listen to any plan that will meet our state's priorities."
Taking the same conciliatory tack a few hours earlier, state education officials released revised school-aid figures that provide $341 million in additional money mostly for middle-income school districts. The new aid was generated through a proposal that would cut the government's contribution to state employee pension funds.
 
School Aid a Volatile Issue
 Middle-income taxpayers have severely criticized the Florio administration, and the allocation of school aid has become one of New Jersey's most volatile political issues recently.
Together with his conciliatory State of the State message on Jan. 14, Mr. Florio's measured comments for Republican tax foes today and his Education Department's allocation of more aid for middle-income districts suggested that the traditionally combative Governor hoped to deny the Republican opposition a clear target.
He also seemed to be reaching out to the middle class, which turned against the Democrats in November, helping elect Republican majorities in both houses of the Legislature for the first time in 20 years.
Mr. Florio said his major goals were to cut the size and cost of state government and to funnel more money back to taxpayers. And he vowed that New Jersey would "take care of our own" during the current recession by creating thousands of new jobs.
He repeatedly told New Jerseyans that they are better off than their neighbors in New York and most of the rest of the country. "While other states are cutting back and hurting people, we're giving back and helping people," he said.
His budget called for no new taxes for the second year in a row and no new raises for the state's nearly 66,000 employees. It would increase aid to secondary schools, thereby holding down local property tax increases, and expand college tuition-assistance programs.
Mr. Florio relied on a turnaround in the economy, a drastic reduction in state payments for pensions and an anticipated Federal Medicaid payment to balance the budget. He also relied on revenues from a 7 percent sales tax, though the Republicans have vowed to cut it to 6 percent.
"The Governor's failure to propose a tax-cut budget means that the Republican Legislature will have to develop a state spending plan which cuts taxes," said Donald T. DiFrancesco, the new Senate President.
He conceded that the change in the pension system, which is based on a revaluation of the funds' assets, and the anticipated revenue from Medicaid payments might produce a "windfall," which Mr. Florio's administration has projected at $1.1 billion.
 
G.O.P. Vows Tax Cut
 "But if that does happen," he said, "perhaps we should look for ways to return this money to the people. We shouldn't be looking for ways to spend it.
"If the Governor won't cut taxes," Mr. DiFrancesco added, "we will."
An increase in the sales tax to 7 percent from 6 percent was part of the record $2.8 billion tax increase the Legislature, then under Democratic control, passed in 1990.
"The extra penny was needed to balance the budget in 1990," Mr. Florio said today. "We had to pay our bills. But all of us know that making a budget is about making choices and setting priorities."
Mr. Florio used his budget speech today to briefly raise the issue of abortion rights and to obliquely criticize the Federal Government's decision to withhold money to abortion clinics and counseling services.
 
'We Do Not Gag Women'
 "I have included funding in this budget to give women in New Jersey the information they need to make their own reproductive choices," he said. "In New Jersey, we do not gag women or their doctors."
The Governor attributed many of the state's economic troubles to the national recession. But he said New Jersey was better off than any of its neighbors and most of the country.
"In New Jersey today, we don't have to make the education cuts we're seeing in other states in the Northeast and across the nation," he said. "We're not faced with insurmountable deficits. We will finish the current year with a balanced budget."
Mr. Florio also said his budget would hold down college tuition. "Across the Hudson in New York," he added, "tuition increases at the state university system are planned to double."

HEADLINE: McDonnell Posts Profit

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
A year after a financial crisis that left its viability in doubt, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation posted strong fourth-quarter earnings yesterday, continuing a steady comeback despite cuts in the Pentagon budget and a weak market for commercial jetliners.
The nation's largest military contractor and second-largest builder of commercial aircraft said it earned $211 million, or $5.50 a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $1 million in the corresponding period a year earlier. Revenues for the period were $4.8 billion, an increase of 18 percent. 
 For the full year, the company earned $423 million, or $11.03 a share, an increase of 38.2 percent over 1990. Revenues increased 15.7 percent, to $18.4 billion.
McDonnell Douglas was so pressed for cash early last year that it sought financial help from the Pentagon. The request was later withdrawn, but the company was plagued by rumors last winter that it might even need to file for bankruptcy.
Although McDonnell Douglas still faces further Pentagon spending cuts and weakness among its airline customers, analysts said the St. Louis-based company had come a long way. They point out that McDonnell Douglas's debt was cut to $2.39 billion at the end of the fourth quarter from a peak of $3.3 billion in March.

HEADLINE: Bank Yields Drop Slightly

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit dropped slightly for the week ended yesterday, according to figures released by The Bank Rate Monitor, which watches bank rates.
Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor, said interest rates over the next couple of weeks will be influenced by the reaction to President Bush's State of the Union address and the possibility that the Federal Reserve will again reduce its key rates." 
 In the New York area, the average money market account yields at commercial banks was 3.69 percent, down a basis point, or one-hundredth of 1 percent. The average yield on money market accounts at savings banks was 4.23 percent, off 6 points.
For money market accounts, the steepest cut among area banks was made by Hudson City Savings Bank, Paramus, N.J., which lowered its rate by 40 basis points. Anchor Savings led the way with a drop of 20 basis points for its three-month certficate of deposit, and Crossland Federal Savings Bank made the largest cut in six-month certificates of deposit, dropping them 20 basis points.
The Bank Rate Monitor said the average yields at 20 large banks outside the New York area fell slightly, with the average yield on money market accounts down a point, to 3.70 percent, and on six-month certificates down 2 basis points, to 3.86 percent.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday,January 29,1992. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

Stock Prices As Measured By Inflation

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
JUST how high are stock prices? By one measure, they are nearing, but have not yet reached, the level set more than 23 years ago, back when Richard M. Nixon was winning the Presidency and a subway token was 20 cents.
That measure of stock prices is adjusted for inflation, comparing the prices of stocks with the Consumer Price Index. Rather than measure stock prices in dollars, as normal indexes do, that calculation measures them in the context of what other things cost. The Consumer Price Index reflects the cost of a basket of items purchased by consumers; this measurement effectively shows how many such baskets an investor would need to give up to buy a representative sample of American stocks. 
 Some bulls may take comfort from the fact that stock prices by that measure are no higher than they were in 1968, despite substantial economic growth. Over that period, it should be noted, stocks have outperformed inflation after dividends are included.
But there is also a bearish way to look at the figures. Prices now are at levels that three times in the past have proved to be market tops. By contrast, when the ratio was low, stocks have often been an excellent investment.
In the summer of 1982, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock average was barely higher than the Consumer Price Index. The ratio was just 1.1 to 1. One way to look at that is that to buy a certain amount of stocks one had to give up just more than one basket of consumer products.
That came at the time that most Americans believed that inflation was all but certain to continue, and that stocks were unlikely to be good values. In fact, inflation was dying and the stock market was about to begin a decade of explosive growth.
At the end of 1991, the ratio was 3.03 to 1. That means that to buy the same group of stocks, one would have to forgo more than three baskets of consumer goods. In January, the S.& P. 500 is about unchanged, having retreated from rises early in the month. So the ratio for this month seems likely to be about the same.
The first time the ratio got so high was in November 1968, when it peaked at 3.06. By the summer of 1970, the S.& P. 500 had fallen 33 percent.
There are other comparisons between 1992 and the late 1960's. Estimates of stock holdings by individuals, as a percentage of total investments by those individuals, indicate that they have risen to the highest levels since they began declining in the early 1970's. That rush to stocks, which has taken the form of both direct holdings and purchases of stock mutual funds, has followed the sharp decline of interest rates, which made many investors more willing to take risks in hopes of gaining higher rewards.
The second time that the ratio of stock prices to consumer prices reached a high level was in late 1972. The ratio, using month-end figures, peaked at the end of December of that year, at 2.78. That was just before the brutal 1973-74 bear market began. Two years later, the S.& P. 500 had dropped 42 percent.
In the summer of 1987, the ratio climbed back to 2.88 by the end of August. Three months later, after the October crash, the S.& P. 500 was down 30 percent.
It may be interesting to note that the economy was not in a recession during the three previous times that the ratio reached current levels. In that sense, the current run-up is unprecedented. The fact that prices have risen so far during the recession -- the ratio was at 2.28 at the end of October 1990, the recent low for stock prices -- is another indicator of the extent to which the stock market seems to have discounted a substantial economic recovery.
Such calculations do not prove that stock prices are about to collapse. But they do provide another reminder that whatever else the market is it is not very cheap by historical standards. Low inflation is beloved by the bulls, in part because it makes lower interest rates possible. But it also makes it harder for companies to raise prices, and thereby to push up profits. And current share prices may be assuming a sharp rise in corporate profits within a year or two.

HEADLINE: Weather Looking Good for Round-the-World Balloon Flight

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
As helium gas screamed from a tank truck into a huge plastic gas bag yesterday, final preparations began for the launching of Earthwinds, a balloon whose three-member crew hopes to be the first to circumnavigate the world in a single balloon flight.
Larry Newman of Scottsdale, Ariz., captain of the Earthwinds, said there was a good chance that weather conditions in Akron, Ohio, would permit the launching of the balloon this weekend to begin its voyage of some 22,000 miles at an altitude of about 35,000 feet. 
 Although manned balloons have crossed both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, none has successfully circled the earth, the last great goal of record-seeking aeronauts. Mr. Newman was a crew member of both the trans-Atlantic balloon flight in 1978 and the trans-Pacific flight in 1981.
With Mr. Newman on the Earthwinds flight will be Maj. Gen. Vladimir Dzhanibekov, chief of astronaut training in the Russian air force, and Don Moses, an American builder and expert mechanic. Besides the three men, the balloon, which is higher than the Statue of Liberty, will carry scientific experiments built in the former Soviet Union and by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
 
Two Balloons in One
 Earthwinds is radically different in design from any previous long-duration balloon. Shaped like an hourglass, it is actually two balloons -- an upper lifting balloon containing some 1.1 million cubic feet of helium, and an "anchor" balloon suspended beneath the crew capsule and containing compressed air.
Ordinary gas balloons carry ballast in the form of sand or water, and when a balloonist exhausts his supply of ballast, the balloon is forced to land. But Earthwinds makes its own ballast and will be able to stay aloft for more than a month.
The duration of conventional gas balloon flights is limited by the warming and cooling effects of daytime and nighttime flight. During the day, balloon gas warms, expands and provides so much lift that the balloon ascends to such heights that it must release some of its helium to prevent the gas from ripping open the balloon. But at night, the cooled helium contracts, and its reduced lift causes the balloon to descend too far, forcing the pilot to drop ballast. This cycle can continue for only a few days before ballast is exhausted and the balloon is forced to land.
But on Earthwinds, nearly one ton of extra air can be pumped from the atmosphere into the anchor balloon, thereby making the balloon system heavier and preventing it from rising during the warmth of the day.
In the cool of the night, compressed air can be released from the anchor balloon -- the equivalent of dropping sand ballast -- to prevent the balloon from descending. This unique system for replenishing ballast, its designers say, is expected to give the balloon a duration of at least 40 days, more than double the time expected to complete the round-the-world flight.
The pressurized crew capsule with its myriad of flight instruments, controls, compressor engines, generator, survival clothing, food and other equipment was moved last week from its stand in the Loral Defense Systems Air Dock to a flat-bed trailer from which it will be launched. The anchor balloon, resembling a 100-foot-diameter golf ball, was inflated and pressurized two weeks ago. Yesterday, the big plywood crate containing the folded plastic lift balloon was towed to the inflation site 100 yards from the hangar, and technicians began filling the balloon with helium from two tank trucks.
During the early stage of inflation, the height of the balloon is expected to greatly exceed the 200-foot height of the roof of the hangar, so inflation is being conducted outdoors. With a full load of helium, the balloon was expected to become round and low enough to squeeze back into the immense hangar for final rigging. In the last stage of preparations the lift balloon will be attached to the capsule and the anchor balloon, and this entire "flight train" will be moved to the nearby launching site.
 
A 'Different' Experience
 General Dzhanibekov said he gave the flight only a 50 percent chance of success but added that its potential scientific and technical rewards would make the risk worthwhile. "Also, the experience is different," he said. As a Soviet astronaut he made five space flights. In one he commanded the rescue operation that saved the Salyut 7 spacecraft.
"This flight will leave us broke and badly in debt," Mr. Newman said, "but it's something I've always dreamed of." Mr. Newman said much of the credit for the flight belonged to his partner, John Wilcox, who not only arranged for Soviet participation but obtained seed money for the venture from ESPN, the cable-television sports channel.
Besides ESPN and Mr. Newman himself, major sponsors include the Hilton Hotels Corporation, Virgin Atlantic Airways and the Canon Corporation.
Meteorologists say the balloon will probably travel northeast along the coast of the United States and cross Europe in the vicinity of Scandinavia. Beyond Europe, it may swing south over the Persian Gulf and then head northward over Russia and Siberia. Survival equipment aboard the balloon will include parachutes, flotation suits, Arctic clothing and a rifle.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Aides Fear Cuts In Construction Spending

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins's latest proposals for cutting New York City's capital budget for construction took his own city agency heads by surprise when City Hall announced them on Monday, and yesterday many commissioners were still scrambling to figure out what the cuts would mean.
The cuts in capital spending are part of the Mayor's plan for closing at least $8 billion in gaps between projected city revenues and spending over the next four years, and were decided by senior city officials over the weekend, after they reached the limits of their willingess to cut other spending for city services. 
 Some other city officials and outside fiscal monitors expressed concern that the cutbacks in spending for construction risked damaging the city's aging infrastructure even further, while construction groups worried that they would hurt the economy. But the administration said that most of the cuts would not begin taking effect for 18 months, and that they had made special efforts to leave untouched vital areas like bridge reconstruction.
Struggling to fill a $1.8 billion gap in the $29 billion budget for the fiscal year that starts on July 1, Mr. Dinkins is to present his overall plan tomorrow. It calls for trimming thousands of jobs from the city work force, raising $115 million through new taxes on gasoline, automobiles and the income of commuters the first year, and freezing property-tax rates for four years.
 
Holding Payroll Costs Steady
 Officials said Mr. Dinkins would also propose, as he did last November, to grant no wage increases to municipal workers over the next two years, except in exchange for money-saving improvements in productivity, and to resort to layoffs only as a last resort, opting to shrink the work force by 20,000 jobs over the four years through attrition.
But Mr. Dinkins, who will have to run for re-election in large measure on the budget he is now proposing, has resisted deeper service cuts in other areas. Last night, in an apparent effort to demonstrate the Mayor's sensitivity, his office released a list of cuts he had refused to consider even as contingencies. Those included closing drop-in centers for the homeless, eliminating infant mortality programs, closing half the city's beaches and pools and eliminating all-night Staten Island Ferry service.
The $3.7 billion in proposed cuts would trim the capital budget to $8.5 billion over four years, about half what it was two years ago. But the effects are not yet clear. Officials at the School Construction Authority, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the cuts would "massacre" the five-year building plan, delaying the construction of a dozen new schools and the rehabilitation of scores of others, but the Parks Department said most of its cuts appeared scheduled to take effect several years from now. The Transportation Department would cut road reconstruction, but not resurfacing.
The capital budget is always the part of the city's spending plans most subject to change, because it stretches over such a long time, and even some projects included in it are never built.
But one agency head, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, "If you take it out of there, it's out of there."
The capital budget is financed by the sale of long-term bonds, whose interest and principal must be repaid from operating revenues each year, and such payments have come to be one of the fastest-growing parts of the budget, projected to take one dollar of every five in tax revenues by 1996. Bond-rating agencies and fiscal monitors had strongly pressured the city to cut this expense, and the cuts would save $250 million a year in debt service by 1996.
But some questioned the wisdom of trimming a program that the city had painfully rebuilt after the fiscal crisis of the mid-70's, and that it has already trimmed by $2.9 billion in the last year.
"As in the 1970's, again there is the threat of further deterioration of the city's capital assets at a great cost to the future health of the local economy," State Comptroller Edward V. Regan said.

HEADLINE: Dow Corning's Failure In Public Opinion Test

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Regardless of whether Dow Corning Inc. ever convinces regulators that its silicone-gel breast implants are safe, the company seems likely to be branded as one of several that have bungled their handling of an accident or product defect, according to public relations and crisis management experts.
Dow Corning's handling of the growing controversy that led to the Food and Drug Administration on Jan. 6 to call for a moratorium on breast implants is increasingly being compared to the Exxon Corporation's response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the Johns Manville Corporation's treatment of its asbestos woes, and A. H. Robins's debacle with its Dalkon Shield birth control device. Critics say that Dow Corning's mistakes include a lack of public action by Lawrence A. Reed, the company's chief executive; too little sympathy and support for women who say they were harmed, and the failure to get the worst news out quickly. 
 "It's a textbook case of crisis mismanagement," said Gerald C. Meyers, a consultant on such matters who is based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. "It looks like the lawyers are in charge, trying to limit their liability. But the damage is much worse to the corporation if they lose in the court of public opinion than if they lose in the court of law."
Dow Corning officials decline to speak about their crisis strategy. "We are busy trying to move this on a positive and constructive course," said Robert Grupp, a spokesman for the company, which is a joint venture of the Dow Chemical Company and Corning Inc. and is based in Midland, Mich.
 
A Question of Compassion
 Crisis management experts say that Dow Corning has courted trouble by being far too slow and low key in expressing compassion for women who say that they have suffered a variety of ailments from the implants, including immune-system diseases and painful hardening of the breasts. Critics also say that the implants obscure mammograms used to detect breast cancer. By the company's reckoning, women with ailments make up only a small percentage of the one million to two million who have had breast implants from Dow Corning and a handful of smaller competitors.
Consultants concede that because Dow Corning argues that there is little or no scientific evidence supporting many of the injury claims, it is difficult for the company to act sympathetically without appearing to undermine its legal strategy. And the entire implant industry's position has been, in essence, that the greatest social imperative is to avoid needlessly alarming the majority who are not having problems and other women who want implants.
But such a position, consultants say, ignores several lessons about how consumers respond to health threats. First, even a small number of people who feel misled or severely injured can rally enough relatives, friends and allies to give their claims great impact. Companies are expected to try to soothe anyone who feels victimized.
"It just a standard tenet of crisis situations involving health or safety that you have to strongly demonstrate concern, regardless of the numbers," said James E. Arnold, a Manhattan-based consultant who frequently deals in crisis management.
Second, the numbers involved in defective or dangerous product cases frequently turn out to be larger than the projections by the company involved. In some cases, like the cranberry cancer scare of 1959 and fears in the late 80's about the use of Alar on apples, the public needlessly panicked about health threats. But in Dow Corning's case, the company may have deceived itself by relying too heavily on the rosy assessments of plastic surgeons, who have a far bigger economic stake in implants than the company does. As with the Dalkon shield and asbestos, the publicity may now bring forth many more complaints, both valid and invalid.
The third lesson is that consumers become especially upset when they feel deceived. Information that has dribbled out over several years of litigation and regulatory hearings now suggests that Dow Corning misled regulators, physicians and consumers about the extent of uncertainty within the company itself about the safety of the implants.
"Most people didn't walk into this feeling they were meaningfully at risk," said Stephen A. Greyser, a public relations expert at the Harvard Business School, referring to those who received implants. "Most will now say that if they knew then what they know now, they wouldn't have done it." The result, consultants say, is that a public accustomed to being cynical about business ethics is now distrustful of Dow Corning, and that even people who would otherwise give the company the benefit of the doubt are now uncertain.
Even if a company is completely in the right, Mr. Meyers said, failure to voluntarily and dramatically accept losses and potential liability in favor of reassuring consumers is a mistake.
He cited the huge loss of market share that Gerber suffered for several years in the baby food business when it refused to remove any products from the market in 1986 after reports that glass shards were appearing in jars of baby food. It turned out, as Gerber insisted, that there were only isolated cases behind the reports and that the likely cause was mishandling by retailers or consumers.
Regardless of Dow Corning's position, most consultants say, the company's top managers are making a mistake by not taking a more public role. Mr. Reed has delegated basic responsibility for managing the controversy to J. Kermit Campbell, a former public relations executive who is group vice president in charge of the company's United States operations. Mr. Campbell, in turn, has transferred the task of speaking for the company to Robert T. Rylee, vice president in charge of health care; Dan M. Hayes, chief executive of Dow Corning Wright, the subsidiary that makes the breast implants, and the corporate public relations staff.
That division of labor reflects the minor role of medical products within the Dow Corning's overall business and the company's negligible profits from breast implants. Dow Corning produces nearly 5,000 products based on silicone, which is used in applications as diverse as caulking for construction, adhesives for labels, suds control in brewing, and Silly Putty in toys.
Mr. Reed's actions in particular call to mind the aloofness of Exxon's chief executive, Lawrence Rawl, during the early stages of the Valdez spill -- a marked contrast to the public leadership demonstrated by Johnson & Johnson's chairman, James Burke, following the discovery of poison-laced Tylenol capsules in 1983. Public relations executives say there is no doubt that Mr. Burke's approach did more for his company's reputation among customers and the larger public.
The breast-implant controversy is sending shock waves through Dow Corning, according to Barbara Carmichael, a senior public relations executive with the company. "This is a company that has never been particularly visible, much less questioned about its ethics," she said.
 
An Ethical Reputation
 Indeed, the picture painted by attorneys for women unhappy with their implants of a careless if not heartless company is not an image that squares with Dow Corning's reputation among corporate ethics consultants, nor does it reflect past actions that received little attention. In 1985, for example, Dow Corning reversed a decision to stop making silicone contact lens after learning that they were used to treat infant blindness.
"They were losing money hand over fist but they didn't realize they were the only ones making a lens that these babies could tolerate," said Dr. John Simon, a pediatric ophthamologist in Albany
Dr. Simon had scarcely begun a local publicity campaign to put pressure on the company when it agreed to continue making the product until it sold the business. "They were amazingly ethical once they understood," Dr. Simon said.
But Barbara Ley Toffler, an ethics expert at Resources for Responsible Management, a Boston consulting firm, said last week that Dow Corning's current plight underscored the way many ethics programs had become rote exercises that were naive about the true pressures in corporate life. The codes are often too vague to provide an easy road map through situations as complicated as the breast-implant controversy, she said.
Many of the most damaging ethical lapses occur when well-intentioned employees do something wrong that they believe is for the good of the company or most of its customers. That dynamic may still be unfolding at Dow Corning.
Last summer, the company set up a hot line for women with questions about implants. Early this month, the hot line was temporarily shut down after the F.D.A. complained that at least some of the 40 women answering the lines were misleadingly saying that the agency had determined that the products were safe. The operators were also playing down the potential hazards.
"I am willing to bet that part of what they were told to do by their trainers was to sound reassuring," said Ms. Toffler, the ethics expert. "In these kinds of situations, everyone goes into a panic mode that makes it harder to think clearly."

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Fell in January

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Americans became more pessimistic about their financial and job security this month despite lower interest rates aimed at helping the weak economy, a widely followed survey on consumer confidence said yesterday
The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index, which had leveled off in December after sharp declines the previous two months, fell again in January, largely on anxiety over future employment and business conditions. The index is at its lowest level since the 1981-82 recession. 
 The report from the business research group was considered especially significant by economists because it showed Americans were not responding to some of the most affordable borrowing costs in nearly two decades.
 
Focusing on 'Deterioration'
 "I think individuals are focusing more on the further deterioration of the job market and their own families' financial situation," said Gary Ciminero, chief economist at the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group in Providence, R.I.
 "Job prospects, job concerns, continue to mount. That's what's driving things," he said. "It should be patently obvious that interest rate cuts haven't worked."
The Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, who orchestrated significant interest rate reductions last year to encourage more borrowing, has said these moves should be sufficient to get the economy growing again.
The Conference Board index is based on responses to questions sent to 5,000 households nationwide, on subjects ranging from home-buying plans to job availability. It is considered by many economists to be a useful barometer of the American consumer mood. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of all economic activity.
The Conference Board said the January Consumer Confidence Index showed a reading of 50.4, a loss of 2.1 points from December. The index is calculated on a 1985 base of 100.
It has slid significantly from its 81.1 level last March, when consumer confidence reflected a euphoric mood after the gulf war.
In October, the index took an especially sharp dive, falling to 60.1 from 72.9 the month before. It slid to 52.7 in November before stabilizing somewhat in December.
Only 6.4 percent of all respondents in January considered business conditions good, while 51 percent said they were bad, the survey showed. Those figures were weaker than the preceding month.
Moreover, the survey showed an increasingly large number of households are experiencing hardship. Close to one in four reported that someone in their household was unemployed over the past 12 months. Of those who are back on the job, nearly half are making less money.
In expectations for the future, the survey said less than 19 percent believe conditions would be better in the next six months, while 20 percent feared they would worsen. Those figures are worse than a month earlier.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Campbell Shapes Up All Around

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
THE Campbell Soup Company is ambitiously expanding its lines of pantry- and freezer-food products through one of the most comprehensive advertising programs being undertaken by a large American grocery marketer. The company, which spends more than $250 million annually on marketing, is lifting the budget by 8 percent, up from a 5 percent increase announced last year.
The expansion involves everything from Campbell's traditional red-and-white cans of condensed soup, which are being dressed up in new labels featuring photographs of the ingredients inside, to new lines of lower-fat, lower-calorie foods under brand names like Mrs. Paul's Healthy Treasures and Healthy Request. 
 All that product news is being conveyed to consumers in a barrage of television commercials, print advertisements and even miniature billboards attached to supermarket shopping carts.
"We have made a conscious decision to spend more," Herbert M. Baum, the new president of the Campbell North and South America division, said in a recent telephone interview, to prevent "our brand franchises from starting to slip away from us."
He added: "We know we're good at, and can make lots of money at, dry groceries and frozen foods. Where we think we're getting results, we'll get much more aggressive. If we don't think we're getting all out of our advertising that we should be, we'll put the money somewhere else."
His remarks alluded to previous expansion efforts, like the failed Fresh Chef line of refrigerated salads, that took Campbell far afield of its core businesses and were discontinued.
Campbell's decision to bolster marketing spending is significant beyond the fate of the company's new condensed broccoli cheese soup. Along with stepped-up spending by other packaged-goods giants, like the Procter & Gamble Company and Unilever P.L.C. of Britain, it could mean a rebirth for brand-name products, which have been hard-hit during the recession as consumers cut back or switch to store brands.
For marketers like those, "there is a need for growth," said Edward F. Ogiba, the president of Group EFO Ltd., a marketing consulting company in Weston, Conn.
In a survey conducted last year by Group EFO, he added, 61 percent of the companies responding said 30 percent or more of their sales over the next five years must come from new products, compared with 48 percent in 1990.
"Products like our condensed soups would do very well in an economy like this," Mr. Baum said.
As a result, ad dollars are being spent for the first time in many years on an underpromoted line of condensed soups in family-sized 26-ounce cans.
"When you reconstitute two of those, they will fill your bathtub," Mr. Baum said. Since August, sales of those larger cans are 64 percent higher than a year ago, he added.
Part of Campbell's increased spending is being financed by money that had been spent on promotions aimed at consumers, like cents-off coupons, and at grocery retailers, like bonuses to entice them to stock Campbell products.
Another aspect of Campbell's activities is changes in the company's roster of advertising agencies. Earlier this month, an estimated $25 million in frozen-food brands were moved to BBDO Worldwide from Ogilvy & Mather, which retains only Campbell's Pepperidge Farm line of baked goods. BBDO added brands like LeMenu frozen foods to a list that included products like Campbell's Chunky Soup and Mrs. Paul's frozen fish line.
Campbell, based in Camden, N.J., employs six other agencies, including Backer Spielvogel Bates, W. B. Doner & Company, FCB/Leber Katz Partners and Margeotes Fertitta & Weiss.
Campbell's panoply of marketing moves reflects the involvement of David W. Johnson, who became president and chief executive in 1990, determined to rejuvenate a marketer perceived to have fallen behind its grocery rivals.
"This is a company that has gone through a major cleaning-up and restructuring," said Nomi Ghez, a food-industry analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York, referring to steps Mr. Johnson took in the last two years. "Now is the time to focus on rebuilding its core businesses.
"That is especially true for a company that has such strong brands as Campbell," she added. "You have to make sure they grow and expand."

USX Reports a Loss in Both Steel and Oil

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Jan. 28

 BODY:
The USX Corporation today reported a $394 million fourth-quarter loss, partly because of the falling price of oil and restructuring costs in its steel division. And the Allegheny Ludlum Corporation, a specialty steelmaker, said its fourth-quarter earnings increased 53 percent because of less costly raw materials, cost controls and increased efficiency.
Following are the details of the companies' results:
 
USX
In contrast to the fourth-quarter loss, USX earned $267 million in the last three months of 1990. Sales fell 22 percent, to $4.87 billion in the latest fourth quarter, from $6.22 billion. 
 For all of 1991, the nation's largest steelmaker lost $578 million, compared with income of $818 million in 1990. Sales fell 9 percent, to $18.82 billion from $20.65 billion.
The company does not report earnings per share as a whole because its stock is split into separate classes for energy and steel.
The company's Marathon Oil group lost $229 million in the latest quarter, compared with earnings of $216 million, or 84 cents a share, in the period a year ago. Sales fell 22 percent, to $3.6 billion from $4.6 billion.
The fourth-quarter loss was caused largely by a $260 million accounting charge against income to lower the value of inventory in light of falling oil prices. In the period a year ago, the value of inventory was increased $140 million.
For all of 1991, Marathon lost $71 million on sales of $14 billion. Earnings for all of 1990 totaled $508 million, or $1.94 a share, on sales of $14.6 billion.
Marathon's 1991 results were affected by lower worldwide hydrocarbon prices and reduced refined product margins, USX's chairman, Charles A. Corry, said. Crude prices fell as concerns over Persian Gulf supplies abated.
The U.S. Steel Group, which also includes operations such as mining and real estate, lost $165 million in the fourth quarter, compared with earnings of $51 million, or 99 cents a share, in the period a year ago.
Sales fell 19 percent, to $1.3 billion from $1.6 billion.
"While some economists remain hopeful for 1992, the near-term outlook for the U.S. Steel Group is clouded by continuing weakness in the domestic economy and oversupply in world steel markets," Mr. Corry said.
On the New York Stock Exchange, USX-Steel Group shares slipped 25 cents, to $26.75, while USX-Marathon gained 12.5 cents, to $23.625.
 
Allegheny Ludlum
Allegheny Ludlum said earnings totaled $13 million, or 40 cents a share, in the three months ended Dec. 29, vs. earnings of $6 million, or 19 cents a share, in the period a year ago.
Sales fell 3 percent, to $231.86 million from $238.72 million.
The company said earnings fell 40 percent in 1991 because of the high cost of raw materials, depressed prices and increased Pennsylvania taxes.
The company earned $41.1 million, or $1.25 a share, in 1991, compared with $68.9 million, or $2.07 a share, in 1990. Sales fell 7 percent, to $1 billion, from $1.08 billion in 1990.
Allegheny Ludlum's shares added $1.375, to $32.125, in Big Board trading.

HEADLINE: Buyers of New Volkswagens Get Hedge Against Job Loss

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 28

 BODY:
To ease the worries of skittish consumers and woo them to its showrooms, Volkswagen of America said today that it would cover car insurance and loan payments for up to a year for new Volkswagen buyers who lose their jobs because of the soured economy.
Volkswagen's coverage is unusually generous, analysts said. "This program seems to be a bit more extensive" than what other auto makers have done in the past, said L. Raymond Windecker, who runs American Autodatum, an industry research firm in Livonia, Mich. 
 The program, known as Payment Protection Plus, pays up to $500 a month for car insurance and lease or loan payments. The coverage lasts up to 12 months, and consumers may use the insurance any time during the first three years of ownership. They are not required to reimburse Volkswagen.
 
March 31 Deadline
 It will be offered to consumers who buy or lease a new Volkswagen before March 31. Buyers of all new Volkswagens are automatically covered; no separate application or screening process is required, the company said. The protection is also available on loans and leases arranged through lending institutions other than VW Credit, Volkswagen's financing arm.
For their payments to be covered by the auto maker, Volkswagen owners must provide a letter from their employers attesting that economic conditions, not performance, resulted in the job loss.
Volkswagen is hoping the program will also help increase its flagging sales, which dropped by 29.1 percent in 1991. But Mr. Windecker, a former researcher and analyst for the Ford Motor Company, said its effect would be marginal. The program may draw people who are already shopping for a car, but is not likely to bring consumers off the fence, he said.
"Very, very few people that are worried about losing their jobs would even consider buying a car," Mr. Windecker said. "If current interest rates won't jump-start the situation, this won't either."
 
Small Risk Is Seen
 Volkswagen officials declined to predict how many buyers would need coverage, but Mr. Windecker said their ranks would be small. The program therefore represents a small risk for Volkswagen, he added.
Auto makers have offered similar coverage in the past, and many car dealers sell insurance to pay for car loans should job loss occur.
The Chrysler Corporation offered a similar program in the early 1980's, but only in the economically depressed Southwest and around the Rochester area. By contrast, Volkswagen's program will be offered by all the company's American dealers.
Such programs are not unique to the automobile industry. In New Jersey, several housing developers offer similar protection for buyers worried about making mortgage payments should they lose their jobs.

HEADLINE: Compaq Earnings Off 51%; Sun Microsystems Up 21%

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
The Compaq Computer Corporation said yesterday that its net income in the fourth quarter was about half what it was in the 1990 period. But sales and earnings rose modestly from depressed levels in the second and third quarters of 1991, exceeding Wall Street estimates.
Sun Microsystems Inc., the leading supplier of computer work stations, continued to grow through the recession, chalking up 21 percent gains in net income and revenues for its second fiscal quarter. 
 Analysts said Compaq had begun to repair damage inflicted last year by lower-priced rivals and the slumping market for personal computers. Still, the company's stock lost 7.3 percent of its value yesterday, reflecting investor worries about slow 1992 sales and rising costs when Compaq introduces several computers in coming months.
Compaq reported net income of $66.6 million, or 77 cents a share, down 51 percent from $134.8 million, or $1.50 a share, in the quarter last year. Most analysts had projected earnings between 45 cents and 60 cents a share for the recent quarter. Sales fell 13 percent, to $873.4 million from $1 billion.
Eckhard Pfeiffer, president and chief executive, said increases in industry unit sales both in the United States and abroad would be less than 10 percent this year, with prices continuing to decline.
"We are not seeing any significant market pickup via the economy or PC industry," he said in an interview from Compaq's Houston headquarters. "We are prepared for a year that is probably going to be difficult."
Compaq's share price fell $2.375, to $32.75, in trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
The company lost $70.3 million in the third quarter after taking a $135 million charge related to 1,400 layoffs and other cost-cutting steps.
For the year, Compaq recorded its first decline in sales and profits since the company shipped its first products in 1983.
Net income fell 71.2 percent, to $130.9 million, or $1.49 a share, from $454.9 million, or $5.14 a share. Sales declined 9.2 percent, to $3.27 billion from $3.6 billion.
 
Sun Microsystems
Sun Microsystems, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., reported net income for the quarter, which ended Dec. 27, of $47.4 million, or 47 cents a share, compared with $39.1 million, or 39 cents a share, for the corresponding period a year earlier. Revenues rose to $909.1 million, from $753.5 million a year earlier.
Sun said that it shipped a record 49,000 computers in the quarter and that it had seen good acceptance for its new family of servers, which are powerful computers that provide central data storage for a group of less powerful work stations.
Sun's stock, traded over the counter, closed at $33.875, up 37.5 cents. The earnings were announced after the close of trading. Robert G. Herwick, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco, said earnings were about in line with Wall Street expectations, but that revenues were a bit higher and profit margins a little lower than expected.

HEADLINE: Southeast Asia Nations Sign Free-Trade Accord

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations agreed today to take their first step toward creating a common market, a response to economic alliances being formed in Europe and North America.
Under the agreement, the six-nation association will attempt to integrate its economies, which are some of the fastest growing in the world, by reducing or eliminating tariffs on nonagricultural goods within 15 years. 
 Though it has been criticized for its drawn-out timetable and for loopholes that will permit each government to exempt hundreds of products from tariff cuts, the agreement was nevertheless hailed by leaders of the association's member nations -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
"It is a new chapter for Asean and a new era for Southeast Asia," Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun of Thailand said.
 
Loopholes Are Acknowledged
 Singapore's Trade Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, acknowledged loopholes in the free-trade agreement but said that the pact represented "a considerable change of mood" within the association, which in the past has moved slowly on proposals to expand regional economic cooperation.
"The sentiment now is, we would like to move faster," he said.
The creation of the so-called Asean Free Trade Area is the association's response to the integration of the economies of Western Europe and to the North American free-trade agreement covering the United States, Canada and Mexico.
At this week's meeting, leaders of some of the six nations suggested that Southeast Asia could be shut out of the largely self-sufficient mega-markets being created elsewhere. "Unless Asean can match the other regions in attractiveness both as a base for investments and as a market for their products, investments by multinational companies are likely to flow away from our part of the world," Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong of Singapore said.
But the free-trade agreement, he said, showed that the association was a "strong player in the new world order."
The agreement is not expected to have a significant effect on American exports, since many American-made products sold in the region, such as jetliners and electronics-manufacturing equipment, cannot be replaced by goods made here.
 
Scheduled for Cuts
 Under the accord, 15 large groups of products made in the region will immediately be selected for tariff cuts, including textiles, electronics, chemicals, plastics, pharmaceuticals, ceramics, wooden furniture and jewelry.
The association's six members pledged today to reduce tariffs on the goods covered by the agreement to no more than 20 percent within five years, and to no more than 5 percent by the year 2008. The accord takes effect on Jan. 1, 1993.
The goal of the agreement is to expand trade among the six, mostly booming nations, and to attract new foreign investment to the region by offering investors a single, simplified and increasingly affluent market of nearly 330 million people.
Joe Rogers, a former United Nations ambassador to the Asian Development Bank, said in a telephone interview from Washington that the free-trade accord could be an important enticement to foreign investors.
"It would open a region market," said Mr. Rogers, who is now a private consultant on Asian business. "For example, you'd be able to go and manufacture in Malaysia and still be able to ship your product to Thailand. That's a great benefit."
 
Plan Nearly Vetoed
 The free-trade area was originally proposed last year by Prime Minister Anand of Thailand, who suggested a 10-year timetable for tariff reductions in the region. Thailand has some of the highest tariff rates in Southeast Asia.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed in Wary Day; Gold Recovers in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mixed on world currency markets yesterday in seesaw trading ahead of President Bush's State of the Union Message.
Gold prices rose in domestic trading after posting losses in Europe. On the New York Commodity Exchange, bullion for current delivery settled at $355.80 a troy ounce, up $1 from Monday. The Republic National Bank said gold gained 85 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $355.65. 
 Analysts said currency trading was characterized by a wait-and-see attitude ahead of the President's address last night.
"The market is a little scared; there is some trepidation ahead of the speech," said Randolph Donney, research director at the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. "But there is no real strong trend."
 
Report Leads to Selloff
 A Conference Board report released early in the day showing that consumer confidence declined in January caused a dollar selloff. With the economy in recession, the Federal Reserve is more likely to cut interest rates to stimulate growth, a move that is bearish for the dollar because it reduces the yield on fixed-income investments.
The confidence report caused the dollar "to come off a bit," said John McCarthy, chief dealer at ABN-Amro Bank N.V., noting that traders "overshot it on the downside." The currency recovered from its lows but still closed off on the day.
The dollar, some analysts say, remains poised for further declines. "The market will perceive it as an opportunity to sell if what Bush says is less than spectacular," Mr. McCarthy said.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose eight-tenths of 1 yen, closing at 125.37 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at 125.65 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 125.70 yen, up from 125.23 yen on Monday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7950, from $1.7770 late Monday. In New York, it cost $1.7925, more than Monday's $1.7825.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.5994 German marks, down from 1.6105; 1.4225 Swiss francs, down from 1.4300; 5.4495 French francs, down from 5.4840; 1,201.50 Italian lire, down from 1,209.25, and 1.1745 Canadian dollars, up from 1,1733.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Breathable Air For Swap or Sale

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
HOW in the world is the city where nobody walks going to cut air pollutants by 85 percent? Not easily or cheaply: A ballpark estimate by the David Harrison and Albert Nichols of National Economic Research Associates in Cambridge puts the cost of meeting Federal standards at an astonishing $1,200 a year for every resident of the Los Angeles sprawl.
But many economists are convinced that the bill could be reduced sharply if the job of deciding who cuts emissions, and how, were left to markets rather than regulators. And they are on the verge of convincing the California's South Coast Air Quality Management District to give it a try. 
 Thanks to tough controls on cars and big industries, the air of Los Angeles is far cleaner than it was in the 1970's. But it is not nearly clean enough to meet Federal requirements. The region is now under orders to pare emissions by 5 percent annually until the air is pure enough to spare the lungs of the most sensitive residents.
James Lents, executive director of the South Coast District, has apparently never been gung-ho over market-based solutions to environmental problems. In 1988 he wrote to the Environmental Protection Agency that the "disadvantage of an emissions trading program far outweighs the possible advantages." A year later the district proposed to meet the clean-air requirement by turning the regulatory screws ever tighter, effectively barring the use of everything from backyard barbecues to aerosol deodorants.
But hard times have a way of changing minds. California business, laid low by recession, is now desperate for an alternative to regulation-as-usual. And local officials, fearing they will be crushed between legal mandates and economic realities, have every incentive to cooperate: "They're up the creek without a paddle," concludes Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.
Enter marketable pollution permits. A 1990 study by Mr. Harrison and Mr. Nichols for the California Council for Environmental and Economic Balance, an industry-labor group, estimated that smog-control costs could be cut by a quarter or more by creating a free market in pollution rights. The two economists envision a system much like the one soon to be used nationally to control acid emissions from power plants. The right to dump smog-producing gases would be auctioned off by government, or simply assigned to existing polluters by some historical basis. Thereafter, the permits, denominated in tons or pounds, would be cut back proportionately each year to hit increasingly ambitious antipollution targets.
Any polluter who could not meet the tightening limits, or anyone wanting to operate a new source of pollution would have to buy rights from another polluter. A computerized market, much like the over-the-counter market for stocks and bonds, might facilitate exchanges.
Fans of marketable permits think it beats conventional "command and control" regulation in a number of ways. It would give polluters flexibility to find least-cost controls: A dry cleaner, for example, whose own control costs might be $30,000 a ton, could buy pollution rights from a nearby bakery whose control costs are just $2,000 a ton. And it would also give polluters incentives to clean up even if they were already doing a good job on the antipollution front: Unused rights could always be sold for cash.
For maximum savings, experts say, it would make sense to encourage trading between any two consenting polluters -- say, oil refineries and truckers. To keep enforcement simple, however, South Coast regulators are likely to limit trades to stationary sources, while perhaps giving businesses limited permission to buy rights from mobile polluters, paying to junk older, dirtier cars.
Some form of emissions trading is almost certainly in the cards for Los Angeles in 1993. But supporters are not cheering yet: Victor Weisser, the president of the industry-labor group, worries the regulators will add "bells and whistles" that make trading too cumbersome to be practical for all but the largest transactions.
Jack Broadbent, an economist at the South Coast District, hastens to reassure business that the regulators "recognize their concerns." But he concedes that the staff is leaning toward a system in which trades will have to be pre-approved, rather than spot-checked after the fact. For example, emissions-control equipment would have to be inspected before credits were granted.
For Southern Californians, the stakes are clear. Without an affordable solution to the smog problem, the region's economy may never regain its competitive edge. But the rest of the country has a stake here, too: If this high-profile experiment fails to achieve major savings, it will be hard to convince other regulators to take a chance on market-based cleanup strategies.

The Death Lobby
How the West Armed Iraq
By Kenneth R. Timmerman
Illustrated. 443 pages. Houghton Mifflin. $21.95.
Among the growing number of books about the Persian Gulf war and its aftermath, "The Death Lobby," by Kenneth R. Timmerman, is the most shocking. It's about that familiar enemy of peace, the international arms merchant, a subject that has been around in fact, fiction and drama at least since World War I. This strongly documented book is essential reading for anyone interested in understanding how the most sophisticated shooting irons were sold to Iraq and what the shooting was all about. 
 Like the managed television pictures and military briefings, the first round of instant books on the gulf war emphasized the generalship and the high-tech blast of war but without much political or economic savvy. In light of subsequent information, some of these yellow-ribbon books already seem dated and naive. Their version of victory calls to mind Antony's words in "Julius Caesar," "Are all thy conquests, triumphs, spoils/ Shrunk to this little measure?"
Now a second round of gulf war books is coming out that is more critical of American intelligence, ground and air tactics, "friendly fire" casualties and the precise number of civilian casualties, including Kurdish deaths caused by Saddam Hussein's arms after Iraq was supposedly defeated. One reason for the harsher tone is that the Pentagon's censored battlefield information is slowly dribbling out. A third round of books is expected in a year or so, led by the memoirs of Gen. Norman H. Schwarzkopf. If the Allied commander tells all or nearly all -- especially about the decision to halt the war before conquering Baghdad and toppling the dictator -- it could be a worthwhile book. So could the forthcoming memoirs of Peter Arnett, CNN's daring wartime Baghdad correspondent.
For an understanding of the roots of the gulf war and the enemy's powerful arsenal, "The Death Lobby" is in a class by itself. Mr. Timmerman, a journalist who publishes Mednews, a newsletter about Middle East security and defense issues, is the author of several books, including "Fanning the Flames," about the Iran-Iraq war. He knows the territory.
The book's subtitle, "How the West Armed Iraq," sums up its theme. The Western Governments, including that of the United States, winked at the arms bazaar that directly fortified and indirectly encouraged Iraq's dictator to invade Kuwait and let slip the dogs of war.
It was surely not the author's intention, but by shifting much of the responsibility for the war to the West's arms merchants, Saddam Hussein is partly let off the hook for his military aggression. Still, there's enough blame to go around on all sides in "The Death Lobby."
In non-democratic countries, authors would be imprisoned for writing this bluntly, if what they wrote was printed at all:
"But the fight against Saddam Hussein had little to do with the liberation of Kuwait, no matter how much President Bush and his advisers tried to focus publicly on that goal. It wasn't about jobs, as Secretary of State James Baker once argued, or even about oil. Simply put, the United States went to war to smash the death machine that this country and its Western allies had helped Saddam assemble in the first place. The United States and its allies had no choice but to combat Saddam Hussein on the battlefield because of the greed of Western businesses, misguided analyses by the foreign policy Establishment, and the incompetence of regulatory officials."
Mr. Timmerman mocks the statement made by Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly to Congress, four months before the invasion of Kuwait, that Mr. Hussein was a "force for moderation." He writes that a more accurate statement could be found in the corporate balance sheets because they would show that Iraq was a great market for the most advanced weaponry produced by companies in France, Germany, Italy, Britain, Austria and the United States.
"Saddam Hussein was our creation, our monster. We built him up and then tried to take him down," Mr. Timmerman says. ". . . The arming of Iraq was a 15-year love affair. And it was a world-class enterprise."
Documentation for these devastating accusations can be found in a detailed appendix that lists arms sales to Iraq between 1970 and 1990. The author notes that this information was compiled from public sources and material from his own publication. The appendix includes the Soviet Union as one of the arms merchants, a fact that for the sake of accuracy should have been included in the book's subtitle.
Among the big-ticket military items listed by the author are billions for French Mirage fighter planes and artillery; missile systems from West Germany; communications and surveillance systems from Britain; howitzers and tanks from Austria; Scuds, tanks, artillery and missile systems from the Soviet Union; naval vessels from Italy; howitzers from South Africa; tanks from China; Scuds and missiles from Brazil; artillery from Egypt. Listings from the United States include Hughes and Bell helicopters.
Mr. Timmerman points out that other nonmilitary items -- some disguised as instruments for ordinary business purposes were sold to Iraq for Mr. Hussein's effort to achieve a nuclear capability. Western suppliers provided dual-use technology. For example, "Marubeni of Japan had supplied Saddam with hundreds of buried fuel storage tanks that escaped Allied bombardment," and a "Franco-Italian petrochemicals consortium had built an entire underground diesel fuel plant."
The author writes that a compilation of public sources shows that 445 companies cashed in on this macabre bonanza, one-third of them from Germany alone. Some of the facts in "The Death Lobby" have been brought out before Congressional committees attempting to control export licenses and have been reported in serious newspapers; the great value of the book is that all this information now appears in one place, with no punches pulled. Mr. Timmerman concludes: "Until concrete steps are taken to curb this type of trade, the 'new world order' President Bush is so keen on heralding will turn out to be more death as usual."

HEADLINE: GOLF;
For the Public, Pebble Beach May Become a Missing Links

BYLINE: By JAIME DIAZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PEBBLE BEACH, Calif., Jan. 29

 BODY:
To a golfer walking its cliffside fairways this week at the A.T.&T. Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, the famous course on Monterey Bay has never looked better. Indeed, for the United States Open in June, Pebble Beach is being meticulously restored to accent its rugged, linkscharacter.
But to financial analysts charting the bottom line, Pebble Beach has some serious problems. 
 Since being sold in 1990 -- along with sister courses Spyglass Hill, Spanish Bay and Old Del Monte -- to Minoru Isutani of Japan for an astounding price of $840 million, its owner has been scrambling to install a plan that will pay for the purchase.
As a result, the precise future of one of America's greatest courses is uncertain. Although United States Golf Association officials said this week that Pebble Beach's financial situation would have no bearing on it holding the Open, the larger question of who will be able to play the course in the future is very much in the air.
 
Nicklaus's Choice
 Simply, no one knows if Pebble Beach will ultimately remain -- as it has been since being opened in 1919 -- completely open to the public.
The very possibility that Pebble Beach, along with St. Andrews in Scotland the most renowned public course in the world, could become for all practical purposes inaccessible to the everyday golfer strikes an emotional chord in the national sporting psyche.
When Jack Nicklaus said, "If I had one last round to play, I'd choose to play it at Pebble Beach," he was speaking for countless golfers who would have gladly paid the $200 green fees to have the same choice.
The man who has attempted to change the public character of Pebble Beach is Isutani, a 51-year-old businessman whose holdings include Cosmo World, a computer software manufacturer, and Olympia Staff, a sporting goods company.
Isutani, who reportedly owns 12 golf courses outside of the United States, bought the 530-acre Pebble Beach property from Marvin Davis, who had purchased the resort for $12 million in 1977. In paying the highest price in history for a golf course, Isutani recently admitted he probably paid too much.
"I bought the property with 50 percent of my business mind and 50 percent of my golf mind because that was my dream," Isutani told The San Francisco Examiner in December in his only interview with an American publication. "My dream is knowing that everybody thinks that Pebble Beach is the best course in the world."
At the time of the purchase, a Pebble Beach spokesman said Isutani's representatives also discussed plans for building 1,000 condominium units and a fifth golf course on the property.
 
Membership Plan
 Isutani's plan was to repay the loans he needed to make the landmark purchase by selling private memberships. Six months after the sale, Japanese newspapers reported that Isutani had plans to place 760 private memberships on sale for the incredible amount of $740,000 each.
Although extremely expensive by American standards, the expectation was that Japanese businessmen, who buy and sell golf club memberships in the same way that commodities are sold on the stock market, would rush to join what Isutani proposed calling the Pebble Beach National Club.
But the effects of the recession in Japan knocked the bottom out of the golf membership market, and the estimated selling price for the memberships dropped all the way to $150,000 apiece. It meant that Isutani would have to sell many more memberships than he originally planned to repay his loans.
To accommodate the proposed membership structure, Isutani's representatives put forth a plan in which two hours of midmorning starting times at Pebble Beach each day would be reserved for members. Each day's last hour of starting times would be allocated to the public, with the remaining several hours of starting times for resort guests.
Even though non-resort guests at Pebble Beach currently have no guaranteed starting times on the course, opponents of Isutani's plan said it would have cut public, non-resort guest play from 27 percent to 7 percent of total play.
Once the plan was circulated in the press, it soon became clear that Isutani, besides overestimating what his new acquisition was worth, had also underestimated how strong public opposition would be.
Many opponents in the Monterey area feared that if Isutani had his way, the 17 Mile Drive would be eventually become a condominium-filled resort like others under Japanese ownership in Hawaii.
Although the plan was approved by Monterey County supervisors last July, it was rejected by the California Coastal Commission, which ruled that the proposed private memberships would limit public access and possibly set bad precedent for future land uses along the coast.
That decision left Isutani unable to repay his loans through revenues generated by the resort. With more than $400 million in loans due in September, Isutani received a one-year extension from Mitsubishi Trust & Banking, a Japanese bank.
With the heat reduced slightly, Isutani decided to withdraw his original proposal three weeks ago. His representatives said today that no decision has been made on whether there would be a new plan proposing private membership or when it might be submitted.
For the moment, it is anybody's guess what Isutani's next move will be. He may choose to pay his loans for Pebble Beach by selling off some of his other assets. Isutani said in his interview that he has no intention of selling the property.
"I bought the property not knowing how strongly the local community would object," he said in December. "We must leave significant access to the public. It is very important to keep in constant contact with the local community."

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION;
BUSH VOWS ECONOMIC RELIEF AND PROPOSES MODEST STEPS IN STATE OF THE UNION TALK

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Staking his political fortunes on advice that the economy will right itself by summer, President Bush delivered a State of the Union Message tonight that offered modest proposals to ease the immediate pain of middle-class taxpayers and erase any impression that he is insensitive to America's economic burdens.
Mr. Bush used his own powers to give some quick relief to taxpayers and inject about $20 billion into the economy in the next six months. He directed that tax-withholding rules be changed immediately, meaning that some money normally given back later in refunds will be left in paychecks so it can be spent quickly. The change is expected to inject some $2 billion a month into the economy when fully effective. Mr. Bush also ordered Federal spending on some programs accelerated.
 
Rewarding the Taxpayer
 
 Challenging Congress to act within eight weeks and promising a "battle" if it does not, Mr. Bush proposed short-term relief measures like an increase in tax exemptions for children, tax breaks for first-time home buyers and the housing industry and tax credits for the purchase of health insurance by those earning low wages. [A transcript of the President's address is on page A16.]
In a televised address that at nearly an hour was longer than most State of the Union messages, the President declared that it was time to reward the American taxpayer for decades of paying for cold war arms programs. He proposed $50 billion worth of Pentagon cuts over the next five years and outlined new arms-control measures, including a proposal that the United States and the republics of the former Soviet Union eliminate all multiple-warhead nuclear missiles based on land. Mr. Bush did not make clear whether the money saved from the Pentagon would be plowed into domestic programs.
 
Trying to Regain Stature
 But the bulk of Mr. Bush's third State of the Union Message was dedicated to stopping the President's slide in the public opinion polls and strengthening him for the re-election campaign. Mr. Bush's speech was immediately criticized by Democrats, some of whom said it was too little and too late.
Earlier today, to sidestep a bitter election-year issue, Mr. Bush and House leaders agreed to spend $2.7 billion on another 13 weeks of unemployment benefits for about two million of the long-term unemployed. [Page A18.]
With his popularity at the lowest ebb of his three years in office, Mr. Bush sought to recapture the stature he enjoyed just one year ago as Commander in Chief in the war against Iraq and as the leader of the free world during the collapse of Communism. He even borrowed his own Persian Gulf war oratory in an effort to persuade voters that he could bring the leadership he demonstrated in battle to bear on the economy.
"We are going to lift this nation out of hard times inch by inch and day by day, and those who would stop us had better step aside," Mr. Bush declared in a line that drew loud applause in the packed chamber of the House of Representatives. "Because I look at hard times, and I make this vow: This will not stand." The pledge echoed his promise that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait would not stand.
The Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley, politely applauded Mr. Bush as the President spoke to the joint session of Congress. But afterward, he criticized the President's proposals as too little, too late. "For too long, we were told to wait, that things would get better on their own," he said in the Democrats' official response. "There was even an effort to talk us out of the recession, or to tell us that it wasn't really happening at all."
After hearing the address, some of the Democratic Presidential candidates said they were disappointed with the President's economic plans.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, who was campaigning at a school in Franklin, N.H., offered this: "All I can say after watching his speech is the State of the Union is coming from someone who is totally out of touch with what is happening in America." Incongruously for a speech that had been billed as his moment to define not only his campaign agenda but the second term he hopes to win in November, Mr. Bush began his remarks in the chamber of the House of Representatives tonight with two jokes.
 
Poking Fun at Himself
 "You know, with the big buildup this speech has had, I wanted to make sure it would be a big hit, but I couldn't convince Barbara to deliver it for me," he said, as the chamber erupted into laughter and applause.
He smiled again and said: "I see the Speaker and the Vice President are laughing. They saw what I did in Japan, and they're just happy they're sitting behind me."
The politicians in the House chamber interrupted Mr. Bush's speech dozens of times for applause. Sometimes the applause came from both sides of the aisle, as it did for politically popular themes like Head Start and the war in the Persian Gulf. At other times, the applause was Republican only, as when Mr. Bush spoke of cutting the capital gains tax on profits from investments.
Mr. Bush tried to paint himself as Presidential and Congress as partisan. Striking a compromise between aides who urged him to be conciliatory and those who wanted him to start battling the Democrats right away, Mr. Bush challenged lawmakers to pass his proposals by March 20.
"From the day after that, if it must be: the battle is joined," Mr. Bush said. "And you know, when principle is at stake, I relish a good fair fight."
 
Says He Shunned 'Gimmicks'
 Mr. Bush portrayed his plan as a fiscally and politically responsible effort to speed the recession's end, although it came 18 months after the recession began and one year to the day after he promised America that it would soon end, and he asserted that he had resisted the temptation for "new and dazzling" proposals or "gimmicks."
But the President spoke against the backdrop of an extraordinary buildup for the annual speech, which the President has promoted in virtually every public utterance for the past six weeks. Concerned that the advance billing was too ambitious, and still caught up in disputes that kept a major proposal on health-care reform from being included tonight, the White House tried to lower expectations at the last minute.
Heeding the advice of moderate advisers who cautioned against too sharp a break with the past, Mr. Bush made no radical departure from the economic policies he has pursued for three years, nor did he remake the political philosophies that he inherited from Ronald Reagan into his own images.
Details of the President's programs will become clearer on Wednesday when he submits his budget to Congress. Then the White House and Congress begin the complicated process of negotiations and tradeoffs in incorporating the dozens of pieces of the package into legislation.
While economists suggested that Mr. Bush's short-term proposals could help the economy, the President offered no detailed vision of the future of the country tonight. Many of the proposals he outlined were programs that he offered in the past and that Congress rejected.
Among these was a call for a reduction in the rate of taxes on capital gains, which Mr. Bush has made the centerpiece of his economic policy, to as low as 15.4 percent on the profits from the sale of assets held more than three years. The current capital gains tax rate is 28 percent.
"This time, at this hour, I cannot take 'No' for an answer," he said.
Outlining his economic programs, many of which had found their way into news reports in recent weeks, Mr. Bush said he was issuing executive orders that would impose a 90-day moratorium on all new Federal regulations that could hinder growth, and he pledged to change banking regulations to stimulate lending.
To pump money into the economy, he said, the Federal Government will accelerate spending on existing programs, for a total of $10 billion in the next six months. He also proposed a budget "freeze" that would keep spending on discretionary programs in the budget for the 1993 fiscal year at the same level as the current budget. That proposal would produce less than $5 billion in savings.
 
Money Back Sooner
 Mr. Bush ordered the Treasury Department to revise the method by which taxes are withheld from paychecks. This would have no effect on Americans' tax burdens, but would simply give them back their own money sooner. Income taxes are now withheld at a rate higher than the actual tax rate in order to provide extra money to the Federal coffers during the year, and many taxpayers receive refunds.
Mr. Bush also proposed an increase of $500 in the personal tax exemption for each child, tax credits and penalty-free withdrawals from individual retirement accounts for first-time home buyers, tax breaks for the real estate industry, tax credits and deductions for medical insurance.
Declaring that "by the grace of God, American won the cold war," Mr. Bush played to the strongly inward-looking trends that are evident in polls of American voters in this election year.
He said: "For half a century now, the American people have shouldered the burden and paid taxes than were higher than they would have been to support a defense that was bigger than it would have been if imperial Communism had never existed. But it did. Doesn't anymore."
Mr. Bush announced that the enormously expensive B-2 Stealth bomber program would be stopped after the 20 planes already being purchased.
 
Towarde Fewer Warheads
 Mr. Bush also said he was canceling production of the Midgetman nuclear missile and would halt manufacture of new warheads for sea-based nuclear missiles. No more multiple-warhead MX missiles will be built, and the military will not buy any more advanced cruise missiles, Mr. Bush said.
He said that on Saturday, when he meets with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, he would propose that if Russia eliminates all land-based missiles with more than one warhead, he will eliminate the multiple-warhead MX missile and reduce the number of warheads on the Minuteman missile to one from three.
Often criticized for seeming deadpan in the face of astonishing events, Mr. Bush said, "Even as as President, with the most fascinating possible vantage point, there were times when I was so busy helping to manage progress and lead change that I didn't always show the joy that was in my heart."

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: Looking to Short Term;
Economists Say Bush Offers Gifts for Many But Probably Won't Deliver Lasting Growth

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
 President Bush proposed something for everyone in his State of the Union Message tonight except perhaps for economists. They said his proposals might do more to lift his popularity in an election year than to lift the nation out of recession and promote economic growth after that.
The Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cuts will probably do more to spur the economy over the next six to nine months than anything the President or Congress could do, many economists said. They said the President's tax-cut proposals, if they became law, would further fuel the recovery by giving consumers more money to spend and by offering businesses new incentives for investment. 
 But as for strengthening the economy over the longer term -- which economists consider far more fundamental than whether $20 billion or $50 billion is pumped in the short term -- many experts saw the President as proposing little new to help.
Administration officials say the President's proposals to accelerate depreciation and cut the capital gains tax should spur corporate investment in new plants and equipment. They say his proposals to make a tax credit for research and development permanent would help keep America in the forefront of innovation. Other tax measures, they say, would boost consumer confidence and homebuilding.
 
No Bold New Vision
 But many economists, worrying more than ever before about the nation's declining competitiveness, had been hoping that the President would lay out a bold new vision. Instead, they complained, he offered a rehash of warmed-over ideas, several of which have already been rejected by Congress.
These critics say Washington should be doing far more to train unskilled workers and rebuild cities if it is to increase competitiveness over the long haul. They would also like the Government to push companies to think more about long-term growth rather than quarterly profits and to step up efforts to unsnarl airports and roads that cut productivity.
Some economists are also concerned that adopting the President's tax-cut proposals would increase the mushrooming budget deficit, although the Administration insists that this is not the case. In addition, many economists say his proposals offer no startling new solutions to help America where it is faltering, in education and public investment, for example.
"It's a real Christmas tree for everybody," said Bernard L. Weinstein, director of the center for economic development and research at the University of North Texas. "It's the traditional short-term approach to goosing the economy, designed to garner votes. It doesn't address the long-term structural, institutional problems that are key to productivity, trade and unemployment."
For the affluent, the President's proposals would not only lower the capital gains tax but eliminate the luxury tax on yachts and private airplanes, a step the Administration classifies as a stimulus to create jobs in the ship-building and aviation industries.
For the middle class, the President called for raising the personal exemption by $500 a child. He also proposed a $5,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers that would be phased out after a year. And to encourage Americans to go to college, he called for deducting interest on student loans.
 
Some Enthusiasm
 For the less well-off, he offered a tax credit of up to $3,750 to make medical insurance more affordable.
And for everyone, he proposed reducing the amount the Government withholds from paychecks so that taxpayers would receive this year much of the tax refund they are due to receive in 1993.
"The tax credit for first-time home purchases, if it's temporary, is not a bad idea to spur growth, but it doesn't speak to any clear vision of wanting to do anything systematic for the economy," said Robert Solow, an economics professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics. "It sounds like bits and pieces paying off political debts."
Rudolph Penner, a former director of of the Congressional Budget Office who is now a fellow at the Urban Institute, a research organization here, was more enthusiastic about the address. He said America's competitiveness would be helped by making permanent the tax credits that corporations receive for research and development. As for the investment tax allowance that would allow companies to depreciate an extra 15 percent of investments in their first year, Mr. Penner said, "If you're going to try for stimulus, that's probably an effective way to do it.
"The important point to make is it appears to be a fairly restrained package," Mr. Penner continued. "The hope will be you can keep it restrained as it goes through Congress. My worry is that there will be a bidding war that will lead to a substantial long-term budget deficit increase and a stimulus we don't need."
 
Rejected by Congress
 At a background news briefing today, senior Administration officials said recovery seemed near, and added that the President's "growth package" should create hundreds of thousands of jobs this year and increase the nation's economic output by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next five years.
In his list of proposals to strengthen the economy over the long run, the President made several proposals that have stalled or been rejected by Congress in the past: reducing the capital gains rate, allowing nationwide banking and giving parents vouchers to make it easier for them to send children to private schools.
The capital gains proposal, which the business community applauded, is sure to spur another huge battle in Congress, with many Democrats saying it would do more to line the pockets of the rich than to spur investment. In this election year, tax-cut proposals aimed at the middle class are expected to find smoother sailing.
But some economists said the short-term tax cuts were hardly needed to combat the recession. "It seems to me that we ought to leave the majority of the countercyclical burden to the Federal Reserve," said Donald Straszheim, chief economist for Merrill Lynch. "They have done a lot. There is a recovery coming. My own bet is that any countercyclical stimulus now will come too late."

HEADLINE: Budget Pretense in New Jersey

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio's new budget for New Jersey offers more spending, no new taxes and no more layoffs. Nice trick if he could pull it off. But there's a new reality in Trenton. The Democratic Governor's budget will be filtered through a Republican Legislature this year, and the Republicans are determined to cut both taxes and spending. At this stage, both he and they are just sparring.
Mr. Florio's $15.7 billion proposal for the year starting July 1 -- $700 million more than the current year -- rests on uncertain assumptions of increased revenues. He hopes that an economic recovery will yield higher state tax collections, that Washington will provide a windfall of Medicaid reimbursements and that the Legislature will approve revised accounting for state pension funds. He also proposes small spending cuts, of less than 1 percent, for most state agencies. 
 The Republicans say he should have included a reduction in the state sales tax, because he knows it's coming; they won their veto-proof majorities by promising tax cuts. But it is not Mr. Florio's job to fulfill opposition promises. If they want to cut taxes, let them find spending cuts to keep the books in balance. That will give them a lesson in the harshness of budgeting these days -- no doubt Mr. Florio's intent.
The face-off in New Jersey is sharpened by the Republicans' absolute control of the Legislature, and by the Governor's apparent belief that even these difficult times demand no tighter control over spending. Let the sparring proceed.

HEADLINE: Out of Uniform, Into Service

BYLINE: By Adam Walinsky; Adam Walinsky is a lawyer.

 BODY:
The Democratic candidates seem agreed on the need for deep cuts in the defense budget, perhaps to fund tax cuts for the middle class. The Congress is sure to go along with them. Cutting the budget will mean severe adjustments. Consider the people affected.
There was a great outcry when General Motors announced plans to lay off 74,000 workers by 1995. Defense budget reductions envisioned by Congressional leaders would require Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to lay off about 500,000, many of them combat veterans. They would be thrown almost casually into an uncertain and troubled economy. 
 We must see these men and women not as a problem to be got rid of, but as a new reserve of energy and talent. The Federal Government should keep them on its rolls, at their current pay and allowances, and use them for three- or four-year terms of civilian service.
First, since the country is desperately short of police officers to face a rising tide of disorder and violence, 200,000 should be assigned to police forces across the country. Soldiers and marines would need training and tight supervision from civilian police authorities. But they would arrive more than competent to suppress gunfights, to corral wilding groups and generally to help keep the peace.
Second, 100,000 should teach in elementary and secondary schools and in remedial and vocational programs. Of the 500,000 likely to be discharged, 100,000 are officers, mostly college educated. Many of the senior enlisted men are also highly experienced trainers.
Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, has said for years that the nation should capture these people to teach in elementary and secondary schools. They know how to teach job skills, are used to dealing with young people from impoverished backgrounds and would not be afraid to teach in rough neighborhoods, even in jails.
In the last four months, an Army hotline has drawn more than 11,000 inquiries from officers interested in becoming teachers, many qualified to teach mathematics and science, for which good teachers are in short supply.
Third, 30,000 medical corpsmen should be assigned to hospital emergency rooms and public health programs. These technicians have been trained to deal with traumas, accidental and violent, like those inundating inner cities. The Special Forces, trained to bring basic public health practices to remote and primitive third world areas, can do at least that much at home, especially when tuberculosis and sexual diseases are spreading in new and more virulent forms.
America's continuing racial crisis gives such a program special urgency. Thirty percent of those likely to be discharged are black, while the population is 11.7 percent black. The military has been a great highway of advancement of talented men and women without regard to race or ethnic origin.
They should not be simply sent back to depressed communities as isolated individuals in search of a function and place. This program of reconstruction would bring them home with a special mission and the support of a committed nation. These are patriotic people of discipline and spirit -- potential leaders whom we need. They would be inspiring examples to the legions of lost black and Hispanic children in ghettos across the country -- and the rest of us, too.
This is not a permanent but a transitional program, at a time of special need. We must still establish the Police Corps, which both houses of Congress established last year and which would enlist young people for four years of police service in exchange for college scholarships. And we will still require fundamental reform in education and health care. But it would bring our military people home to highly useful temporary and perhaps permanent jobs.
It would not reduce Federal outlays, but it could enormously increase our sense of security, prosperity and well-being. Personal safety, the quality of a child's education, quick assistance to the sick and injured -- these are hard to quantify and are omitted from economic statistics. Yet they can determine personal and national satisfaction more surely than any number of things measurable in dollars.
America faces awesome problems of race, poverty and urban decay. Suddenly and unexpectedly, we will have at our disposal a great reservoir of strength to confront them. Let's use it.

HEADLINE: Is Islamic Fundamentalism a New Red Scare?;
The State of the Law

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Algeria Chooses Islam" (editorial, Jan. 3), unwittingly proffers an answer to a question that has troubled Muslims since the abolition of the caliphate in 1924: Is it conceivable for vibrant Islam to exist without Islamic dominion? Muslim fundamentalists say no, and you seem to agree, provided the imposition of Islamic law in Algeria proves "wise, merciful and just." 
 Recent experience however disputes the fundamentalist claim. Pakistan, where a Muslim population was the main justification for a state separate from the rest of India, has been through three constitutions since its founding in 1948 and remains uncertain about the feasibility of Islamic law governing all social and economic relations.
In Iran, the principle that the ultimate judicial and legislative authority resides in the ayatollah as the legitimate successor of Mohammed did not outlast Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death. The contradictions between an elected legislative assembly and an unimpeachable clerical establishment sharing power led to the abolition of the supreme religious authority in the revised constitution.
The Arab Muslim states, including Algeria, suffer from duality in their legal orders. Their constitutions have left Islamic law and institutions unencumbered by the adoption of modern codes and organization.
This has led to duplicity by certain regimes toward fundamentalists and one another, reaching ludicrous proportions in the Persian Gulf crisis, when Baghdad, Riyadh and Cairo invoked Islamic law both to assail and support United States intervention in a primarily Muslim quarrel.
Before Muslim fundamentalists in Algeria or elsewhere build a viable Islamic state, they need to take a critical look at the state of Islamic law, whose interrupted evolution as early as the 10th century deprived it of the rationalization and systematization that law must have in modern society. They need to take heed of what their co-religionists trained in Western legal science have to say: that only by resurrecting the principles of Islamic law from under the heap of outmoded interpretations, opinions and rulings, and recasting them more compatibly with today's social and economic needs, will it be possible to revive Islamic legal culture.

HEADLINE: The Federal Budget: Budget as Bush Campaign Manifesto;
Bottom-Line: A Hands-Off Government

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
The budget that President Bush sent Congress today is essentially his campaign manifesto, and it delineates how starkly his views differ from those of his Democratic opponents, in Congress and on the campaign trail.
With minor exceptions, the new budget underscores Mr. Bush's intention of maintaining the same course the country has been on for the last dozen years, one in which the Government uses tax and spending policy as little as possible to guide the nation's economic affairs. 
 That philosophy was more or less embraced today by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who wields his considerable influence over the economy independently of the Bush Administration.
Mr. Greenspan told Congress, as he had earlier, that he was confident he could manipulate monetary policy in such a way that the economy would begin growing again before this summer. Speaking in his typically cryptic manner, he cautioned the lawmakers, and by extension Mr. Bush, against breaching the hands-off principle and letting the fever for tax cuts get out of hand in a way that would damage the economy over the long haul. [Page D1.]
Mr. Bush's view is directly in conflict with that of the Democrats, who, while disagreeing on details, are unified in wanting bold changes in direction and an active, deeply involved Government. The President's approach is also being challenged by a small but vocal group of conservative Republicans led by the House minority whip, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who want the Government to be more aggressive in promoting investment and economic growth.
In an earlier time, Mr. Bush might have been able to use Mr. Greenspan's stance as ammunition in the President's political battles. But in Congress and elsewhere, many politicians of both parties hold Mr. Greenspan to be at least partly responsible for the meager growth and the recession that have plagued the economy in recent years. So his political influence has waned considerably.
 
Tar for the Democrats
 Mr. Bush clearly intends to tar the Democrats with the same brush the Republicans have used successfully in the last three Presidential elections: as favoring wasteful spending and a weak military, as supporting intrusions into the American system of private enterprise and opposing tax cuts that the Republicans say would generate more private investment and economic expansion.
With that in mind, the President laid down these markers:
*Over the next five years, he wants to cut spending for domestic programs below what would be needed to keep pace with inflation. Democrats want heavy new investment in public projects like highways, transit systems, environmental cleanup and airports.
*Mr. Bush wants to save $50 billion from the projected military budget over five years and to use the money for either tax cuts or deficit reduction. Democrats want a military cut of at least $100 billion, with the money saved to be transferred into public works projects, education, medical care and other domestic programs.
*The President wants merely to tinker with the nation's system of private health care insurance and essentially keep the Government's hands off. The Democrats, in Congress and in New Hampshire, favor national health insurance or at least a system in which the Government would play an important role.
*Mr. Bush wants no additional taxes on the wealthy, and many of the tax breaks he proposes would benefit the well-to-do more than others. Democrats want to give tax reductions mostly to the poor and the middle class while raising raise taxes on the wealthy.
Although other issues like abortion and trade policy will obviously rise to the fore at times during this year's campaign, questions about the direction of the nation's economy are likely to dominate politics between now and November. Both sides express a willingness to wage battle on that turf.
 
'Cornerstone of Policy'
 This budget, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told reporters today, "will be the cornerstone of a policy that will keep America strong and competitive into the next century."
The Democrats, for their part, are relying on the history of Presidents' losing political ground when the economy falters.
A chapter in the budget shows that the Administration's economists expect the economy to grow by only 2.2 percent this year if Mr. Bush's proposals are adopted, a forecast in the same range as those of private economists.
The last two Presidential election years when the growth rate was that low were 1960 and 1980, and both times the incumbent party was ousted. The winning candidates, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, had emphasized in their campaigns that they wanted to turn the country in a new direction.
Mr. Bush's budget does offer some policy changes he has never proposed before, like the elimination of some weapons systems, an increase in spending for early childhood education and a variety of new tax breaks for individuals and businesses. But those initiatives are the exceptions. Despite the current bad times and the gloomy expectations for the future expressed in public opinion polls, the new budget differs only on the margins from Mr. Bush's previous ones.
 
Call for Standing Pat
 His message seems to be that the Government should more or less stand pat.
In a few areas, like more money for Head Start, Mr. Bush clearly expects Congress to go along with his recommendations. But other budget proposals, like a lower tax rate on capital gains, seem intended mostly to pick a fight with Congress. If past is prologue, Mr. Bush will run this year as much against Congress, which gets rock-bottom approval ratings in public opinion polls, as against the Democratic Presidential nominee.
Democrats, even most of those who favor other forms of a capital gains tax reduction, maintain that Mr. Bush's proposal would be a windfall for the wealthy. They think they can use the President's position to show that he is the patron of fat cats.
The President says that most of the people whom the tax cut would directly benefit are middle class and that investments generated by the cut would speed recovery from the recession and thus benefit all Americans, rich and poor. If Democrats oppose it, Mr. Bush plans to blame them for hard times.
Other budget proposals, like the elimination of 246 Government programs, many of which have their own constituencies and are thus difficult to get rid of, stand little more chance of enactment this year than they did in previous years, when they failed. But by proposing their abolition, even though he knows it will not come about, Mr. Bush can show savings that make his balance sheet come out right.
This tactic, used by the Republicans year after year, traps the Democrats who control Congress. If they do not want to abolish programs that are important to particular constituents, they must either oppose the President's tax reductions or find other programs, perhaps equally popular, to cut.
 
Polls Offers Democrats Hope
 Mr. Bush relies in his budget proposals on fundamental Republican dogma: that spending on many domestic programs is basically wasteful, that military cuts beyond those he proposes cannot be risked, that the medical care system should remain private and that low taxes for the wealthy lead to economic growth and therefore to jobs and prosperity for those less well off.
Those principles have served the party well for years. Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush won three Presidential elections in part because they persuaded the public that Democrats led by Jimmy Carter had destroyed the national economy with crippling taxes to pay for Government waste.
But Democrats take heart from recent polls that show the public less interested in tax cuts than in more Government spending for schools, medical care, job creation, environmental protection and public works. People seem to be saying they want the Government to be more ambitious and active.
If Mr. Bush's forecast is right, he will have presided over the slowest four-year period of economic activity since the Presidency of Herbert Hoover. His opponents will say that was Mr. Bush's fault, for embracing tax and spending policies that allowed the Government to atrophy.

HEADLINE: Mideast Parley Ends in Moscow Under Shadow

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 29

 BODY:
The two-day Moscow round of Middle East peace talks ended today much as they had begun, with a pall cast over the future by the question of who will speak for the Palestinians.
Yet despite wobbly moments caused by this question of Palestinian representation, it was clear that the talks here focused on a panoply of issues affecting the entire Middle East, and that therefore the peace process did have a future. 
 Delegates from two dozen countries, including the broadest band of Arab countries ever to sit at the same table with Israel, agreed to resume their discussions in the spring. They set up five small groups, each of which is to focus on a specific problem and to convene in April or May in capitals stretching from Tokyo to Ottawa.
 
Success, in a Sense
 Viewed from that vantage point, some of the nations represented in Moscow said, their gathering was significant, even successful.
But the unresolved dispute over Palestinian representation hung over the conference more thickly than snow clouds over the city.
It appeared that, at least for now, the arguments were centered only on this regional phase of negotiations and not the companion direct, two-party talks between Israel and delegations representing the Palestinians, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Those negotiations, held thus far in Washington, are supposed to resume in mid-February, although the location has not yet been decided.
For a second day, Palestinians did not attend the talks here because their choice of delegates was unacceptable to the American and Russian sponsors, who had acceded to Israeli demands that Palestinians from East Jerusalem and from outside the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip be excluded.
 
Guidance From the Hosts
 But there were strong signs that the United States and Russia were looking for a way to get the Palestinians involved when the working groups reconvene this spring to discuss regional concerns.
The next working-group sessions will be spread across the globe in April and May. Talks on economic development are to be held in Belgium, on the environment in Japan, on arms control and regional security in Washington, on refugees in Canada, and on water resources in either Turkey or Austria.
The meetings on refugees and economic development are being called "seminars." The purpose of such language is not clear, but it may be intended to bring about some form of compromise on the question of Palestinian representation by labeling those sessions something other than working groups.
It is quite possible, said Vladimir Petrovsky, the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, that there will be "adjustments" to present agreements forbidding the involvement of Arabs from Jerusalem or of overseas Palestinians. On Tuesday, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said he supported the idea of having Palestinians from outside the territories join the discussions at a later date, especially on an issue like refugees, which affects them directly.
 
A Measure of Hope
 Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman, said today that she regarded the Secretary's remarks as a commitment to change the rules, although other members of the Palestinian delegation said they were not yet convinced that the Americans meant business.
If Mrs. Ashrawi is right, Washington could be headed into a collision course with Israel, a road already well traveled as a result of clashes over the building of Jewish settlements in the territories and the Israeli request for $10 billion in American loan guarantees over five years to resettle Russians and other Jewish emigres.
Yosef Hadass, director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, repeated his country's opposition to any change of procedure, often referred to as the "Madrid formula" because they governed the opening peace conference in Madrid last October.
"We have accepted participation of Palestinians who live with us in the territories," Mr. Hadass said tonight. "We are not going to change it."
"I don't want to tell you we will even consider it in the future," he added. "We will not."
On Tuesday, Foreign Minister David Levy of Israel said that if Palestinians considered unacceptable by his Government were allowed into the peace process, "they will meet by themselves."
The Israelis argue that the rules establishedmust be followed down the line.
For them, letting in Palestinians from abroad or from Arab East Jerusalem would imply that they are now willing to negotiate both their absorption of East Jerusalem soon after their victory in the 1967 war and to accept the right of hundreds of thousands of Arabs to return one day to pre-1948 Palestine. In addition, by excluding "outside Palestinians," they can prevent direct participation by the Palestine Liberation Organization, labeled by Israel as a terrorist group.
But the Palestinians say that in these talks on regional matters, it is senseless and unfair to limit their involvement to delegates evaluated under the criteria set initially by Israel and then accepted by the sponsors to get the peace process under way. While insisting that their refusal to play now by Madrid rules is a matter of substance and not pride, they have decided to draw the line on conditions that all along they have found humiliating but had to swallow out of political weakness.
"Enough is enough," Saeb Erakat, a Palestinian delegate said.
The United States and Russia told the Palestinians that most of their chosen delegates were unacceptable for the Moscow round. But now they are talking about possibly changing the rules the next time, because they worry, among other things, that broad Arab involvement in this delicate process could be jeopardized if the Palestinians stay away.
Referring specifically to the Mideast refugee issue, a senior Russian official, Oleg Dirkovsky, said, "We do not understand how these negotiations can proceed without participation by the Palestinians."
Israel's concern about this shift by the sponsors was signaled by an official who said, "In the long run, the Palestinians may have scored a major political victory because of this American and Russian departure."
Still, Israelis pronounced themselves satisfied with the Moscow talks, in large part because Saudi Arabia and other Arab gulf nations, along with North African countries, sat down for negotiations involving Israel for the first time. Also attending were delegations from outside the Mideast region -- Japan, the European Community, China and Canada, whowere welcomed for their political and diplomatic expertise, and also for their money.

HEADLINE: The Federal Budget: The Overview;
PRESIDENT OFFERS CAUTIOUS CHANGES IN SPENDING PLAN

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
In an election-year budget of $1.52 trillion, President Bush called today for modest increases in a wide range of popular domestic programs, but he avoided any major change in spending priorities to fight the recession.
Most of the President's proposed budget carries out decisions and commitments made in the past. Social Security overtakes military spending for the first time, as the Pentagon budget declines while cash payments to the elderly rise steadily. 
 Hoping to breathe life into a listless economy, Mr. Bush proposed tax breaks for investors, home buyers, businesses and families with children. His proposals turned out to be less drastic than some of the tax cuts considered by his advisers over the last two months.
 
Predictions on Deficit
 Mr. Bush's budget shows a deficit of $399 billion in the current fiscal year and $352 billion in 1993, both far above the record $269 billion reported last year. The actual deficit for any year is often bigger than the President predicts. Mr. Bush assumes an upswing in the economy this year, but if that does not occur soon, the deficit may be larger than his estimate, because tax collections would be lower.
The President's budget would provide almost $40 billion for unemployment insurance benefits in the current fiscal year, including $2.7 billion in extra aid for people who have exhausted their regular benefits. But the budget contains no major jobs program of the type sought by many Democrats and big-city mayors.
Overshadowing the entire budget are the nation's economic problems. President Bush and his budget director, Richard G. Darman, insisted that it was neither necessary nor desirable to break the budget agreement of 1990, which set separate limits on domestic and military spending through the fiscal year 1993. But Mr. Darman said grudgingly today that the Administration would, under certain conditions, consider a change in that agreement to use savings from the military budget to finance a tax cut for families with children.
 
Not Yielding to Democrats
 Mr. Darman's comments were the clearest indication to date that the Administration might be willing to renegotiate the budget agreement. But he expressed no willingness to bow to Congressional Democrats who want to take money from the Pentagon and spend it on social welfare programs.
The budget sent to Congress today covers the fiscal year 1993, which begins Oct. 1, five weeks before Election Day. One section of the budget, describing the Administration's economic assumptions, predicts confidently that "a sustained upturn will soon begin," thanks in part to Mr. Bush's efforts to stimulate economic growth.
But in a separate chapter of the budget, Mr. Darman is more cautious, saying: "Here at home, the euphoria of summer has been displaced by another winter's gloom. The domestic economy has not recovered in the manner that had been widely forecast."
And the Agriculture Department, in its budget, predicts that the number of people on food stamps, 24.2 million in October, will reach a monthly average of 25.6 million this year and 25.8 million next year.
Senator Robert C. Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said, "I saw no immediate burst for the economy in any of the tax-cut proposals." He was referring to Mr. Bush's State of the Union Message on Tuesday as well as the budget request today.
Asked why there was no big tax cut to revive the economy, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said, "The President's feeling is that the recovery is on its way." Samuel K. Skinner, the White House chief of staff, said the most important boost for the economy came late last year, when the Federal Reserve lowered the discount rate, which it charges for lending to commercial banks.
This year's deficit would be $30 billion higher but for Mr. Darman's decision to make an accounting change that sharply reduces the apparent cost of Federal insurance for banks and savings-and-loan associations. Representative Leon E. Panetta of California and Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee, Democrats who serve as chairmen of budget committees in the two chambers, said the proposed accounting change was a gimmick that makes the deficit seem more manageable.
Mr. Panetta described Mr. Bush's budget request as "a return to the smoke-and-mirrors, buy-now-pay-later budgets of the 1980's."
 
What Does It All Mean?
 The President's budget is a request to Congress, which may or may not accept his suggestions. What emerges from Congress is invariably different from what the President proposes, in part because Presidents sometimes do not lobby hard for their own proposals.
The President said his budget complies with the 1990 budget agreement. The agreement set limits on the Federal deficit, but they are essentially meaningless because they are adjusted for changes in economic conditions and other factors.
Mr. Bush's budget gives no indication that he will aggressively pursue any proposals likely to alienate large numbers of voters. As expected, he proposes to increase spending for Head Start, child nutrition, preventive health programs, biomedical research and Pell grants, the major source of Federal aid to college students from low-income families.
Those proposals are all intended to reinforce the message Mr. Bush carried this month to New Hampshire, where the people have been battered by the recession and where there is a primary election on Feb. 18. "I care," he said on his trip to New Hampshire, where he acknowledged that "this economy is in a free fall."
 
In the Fine Print
 But for each increase in politically popular programs, the fine print of the President's budget shows proposed cuts in other areas, not highlighted by the Administration: cuts in home heating assistance, housing for the elderly and the disabled, Amtrak, operating subsidies for urban mass transit, the Tennessee Valley Authority and aid to Appalachia.
Increases and decreases in these programs more or less offset each other. Mr. Bush would freeze this type of "domestic discretionary" spending, which is subject to annual appropriations by Congress.
The driving force in the budget, surging beyond any such constraint, is benefit programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Taken together, such benefit programs account for more than half of all Federal spending, but they are "largely exempt from budgetary discipline," Mr. Darman said in his introduction. Under these programs, the Government is required to pay benefits to any applicant who meets eligibility criteria.
Disappointed with the results of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law and other measures intended to balance the budget, Mr. Bush and Mr. Darman urge Congress to establish a new procedure to curb the growth of benefit programs. They would set an overall ceiling on such spending, allowing increases for inflation and population growth, but not for high unemployment or recession.
 
Laying a Foundation
 Under this proposal, some benefits could be automatically cut if total spending on such programs would otherwise exceed the limit. The proposal, though unlikely to be adopted in the exact form suggested by Mr. Bush, lays a foundation for future efforts to control benefit programs, usually treated as untouchable in election years.
Mr. Darman said Congress should impose "an enforceable cap" on the growth of spending for these programs. Otherwise, he said, "they just keep on going and growing automatically."
Without waiting for Congress to act, President Bush today proposed cutbacks and other changes in benefit programs intended to save $7.7 billion this year and $68 billion over six years. The proposals include a sharp increase in monthly premiums for affluent people enrolled in Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled.
The proposal would apply to individuals with annual income of more than $100,000 and couples with income of more than $125,000. It would roughly triple the monthly premium, now $31.80, for insurance covering the cost of doctors' services.
Congress took no action on a similar proposal last year, though the House Budget Committee said the idea had "a great deal of merit and should be considered."
 
Health Care Deferred
 The budget does not include comprehensive proposals to overhaul the nation's health-care system, control soaring medical costs or increase access to care for millions of people with no health insurance. The Administration has been studying that issue for more than two years. The White House says Mr. Bush will announce his health proposals on Feb. 6.
Under one proposal already approved by Mr. Bush, poor people could get tax credits to help them buy health insurance. The maximum credit in any year would be $3,750 for families and $1,250 for individuals.
In his military budget, President Bush says he would stop production of the B-2 Stealth bomber, the Seawolf submarine and the nation's most powerful nuclear warhead, used on missles carried by Trident submarines.
He would also terminate the small intercontinental ballistic missile known as the Midgetman, stop all production of the MX missile and shift many long-range bombers to missions predicated on conventional wars.
 
Protective at the Pentagon
 But the Pentagon said that money for the "Star Wars" antimissile system "remains a top priority." Mr. Bush requested $5.4 billion for the program in 1993, up from $4.1 billion this year.
While the Pentagon is cutting expensive weapons systems originally intended to counter the Soviet threat, it hopes to protect its budget for military salaries and training.
The Administration is resisting Congressional calls for swifter cuts in active-duty military personnel. The armed forces, now just under 2 million, would decline by 138,000 this year and 99,000 next year, eventually reaching 1.64 million in 1995 under the President's plan.
Members of Congress from both parties support many of the military cutbacks proposed by Mr. Bush. Some staunch supporters of the Pentagon like Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, had already called for ending production of the B-2 bomber and canceling the Seawolf submarine program.
But Mr. Bush says that money saved as a result of the military cutbacks should not be used for domestic programs, as many Democrats propose. The House Committee on Government Operations plans to vote next week on legislation to permit such shifts. Representative John Conyers Jr., the Michigan Democrat who heads the committee, said today that "unneeded defense funds" should be used to create civilian jobs and to help cities and states in fiscal distress.
 
Darman's Understatement
 With considerable understatement, Mr. Darman says "the outlook for debt and deficits remains unattractive." The Administration envisions Federal budget deficits totaling $1.5 trillion from 1992 through 1997. The Government finances such deficits by borrowing money from the public.
Under Mr. Bush's budget, the Federal debt, which represents the accumulated total of all Government borrowing, would soar from $2.7 trillion in 1991 to $4.2 trillion in 1997. The ratio of the Federal debt to gross national product will reach 52.5 percent this year, a level not seen since the mid-1950's, when the Government still owed huge amounts from World War II.
Such debt will be a burden for years. The Government cannot reduce its debt unless it runs a surplus in the Federal budget. In 1993, the Treasury expects to spend $214 billion, or 14 percent of the entire Federal budget, on interest payments to people who have lent money to the Government.
To trim Government spending, Mr. Bush proposes to end 246 domestic programs that together cost $5 billion a year. He would, for example, end construction of public housing for low-income families, eliminate the Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration and end support for improvements to rail tracks in the Northeast Corridor used by Amtrak trains.
If money is still needed for such purposes, he said, it can be provided by state and local governments or by other Federal programs.

HEADLINE: BUSH AND YELTSIN PROPOSE DEEP CUTS IN ATOMIC WEAPONS

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin made new arms control proposals this week that envision slashing American and Russian long-range nuclear arms by well over half and could eliminate the class of missiles considered the biggest threat to peace.
But Mr. Bush's proposal, outlined in the State of the Union Address on Tuesday, asks Mr. Yeltsin to take a step that no Soviet leader ever entertained: give up his advantage in one area of nuclear arms competition, land-based missiles, in return for an important concession but not parallel cuts in the area of American advantage, submarine-based missiles. 
 Mr. Bush's plan would reduce the American strategic nuclear arsenal to between 4,500 and 5,000 warheads, about 60 percent of the current level and far less than envisioned in last year's strategic arms reduction treaty.
 
Multiple-Warhead Missiles
 It would eliminate missiles with more than one warhead that are fired from land, the most dangerous kind of nuclear weapon and the mainstay of the Soviet nuclear force. In exchange, the United States would sharply reduce its stock of weapons launched from submarines, which are the ones the Russians worry about the most, but Washington would retain an edge.
In response, Mr. Yeltsin said today that he would propose cutting long-range nuclear warheads to between 2,000 and 2,500. That did not appear to include cruise missiles and bombs dropped from airplanes, but would still mean a total significantly lower than what Mr. Bush suggested. [Page A8.]
Administration officials said prospects were good for some sort of an agreement, which Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin will begin discussing at Camp David on Saturday. Mr. Bush on Tuesday described Mr. Yeltsin's early response as "very positive."
 
Offer Called 'Lopsided'
 But Soviet officials visiting the United States in advance of Mr. Yeltsin's arrival for a United Nations Security Council meeting on Friday are reported to have said in conversations here that Mr. Yeltsin found the offer "lopsided" and told Mr. Bush so in a letter received by the White House on Monday. Mr. Yeltsin had been advised in advance of Mr. Bush's proposal.
Mr. Yeltsin also made clear in a speech today that his Government will continue to oppose Washington's "Star Wars" anti-missile program unless the United States agrees to share the technology, something the Bush Administration has refused to consider.
Both sides have indicated in recent days that they recognize that the dynamics of arms control have been transformed. Just last week, Mr. Yeltsin announced that Russian nuclear missiles would no longer be aimed at American targets, and the Pentagon has long conceded there is no apparent military threat from what used to be the Soviet Union.
Indeed, Administration officials said these sorts of developments led Mr. Bush to propose the concessions that Soviet leaders always refused, with some confidence that his ideas would be at least considered.
 
'Out to Sea'
 "This is what we've been trying to do since the beginning of strategic arms negotiations in 1969 -- 'push the Soviets out to sea,' where we have our missiles," said Dunbar Lockwood, a senior analyst with the Arms Control Association, a private research group.
He added, "It has always been our premise that it's more stabilizing to have the bulk of missiles in subs, because they are invisible under the sea and therefore more useful for retaliation and not an attractive target for someone considering a first strike."
As dramatic as the newly proposed cuts may seem, arms control is not the only item on the agenda for Saturday's meeting, nor perhaps even the most pressing.
The White House views the meeting as a chance for Mr. Bush to impress on Mr. Yeltsin the need to continue political and economic liberalization without Russia imposing its will on other former republics.
 
'Big Brother Fashion'
 "We believe there is a need for all the former Soviet republics to move forward along these lines, mutually and not in Big Brother fashion," an Administration official said. "The Russians have shown a tendency to confuse their national interests with those of the peoples surrounding them."
Mr. Bush also planned to give what one official called his "imprimatur" to Mr. Yeltsin's economic policies, which Washington hopes will give the Russian leader a political boost at home, in much the same way that Mr. Bush once sought to shore up President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Equally important, officials said, Mr. Bush hopes to establish with Mr. Yeltsin the kind of personal rapport and working relationship that he had with Mr. Gorbachev. "It's the first time he's met with Yeltsin that Bush hasn't had to worry about the problem of dual power and conflicting loyalties," a senior official said.
Another official said, "The only alternative to Yeltsin that we can see is dictatorship and so we want to, A, make sure that he's politically entrenched and, B, make sure as we did with Gorbachev that he follows the path of democracy and reform."
 
1991 Arms Treaty
 Last July, the United States and the Soviet Union signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which calls for reducing the American arsenal of about 11,600 nuclear warheads aboard ballistic missiles, jet-like cruise missiles and bombs dropped by airplanes to about 8,600 before the end of the century. The Soviet arsenal would be cut from about 10,900 warheads to about 6,900.
Nuclear arms treaties deal with warheads, which are the actual nuclear bombs, rather than the missiles that carry them, because modern missiles can carry more than 10 warheads apiece. These missiles are considered dangerous or "destabilizing" because they are tempting targets for the other country's military planners.
On Sept. 27, in announcing unilateral cuts in short-range nuclear weapons that are used on the battlefield, Mr. Bush offered to negotiate an elimination of multiple-warhead missiles with the Soviet Union.
 
Cutting Soviet Arsenal
 On Tuesday, Mr. Bush proposed that Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan eradicate all of their huge, multiple-warhead missiles based on land. This would have the additional benefit to the United States of removing all intercontinental missiles from Ukrainian and Kazakh soil.
The United States has in the past proposed eliminating multiple-warhead missiles fired from land and the Kremlin has always refused, because the United States was not willing to consider cuts in its submarine-launched missiles.
This time, Mr. Bush offered to do just that if the other three countries accepted his proposal. He said he would eliminate about one-third of the warheads aboard American Trident submarines, reducing the force from 3,456 warheads to about 2,300.
He went a step further by saying he would also destroy America's newest and most powerful land-based weapon, the 10-warhead MX missile, and lower the number of warheads aboard the Minuteman 3 missile to one from three.
If these ideas are adopted, the United States would be left with about 2,800 warheads on its long-range missiles. The rest of the arsenal is composed of bombs dropped by aircraft and cruise missiles, similar to conventionally armed versions used against Iraq last year. It is not clear how many of each kind of missile Mr. Bush intends to keep.

HEADLINE: The Federal Budget: Taxes;
Adjustment Brings In Cash, and Risk

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Among the more than three dozen tax proposals in the budget request for 1993 that the Bush Administration sent to Congress today, the adjustment of withholding tables for most taxpayers to cut the amount taken out of each paycheck stands alone in needing no Congressional assent.
But while the adjustment will inject more than $2 billion a month in spending into the economy this year, some analysts warned that it would also create a potential trap for the unwary. 
 More than 8.5 million taxpayers who would be getting tax refunds in the spring of 1993 without the adjustment will instead owe the Government money unless they take a simple precaution, Treasury figures indicate. That precaution will involve filing a new form to advise the employer that they want more money withheld.
Although the Internal Revenue Service will waive penalties for underpayments of estimated income tax because of the adjustment, many taxpayers may find themselves scrambling for the money to make up for the underpayment.
"It's play in '92, pay in '93," said David Berenson, national director of tax policy for Ernst & Young, an accounting firm. Mr. Berenson said he expected that despite the change, which was being put in place today, relatively few people would file the form to readjust their withholding.
 
Millions to Be Affected
 According to the I.R.S., 89 million income tax returns fall into the low-to-middle income categories, with 72 million of these producing refunds under the old system. The agency also estimates that 88 percent of all taxpayers now getting refunds will still get them. But 12 percent, or about 8.6 million people, will not. In addition, others who now come out even when they file their tax returns will owe money, while many who already owe on April 15 will owe more.
To avoid the change in withholding, which is automatic, workers must complete a new Form W-4 in which they would claim the same number of allowances as before, but would also tell their employers that they want additional money withheld each payday. Generally, the smaller the refund a person is accustomed to getting, the more likely he is to owe money next spring.
Married couples who file a joint return should deduct an additional $345 divided by the number of paydays per year. Single employees should use the figure $172, so that if they are paid weekly, the extra amount withheld from each paycheck would be $3.30.
People at higher income levels will not have to make any decision on withholding. The new plan does not reduce the amount of tax withheld for married people starting with incomes of $90,200 and for individuals with incomes starting at $53,200.
 
Gains and Losses
 In their overall effect, the Administration says, the changes it is proposing will not significantly increase the Federal deficit. The changes would cost the Treasury $5.2 billion in 1992, it says, but receipts would rise $700 million in 1993, $3.1 billion in 1994 and $900 million in each of 1995 and 1996.
But the projection does not take into account the loss to the Treasury of the interest-free money it had been withholding from taxpayers' paychecks. The Government will now have to borrow that money in the capital markets at going interest rates unless it can be found elsewhere.
Among various "sleeper" proposals in the package are provisions that would force charities to file annual returns that document contributions of more than $500. That could cause taxpayers to be more cautious in claiming deductions, or exaggerating them, and might reduce charitable contributions, some analysts said.
Another proposal would require securities dealers to value their inventories at current market rates instead of giving them the choice of using the lower of market value or cost. Some specialists said this could discourage dealers from selling securities that had risen in value.
As a whole, the Administration said, the provisions are designed to spur the economy in the short term and revitalize it over the long term.
A supplementary Treasury document distributed this afternoon grouped the revenue items into four broad categories. They are jobs and investments; families, health, education and savings; homebuyers, and other proposals, a miscellany of provisions affecting both individuals and businesses. All three of the sleeper provisions, for example, are included under "other."
In the jobs and investments category, six proposals are already on the books but are due to expire soon. They include rules that govern the way companies allocate spending on research and experimentation between their domestic and foreign operations, and rules on credits for businesses that invest in solar or geothermal energy.
Three other tax credits for business that would otherwise expire also provide direct benefits to individuals. The Administration would extend for 18 months the tax credit for investments in low-income housing, a tax credit for businesses that hire disadvantaged veterans and people now on welfare, among others, and the authority of state and local governments to issue bonds to aid new farmers.
The extensions are expected to fare well in Congress. Indeed, the proposal to keep the credits on the books is hardly new. Many have been extended several times.
The freshest idea, but one with limited application, would allow a person who sells a principal residence at a loss to deduct the portion of the loss that exceeds 10 percent of income. This would mainly benefit people who have bought homes in recent years at high prices and must sell at low prices. But analysts cautioned that to compute the loss on a residence a taxpayer must take into account any deferred gain on previous homes.
One of the most expensive proposals also involves homes, costing a total of $4.6 billion in 1993 and 1994. It would allow people who have not owned a home within the last three years a 10 percent credit on the purchase price, up to $5,000, spread evenly over the two years. The purchase would have to made before Jan. 1, 1993. Any unused part of the credit could be carried forward for up to five years.
Real estate developers would regain a long-sought tax break that was removed from the tax code in 1986. It would permit developers to treat all their real estate operations as a single entity, thereby allowing them to apply losses in one area against the profits in another. As it stands now, these losses cannot be used to lower tax liability. The Administration contends that developers were unfairly caught in the general crackdown on tax shelters in the 1986 tax overhaul.
 
Cut in Capital Gains Tax
 Mr. Bush's first item on a list of proposals designed to stimulate jobs and investment is a reduction in the capital gains tax rate. It would exclude from taxation 45 percent of the capital gain on assets held for three years or more, 30 percent of the gain on an asset held two to three years, and 15 percent of the gain when the asset is held at least one year.
A 45 percent exclusion would effectively cut the levy to 15.4 percent for taxpayers now subject to a 28 percent capital gains rate and to 8 1/4 percent for those in the lowest bracket, 15 percent.
Prospects for passage of a capital gains tax cut are unclear. Administration officials emphasize statistics showing that 60 percent of the people who benefit from capital gains each year are of moderate income, but private analysts and members of Congress pointed out that most of the gains, in dollar terms, go to the wealthy.
The Administration's proposal also contains an assortment of relatively small provisions that would provide specific benefits for widely different groups of taxpayers.
 
Break for Commuters
 For New Yorkers and residents of other cities with public transit systems, for example, the Administration proposes raising to $60 a month from $21 the amount that a worker can receive tax free from an employer for commuting costs. Under current law, employees who get even a few cents more than $21 in passes, tokens or reimbursements have to count the total amount received as income. Under the proposal, the $60 would be tax free and the benefit would not be lost if a worker received more than that.
For workers in the shipbuilding and aviation industries and for people and corporations buying yachts and private aircraft, the Administration would repeal the luxury tax imposed as part of the 1990 budget agreement. The tax would remain on expensive automobiles, furs and jewelry.
To offset the revenue loss to the Treasury, the Administration would repeal a current exemption for diesel fuel used for pleasure boats, effective July 1, 1992. The tax is now 20.1 cents per gallon.

HEADLINE: Russian Offers Americans Access to K.G.B. Files

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
The chairman of the Russian parliamentary commission that oversees the archives of the K.G.B. says he is prepared to invite American historians to search for evidence that could shed light on the fate of Americans taken prisoner during the Vietnam war.
The official, Col. Gen. Dmitri Volkogonov, speaking on the eve of President Boris N. Yeltsin's trip to the United States, said the Russian president wanted to assure the United States Senate that he was responding to a request for information on reports that some Americans might have been taken to the Soviet Union. 
 "We want to be honest," said General Volkogonov, who is also an adviser to Mr. Yeltsin. He said he would support "one, two, three American historians or specialists" working with his commission in Moscow.
 
No Support for Kalugin Yet
 General Volkogonov said the commission had begun examining the K.G.B. archives but could not yet speak definitively about contacts with Americans during the Vietnam war.
But he said that so far, he had found nothing to substantiate the statements of Gen. Oleg D. Kalugin, a former K.G.B. official, that Soviet intelligence had interviewed several Americans in Vietnam as late as 1975-78, after the war had ended and all American prisoners were reported released.
"Maybe there are documents but we haven't yet found them," he said in an interview Tuesday at the Russian mission to the United Nations. "Maybe he spoke all the truth. Maybe to the contrary, he spoke untruth. Kalugin spoke by memory. I think that's not enough."
General Volkogonov is part of an advance party of Russian officials who arrived in New York seeking technical assistance and advice on how to wrench Russia toward a market economy and convert factories in the vast military-industrial complex to civilian uses. Mr. Yeltsin is to arrive tonight, attend Friday's session of the United Nations Security Council and meet President Bush on Saturday.
 
Reviewing the Records
 The author of a critical history of Stalin, General Volkogonov fell into disfavor with the military establishment before the failed August coup for saying the Communist system had been responsible for the Soviet Union's huge losses during the World War II.
General Volkogonov said he knew of a case in 1969 when four American deserters from Vietnam went to Japan and then by boat to the Soviet Far East. He said they were questioned by the K.G.B., held for several months in Moscow and then released. He did not identify the four.
He said his committee was also scouring records from the end of World War II, when as many as 22,000 Americans liberated from German prison camps were brought to the Soviet Union and repatriated, primarily through the Ukrainian port of Odessa.
In some cases, General Volkogonov said, Americans with Russian, Ukrainian or Jewish names were held prisoner by the secret police, and that three of them were released several years later in an East-West prisoner exchange.
In December, the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs appealed to Russia for more information on reports that some Americans might have been taken to the Soviet Union after the Vietnam war.
General Kalugin, the former K.G.B. official, testified for three hours before a United States Senate committee last week, saying the K.G.B. interrogated several Americans held by Vietnam in 1975-78. General Kalugin described himself as the former head of the K.G.B.'s counterintelligence operations.
The government of Vietnam has confirmed that it allowed at least one American prisoner of war to be questioned by the K.G.B. in January 1973. Vietnam identified the Soviet interrogator as Oleg Nechiporenko, who worked under General Kalugin. Mr. Nechiporenko has also said that he interviewed an American in 1973, but he has denied that Americans were questioned any later than that.
General Volkogonov seems intent on cementing a close relationship between the American and Russian governments, as Russia moves through a winter of simmering public discontent with price rises and continued shortages.
"We need not only help with bread and with money," he said. "The most important help we need is help in how we should build our market. We need technical help, we need intellectual and organizing help."
General Volkogonov criticized the West for succumbing to a "victor's complex" as the Soviet Union and the former Communist empire collapsed.
"It could turn into Pyrrhic victory," he said. "The problems in the Soviet Union now are not less dangerous. They also could be a danger to the whole world."

HEADLINE: Clinton's Accuser Dismissed From State Job in Arkansas

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Jan. 29

 BODY:
The woman who has maintained that she had an affair with Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas was dismissed from her state job today because of unexcused absences, her superior said.
The Arkansas woman, Gennifer Flowers, had been an administrative assistant for the appeal tribunal, which hears unemployment cases. Her salary was $17,000 a year. 
 "Gennifer Flowers has abandoned her job with the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal by failing to report for work or call in for three days," Don K. Barnes, chairman of the Arkansas Board of Review, said in a prepared statement. Mr. Barnes said Ms. Flowers had been absent without leave since Monday.
A spokesman for Mr. Clinton, Mike Gauldin, said the Governor had nothing to do with the dismissal. "There's a state policy that says if you don't show up for three days, you've abandoned your job," he said.
In a paid interview with a supermarket tabloid, Star, Ms. Flowers asserted last week that she had a 12-year affair with Governor Clinton, a Democratic Presidential contender. The Governor has repeatedly denied having had a sexual relationship with the woman.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Struggling to Be Heard, Kerrey Pounces on Clinton

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
In most sports, when the front-runner stumbles, his competitors gain a clear opportunity. In politics, however, it is trickier. Because when the front-runner stumbles, he takes all the television cameras with him.
This is the awkward situation now facing Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. For the last several days, he has been trying to draw Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas into a public debate on issues like health care and the environment. But as Mr. Clinton's campaign suffered under accusations that the Governor had carried on a 12-year extramarital affair, he ignored the gibes, and Mr. Kerrey's campaign suffered even more -- from lack of exposure. 
 Yesterday, Mr. Kerrey apparently decided that if the press would not take up his challenge, he would take up its.
At news conferences first in New Hampshire and later in New York, Mr. Kerrey issued his first public comments critical of Mr. Clinton's relationship with Gennifer Flowers, who says she was the Governor's lover. It was not the accusations of marital infidelity that disturbed Mr. Kerrey, though. It was the insensitive comments Mr. Clinton had made about Governor Mario M. Cuomo.
 
A Change of Tone
 Given the range of invective political opponents have been known to heap on one another, Mr. Kerrey's criticism of Mr. Clinton still left him well on the tame side of his profession. But taken together with other remarks he has made in recent days, it is an unmistakable change in tone for Mr. Kerrey, who has often seemed to be trying to run for President without hurting his rivals' feelings.
Opinion polls show that so far Mr. Kerrey has reaped no discernible benefit from Mr. Clinton's contretemps with reporters. Indeed, some polls show the Senator has lost support in recent days. With less than three weeks to go before the New Hampshire primary, the Kerrey campaign is hoping to reverse this slide through an open "engagement" with Mr. Clinton, who is still leading the Democratic field in most New Hampshire polls.
Such an engagement, aides to the Senator say, would at once help to set the two men apart, and provide Mr. Kerrey with some much-needed attention. A top aide to Mr. Kerrey explained, "We're looking for a tactical engagement that will carry over into some news cycles."
By yesterday evening, Mr. Kerrey could claim at least some modest success in this endeavor.
In tapes Ms. Flowers played for reporters on Monday, Mr. Clinton suggested that Governor Cuomo "acts like" a member of the Mafia. He later apologized for the remark, saying that he meant only to imply that Governor Cuomo "was a tough and worthy competitor."
Yesterday, Mr. Kerrey took Mr. Clinton on, saying he thought his apology "was too generic and inadequate."
It did not, he said, "express an understanding of the offense given to those who were mentioned by the tape, not just Governor Cuomo but the Italian-American population."
At an appearance yesterday afternoon in Hampton, N.H., Mr. Clinton responded to Mr. Kerrey. "Of all the things I might be faulted for in my public life," he said, "being insensitive to any kind of minority or ethnic group is not one of them, ever."
And at a fund-raising event tonight in West Orange, N.J., Governor Clinton apologized to Italian-Americans and anyone else who might have been offended by the remark. "Wounds were caused," he said. "I want to apologize again for any hurt that was caused to any Italian-American in this region, state or country or anyone else offended."
Mr. Kerrey's efforts to "engage" Mr. Clinton directly began last week. At a stop in Maine on Friday, for example, he said: "I've got big disagreements with Governor Clinton's environmental record, and significant disagreements over health care." Later that day, he said: "I'm for national health insurance and he's pretending to be."
His most recent television commercials are intended to underscore the theme of difference. In one that began airing in New Hampshire this week, Mr. Kerrey says: "The other candidates in this race have figured out that national health insurance is popular, so they're talking as if they support it. But they don't."
 
'A Counterfeit Proposal'
 "I hope," he concludes in the commercial, "that the people of New Hampshire in this campaign will not accept a counterfeit proposal." Mr. Kerrey supports a national health insurance plan that would be financed though the Federal Government.
Mr. Clinton, in contrast, often says that he supports national health care, but his proposals explicitly avoid any form of nationalized care.
At the same time that Mr. Kerrey is seeking a clear confrontation with Mr. Clinton, he is also seeking a clearer formulation of his own views. Over the last two weeks, his standard speech has been undergoing continual revisions, until now it barely resembles the original. Gone are the abstruse references to "generic technologies," and in their place are repeated invocations of the "urgency" of the task at hand.
His new speech has won good reviews at recent appearances, and aides to Mr. Kerrey say they are encouraged that after a tentative start he is finding a voice. But the campaign has yet to work out all of its glitches.
On Tuesday night, for example, Mr. Kerrey and an entourage of aides went to watch President Bush's State of the Union Message at the home of an unemployed worker in Manchester, N.H. The occasion, chronicled by several television crews, seemed like the perfect opportunity for the Senator to demonstrate his support among victims of the recession and to score some points against the Republicans.
But when asked after spending the evening with Mr. Kerrey whom he planned to vote for in the primary, the unemployed worker, Frank Adamske, a registered Republican, said: "Pat Buchanan."

HEADLINE: Dow Drops 47.18, to 3,224.96, After Remarks by Greenspan

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stock prices swung in a wide arc yesterday, ending with a sizable drop on fading hopes of further interest-rate cuts. The Dow Jones industrial average, which posted solid gains earlier in the day, plunged after remarks on the economy by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
The Dow ended the day at 3,224.96, down 47.18 points, or nearly 1.5 percent. But that was 74 points shy of the day's high, the biggest one-day spread since a 120-point swing on Nov. 15, 1990, when the market unraveled during a period when futures and options were expiring. 
 The morning began in weakness as foreign investors sold and disappeared, but then prices moved up steadily through midday, until Mr. Greenspan, speaking before the Senate Banking Committee, gave the market a large dose of disappointment, traders said.
"Mr. Greenspan's comments around midday that the economy was already in the process of stablizing and could show a reasonable improvement in the near term, created a very unfriendly bond market to provide the equity market with support," said Bernard Spilko, senior vice president of the New York branch of Bank Julius Baer.
 
No Shift by the Fed
 Mr. Greenspan said that while the economy showed no signs of revival, recent interest rate cuts should be sufficient, and that he was not inclined to relax credit again soon. Traders noted that he had said these things before, and they remarked it was more a disappointment than a surprise to hear them. After President Bush's State of the Union Message Tuesday night, many investors were expecting a shift by the Fed.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy, at 249 million shares, up from 217.2 million on Tuesday, with losing issues outpacing gainers by 1,054 to 653. The Big Board composite closed at 226.64, down 2.31.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, another blue-chip indicator, fell to 410.34, down 4.62 points, while the American Stock Exchange index fell 3.07 points, to 409.64.
Traders said no issue was protected in yesterday's market, as trading on the Nasdaq lowered its composite by 4.98 points, to 616.31, and the Russell 2,000 to 203.87, down 1.11 points.
Birinyi Associates, a research firm that tracks program trading, said two large program-trade sales entered the market near the end. The New York Stock Exchange's 50-point rule went into effect at 3:32 P.M., restricting program trading.
The two sell programs combined gave the Dow a loss of 48 points, the research firm said.
Renewed economic concerns prompted investors to buy the stocks of companies with the most consistently strong earnings, traders said.
Most of the early gains in the Dow industrials came from Procter & Gamble, up 1 1/2, to 104 1/8; Merck, down 5/8, to 152 3/8; Philip Morris, down 1/2, to 75 3/4, and Allied-Signal, up 1, to 48 1/2. Allied was helped by a Morgan Stanley recommendation.
Before the market faded, drugs, health care, tobacco and household products were up the most on the S.& P. 500 index.
 
Declines for Military Contractors
 With the expectation that military spending is about to be cut, Boeing fell 3, to 50 5/8; General Dynamics 5/8, to 56 5/8, General Electric 3/4, to 77 3/8, and Northrop 1/2, to 25 1/2.
Elsewhere in the market, Roadway Services, a company engaged in trucking and leasing, rose 4, to 71 1/4, as Dean Witter Reynolds repeated a "buy" rating, traders said. On Tuesday, the company reported a rise in its fourth-quarter earnings.
Sun Microsystems fell 4, to 29 7/8, as the company told analysts that it planned to invest $45 million in the next few quarters to insure its position in the computer market.
Storage Technology rose a further 2 7/8, to 69 3/8, as Alex. Brown & Sons reiterated a strong "buy" recommendation. On Tuesday, the company said it had $150 million in commitments for a new disk storage system.

Like President Bush, with whom he will have dinner in New York on Thursday night, Prime Minister John Major of Britain has to face an election this year in almost the worst possible economic circumstances: a recession whose end is not yet in sight.
Times have changed since the Conservatives threw over Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the opposition Labor Party abandoned the radical left-wing policy positions of the early 1980's. For the first time since then, because of the economic mess, it does not seem like a foregone conclusion that Mr. Major and his party will win the next election. 
 That is why he has not yet set a date for it, a prerogative reserved in the British system to Prime Ministers who try to pick a time when they think they have the best chance of winning. But Mr. Major is running out of time, because the term of the current Parliament will expire in early July.
For months, the public opinion polls have shown Neil Kinnock's Labor Party and the Conservatives trading places in the lead, but recently Mr. Major's party has begun easing ahead, 41 percent or so to Labor's 39.
 
Volleys of Hot Air
 With unemployment at 2.55 million, 9 percent, and stillrising, even a slim lead seems good to the Government's supporters, and many are speculating that Mr. Major will announce, traditionally a month ahead of time, that the election will be held on April 9.
"It's going to be a bloody tough fight," the Conservative Party chairman, Chris Patten, said in an interview, though he said Mr. Major could also wait a little longer. He would have had a decent chance of winning last fall, Mr. Patten thought, but he waited because "the economic forecasters were saying the economy would be much better in the spring."
All three major parties -- the Conservatives, Labor and Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats, who are showing support of about 15 percent in the polls and want a change in the election system to proportional representation, to give them more than the 22 seats they have now -- have long since begun their campaigns.
So far, Mr. Kinnock and Mr. Major have been trading volleys of hot words, since there's little either of them can do about the recession except to hope that, with inflation now under control, things will finally start turning up.
 
Clashes of the Past
 Gone are the thunderous clashes between Thatcherism and union-dominated "socialism." With the victory over Argentina in the Falkland war in 1982 and the cold war now only a distant memory, Conservative championship of a strong defense rings hollow, and Labor gave up its disastrous policy of unilateral British nuclear disarmament nearly three years ago.
Now it's Mr. Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia who are outdoing each other in unilateral nuclear disarmament, and Mr. Major is saying "Not us, yet."
He welcomed the latest American proposals in a statement issued after Mr. Bush's State of the Union Message on Tuesday night, and his spokesmen welcomed most of Mr. Yeltsin's today, but said Britain would go ahead with plans to replace most of its old nuclear deterrent with four American- designed Trident missile submarines, using British warheads. Labor says three boats will do.
Whenever the formal four-week election campaign begins, it is expected to focus on the personalities of the leading contenders for the Prime Minister's job. The imagemakers will cast Mr. Major, a plainspoken man from London's middle class, against Mr. Kinnock, a more orotund speaker from a Welsh working-class background.
 
Trading Billboards
 But there has not been much real debate about those ideas in the campaign so far, nor about how to manage better British economic growth.
Instead the parties have been throwing slogans at each other, and putting up silly billboards. Labor will drop a tax bomb on you, the Conservatives tell the voters. Labor has said it would raise taxes and social insurance payments gradually on those in the highest income brackets, from the present 40 percent to 59 percent, and lower them at the bottom end of the scale from 25 to 20 percent or below, but hasn't offered the details.
On Tuesday, Labor began putting up posters of Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont masked as "Vatman," saying the Conservatives would raise the value added tax imposed on nearly every purchase from its present level of 17 and a half percent to 22.
At Question Time in the House of Commons on Tuesday, asking Mr. Major what the Conservatives were going to do, Mr. Kinnock demanded "a straight answer to a straight question," and got one.
"There will be no VAT increase," Mr. Major said.
But Labor still described the Government's position as "fudged." VAT, which is like a sales tax, was only 8 percent on some items when the Conservatives took power in 1979.
Many Government services, from schools to subways, have become frayed at the edges, and Mr. Major's main idea for improving them is a "citizen's charter" giving taxpayers the right to demand better performance. The only real way of giving it to them, Labor counters, is to spend more public money instead of starving them and reducing taxes, as the Conservatives have done.

For the People of Groton, Peace Pays No Dividend

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GROTON, Conn., Jan. 29

 BODY:
A Baptist minister walked into Mayor Catherine J. Kolnaski's office this morning and offered to say a prayer for her. She gratefully accepted.
Across southeastern Connecticut and Rhode Island, tens of thousands of Electric Boat employees and their families had awakened to news worse than all their years working in the boom-and-bust weapons industry had prepared them for. The cold war was won, President Bush had said, and their jobs were done. 
 He didn't simply want to slow down the Seawolf program, the next generation of nuclear attack submarines. He wanted to kill it.
In this corner of New England, where the nation's nuclear submarines have been built ever since the Nautilus program in the 1950's, the Seawolf represented not only the next generation of Electric Boat workers, but the next generation of employment. Electric Boat, its contractors and the businesses that depend on their employees make up 82 percent of New London County's $2 billion payroll.
 
Losing the Future
 Electric Boat has a backlog of 13 other submarines, including the last six Tridents, so there will be work here for at least a few more years. But the Seawolf was the future.
"It's pretty somber in there, pretty somber," Tommy Algiere, a machinist with 10 years at Electric Boat, said this afternoon as he waited in a parking lot for his brother and sister-in-law, who also work at the shipyard, for his ride home to Westerly, R.I.
"If you were smart," he said, "you'd quit now and go out and get a job while they're still there."
The budget released by the White House today proposes to kill two $2 billion Seawolf submarines that have already been approved, ending what only two years ago was to be a 29-submarine construction program. A first Seawolf is under construction at the Electric Boat shipyard on the Thames River here.
Congressional representatives from Connecticut and Rhode Island, where Electric Boat employs 4,000 people at Quonset Point, vowed today to restore those two submarines, and to fight for as many more as possible, to keep Electric Boat's yards open.
 
Victory and Then Defeat
 "The irony is that the first notice these people are getting from the peace dividend is a pink slip," Representative John F. Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, said at a news conference after he and Representative Sam Gejdenson, a Democrat who represents eastern Connecticut, met with union officials and local leaders.
Asked when Electric Boat would have to close its yards if the Seawolf were killed, a spokesman for the company, Neil D. Ruenzel, said that prospect was "unacceptable."
"Electric Boat is not going to lie down and die," he said. "We're going to fight."
Rumors of layoffs are a constant in the arms industry. Only last week, United Technologies, Connecticut's largest private employer, announced a reorganization that will eliminate some 6,400 jobs. Electric Boat, a division of General Dynamics, has also had its ups and downs. Employment, which peaked in the 1980's at 18,000 in Groton, is already down to 15,000, and is projected to hit 11,000 by 1996, even if Electric Boat wins more Seawolf contracts.
But the idea that the entire shipyard could be threatened, so soon after the glory years of the Reagan Administration's military buildup, has created enormous anxiety.
"The good news is that if Electric Boat gets one sub contract a year for the next five years and stays in business, we lose only 7,000 jobs," said William D. Moore, president of the Chamber of Commerce of Southeastern Connecticut. "If Electric Boat were not to get any submarine contracts, we're expecting a total employment loss of 27,000 by 1997, out of a county work force of 125,000."
For Groton, the loss of Electric Boat would be devastating. The shipyard is not only its largest taxpayer, but also the largest customer of its municipal utility, paying $9 million for water and electricity. A closed shipyard would saddle residents with both higher property taxes and higher electric rates.
 
Pride and Anger
 New London County is also home to the Navy submarine base, the Coast Guard Academy and the Naval Underwater Systems Center research laboratory, and all the businesses that depend on them. Today many people expressed pride in the region's military contribution and anger at how summarily it seemed to be ended.
But they were also frustrated that more had not been done to diversify the region's economy to make it less dependent on Pentagon spending.
Local chief executives have been meeting to discuss the issue, and groups have been formed to promote diversification, Mayor Kolnaski said.
Electric Boat itself has taken one step, with the help of a $1.5 million grant: starting a career transition center that began last summer by teaching laid-off workers how to look for new jobs. A second center, for non-Electric Boat workers, opened in January.
"We told the people last summer, they were among the lucky ones," said Richard Flath, a personnel consultant who helped train the people let go by Electric Boat. "If a couple hundred people are laid off, that's one thing. A couple of thousand people, that's another. This is a small area."

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 29

 BODY:
The Occidental Petroleum Corporation today reported a fourth-quarter profit of $6 million, compared with a $2 billion loss a year earlier when it began remaking itself after its former chairman, Armand Hammer, died. The quarterly profit equaled 2 cents a share. The results came on revenues of $2.6 billion, down 25 percent from $3.5 billion in the final period of 1990. The lower revenues reflected the sale of some company assets. Occidental's chairman, Ray R. Irani, said the company had nearly completed its restructuring and had reduced its debt by $2.6 billion of the target $3 billion. He said the weak economy and low energy prices had hurt the Los Angeles-based oil giant.

Patch of Mid-America Not Impressed by Bush Talk

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAK PARK, Ill., Jan. 29

 BODY:
Theoretically, this quaint patch of middle America should be a Republican President's dream. It is 4.5 square miles of well-educated, white-collar, voting literate types who read the Op-Ed pages, who can cite Keynesian theory and who keep up with the minutest changes in the tax law.
When President Bush speaks of lowering the capital gains tax or making it easier to withdraw from individual retirement accounts, he is talking to Oak Park. 
 And so, during perhaps the most important speech of Mr. Bush's term, nearly every television set on the 200 block of South Elmwood Avenue was tuned to the State of the Union Message. And those who were not watching were listening from their car radios on their way home from the office.
Joseph Norton, a partner in a Chicago law firm, was looking for corporate tax incentives for job training in a field where he says skilled support jobs go wanting. Across the street, Karla Nacion, a nurse, was looking for a national health care plan.
What they heard, they said, was vague and predictable and not particularly reassuring. Many said they turned off their television sets feeling as bewildered about the future health of the economy as they had when the evening began.
"Platitudes," muttered William Brace, a college professor, as he sat on his sofa watching President Bush talk of lifting the nation out of hard times "inch by inch."
To look at the 19th-century victorians and neatly shoveled walks on Elmwood Avenue, one would never know there was a recession in the country, and most people's anger about the economy, while pointed, is mostly second-hand.
But even in this well-to-do suburb of 53,000 people where everyone has food on the table and the luxury of worrying about the Amazon rain forest, the troubles of the economy have hit home.
Mrs. Nacion's husband, Robert, a pharmacist, was astonished to find himself out of work for much of last year in a field where he thought employment was assured. After quitting his job because of its poor hours, it took him seven months to find another one.
Rand Gerald moved in with the Braces last May after he lost his job as a systems engineer in a company takeover. He said he had thought he would be staying a couple of weeks. But it has been seven months and he is still there and still jobless.
The day after watching the President's address, people like Mr. Gerald and Mr. Nacion said the economic picture looked no better.
"My expectations are lower today than they were yesterday," Mr. Gerald, 46 years old and a lifelong Republican, said. "It sounds as if it's going to be political business as usual. The Democrats and the Republicans are going to spend the next six months fighting each other. They're all basically the same. Neither side is looking out for what's best for the country."
Those who have managed to escape the tendrils of the recession say they feel its effects through young relatives looking for jobs or clients pulling back. They also say they are concerned that the recession may reach them yet.
Some residents say they worry that their children may not be able to live as well as they do. Many of them say their children cannot afford to buy a house in their own neighborhood, where the average house costs $170,000.
"The economy is dead in the water," Mr. Norton said while watching the President on television. "I want to give the man credit for having a positive approach. But I have the feeling he's another Mike Bilandic. That's the Chicago Mayor who sat in his office and tried to tell people it wasn't snowing."
That is not how his neighbor, Paul Nowicki, saw the speech. Mr. Nowicki, a 22-year-old solicitor at an investment banking company who lives with his parents, said he felt good because at least he has a job. Where his neighbors saw shameless flag-waving Tuesday night, he saw hope and optimism.
"I know the President was trying to bring back the memories of past wars and bring out that red, white and blue spirit," Mr. Nowicki said. "My biggest fear is that Congress is not going to cooperate with him."
 
Support for Military Cuts
 The President generally found support among Democrats and Republicans, those hurting and those thriving, for proposing limited cutbacks on military spending and corporate tax incentives for research and development and equipment purchases.
But most people doubted that quick fixes would be enough. Those with children said a few tax credits or exemptions would not make them change their spending habits and were generally leery of what they consider economic patchwork.
"He's still doing what Reagan was doing, and that's how we got where we are," said Mrs. Nacion.
Mr. Brace could not keep from yelling "balderdash" at his television set as the President congratulated himself and the country on winning the cold war. "We've got five new nations that have atomic bombs," Mr. Brace said. "This is an improvement?"
Through the more than 50 minutes of televised speech and applause, people on Elmwood Avenue kept looking for glimpses of the education President or the kinder, gentler President promised in the last election. They said they could not find him.
"Not one word about the homeless," said Barbara Mullarkey, a home economist and writer.
Many residents said the speech had more sentiment that substance.
"It was a well-crafted speech and had all the emotional buzzwords, but I don't feel he's added anything," said Mr. Brace's wife, Pamela, who runs a secretarial service company. "He just woke up to the fact that we have a crisis. Now I think we're headed in the right direction, but not fast enough. We need a Band-Aid until we can have surgery."

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Won't Back Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Saying he expected the economy to recover in the second quarter, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress today that he did not think the White House and Congress needed to cut taxes to lift the economy.
A day after President Bush disclosed a tax-cut package to stimulate the economy, Mr. Greenspan, the Government official with the most influence over the economy, told the Senate Banking Committee that he feared that all the competing stimulus proposals now circulating on Capitol Hill would be added together and end up pushing up the budget deficit and long-term interest rates. 
 He commended the tax-cut proposals made by the President in his State of the Union Message on Tuesday for being restrained but he clearly said he did not think it wise to try to enact a tax-cut package at all.
 
Turmoil in Markets
 Mr. Greenspan insisted, as he has in other recent Congressional testimony, that the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cuts should suffice to pull the economy out of recession.
His remarks created turmoil in the stock and bond markets as traders' hopes for still lower interest rates appeared to fade. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average lost a midday gain and tumbled to close down 47.18 points. Bonds did a similar turnabout, ending the day with a large selloff. [Pages D12 and D18.]
Speaking in his customary circumspect, non-confrontational manner, Mr. Greenspan took pains not to criticize the President's proposals in particular. On Jan. 10, in his last testimony before Congress, Mr. Greenspan said the Federal Reserve's recent interest rates cuts were enough "by any historical standard" to move the economy forward. Today he said "this economy can move out of this extreme lethargy with monetary policy alone."
 
Forecasts an Upturn
 When Senator Richard C. Shelby, a Democrat from Alabama, asked him whether he foresaw an upturn in the second quarter, the Fed chairman said: "Yes, I do. I think my best judgment as to the forces that are now beginning to emerge suggests that."
He cautioned that his forecast was tentative. Indeed, in the middle of last year, he predicted a substantial upturn that failed to materialize. He said today that this recession was somewhat unpredictable because unlike previous postwar downturns, real estate values remained stubbornly low in many states and many banks remained reluctant to lend money. Still, he said, "as far as I'm concerned, I would expect the economy to quicken its pace."
Mr. Greenspan, who is 65 years old, was appearing at a hearing on his nomination to a second four-year term. Confirmation is widely expected.
Although the tone remained respectful, Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., a Michigan Democrat, led a barrage of criticisms from Democrats and Republican committee members, who said the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts had been too little and too late to help lift the nation out of recession. The Fed most recently made a significant cut in interest rates on Dec. 20 in an effort to give a real spark to the economy.
 
'Need Something More'
 "We need something more than we've already done in the way of monetary policy," Senator Riegle said. "I am very concerned about waiting any longer to see some bounce."
But Mr. Greenspan said he feared that new interest rate cuts could backfire by raising inflationary fears and long-term interest rates.
Borrowers continue to face a shortage of credit, he said. But he added that the shortage might begin to ease soon because the amount of loans not being repaid at banks has begun to "flatten." He said banks were wary to increase loans until they were confident the loans on their books would stop hemmorrhaging.
In response to repeated questions from the senators on his views about using tax cuts and other fiscal means to stimulate the economy, Mr. Greenspan said his big concern was that such measures would expand the budget deficit. The deficit, he said, was cutting into private savings and investment.
"The concern that I have is that, in the process of trying to implement any of these programs into a general agreement that can pass both houses," he said, the Congress and the President would not average the programs but would "add them up, and that would concern me because I do think that would create a long-term problem for the economy, which would immediately be perceived in the markets, which would move long-term interest rates back up."
Trying to moderate those remarks, he praised President Bush's tax-cut proposals for being restrained and added: 'My main concern about a limited package is it will not remain limited. If it were limited, then I really have no strong objections toward it."
In testimony on other topics, Mr. Greenspan criticized proposals to allow banks to reduce their capital ratios, suggesting that such a move would weaken banks and violate international agreements. Many bankers and legislators have called for weakening capital standards because they believe it will encourage banks to lend more and help the nation out of recession.
But he called on Congress to make it easier for banks to increase their capital. He specifically backed the Bush Administration's proposals -- which Congress rejected last year -- to allow banks to operate across state lines and to engage in commercial and investment banking. He said these measures would help strong banks increase their capital by making it easier for them to increase profits and sell equity.
He said that a tax credit of up to $5,000 for first-time home buyers, which President Bush proposed in his speech Tuesday, should spur homebuilding -- and perhaps raise depressed real estate values.
The only two proposals made by the President that Mr. Greenspan singled out for praise were lowering the capital gains tax and restoring certain tax breaks to help real estate developers. Mr. Greenspan has supported both in the past.
Mr. Greenspan said he did not see how commercial banks and insurance companies could get back to full strength and fulfill their role in helping the economy "until this real estate issue is resolved."

HEADLINE: Crises Surmounted, Balloon Ready for Global Trip

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
For six anxious hours Tuesday night, a platoon of technicians, engineers and master balloonists in Akron, Ohio, wrestled with cables, machinery and tank trucks of helium gas as they inflated Earthwinds, whose crew hopes to be the first in history to circle the earth in a balloon.
After surmounting several heart-stopping technical crises, the team pronounced the $5 million balloon inflated and nearly ready to begin its perilous voyage. 
 The empty lifting balloon, made of gossamer-thin polyethylene film, was first unpacked from its crate and laid out on the ground outside the huge Loral Defense Systems Air Dock, where components of the complex Earthwinds flight system are being assembled. With a team of meteorologists watching for any change in the weather that could produce dangerous gusts, the technicians opened valves that sent 220,000 cubic feet of helium roaring up two flailing fill tubes to the top of the balloon.
Near midnight, the balloon's lift approached 20,000 pounds and it began tugging skyward. But by then the big tractor holding it down, a 30-foot-high front-end loader, was struggling to stay in place. Technicians loaded tons of concrete and scrap steel into the tractor's scoop, said Larry Newman of Scottsdale, Ariz., captain of the balloon flight, but the balloon still threatened to defeat the tractor's hydraulic system and pull the scoop upward. Only after technicians welded a steel beam between the tractor and the scoop, thereby immobilizing it, was the wayward balloon brought to heel.
 
Nine Feet to Spare
 Had the scoop been forced upward, the balloon tethered to it would have risen enough that it might have brushed against the hangar roof while being rolled in, possibly causing irreparable damage. As it is, clearance between the top of the balloon and the roof of the cavernous Air Dock is only about nine feet.
At another point in the inflation, a kink formed in one of the polyethylene fill tubes, and the crew feared that the tube might rip open under the pressure of the gas pouring from the tank truck. Just in time, the kink was straightened out.
As dawn broke yesterday, Earthwind's lifting balloon had been hauled into the Air Dock hangar to await launching, nearly touching the 200-foot high roof.
"It stands absolutely motionless -- elegant and shimmering," Mr. Newman said. "In all my years of ballooning, I've never seen anything so beautiful."
 
Flight May Begin Sunday
 If the weather is favorable, Earthwinds could begin its 22,000-mile flight as early as Sunday. Aboard, besides Mr. Newman, will be Maj. Gen. Vladimir Dzhanibekov, a decorated senior astronaut in the Russian air force, and Don Moses, an American builder, mechanic and pilot. The crew plans to ascend to 35,000 feet and enter the eastward jet stream which, at speeds that may exceed 200 miles an hour, is expected to carry them to the Arctic, across northern Europe, south toward the Persian Gulf, then northward again, across Russia and Siberia.
The innovative Earthwinds system consists of a lifting balloon, in which helium will expand at cruising altitude to 1.1 million cubic feet; a pressurized crew capsule with advanced communication and support systems, and a 100-foot-diameter "anchor balloon" suspended beneath the capsule. Compressed air pumped into the anchor during the flight will add weight to the system at times when the balloon would otherwise rise uncontrollably, forcing the crew to release precious helium.
With the launch imminent, the crew yesterday began stowing food and survival equipment, cleaning the craft's gasoline tanks, tightening seals and readying rigging cables. "It's been a long wait," Mr. Newman said, "but it's almost over."

HEADLINE: Transit Authority and Union Reach Tentative Accord on Contract

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
The Transit Authority and the union representing 32,000 New York City transit workers announced last night that they had reached a tentative agreement on a new contract that calls for a raise of 4.5 percent this year and an additional 2 percent next year.
Subway conductors and motormen, token clerks, bus drivers, maintenance workers and other unionized transit employees have been working without a new contract for nine months. The agreement is complex; it covers a total of 38 months and is retroactive to May 1991. 
 Among other things, the settlement includes a $1,000 payment to each transit worker to cover inflation since last May, said officials of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Transit Authority's parent agency.
M.T.A. officials said the agreement would not affect the $1.25 subway and bus fare or the Transit Authority's $3.6 billion budget for 1992. They said the increased costs of the contract's first two years would be offset by savings from various contract concessions -- including changes in the wage scale and in compensation for workers injured on the job -- and savings in pension contributions.
 
Health Care a Critical Issue
 The tentative contract calls for additional negotiations on productivity savings, with transit workers to receive money in May 1993 if such savings are realized. The first portion of any productivity savings would go to the transit workers, up to an amount equal to 1 percent of the union's total wage package -- which would be about $14 million right now, M.T.A. officials said.
All savings beyond that would be split this way: one-third would be used to offset any deficits in the Transit Authority's budget; one-third would be used to enhance subway and bus service, and one-third would be go to the members of the transit workers' union as bonuses.
Sonny Hall, the president of the Transport Workers Union, Local 100, said in a statement last night that the union's executive board had approved the tentative contract. He said it could take as much as six weeks for the union's membership to vote on the agreement by a mail ballot.
Mr. Hall said that the most critical issue in the negotiations was health care, and that management had agreed to maintain existing levels.
 
Balancing Wage Increases
 "This contract was, by far, the most difficult and complicated labor agreement in my 15 years of contract negotiations," he said in the statement. "The economy as well as the operating deficit of the authorities presented severe pressure on the negotiation process."
Mr. Hall said he would not discuss any additional details about the agreement until his members had had the chance to see the tentative contract and vote on it.
The M.T.A. chairman, Peter E. Stangl, said in a statement that he believed the settlement was "fair to our customers, fair to our employees and fair to the taxpayers who support the M.T.A." The settlement must also go to the M.T.A. board for its decision.
Officials said the contract's net increase in cost to the Transit Authority would be 3.1 percent. Much of the cost of the wage increases would be offset by changes in the wage scale, in the way the Transit Authority pays workers who are hurt on the job and in recalculations by the city of interest rates that will result in savings in the authority's pension contributions.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Tells Russians of Arms Cutbacks

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Within hours of President Bush's announcement on Tuesday of deep cuts in America's military spending, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia went on television today to outline sharp arms cutbacks under way in the former Soviet armed forces.
Mr. Yeltsin's program was in large part a summary of military reductions either previously pledged by Moscow or necessitated by the economic and political crisis in what is now the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
 It included details of some arms programs that have been curtailed or cancelled by Moscow, such as production of strategic bombers and long-range cruise missiles. Mr. Yeltsin also said proposals were being readied to reduce strategic arsenals on the American and Russian sides to 2,500 or even 2,000 nuclear warheads each, well below levels required by existing treaties or proposed by President Bush.
In his address, Mr. Yeltsin also spoke for strategic weapons deployed in Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, underscoring the agreement among the former Soviet republics that their strategic weapons would remain under unified command.
 
Open to Further Talks
 Mr. Yeltsin further expressed readiness to discuss a wide variety of other reductions, ranging from a curb on development or elimination of various kinds of cruise missiles to a halt in submarine patrols to a joint global air defense system to replace the strategic defense initiative of the United States.
The United States is not likely at this time to discuss sharing the technology of the strategic defense initiative or curbs on submarine patrols, which have traditionally been central to American deterrence. But mutual interest in reducing arms spending could lead to various further agreements.
In an interview with ABC News on Saturday, Mr. Yeltsin said Russia would no longer target its missiles on the United States. In his televised statement today, the Russian leader said only that weapons remaining in the two countries "should not be aimed at American and Russian targets respectively."
Each president has praised the other's initiative and pledged to pursue the dismantling of cold war arsenals further when they meet Saturday in Camp David.
 
Yeltsin on Tour
 Mr. Yeltsin leaves Thursday on a trip that also includes visits to London, the United Nations and Ottawa. It will be his first major foreign tour since the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia assumed the bulk of the superpower's military legacy, and security issues are certain to be central in his talks.
To Western diplomats in Moscow, Mr. Yeltsin's address was significant less for any specific disarmament proposals than for the demonstration by the Russian president that he was now the heir to all the disarmament functions previously performed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Much of Mr. Yeltsin's address was in fact a reaffirmation of pledges made by Mr. Gorbachev last October, when President Bush and the Soviet leader both announced sweeping arms cuts, and of other obligations undertaken by Mr. Gorbachev.
 
Emphasizing Who's in Charge
 Earlier this week, Mr. Yeltsin made an unannounced visit to the Black Sea Fleet, which had been a bone of contention between Ukraine and Russia. Like today's speech, that visit was viewed in part as an attempt to affirm Russia's claim to the unity of the former Soviet military under the formal aegis of the Commonwealth of Independent States and under the specific jurisdiction of Russia as the primary heir to the former Soviet state.
The latter role will be underscored at the United Nations when Mr. Yeltsin appears before the Security Council, where Russia now occupies the permanent seat held by the Soviet Union.
Today, Mr. Yeltsin met with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who is in Moscow for the Middle East peace conference. At a news conference later, both Mr. Baker and the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, confirmed that the statements by the American and Russian presidents had been discussed by them in advance.
"Both presidents have made far-reaching suggestions and far-reaching proposals that I think reflect the new political realities and changed circumstances and conditions with respect to relations between the United States and Russia," Mr. Baker said.
 
Communiques Less Grim
 Among the signs of the new realities was the fact that the coordinated statements no longer resembled the painstaking arms-controls agreements of past years, in which the two superpowers negotiated cautiously balanced arms reductions.
Instead, the speeches in Washington and Moscow were broadly coordinated statements of separate reductions prompted by the collapse of the Communist empire, coupled with some proposals for reciprocal gestures.
Russia in particular has been compelled to reduce arms procurement sharply because of its extreme economic crisis, and Mr. Yeltsin has already announced severe cutbacks in arms procurement to concentrate military spending on the social needs of soldiers.
"The leadership of Russia confirms its commitment to the policy of radical cuts in nuclear arms, insuring maximum safety of nuclear arms and all installations related to their development, production and exploitation," Mr. Yeltsin declared at the start of his televised address.
He said Russia was preparing an initative to create an international agency that would monitor nuclear arms reductions and eventually control the production of nuclear fuels and the dumping of nuclear wastes.
Mr. Yeltsin reported that 1,250 strategic warheads had already been removed from stand-by alert and that 130 intercontinental silos were being dismantled. Six submarines are being stripped of nuclear launchers.
In addition, he said, the Soviet Union was halting the production of two heavy bombers, the Blackjack and the Bear-H, and of long-range air- and sea-borne cruise missiles.
Expanding on Mr. Gorbachev's pledges in October to exceed limits set by the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, Mr. Yeltsin said Russia intended to reach agreed levels within three years, instead of the seven envisioned by the treaty.
Mr. Yeltsin also outlined reductions in tactical weapons, which both the United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to largely eliminate. He said Russia had stopped production of most short-range nuclear weapons and was reducing stockpiles of various weapons.
Mr. Yeltsin also reiterated that the armed forces would be reduced by 700,000, to 3 million.
Arms-control experts noted that this and some other steps reflected internal political and economic realities. Most Soviet submarines are currently in port, they said, Ukraine has insisted on removing nuclear weapons from its soil and intercontinental missiles in other republics were probably already off alert.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Coverage of Smoking Linked to Tobacco Ads

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
A new report by researchers at the University of Michigan says that magazines that carry cigarette advertising have consistently restricted or softened coverage of the dangers of smoking, possibly out of fear of economic reprisals by cigarette manufacturers.
The study, which appears in today's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, examined 99 American magazines published from 1959 to 1986. Although other reports have offered anecdotal evidence about the relationship between cigarette advertising and the coverage of tobacco as a health issue, the new report is one of the most comprehensive statistical looks at the subject. 
 The researchers tracked annual cigarette advertising revenues for the magazines and correlated dependence on cigarette ad revenues with the presence or absence of articles on smoking and health in each magazine. They found that magazines that carried no cigarette ads were 40 percent more likely to have articles on the risks of smoking.
 
 
'Statistically Significant'
 "We have found that the higher the percentage of cigarette advertising revenues, the lower the likelihood that a magazine will publish an article on the dangers of smoking," said Prof. Kenneth E. Warner, chairman of public health policy and administration at the University of Michigan and an author of the report. "That is a statistically significant finding."
Even so, Mr. Warner said his research did not prove that advertising pressures were actually the cause of such modified coverage.
The journal of medicine article does not identify any of the magazines studied, though it does say that the correlation was highest among women's magazines.
Mr. Warner said a "wealth of anecdotal evidence" had convinced him that they were often influenced by advertisers. "Almost all the journalists who will speak to me off the record will acknowledge that this phenomenon exists," Mr. Warner said. "If they speak on the record, they will deny it."
 Donald Kummerfeld, president of the Magazine Publishers of America, disagreed. "It is not surprising at all that there is this statistical correlation between the editorial content of magazines that accept advertising and magazines that don't," he said. "Magazines that write about health, fitness and nutrition generally do not accept tobacco advertising and never have."
But the report specificially mentions women's magazines, many of which accept cigarette advertising and also cover health issues.
Of the 164 magazines tracked by the magazine publishers' group in 1991, 58 had no cigarette ads, 36 had fewer than 10 pages a year and 70 carried tobacco advertising.
Moreover, Mr. Kummerfeld asserted, the dangers of smoking have been so well publicized that most magazines no longer write about the issue. He also pointed out that tobacco advertising had declined.
In an interview yesterday, Grace Mirabella, founder and publication director of Mirabella magazine, said that when she was editor in chief of Vogue she had been asked to "soft-pedal a little bit" on health articles that mentioned the negative effects of smoking, but that she was never asked to withhold an article or alter it substantially.
Dr. Susan Okie, a physician and a correspondent for The Washington Post who now lives in Nairobi, Kenya, said she had had "a couple of run-ins" at Cosmopolitan when she was writing a question-and-answer column from 1980 to 1991. They came up in connection with her inclusion of smoking in a list of risk factors for heart disease.
"One time they sent me the copy to check because they didn't want to offend their advertisers, and we had a big fight," she said.
In addition to Professor Warner, the authors of the report are Catherine G. McLaughlin, associate professor of health services management and policy at the University of Michigan, and Linda M. Goldenhar, research fellow of the University of Michigan Institute of Gerontology.

HEADLINE: A Tiny Gain For Economy Last Quarter

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The nation's economy all but came to a standstill in the final quarter of 1991 after two quarters of small advances, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Neither fears of renewed recession nor the Administration's hopes of early recovery were confirmed by the report.
"Economic activity was essentially flat in the fourth quarter," said J. Antonio Villamil, the Commerce Department's chief economist. 
 The nation's gross domestic product -- goods and services produced inside United States borders -- edged up a tiny three-tenths of a percent in real terms in the fourth quarter after rising at 1.8 percent rate in the summer and a 1.4 percent rate in the spring.
 
Decline for Year
 For all of 1991, because of a first-quarter plunge at a 2.5 percent rate, G.D.P. was down seven-tenths of a percent. That was the first yearly decline since 1982, when G.D.P. fell three times as much.
"The economy has shifted into neutral, not reverse," said Roger Brinner, chief economist at Data Resources/McGraw-Hill.
The financial markets shrugged off the fall's statistically insignificant rise in G.D.P., which was about what the Blue Chip consensus of 48 economic forecasters had predicted earlier this month.
A spurt in exports and housing, Mr. Villamil said, basically offset a drop in spending by consumers, commercial builders and the Federal Government.
And a much-feared pileup in business inventories, which could have inflated fourth-quarter G.D.P. and touched off a correspondingly sharp production decline in the current quarter, turned out to be smaller than many economists had been expecting.
The report buttressed the view among a majority of economists that the economy hit bottom last spring. But until growth is brisk enough to ease unemployment and lift incomes significantly, most Americans are not likely to care about the technical distinction between recession and recovery.
"We're still in a growth recession, although we're not in a business cycle recession," said Geoffrey H. Moore, director of the International Center for Business Cycle Research.
G.D.P. has recovered a little more than half of the $78 billion -- in 1987 constant dollars -- drop from its pre-recession peak, and industrial production and business sales are above their levels last spring. But employment and income are barely higher.
"Anytime you have growth of less than 2.5 percent, some regions of the country and some industries are declining and unemployment is rising," said Alan C. Lerner, chief economist at the Bankers Trust Company.
 
Revision Likely
 In any case, the initial snapshot of the economy at the end of the year is likely to be revised at the end of February and again in March. And if the revisions fall within the range of past adjustments, the Commerce Department's release said, the final estimate could show G.D.P. rising at a 1.3 percent annual rate or slipping as much as two-tenths of a percent.
The brightest spot in the report -- from the point of view of consumers and investors, anyway -- was a sharp decline in inflation to a 1.7 percent annual rate, a rate reminiscent of the Eisenhower era. Lower inflation, among other things, helped lift Americans' after-tax incomes a tad in real terms. And saving, which had dipped last summer when consumers were still relatively optimistic, picked up too.
But when it came to spending money, consumers, who account for two-thirds of the economy, were in a funk. Total consumer spending, which is divided almost equally between goods and services, dipped at a 1.1 percent annual rate. But a truer measure of the scared mood of consumers -- and retailers' distress -- was the steep cutback of spending on all kinds of goods, from clothes to cars and other big-ticket items. Americans spent more only on life's necessities -- housing, utilities and medical care.
Government, which accounts for a fifth of the United States economy, also turned more tight-fisted last quarter. Outlays by state and local government, where fiscal distress has been acute, were flat. Washington slashed spending on military and other goods and services at a 14.1 percent rate -- the second consecutive large decline.
 
Capital Spending Pared
 Business continued to pare back capital spending, for the fourth quarter in a row. But the modest decline, at a 2.4 percent annual rate, masked another steep drop in business building and a small rise, the second straight, on spending on new equipment.
Construction of new shopping malls and offices and factories has been hit hard by sky-high vacancy rates as well as by bankers who have lost their enthusiasm for real estate lending. At the same time, ferocious competition at home and abroad is spurring business, despite the squeeze on profits, to seek ways to spur productivity.
Inventories climbed in the fourth quarter after a year of deep cuts, rising at a $3.6 billion annual rate (in 1987 dollars). Much of that increase, said Edward E. Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence, was unplanned. Detroit, for one, is planning to pare inventories on dealers' lots this winter.

 Housing, helped by the lowest mortgage rates in nearly two decades, jumped at a 10.6 annual rate, nearly matching its summer gain. Apartments, which are nearly as overbuilt as offices, are still slumping. But starts of single-family homes, now 41 percent over their low last January, have risen in each of the last three months.
The biggest lift for the economy, however, came from an export surge. The volume of exports rose at a 15.4 percent annual rate. "It's just sensational," said H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. Overseas sales have been rising at double-digit rates for the last five years and America's trade deficit, not even counting the large and growing surplus in services, has shrunk by a third.
Imports fell at a 2 percent rate after pouring in at a 22 percent annual rate last summer, when retailers were still expecting consumers to keep spending. The decline in imports, which reflects the weakness in final sales, is probably one reason for the small increase in inventories in the fall.
"If imports had climbed the way they had been, they all would have ended up in inventories," Mr. Yardeni said. Foreign producers of consumer goods, in other words, are sharing some of the pain of declining sales.
Looking ahead, the Administration and most private economists are predicting, some say hoping for, a modest recovery this year. The Office of Management and Budget, which released the Administration's 1993 budget yesterday, is counting on 2.2 percent growth in 1992 and 3 percent growth in 1993.
"As far as I am concerned, I would expect the economy to quicken its pace," said the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, before the Senate Banking Committee yesterday, "but I am spending a great deal of time watching rather than forecasting."
Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation, said, "The recovery is still six months away -- as it has been for a while." Mr. Soss and most other forecasters expect the economy to revive slowly, with the current quarter looking much like the last one.

Remembering an Embodiment of Small-Town Life

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

DATELINE: CHESTER, Conn.

 BODY:
There is an emptiness lately in this waterside village steeped in its own past, where the trim 18th-century cottages seem plucked from the pages of a storybook and where immortality, at least in the architectural sense, does seem possible.
It is all because of one resident, James L. Grote, who died this month after living here for almost 101 years. A man blessed with a booming voice and a seemingly unquenchable thirst for public life, Mr. Grote became a municipal one-man band, holding an array of official and unofficial positions that ranged from fire chief -- a job he retained for almost half a century -- to front-row worshiper at the local Catholic church. 
 "He represented what we all think of small-town New England being, in a nice way," said Tom Perry, a fifth-generation resident who owns an antiques shop called One of a Kind. "I think everybody's still in shock that he's gone. I keep expecting him to walk through that door."
Mr. Grote was the town's postmaster for 35 years and served as fire marshal for 69 years. For 46 years, he was president of the Agricultural-Mechanical Society, which runs the Chester Fair, one of Connecticut's largest country fairs. And his life, in other ways, was a historical marker for the town: he was the first baby boy to be baptized at his church, was enrolled in Chester's first kindergarten class in 1896 and was a member of Chester High School's first graduating class in 1909.
Day to day, residents were accustomed to seeing Mr. Grote, steering his bright red Ford through the streets or walking briskly down the sidewalks. He was vigilant about inspecting property for fire hazards practically until the day he died, and he kept routines, like raising the American flag on a flagpole in front of his neat white cottage, just about as long.
His death has saddened the town, already huddled against the chill of winter and the disappointments of a battered regional economy. Chester is a place where crime is so occasional that the five local police officers all work part time, and problems like hunger and homelessness are all but nonexistent.
"It kind of makes you realize your own mortality," Mr. Perry said. "When you looked at Jim, you thought, well, maybe I can live forever."
In May, the town held a party for Mr. Grote at the Chester Meeting House, which predated the guest of honor by less than a century. Mr. Grote, the marshal, who for years traveled with a Dalmatian by his side, was greeted with two cakes supporting 100 flaming candles.
"I guess you take people who are around so long for granted," said Dawn Burr, president of the Chester Historical Society, which Mr. Grote also headed at one time but for just two years. "He was there in evidence. You'd meet him at the post office. If you went into Robbie's, he'd be there having a cup of coffee. He loved to talk about himself, and you really didn't mind because he was such an interesting character."
Mr. Grote, who participated in a bucket brigade as a schoolboy, helped form the Chester Hose Company in 1912. The fire company, now in a modern brick building, still maintains a red hose cart, the kind once pulled to a burning building by horses, that was bought by Mr. Grote in 1924.
In Mr. Grote's lifetime, Chester saw many an industry come and go. Now a popular weekend destination for New Yorkers, the town, which is on the western bank of the Connecticut River, clings fiercely to its independence.
Residents are pleased that they are not deluged with tourists like nearby Essex and will tell outsiders proudly that Federal judges and prominent television journalists have houses here, but then they refuse to say exactly where. The town is popular with artists and is home to several well-known groups, including the National Theater of the Deaf.
When the town was incorporated in 1836, Pattaconk Creek, flowing through its center, was deep enough that tall ships could sail straight up to Main Street. That made Chester a manufacturing center for items made from ivory, like knitting needles, hooks-and-eyes and other essentials of 19th-century life.
Although most of those factories have disappeared, Chester until recently remained prominent for knitting-needle production as the home of the Susan Bates Company. But the company, a division of Coats Viyella, has announced plans to move to South Carolina in March, meaning a 118,000-square-foot office and factory complex on the edge of town will be vacant. About 75 jobs will be lost in Chester, said Dennis Tar, the company's general manager.
The complex is not the only building to be emptied this year. The Chester Bank's longtime headquarters, a yellow brick miniature Monticello, is locked up and for sale. The bank was absorbed into another bank that has branches elsewhere around town, said Bettie Perreault, the First Selectman of Chester.
And front yards bristle with "House for Sale" signs, evidence that some of the weekend dwellers, as well as year-round residents, are having trouble making ends meet.
Knowing the history of the town makes some people here optimistic.
"I remember people 20 years ago saying Chester is dead, it's never coming back," Mrs. Perreault said. "But I think this area will probably rejuvenate early, simply because it is a wonderful place to live." Even if one doesn't make it to 100.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: New Hampshire;
For Roomful of Faithful, Bush's Talk Meets Need

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LACONIA, N.H., Jan. 29

 BODY:
The blue Bush placards and brochures were stacked in the kitchen, and the 20-odd people gathered in Newbold and Nancy LeRoy's living room to watch the State of the Union Message Tuesday night were all die-hard Republicans, ready to give the President the benefit of the doubt -- several doubts, in fact.
But as Mr. Bush started to speak, even in this group, not at all enamored of insurgents like Patrick J. Buchanan or Democrats like Bill Clinton, there were a couple of gibes at the image on the television screen. 
 "He looks nervous," someone said.
"Oughta be," another replied.
When the President remarked good-naturedly that he wished he could have his wife, Barbara, deliver his speech, a man sitting on the floor commented: "Now he should sit down. He was joking. I wish he was serious."
But after that, everyone watched attentively. Times are bad in New Hampshire, as the whole country knows by now, and the people who had braved the LeRoys' icy driveway wanted to hear every word. Only whispered asides and a couple of whoops of delight -- one when Mr. Bush said he would make interest on student loans tax-deductible -- broke the hourlong quiet.
 
Party Foot Soldiers
 Nancy LeRoy conceded, "We're not typical voters in this room." But they were precisely the kinds of loyal party foot soldiers whose enthusiastic support Mr. Bush needs to retain if he is to convincingly beat back Mr. Buchanan's stiff challenge in the primary election on Feb. 18.
At the end, all agreed that the President had given a good speech and all expressed hope that he had got through to the state's voters.
"I think he's touched on most of the things that have been wrong," said Peter Karagianis. Mark Thurston, who operates a marina on Lake Winnipesaukee, said Mr. Bush had made "legitimate, usable, tangible shifts" that would appeal to the hard-pressed people of New Hampshire.
But there was a bit of New England stoicism in Mr. Thurston's reaction, too. Unlike some, he clearly did not expect the moon from Mr. Bush.
"Look, you heard the man talking about cutting the military back further, and that's good," he said. "But that obviously hurts our region. So it's an inevitability, this contraction we're going through, and we'll just have to get to the other end. It's not much fun, but then. . . ."
And there was also some New England skepticism on display as well.
 
Puzzled by the Timing
 State Representative Carl R. Johnson of Meredith said he doubted that the President's proposals would have much impact here by November. He said he wondered why Mr. Bush had waited so long, "why he didn't make these decisions six months ago."
The reason, suggested Ed Covino, a hotel manager, was that the President had been preoccupied with the war in the Persian Gulf and the revolution in the Soviet Union. That was fine with him, Mr. Covino said, adding: "It would have been very foolish for any President not to have taken a once-in-a-lifetime shot at making the world a safer place for us and our kids."
Mr. LeRoy, a civil engineer who, like Mr. Bush, went to Andover and Yale, though a good bit later, said, "I'm a little bit dubious of George's capacity to influence Congress."
 
Some Want a Hard Line
 So what should Mr. Bush do? Some, like Gov. Judd Gregg, who said in an interview the other day that he hoped the President "will put his thumb in Congress's eye," advocated a hard line.
Mr. Thurston said, "He'll have to call the Democratic leadership to blame for this stagnation," and Francis LeBranch, applauded Mr. Bush for "drawing a line in the sand here."
But "they won't pass his program," Mr. LeBranch said, because that would help "keep the Republicans in the White House for another 20 years." After March 21, Mr. Bush's deadline for Congressional action, he said, "They'll keep wrangling, and the people will get more disillusioned."
Bob Powers, who runs a scenic railway near the lake, said he hoped the President and Congress would work together, so he welcomed Mr. Bush's appeal for bipartisan cooperation with the Democrats to put the economy right.
 
'You Got to Compromise'
 "In your marriage, your business, with your kids, you got to compromise," Mr. Powers added. "Same thing here. I like his saying, let's pull together the way we did in Desert Storm. George Bush has never been an extremist, not a reactionary, not from the far right or the far left."
Gail Thomas, who teaches at the New Hampshire Technical College in Laconoia, said many of her students, some of whom are unemployed adults seeking new skills, "simply can't afford to go to the doctor or to take their kids." She described herself as "middle class or lower middle class or something -- we keep slipping" -- and said that she and her husband had trouble paying their own medical bills when their insurance did not cover everything.
"I don't want a Federal program," she said, "but I need to hear more from the President. Tax credits are fine, but still, where do poor people find the actual cash, money in hand, to pay for their health care?"
There were other questions as well. But at least in one living room in the shadow of the White Mountains, Mr. Bush seemed to have stilled most of the apprehensions of his backers at a crucial moment in his Presidency.

McDonald's Profit Up 8% In Quarter

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
The McDonald's Corporation said yesterday that profits increased 8 percent in the fourth quarter as it benefited from discount pricing in the United States and healthy sales overseas.
McDonald's, the world's largest restaurant operator, said fourth-quarter profits increased to a quarterly record for the company of $200 million, compared with $186 million for the corresponding quarter last year. Earnings per share were 54 cents for the quarter, compared with 51 cents a share a year earlier. Revenues rose to $1.73 billion from $1.70 billion. 
 Systemwide sales, which include sales of franchises along with company-owned stores, grew 7 percent for the quarter to $5.1 billion.
 
Indiana Jones Promotion
 In the United States, where McDonald's business has been sluggish, consumers responded to the company's lower prices on basic hamburgers and other products, the company said. Also, the company's Indiana Jones videotape promotions attracted customers in December.
The company said operations in a number of countries reported "excellent results" in spite of the impact of changing foreign currencies.
Results were particularly strong in Japan, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Australia and across Latin America, the company said.
Analysts said the latest results indicated that the company might be turning the corner. "This is probably one of the best quarters they've had in a year or more," said Richard Pyle, an analyst with Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc. in Minneapolis.
Edward H. Rensi, president of McDonald's U.S.A., said that several new products, including breakfast burritos, were also beginning to pay off.
 
Possible Bellwether
 Restaurant sales are closely watched because they are viewed as an indicator of the health of the economy. Mr. Rensi said, "Let's hope this is a bellwether of what's going on in the United States economy."
Overseas sales, which now account for about 40 percent of McDonald's sales, may exceed 50 percent by 1995, said Rebecca Barfield, an analyst with the First Boston Corporation. "I compare McDonald's to Coca-Cola 10 years ago," she said. Nearly 80 percent of Coke's profits now come from its business overseas.
In the long run, Ms. Barfield expects the company's overseas business to grow 22 percent a year, compared with 7 percent a year for McDonald's domestic business.
McDonald's stock fell $1.25, to $42.25, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans;
Buchanan Says Bush Stole His Ideas

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Jan. 29

 BODY:
The conservative columnist Patrick J. Buchanan, seeking to embarrass President Bush in this state's Feb. 18 primary, today accused Mr. Bush of stealing his agenda in his State of the Union Message and called on the President to debate him.
As he has done often since he announced in December that he would seek the Republican Presidential nomination, Mr. Buchanan said Mr. Bush had betrayed conservative principles while in office. 
 While crediting Mr. Bush with giving a "well-crafted and well-delivered" speech, Mr. Buchanan accused him of "a little bit of intellectual property theft" and said the President had belatedly returned to such conservative themes as cutting taxes, reducing government regulation and freezing Federal spending, themes that Mr. Buchanan has espoused throughout his campaign in New Hampshire.
"For three years, Mr. Bush has governed as a Rockefeller Republican, as a liberal Republican," Mr. Buchanan told reporters here. "Now he's going to run again as a conservative."
 
Any Time, Any Place
 Mr. Buchanan said he would travel anywhere in the country to debate the President, though he acknowledged that such a confrontation is unlikely.
The challenger, who plans to spend the bulk of the remaining days before the primary within New Hampshire, said the issue is Mr. Bush's credibility. He recalled that during the 1988 campaign Mr. Bush promised not to raise taxes, then accepted a tax increase as part of an agreement with Congress on the 1991 budget.
Mr. Buchanan said the President's speech on Tuesday night indicated that he "clearly intends to run in New Hampshire as a conservative for the last three weeks of the campaign, because he knows that is the political disposition of the Republican Party in New Hampshire. I don't think it's good enough, and I don't think the people of New Hampshire are going to buy this bill of goods a second time."
 
'Read My Lips'
 The question of the President's change on taxes has become the centerpiece of Mr. Buchanan's campaign in this state, which saved Mr. Bush's 1988 primary campaign by giving him a victory over the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, largely on the tax issue. In television and radio commercials that began running last week, Mr. Buchanan criticized Mr. Bush's reversal on taxes, using tape of the President making his now-famous pledge of "read my lips, no new taxes."
Mr. Buchanan hopes such a message will hit home in a state that has been battered by a prolonged recession that many voters blame on the President. While recent polls have indicated some movement away from the President and toward Mr. Buchanan, they also indicate difficulties for the challenger.
For example, in a telephone survey of 400 Republicans likely to vote in New Hampshire, 21 percent of those polled said they would vote for Mr. Buchanan, compared to 56 percent who favored Mr. Bush. Moreover, 27 percent viewed Mr. Buchanan unfavorably, a high unfavorable rating for a candidate. The survey, conducted for The Boston Globe and WBZ-TV of Boston, had a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.
"People in New Hampshire are very unhappy with Bush," said Gerry Chervinsky, president of KRC Communications Research, which conducted the poll. "But they don't like Buchanan."
 
A Moral Victory?
 Even so, Mr. Buchanan is relishing what he sees as one success of his campaign: pushing the President to the right. "There is no question that we not only have been driving the debate, we have been winning the debate," Mr. Buchanan said. "The proof of that is George Bush has moved crabwise in a conservative direction ever since we announced seven weeks ago."
The Administration's strategy seems to be to express regret over the tax increase and to highlight the President's call for a cut in capital gain taxes, levies imposed on the profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate.
Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who was in the state today campaigning for Mr. Bush, said, "Only speaking for Jack Kemp, I believe the President regrets trying to make a deal with this liberal Democratic Congress."
"But the fact is he has come back to the American people and asked them in a call to arms to bring back the tax cut to help restore value to capital assets held by the American people, both fixed and financial," Mr. Kemp said.

HEADLINE: Sordid Business Booms in Queens

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH

 BODY:
Roosevelt Avenue by day is a whirl of traffic and shoppers, to the roar and clatter of the I.R.T. passing overhead.
Nightfall brings traffic and trade of another sort. As steerers walk the avenue openly soliciting clients, men emerge from cars, cabs and the subway and ascend to the low-rent, low-price brothel world that flourishes overhead. There, women -- many of them undocumented immigrants -- do business in warrens of sordid cubicles behind second-story windows painted black. 
 Twenty minutes by the Flushing line from Times Square, these brothels have proliferated so fast in the last few years that the police say they comprise the largest center of prostitution in the city outside Manhattan.
In part, their growth is a traditional downside of successful law enforcement. A crackdown on prostitution in mid-Manhattan in the 1980's simply pushed many of the houses to the other boroughs. But their concentration in the largely Hispanic and South Asian immigrant neighborhoods along Roosevelt Avenue in Queens is also a matter of entrepreneurship, economics and exploitation: brothel operators, most of them South Americans, taking advantage of low rents, proximity to Manhattan and a large population of poor and often lonely immigrant men.
"They did an excellent job in Manhattan," said Capt. Henry C. Roge, commander of the 115th Precinct in Jackson Heights, of the Mayor's Midtown Enforcement task force that was at the forefront of the decade-long crackdown on Times Square. "However, the problem has now moved to Queens. Obviously all the ingredients are here. We are fertile ground for the houses."
As the houses have flourished -- 40 of them along two miles of the avenue in Elmhurst, Jackson Heights and Corona, with perhaps 30 more on surrounding streets -- so have street drug sales, traffic congestion, robberies and shootings, law-enforcement officials said.
And in the last six months, amid complaints from community boards and local residents, the authorities have begun a crackdown against the houses. Last week, in what the police called one of the largest anti-prostitution operations outside Manhattan, a special task force conducted an all-night operation that involved more than 100 police officers, the Queens District Attorney's office and members of the Mayor's Midtown Enforcement Task Force.
Prostitution in Queens, in particular street-walking, is not a new phenomenon. Since the midtown crackdown, the more expensive Asian massage parlors moved almost entirely to Queens. But many have closed recently because of the recession, AIDS and law enforcement, said Norman Dion, chief of operations for the Mayor's Office of Midtown Enforcement. It is the Hispanic houses of prostitution -- far greater in numbers, more visible, cheaper and extremely mobile -- that have angered the local communities and proved much harder to close down, the police and residents said. Since December there has been a murder and at least one shooting in the houses.
"This has developed into an environmental issue," said Helen Sears, a Jackson Heights district leader and community activist. "It sends out a real message that there is a breakdown in law and order. It tells the residents: 'I do not have a safe corner.' "
Many of the clients live in the area and are lonely, single immigrants who have either left their families in their native country or are not yet married. Although American prostitutes work the houses, the police say, the vast majority are undocumented immigrants from South America.
The police say they believe the houses are backed by drug money and have an established network that supplies them with South American women, many of whom are supporting their children, who are kept in virtual bondage until they pay back their smugglers.
Ten to 15 women work in each apartment and prices are low -- $20 for 15 minutes, $1 for a condom, with a cold beer thrown in for customers who have to wait. Vacant apartments are easily available and cheaper than in Manhattan. When a house is closed, the police say, it reopens nearby within days. The women, who are paid about $10 an hour, rarely cooperate with police investigations.
 
'Business Is Booming'
 "Business is booming here," said Capt. Paul Quinn, commanding officer of the Queens public morals squad, adding that prostitution in Queens had increased by 300 percent in the last five years. "Here they cater to as many men as they can. We seem to have no problem arresting them. The problem is that there are just so many of them."
At the end of last week's all-night raid, 10 Queens houses had been raided by the police, 63 people had been arrested on charges related to prostitution and three houses had been legally closed. But many of the women were more exasperated than scared; the men were embarrassed. The second-floor apartment at 93-15 Roosevelt Avenue was like many others. Fifteen men, some naked below the waist, and 10 scantily clad women crouched on their knees shoulder to shoulder, their hands behind their heads as the police made the arrests.
The three-bedroom apartment had been illegally partitioned with plywood into seven narrow cubicles where there was barely room for a bed and a night table. Each table had Babywipes and lubricating jelly. Condom wrappers and soiled paper overflowed from the waste baskets. Exposed wires looped across walls, and each room had a space heater.
In the kitchen, beneath statuettes of the Virgin Mary and other saints, calendars were scribbled with women's names and the refrigerator was full of Budweiser. For every client, the madam punches a hole on the woman's card, at times setting a timer for 15 minutes. Some cards had as many as 15 holes.
Since the Queens crackdown began six months ago, nine houses have been legally closed and lawsuits filed against the landlords and tenants for health code, building or fire-code violations. But the police say enforcement is difficult. Too-few available officers has resulted in a 60 percent decrease since 1990 in prostitution arrests in Queens bringing it down to 400 people in 1991, Captain Quinn said.
One of the prostitutes at a house closed last week, 22-year-old Dana Fischetti, said she would probably work elsewhere for a while until the neighborhood calmed down. Ultimately, law-enforcement officials believe that the crackdown will only lead to further displacement.
"The procurers tend to move the women," said Chief Frank Biehler, commanding officer of the public morals unit. "They are business people. They follow the dollar."

HEADLINE: State Street Boston in Deal

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
The State Street Boston Corporation has apparently been selected custodian for $64.7 billion in assets from a California pension fund, the second largest in the country.
A State Street spokesman, George Russell, confirmed Tuesday that the bank had been selected as custodian for the California Public Employees Retirement System fund. 
 DeWitt Bowman, chief investment officer at the California fund, said the decision was made last week.
A pension custodian is responsible for holding the securities owned by the fund, a function that is kept separate from trading and investing the assets, to protect the pension beneficiaries.
"The contract has not yet been negotiated and signed with State Street, but we are in the process of doing it at this time," Mr. Bowman told The Boston Herald.
The pension fund, roughly equivalent to the gross national product of Hungary, is second only to the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association College and Retirement Equity Fund. That fund has roughly $99.6 billion in assets.
Mr. Bowman said State Street, which currently holds custody of more than $1 trillion in institutional assets, won the bidding because it had the lowest price.
State Street edged out several other competitors, including Bankers Trust, Mellon Bank and the Boston Company, which has held the fund since 1987.
State Street also beat out two bids by the Chase Manhattan Bank and Morgan Stanley to take custody of the $8.5 billion in international assets owned by the California retirement system.
Mr. Bowman said the account review was based on a California law requiring the fund to open up the bidding process to financial services firms every five years.

One-Time Charges Cause Du Pont to Lose $240 Million

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del., Jan. 29

 BODY:
Du Pont lost $240 million in the final three months of 1991 because of one-time charges for cost-cutting and a recall of its fungicide, the chemical company said today.
The charges also contributed to a 39 percent drop in net income for the year. 
 The fourth-quarter loss came on sales of $10.05 billion. In the 1990 period, Du Pont had a profit of $468 million, or 69 cents a share, on sales of $11.18 billion.
Without the charges, the company's fourth-quarter earnings would still have been 43 percent lower than the period a year earlier. The company said today that the charges amounted to 70 cents a share.
For the year, Du Pont earned $1.4 billion, or $2.08 a share, compared with net income of $2.31 billion, or $3.40 a share, the year before. Sales were $39.52 billion, compared with $40.56 billion in 1990.
"We continued to see operating results affected by sluggish economies worldwide, resulting in weak demand and price pressures" for several Du Pont businesses, including chemicals, said Edgar S. Woolard Jr., chairman and chief executive of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company.
The one-time charges stem from the company's $1 billion cost-cutting program announced in July and from insurance payments related to the recall of Benlate, a fungicide.
Benlate was pulled from the market last March after an unusually large number of growers in Florida and other Southeastern states reported stunted plants and leaf damage after application of the chemical to control fungal diseases. Research showed that the problem could be the result of Benlate breaking down into other chemicals that damage plants when exposed to sunlight and heat.
On the New York Stock Exchange today, Dupont's shares slipped 50 cents, to $48.25.

HEADLINE: Some Cheers, Some Jeers for Bush Agenda

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Leaders of American business offered a range of reactions to the economic proposals in President Bush's State of the Union Message, and disagreed sharply over the pressure the President put on Congress to enact legislation in an election year.
"The investment tax credit and the research and development credits are good ideas," said James L. Koontz, president of the Kingsbury Corporation, a producer of machine tools in Keene, N.H., adding that he hoped the research and development credit would be applied to collaborative research. 
 "But there is a shadow over everything because most of it has to pass Congress," he continued. "The general reaction around here was that it was a great speech, but nothing is going to happen until next year."
But Jerry Della Femina, chairman of Della Femina McNamee, an agency in New York, disagreed. "I was more than a little bit disappointed," he said. "The speech failed to show us the way out of the economic mess. He would have made more progress in restoring confidence among the public if he hadn't passed the buck by blaming Congress."
John R. Molloy, a senior vice president of the Du Pont Company, echoed Mr. Koontz's sentiments. "We hope that in an election year that the President and Congress can find a way for bipartisan closure on these issues, but we are not confident," Mr. Molloy said. "A long debate and inaction will stall a turnaround. Uncertainty feeds on itself."
The President said he was acting to get more purchasing power in the hands of the public by reducing the amount of Federal tax withheld from the paychecks of workers. This plan, he said, could pump as much as $25 billion into the economy in the next year so that people can "pay for clothing, college, or to get a new car."
Executives at the auto makers, which have been in a deep sales slump and losing billions of dollars, said they liked the idea. "People have been scared," said Lee A. Iacocca, the chairman of the Chrysler Corporation. "They've put off buying high-ticket items like cars and homes that mean jobs. With interest rates as low as they are, the President's proposals may be just the shot in the arm this economy needs."
Harold A. Poling, the chairman of the Ford Motor Company, said, "The President's message points this country clearly in the direction it has to go, if we are to successfully rebuild and nurture a strong industrial base."
The chairman of the General Motors Corporation, Robert C. Stempel, joined his Big Three counterparts in urging Congress to respond to Mr. Bush's agenda. "He has pointed the way and Congress should give his program prompt and serious attention," Mr. Stempel said.
 
Bankers' Reaction
 Although Mr. Bush said he was directing bank regulators to end "overkill" in their evaluation of loans, which he said is causing a "credit crunch," some bankers reiterated yesterday that the low level of loans was due to slack demand.
"Consumers are not beating down the doors to borrow, except for refinancing mortgages," said Edward B. Brandon, chairman of the National City Corporation in Cleveland. "I'm not sure you can call it a credit crunch when people are not willing to borrow."
The President again raised the prospect of bank regulatory changes to lift old rules that bar banks from entering new businesses. Robert Dugger, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association, noted that Mr. Bush was unsuccessful last year in persuading Congress to allow banks to expand across state lines and to enter the securities and insurance businesses.
"After last year's battle, we are very wary of attempting to obtain meaningful reform from Congress in the near term," he said. He agreed with the President that fewer restrictions would promote economic growth, but he added that even if laws were changed, it would take years for the nation to benefit.
"I don't see bank reform providing any quick fix for the economy," Mr. Dugger said.
 
Markets' Reaction Noted
 Robert White, a vice president of First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles, noted the decline yesterday in both the stock and bond markets.
He attributed much of the reaction to testimony by the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, who said the economy would improve by midyear and that there was no immediate need to cut interest rates further. But Mr. White said the markets were listless anyway.
"There was certainly no euphoria in the financial markets today," Mr., White said. "You could say there was a lack of upturn because of the State of the Union. It was one of the better-delivered speeches in a long time, but the meat of it was not what people are looking for."
 
Attention to Real Estate Noted
 The President paid special attention to the real estate market, which has been slumping badly in many parts of the country. He proposed a $5,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, a lifting of penalties on withdrawals from individual retirement accounts and an easing of rules that make real estate attractive to investors who are not developers.
George Puskar, the chairman of Equitable Real Estate Investment Management Inc., said he was pleased that real estate had been given prominent attention. "The fact that the President chose to mention real estate in the speech is recognition of its significant impact on the economy," he said. "I don't think that was clear until recently."
He said the proposed change in the tax treatment of real estate investors who suffer losses would help bring in new capital to ease the slump. "Where there is real estate that is good but troubled, it will add an element of people staying with their properties and working them harder if their losses can have some value."
 
Disappointment at Morgan
 Jackson Tai, managing director of J. P. Morgan & Company's real estate investment banking group said he was disappointed that Mr. Bush proposed few measures that would strengthen the value of the dollar. "I was looking for steps that would attract foreign capital, because you need foreign capital to get real estate going again," he said. "Foreign capital needs a strong dollar."
The credit for first-time buyers of homes could add as many as 100,000 housing starts this year, said David Shulman, head of Salomon Brothers' real estate research unit. Some housing starts planned for next year will be pulled into this year because of the special stimulus, he added.
But not everyone agreed. President Bush's plan "had some useful elements, but the problems go far beyond quick fixes," said John O'Toole, president of the American Association of Advertising Agencies. "Things like a tax credit for first-time homeowners is peanuts. It isn't going to get consumers spending again."
Much of the impact of the President's proposed changes aimed at home buying would affect inexpensive homes and apartments across the country, said Edward S. Gordon, a commercial real estate broker in New York. But he said it would take time to get new housing started, "so I am not sure it will have an immediate impact," he concluded.
 
Views on Health Care
 Executives of both health-care providers and insurance companies said they were happy that the President rejected both a nationalized health-care system and one that coerced employers into increasing medical benefits. But health-care providers said the President had not sufficiently addressed the needs of poor people.
"We are very pleased that the President came out strongly opposed to play or pay, under which an employer would have to offer a minimum level of benefits or pay a tax," said F. Peter Libassi, a senior vice president of the Travelers Corporation. "We support the President's plan to use public and private resources to expand health care."
But David A. Jones, chairman of Humana Inc., a chain of health maintenance organizations and hospitals, said the presentation glossed over the cost of providing health care to the poor. "If we are going to cover the poor people who aren't covered -- and I think we must -- we are going to have to tax ourselves as a nation in some way," he said. "All the politicians ought to admit that, but none of them seem willing."
The President's plan did not go far enough, agreed C. Thomas Smith, President of Voluntary Hospitals of America, a cooperative group with 860 hospitals as members. "His model stopped short of achieving the goal of universal access," Mr. Smith said. "We have to have tort reform, which he suggested, and reform of the small-group insurance market, but we also have to change the delivery system. Mr. Bush's remarks did not address that."
Leaders of high-technology companies focused on the proposed tax credits for investment and research and development, which they said were important to fostering technological development.
"The part I liked is that, at last, there is support for spending that is very research-and-development intensive," said Craig Barrett, executive vice president of the Intel Corporation, the big maker of integrated circuits. "It will promote the strengthening of our industry."
Bert C. Roberts, president of the MCI Communication Corporation, said, "I think it is important to lower the capital-gains tax to encourage equity markets to stop focusing on short-term investments and focus more on the long term."
The credit for research and development was also popular with David J. Rynne, chief financial officer of the Tandem Computer Company in Cupertino, Calif.
"We spend about 14 percent of our sales, about $300 million, on research and development, so it is an important economic issue for us and a competitiveness issue," he said.
The President's proposals disappointed companies that explore for oil and natural gas.
"President Bush talked about cutting the alternate minimum tax on accelerated depreciation, which affects steel, chemicals and motor vehicles," said Denise Bode, president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America. "But nothing he proposed will help drillers," she added, claiming that the oil industry had lost more jobs than any of those three industries.

Money Fund Yields Drop but Slide Slows

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on both tax-exempt and taxable money funds continued to decline, but at a slower rate, for the seven-day periods ended Monday and Tuesday, respectively, IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report said yesterday. .
"Both tax-exempt and taxable yields are in the process of bottoming out, having both dropped this week, but not sharply," said Walter S. Frank, an economist for IBC/Donoghue's. 
 The seven-day compound average yield for the tax-exempt funds dropped by a basis point, to 2.75 percent, and the seven-day simple yield also dropped a basis point, to 2.71 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
In the same period, the 30-day compound yield fell sharply, to 3.21 percent from 3.57 percent, and the 30-day simple yield dropped to 3.16 percent from 3.51 percent.
The Connecticut fund with the top yield continued to be Fidelity Connecticut Municipal Money Market Portfolio, which reported a seven-day compound yield of 3.22 percent, down from 3.28 percent.
In New Jersey, the top fund once again was Fidelity Spartan New Jersey Municipal Money Market Portfolio with a yield of 3.26 percent, up one basis point from last week.
In New York, the top fund again was Salomon Brothers New York Municipal Money Market fund. It had a seven-day compound yield of 3.60 percent, the same as the previous week.
Assets of the tax-exempt funds, which had risen to a record of $98.1 billion last week, declined to $97.2 billion.
Donoghue's said the average number of days to maturity of securities held in the tax-free portfolios dropped by one day, to 51 days.
Of the funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's with assets larger than $100 million, the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, Milwaukee, continued to lead with a seven-day compound yield of 3.74 percent, down from 3.84 percent.
 
Taxable Assets Rise
 Meanwhile, assets of the taxable funds rose by $2.6 billion, to a record of $505.1 billion. Mr. Frank said $2.5 billion of the $2.6 billion increase came from institutional buying. The average days to maturity of holdings in the taxable funds dropped to 56 days from 57 days.
Mr. Frank said the taxable money fund yields were sensitive to Federal Reserve policy. "It is apparent we are coming to the end of the decline of short-term money fund yields," he said. "We would expect that institutions will tend to move out of the taxable funds and into Treasury securities and other open market investments."
The average seven-day compound taxable yield was 4.07 percent, down from 4.14 percent, while the seven-day simple yield fell to 3.99 percent from 4.05 percent.
At the same time the 30-day compound yield declined to 4.27 percent from 4.39 percent, and the simple yield dropped to 4.18 percent, from 4.30 percent last week.
The taxable fund with the best seven-day compound return for the week was Fidelity Spartan Money Market fund with a yield of 4.95 percent
By comparison, the average bank money market account, a prime competitor of money funds, was at 3.92 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

HEADLINE: Florio's Whirlwind Makes Paramus 'Capital for a Day'

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARAMUS, N.J., Jan. 29

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio moved the state capital here for a few hours today in an exercise that was part civics lesson and part political road show.
After declaring the borough New Jersey's first "Capital for a Day," the Governor and members of his cabinet fanned out around to meet with officials and community leaders; visit hospitals, a veterans home, a nutrition center for the elderly and the town jail, watch police officers rappel down a five-story building at the Garden State Plaza and drop off a $110,000 check for local road improvements before meeting with residents at a town meeting. 
 Mayor Clifford Gennarelli, a Republican, was not impressed as much by the Democratic Governor's visit as he was by Mr. Florio's entourage. "It's more important that the Governor's staff is here, the movers and shakers," he said. "Instead of writing a letter to the Governor's office that is just one of 10,000, the residents have an opportunity to talk to real people about real problems and real solutions."
 
'Running for Re-election'
 The "Capital for a Day" event, which state officials said will be repeated almost monthly around the state, was billed as an effort to bring government closer to the people. Mr. Florio said he wanted to listen to people's concerns, but he also wanted to talk about his proposed budget and focus attention on his priorities before the new Republican majorities in the Legislature begin reviewing his spending plan.
"He's clearly running for re-election," said Paul J. Contillo, a Democrat who lost his Senate seat in November, when the Republicans took overwhelming majorities in both the Senate and Assembly. "What he is going to do is focus attention on his priorities and force the Republicans to respond, and that will take time."
The two general elections since Mr. Florio pushed through a $2.8 billion tax package in 1990 have been difficult for his party, and he appears to have taken seriously the criticism that he failed to seek a consensus on the need for the tax increases before he acted.
In a meeting with more than a dozen community leaders at the Paramus borough hall today, Mr. Florio said, "There are choices that have to be made, and my purpose is to hear from you and the citizens about how we sort out what is important.
"We must engage people to begin evaluating trade-offs," he said. "There are multiple answers to any problem, and we must find those that, on balance, make the most sense."
One such conflict was evident in the room, and Mr. Florio was quick to point it out. Frank Cikutovich, a retired insulation installer, has seen his property taxes double, to $5,600, in the last three years; he wanted the Governor to do more to hold down property taxes. Jacqueline Bishar Pieroni, the president of the Paramus Education Association, wanted him to ease the mandated spending limits on the school budget, but the Governor said that would raise Mr. Cikutovich's taxes.
Rabbi Neal Borovitz, president of the Bergen County Board of Rabbis, told the Governor that he is part of a group that provides meals for about 150 homeless people at a shelter in Hackensack that is in danger of closing. He asked the Governor what could be done to help, adding he was not looking for a promise of funds but for "moral leadership."
 
The People Speak
 Mr. Florio replied with a discussion of the recession, which, he said, had resulted in a "sea change" in the way people live and view the future. What is needed are programs to get the economy moving, the Governor said, adding that President Bush had failed to address the problem in his State of the Union Message on Tuesday. Rabbi Borovitz thanked Mr. Florio but said, "That doesn't put food on the plates of hungry people."
The Governor heard complaints about red tape that delays school construction and said the problem was being addressed. When he was asked to stop the New Jersey Supreme Court from making and enforcing laws from the bench, he agreed that a problem exists and said he would see what he could do about it.
Mr. Florio and his wife, Lucinda, had lunch at the Forum Diner on Route 4 with seven local residents who had written letters to the Governor's office over the last two years. With reporters and cameramen hovering over their table, the meeting produced no sharp exchanges or insights.
Susan Altenkirch of Hackensack, who was in the diner but not at the Governor's table, said she thought it was a good idea for Mr. Florio to get around the state. "He should have done it sooner, and should continue to do it," she said. "I still see the 'Dump Florio' signs, and I don't know if that's a fair image."

HEADLINE: California Proposal Would Let Industry Sell Pollution Rights

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Southern California's air-quality regulators said today that they planned a radical new approach to controlling air pollution, allowing companies to purchase the right to pollute if they could not or chose not to reduce emissions on their own.
The new approach, which is still subject to formal approval, would supplant the current system of tight company-by-company regulation and would be the largest and most ambitious attempt yet to clean up the air by replacing regulatory fiat with free-market forces. 
 Specific elements of the plan have brought opposition from business, labor and environmental groups as the proposal has been drafted in recent months, but regulators said they were confident that the basic concept would be approved by the board of the regulatory authority, allowing it to go into effect by 1994.
Based on a long-debated concept known as emissions trading, the plan would dictate to polluters the amount by which they would have to reduce their emissions each year, but would not tell them how to do it. Businesses that developed techniques or technologies to reduce their emissions below the required levels would generate credits they could sell on the open market to other companies that were unable to meet the requirements or found it uneconomical to do so.
The idea is to reduce the costs to companies while providing them with an economic incentive to cut emissions as much as possible and to develop antipollution processes. The concept, long advocated by economists, was endorsed in the Clean Air Act passed by Congress last year, and has been used to limited degrees within particular industries. Utilities are moving toward adopting it in their efforts to reduce acid rain, but it has yet to be applied across an entire region or on a scale envisioned by the California plan.
Because the Southern California regulatory body, the South Coast Air Quality Management District, is extremely influential in policy circles throughout the country, many people involved in the issue said they expected the approach to spread to other regions with air-quality problems linked to factories, oil refineries, auto body shops and other stationary sources of pollution. The plan does not affect the regulatory approach to reducing emissions from automobiles.
 
'A Model for the Nation'
 "It's a tremendous departure in the sense that in the past the district has mandated regulations that specify a technology or a process or a housekeeping rule for how things should be done," said Joel Schwartz, a staff scientist for the Coalition for Clean Air, an environmental group. "Now the district is going to take its hands off and say that as long as you can prove you're getting real reductions you can do anything you want to reduce emissions, or you can buy permits from other companies that have proven they have reduced their emissions. This will be a model for the nation."
The air-quality district has been drafting plans for the shift for nearly a year against a backdrop of growing pressure by the business community and elected officials to reduce the industrial costs of complying with Southern California's strict air pollution regulations. The air-quality district for many years was resistant to what is called the "marketable permits system," but its executive officer, James Lents, said in an interview today that achieving further improvements in the region's air required a new approach.
"We have some of the world's strictest air-quality regulations in California, but it has not been enough to solve the air-quality problem here," Mr. Lents said. "We feel this will be a better system than the traditional command-and-control approach," he said, by giving businesses incentives to make additional improvements.
 
Further Debate Likely
 While there is general consensus that the board of the air-quality district will approve the proposal, there will almost certainly be changes to specific elements of it as public debate on the issue intensifies between now and March 6, when the board is scheduled to vote. There also appears to be a minority on the board that is not yet convinced the program will work.
"I have a real problem gambling on economic theory," said Larry Berg, a board member and the director of the Institute for Politics and Government at the University of Southern California.
Representatives of environmental groups have been pushing the regulators to adopt a go-slow approach. They advocate limiting the program in the beginning to sources of nitrogen oxides, such as oil refineries and utilities, which can be monitored and measured relatively easily and accurately. The groups want the regulators initially to retain their traditional tight regulation of sources of reactive organic gases, such as those contained in paints, coatings and solvents, which are far more difficult to track.
"We're concerned that the district not go forward with such a big plan and give up the whole regulatory structure until they've learned to make it work," said Mr. Schwartz of the Coalition for Clean Air. "They haven't proven to us that they'll be able to enforce the program."
 
Why Labor Groups Worry
 Labor groups are also expressing some reservations about the concept. They say they fear that by allowing companies to sell their pollution rights the system will reward companies that choose to close plants in the region and move elsewhere, taking jobs with them. So labor groups are pushing for limits on the ability of companies that are leaving the area to sell their credits.
"We don't want to deny companies the right to leave, but we don't want them packing off to Mexico with a sackful of money from selling their credits, either," said Kelly Candaele, a political representative for the Los Angeles Federation of Labor.
Business groups have generally supported the concept as a way of making it more economical to stay and expand their operations in California. Although some smaller companies have expressed fears that larger competitors might benefit inordinately from looser regulation, most industries see emissions trading as giving them greater flexibility in dealing with the basic regulatory requirement of reducing pollution by a mandated percentage each year.
 
Citing an Example
 A study conducted last month by the Regulatory Flexibility Group, a coalition of corporations in the Los Angeles area, cited the example of a small electronics firm that faced huge costs in reducing emissions of reactive organic gases from its semiconductor operations. To make the reductions on its own, the company would have to pay $200,000 per ton of annual emissions.
But a company that paints or coats ships spends only $2,000 a ton to reduce its emissions of the same gases. Under an emissions trading program, the electronics company might be able to buy pollution credits from the ship-painting company for a price much closer to $2,000 a ton than $200,000, sharply reducing its expenses.
As proposed by the air quality district, the plan would initially apply to the 2,000 companies in the region that account for 85 percent of the smog-forming hydrocarbons emitted by the businesses that the district monitors, and to the 700 businesses that account for 95 percent of nitrogen oxide emissions. The plan calls for smaller companies to be added to the program later, with only a handful of businesses, including restaurants and dry cleaners, likely to be exempted, Mr. Lents said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Big Selloff in Treasury Securities

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Remarks by the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, Alan Greenspan, took precedence over other important developments yesterday, and a violent selloff in the secondary market for Treasury securities ensued after Mr. Greenspan said an economic recovery appeared likely in the spring.
Mr. Greenspan made his forecast in confirmation testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. His remarks wiped out what had been a positive early response in the credit markets to President Bush's State of the Union address and a preliminary report from the Commerce Department showing that the economy expanded only three-tenths of a percent during the final quarter of 1991. 
 Ever the cautious economist, Mr. Greenspan went out of his way to note the economy's unusual condition made predictions difficult. At the moment, he said, the Fed is doing more watching than forecasting.
 
'A Silly Reason to Sell'
 Nevertheless, "there is a general sense that the Fed is done easing policy for now," a government bond trader said. "That is a silly reason to sell securities, because that notion was already in the market. At this point, I think that prices are cheap."
Mr. Greenspan has made many of the same comments before, and some analysts acknowledged that they were a bit mystified at the market's severe reaction.
"Market reaction to Greenspan's testimony has been enormously overblown," economists at MMS International noted in their daily market commentary.
"We would argue that his remarks are merely supportive of the view that the Fed is on hold near term," they said, "but that the potential for further easing down the road still exists if economic data continue to depict a stagnant economy."
 
Losses Exceed a Full Point
 The selloff in the bond market, which amounted to more than a full point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, was even more surprising in light of the Commerce Department's report on the weak economy.
The three-tenths of a percent rise in gross domestic product was about in line with Wall Street's expectations. But the report also noted that inflation in the fourth quarter rose by just 1.7 percent, a full percentage point below expectations. This was the lowest quarterly increase in 25 years.
Most economists said the modest economic package proposed by President Bush on Tuesday night should have placated credit market participants, assuming Congress does not try to increase its size significantly. And the early reaction to the speech was positive, as prices moved higher during overnight trading in Asia.
But some analysts speculated that good feeling about the proposals may have evaporated later, after the Administration's 1993 budget was released.
 
'Pretty Ugly Stuff'
 "The budget is pretty ugly stuff," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research on developments in the foreign-exchange and fixed-income markets.
After doing the math, Mr. McCarthy said the Administration's projected deficit of just under $400 billion made it likely that Treasury borrowings in the July-September quarter, the last of the Government's fiscal year, could be as high as $184 billion.
"We are talking about such enormous numbers that it is a bit mind-boggling," he said. "And since the President has been outmaneuvered in previous budget negotiations, it seems safe to assume the deficit will be even larger than projected."
 
Notes and Bonds Plunge
 The bulk of the day's selloff was concentrated among longer-term notes and bonds.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 10230/32 , down just over a point, to yield 7.74 percent, compared with 7.66 percent late Tuesday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 10126/32 , down 19/32 to yield 7.23 percent. And the 4 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 9917/32 , down 3/32 , to yield 5.12 percent.
Despite Mr. Greenspan's comments, short-term Treasury bill rates were little changed. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.81 percent late yesterday, unchanged from late Tuesday. And six-month bill rates rose by just a basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point, to 3.90 percent.
The big selloff in the Treasury securities market did not deter a number of large investment-grade corporate issuers from pricing enormous amounts of new issues.
 
$1.5 Billion Offering
 By far the largest deal was a three-part, $1.5 billion offering from Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the main bottler for the Coca-Cola Company. The issue consists of $750 million worth of 30-year bonds, $250 million worth of 20-year securities and $500 million of 10-year notes.
The 8.50 percent 30-year bonds were priced at $98.83 to yield 8.61 percent, 89 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds at the time of pricing.
The 8.50 percent 20-year securities were priced at $100, or par, 78 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bond at the time of pricing.
And the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were also priced at $100, 68 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7.50 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
 
Retiring Debt
 Proceeds from the sale will be used to retire higher-cost outstanding debt, including $550 million worth of high-yield securities issued by Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group Inc., which Coca-Cola Enterprises acquired in December.
Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager for the offering. All three parts of the issue are rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and AA-by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Elsewhere, the Ford Motor Credit Corporation offered $1 billion worth of securities backed by dealer receivables. The 6 7/8 percent five-year securities were priced at $99.281, to yield 7.05 percent, 80 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 1/4 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
Merrill Lynch & Company acted as lead manager for the offering. The securities are rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
 
Tax-Exempt Issues
 A number of offerings were also priced in the tax-exempt municipal bond market. The largest offering was a sale of more than $550 million worth of securities for the State of Washington.
The negotiated sale consists of serial bonds with yields from 3.30 percent on securities maturing in 1993 to 6.25 percent in 2006.
Yields on term bonds range from 6.35 percent in 2011 to a maximum yield of 6.50 percent in 2014.
Lehman Brothers acted as lead manager for the offering. The securities are rated AA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.

HEADLINE: Arms Makers Brace for Peace

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Even after six years of gradual Pentagon cuts, the Bush Administration's plan to slash military spending by canceling or scaling back a number of high-profile arms programs came as a jolt to weapons builders and to thousands of workers from Connecticut to California who are likely to lose their jobs in coming years.
Virtually every military contractor faces the loss of some business. The ensuing job losses would affect communities across the country, especially as business cutbacks spread to subcontractors and suppliers. 
 The Administration plan, laid out by President Bush in the State of the Union Message on Tuesday night and in budget documents submitted to Congress today, calls for an end to the Northrop Corporation's B-2 Stealth bomber, built in Palmdale and Pico Rivera, Calif., and to the General Dynamics Corporation's Seawolf submarine, assembled at the Electric Boat shipyard in Groton, Conn.
 
 
Programs Scaled Back
 The plan also calls for other programs to be scaled back substantially, including the Comanche helicopter being designed for the Army, largely in Connecticut, by the United Technologies Corporation and the Boeing Company; the advanced cruise missile, built by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation and General Dynamics, and a program for General Dynamics to upgrade the M-1 tank.
The Administration's proposal calls for the Pentagon's budget for the next fiscal year to be cut by $10 billion from the current $291 billion. Many members of Congress had called for similar cuts in the wake of the Soviet Union's dissolution, but the President's proposal represents a sharp shift for the Administration, which until recently had resisted canceling or delaying advanced weapons programs. The plan, if enacted by Congress, would greatly accelerate the industry's shrinkage and hasten its reorientation toward technological research rather than mass production of weapons.
"If you make helicopters, aircraft, missiles, ships, look out, because you're going to get a lot smaller a lot faster than you think," said Gordon Adams, the director of the Defense Budget Project, a nonpartisan research group in Washington.
 "It will be a substantially smaller industry, one that emphasizes the inputs to the weapons platform rather than production of the platform itself," Mr. Adams said. "It's an industry without a lot of production workers and with a heavy emphasis on research and design teams."
Analysts said that by the time Congress finished its work on the budget, the cuts could go even deeper. But they said Congress faced a painful choice between reaping the peace dividend and preserving military contracting jobs in members' home districts during an election year and a recession.
"Bush just established a new ceiling that was lower than the prior ceiling, and it doesn't leave a lot of headroom for the industry," said Howard A. Rubel, an analyst at C. J. Lawrence. "There's going to be a lot of arm twisting and favor paying in Congress before this thing is played out."
 
F-22 Plans Go Forward
 There were a few winners. The Pentagon wants to press ahead with the Air Force's new F-22 jet fighter, to be built by a team headed by the Lockheed Corporation. Final assembly will take place in Georgia, the home state of Senator Sam Nunn, the influential Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Navy will get a new aircraft carrier it wanted, to be built at Tenneco Inc.'s Newport News Shipyard in Virginia.
But many more companies and communities are likely to be losers. In Groton -- the home of Electric Boat, long the nation's leading submarine builder -- the cancellation of the Seawolf program, after just one boat under construction is completed, leaves the company with a rapidly diminishing backlog of orders.
While the company would not specify possible job losses today, it has said in the past that most of Electric Boat's 19,000 jobs in Connecticut and Rhode Island would disappear and the company's long-run survival would be in doubt without further Seawolf orders.
"It is very clear right now that it will have major implications for each of our facilities," Electric Boat said in a statement today about the program's cancellation.
 
 
Sikorsky May Suffer
 The cuts could also hurt another big contractor in Connecticut, the Sikorsky division of United Technologies, which had been scheduled to build the Army's Comanche helicopter in Stratford as part of a team that also includes Boeing. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said production of the Comanche, which had been scheduled to begin in 1996, would be deferred indefinitely.
Foster Morgan, a Sikorsky spokesman, said that more than 2,000 people work on the program, 650 of them for Sikorsky in Connecticut. But he said it was impossible to know how the indefinite delay would affect employment until the Army negotiated a new contract with the company.
In California, Northrop said today that it expected to lay off 1,500 employees from the B-2 program by the end of the year. President Bush's proposal calls for production of the radar-evading, bat-winged bomber to be halted after 20 planes, down from the Air Force's most recent request of 75 and an original order of 132.
There are 16 planes on order, and orders for 4 additional planes would probably extend production through the middle of the decade. But as the program winds down, most of the 13,400 Northrop employees working on the program will lose their jobs.
Also at risk are the more than 40,000 others who work on the program for Northrop's subcontractors and suppliers. The LTV Corporation said that about 1,500 jobs pertaining to its work on the B-2 would be eliminated by the end of the year if the program was halted. Boeing, which had planned to cut 800 B-2 jobs this year, announced that it will cut 2,000 immediately.
Employment at the Government plutonium plant at Rocky Flats, Colo., will also be cut sharply. The plant, idle for years because of environmental and safety concerns, will cease production and concentrate on a cleanup, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins announced today. The department anticipates that about 1,000 of the 8,875 jobs at Rocky Flats will be eliminated in the 1993 fiscal year, with the work force gradually reduced to about 4,500 by the 1995 fiscal year.
Military contractors continued to put the best face on the sharp declines in their business, as they have for years. General Dynamics, the nation's second-largest Pentagon supplier, said in a statement that the Administration's budget contained "relatively few surprises," even though few analysts had expected the Seawolf program to be canceled after a single submarine. General Dynamics said it remained "well positioned" to get what business will be available from the military.
Northrop, too, put on a brave face, despite the loss of the B-2, which currently accounts for half of its revenues. A top Northrop executive said at a meeting with reporters last week that even without the B-2, the company would be able to continue reducing its debt and that it would have the financial strength to make acquisitions or invest in those aspects of its business that are growing.
"Even if the B-2 ends at only 16 aircraft, the present number approved by Congress, we'll be a profitable aerospace company with an enviable business base," the Northrop executive said.

GRAPHIC: Chart: Likely casualties of the military cutbacks proposed Tuesday night by President Bush and the stock market's reaction. Other potential casualties include an improved version of the M-1 tank, an antitank weapon, an air-defense system and an advanced cruise missile.

Philip Morris Income Falls Because of Special Charges

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
The Philip Morris Companies said yesterday that its fourth-quarter net income fell 12.8 percent, to $767 million, because of charges related to an accounting change and the costs of revamping its worldwide food operations.
Excluding the charges, the tobacco and food company's quarterly profits jumped 21 percent from the period a year ago, to $1.06 billion. 
 Sales dropped 3.5 percent, to $13.7 billion. The company attributed the drop to unfavorable currency rates and lower revenues from its North American food operations.
 
 
Kraft Sales Are Sluggish
 The gains were driven in large part by the strong performance of the company's tobacco business, both overseas and in the United States. The company's Kraft General Foods business in the United States fared less well, reflecting what analysts say is an intensely competitive and somewhat sluggish time for the packaged foods industry.
Philip Morris's earnings per share fell 12.6 percent, to 83 cents from 95 cents, for the three months that ended on Dec. 31. Excluding the charges, earnings per share rose 22.1 percent, to $1.16.
"It was a good performance," said Lawrence Adelman, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds. "The numbers were very strong."
Philip Morris stock lost 50 cents a share yesterday, closing at $75.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
 
Shift to Cheaper Cheeses
 Operating income was down for the company's North American food business in the quarter. For the year, the company's volume in cheese, salad dressing and mayonnaise was down 5 percent. In the recession, Kraft's brand-name cheeses have lost market share to cheaper private-label brands. To stem the losses, the company recently cut prices 8 percent. "They got a little tired of losing market share," Mr. Adelman said.
In a statement, Michael A. Miles, chairman and chief executive of the company, said, "Although we expect consumer packaged goods companies to face extremely competitive conditions in a weak economic environment during most of 1992, we are well positioned for continued earnings and cash flow growth." He added, "We expect a good year in 1992."
Analysts expect overall profits, buoyed by cigarette sales, which account for about two-thirds of the company's profits, to grow by 20 percent this year.
"The tobacco business continues to be the crown jewel," said John C. Maxwell, an analyst with Wheat, First Securities.
 
 
Small Gain for Miller Beer
 Philip Morris's Marlboro brand is the world's best-selling cigarette. The company, which controls 43.3 percent of the American market, has also been aggressively building its lower-priced brands, Cambridge and Bucks.
At the company's Miller Beer brewing division, volume rose slightly last year, compared with a decline of more than 2 percent for the United States beer industry. Miller Lite volume, however, declined for the year.
During the fourth quarter, the company voluntarily adopted a new accounting method for retiree benefits. The change resulted in a charge against earnings for Philip Morris of nearly $1 billion.
In the fourth quarter, the company also spent $455 million for costs related to consolidating factories and other cost-cutting measures in its worldwide food divisions.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Anti-Japan Auto Ads May Backfire

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
A RENEWED wave of harsh attacks on Japanese cars and trucks is inundating television and newspapers, as sort of the evil twin of the automotive industry's "Buy American" advertising.
Many of these new passionate, possibly xenophobic pitches seem the automotive equivalent of negative political advertising. Instead of Willie Horton's mug shot, however, the villain is depicted by rising suns, backed by sour-sounding string music meant to mimic the tones of the Japanese koto. And lest these be too subtle, there are remonstrations to remember Pearl Harbor. 
 The new round of ads stems from the perceived failure of President Bush's trade mission to Japan and from the recent criticism of American workers by Japanese politicians and business executives.
The ads, which not only praise American vehicles but also bash the Toyotas and Hondas of the world, are typified by a television commercial by the Deutsch Inc. agency for the metropolitan New York Pontiac dealers. A stern-voiced announcer reminds viewers of the remarks by Yoshio Sakurauchi, a Japanese politician, calling Americans lazy and illiterate. The remarks are printed on screen, against a rising sun; the word "Japanese" is all uppercase.
The announcer says, sarcastically, "Well, excuse us." After touting the attributes of the Pontiac Grand Am over the Honda Accord and the Toyota Camry, he adds, sneeringly, "Maybe they need a reading lesson."
Among other such campaigns are print advertisements for a Chrysler-Plymouth dealer in Anchorage that present World War II images from Pearl Harbor Day to V-J Day, and one for a Yonkers Lincoln-Mercury dealer that mocks Danny, the fictional salesman in a long-running campaign for the metropolitan New York Honda dealers. "Sorry Danny, not all Americans are stupid!" reads the ad, which lists "American jobs" as a selling point for the Mercury Sable.
The overheated rhetoric is far more prevalent in ads by local dealers than in national campaigns, in the same way that local politicians are more likely to "go negative" than, say, the President. While these ads attract attention -- crucial at a time when recession-weary consumers are loath to buy cars or trucks -- automotive industry consultants, as well as many advertising executives and academics, condemn them. Their opposition stems not so much from whether the ads are mean spirited or unpleasant, but from an opinion that they simply do not work, and may even be counterproductive.
Such advertising is "tawdry political grandstanding and disgusting," said Robert Lauterborn, a professor of advertising at the University of North Carolina's journalism school at Chapel Hill.
"Demagoguery has always been the successful refuge of the scoundrel," he added, "but it's still demagoguery."
A car maker or dealer using this strategy "is digging a hole for himself," said Christopher Cedergren, senior vice president of the Auto Pacific Group, a Santa Ana, Calif., automotive marketing consulting company.
"I can understand why they're doing it," he added. "Business worse than stinks. They'll think of anything they can to try to move product.
"But negative advertising like that," he said, "where you are basically scolding the consumer, doesn't do your business any good."
One big reason these ads backfire, said David Stewart, a professor of marketing at the University of Southern California, is that "they may only frustrate the consumer, because it's difficult to determine what's a Japanese product and what's an American product."
For instance, the cars cited in Deutsch's Pontiac spot, the Accord and Camry, are made in American factories. Indeed, a current television and print campaign by Saatchi & Saatchi DFS Pacific, salutes the American workers at Toyota's Georgetown, Ky., Camry plant.
And "you might have a Dodge dealer waving the flag," Mr. Cedergren said, "while half the mini-vans he's selling have V-6 engines from Mitsubishi." That is in addition, he added, to the anomaly that "a lot of the dealers who are shouting 'Buy American!' are the same dealers who own the Nissan dealership down the street."
Another reason these ads do not succeed, Mr. Lauterborn said, is that they appeal mostly to Americans "who are still fighting the Second World War" -- that is, older consumers who are already more inclined to buy American-built vehicles rather than those made overseas.
Donny Deutsch, the executive vice president and creative director at Deutsch, acknowledged that "there is a danger" in campaigns like his. Indeed, previous Deutsch spots for the Pontiac dealers were castigated for their jingoism; one warned consumers that if they "keep buying Japanese cars," they might someday visit "the big Christmas tree at Hirohito Center."
Yet, he said: "It's a message a lot of people want to hear. And you need emotion to get people thinking.
"Will it sell cars?" he asked. "We'll see."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off on Bush's Plans But Is Buoyed by Greenspan

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mixed in United States trading yesterday, weakened at first by disappointment over President Bush's economic proposals but buoyed later on comments from the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan.
Gold prices were narrowly mixed, weakening slightly overseas but strengthening marginally in the United States. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery fetched $356.10 an ounce, up 30 cents. At the Republic National Bank in New York, gold was quoted at $356.50 a troy ounce as of 4 P.M., up 85 cents from Tuesday. The dollar's value fell early in the global trading day, largely in reaction to President Bush's State of the Union address Tuesday night. 
 Traders said they saw few meaningful stimulants in his economic plan, which suggested that interest rates in the United States would likely have to decline again. That would make dollar-denominated investments worth less.
 
Dollar Begins to Rally
 But the dollar began to rally about midway through the trading day in the United States, when Mr. Greenspan, testifying before Congress, repeated earlier assertions that the significant interest rate cuts of recent months were enough to get the economy growing again. He also said he saw subtle signs of economic improvement after a prolonged slump.
"His comments all were directed to the idea that the economy doesn't look so bad," said Andrew Hodge, vice president of corporate treasury services at the New York branch of Bank Brussels Lambert. "So the Fed might not have to ease at all."
Some foreign exchange strategists cautioned, however, that persistent weakness in the United States economy could still result in another round of interest rate cuts, which would hurt the dollar.
"Greenspan said he didn't see any great need to lower the rates and was looking for an improvement in the economy, but I'm not really sure that's the case," said Hillel Waxman, a dealer at the New York branch of Bank Leumi Trust. Mr. Waxman said he foresaw at least one more cut in interest rates.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.20 yen to close at 125.17 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 125.35 yen. By the time trading concluded in New York the dollar fetched 125.65 yen, down from 125.70 yen late Tuesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.8095, from $1.7950 late Tuesday. In New York, the pound fetched $1.7975, more expensive than its $1.7925 exchange rate late Tuesday.

New Man Taking Over At Pacific Power Helm

 BODY:
Paul Lorenzini, a nuclear engineer and lawyer, will take the helm on Saturday as president of the Pacific Power and Light Company, one of the largest investor-owned utilities on the West Coast. The company is still in the throes of wrenching operational changes since its merger in 1990 with the Utah Power and Light Company.
Mr. Lorenzini, 49, who is now executive vice president for operations for the Portland, Ore., utility, replaces Robert Moench, who is retiring. His promotion is part of a management restructuring by the parent company, Pacificorp, to pave a smooth transition for the utility, which is trying to reduce costs and keep power prices low. 
 "It has been very difficult to merge two company cultures," Mr. Lorenzini said. "People get used to doing business in different ways and have spent their entire careers working for either Pacific Power or Utah Power. We've needed to devise processes to merge operations such as accounting, economic development and even generating and transmission resources."
Mr. Lorenzini grew up in Portland and as a youth worked at Whizburger, a fast-food chain that sold 19-cent hamburgers when it was founded in the 1960's by his father, Gilbert.
Once while hitchhiking to school, he was offered a ride by a naval officer who suggested he get a degree from one of the nation's military academies. As a result of that chance meeting, in 1964, he graduated from the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, L.I. An instructor who taught a course in nuclear physics "made nuclear engineering sound fascinating," and in 1969 he received a doctorate in the field from Oregon State University in Corvallis. He received a law degree in 1975 from Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.
From 1969 to 1976, he was employed as a nuclear engineer at Rockwell International in Los Angeles. While working at Rockwell, he was co-chairman of a committee formed to defeat an antinuclear initiative, Proposition 15. In 1976, he joined the law firm of Tooze, Kerr, Peterson, Marshall & Shenker in Portland. In 1979 he joined the Rockwell Hanford Operation, Richland, Wash., and in 1984 was named vice president and general manager, responsible for a staff of 5,000 and radioactive waste management from nuclear operations there. He joined Pacific Power in 1987.
"I'm pretty happy where I am now and welcome challenges," he said. "But one thing I've learned is that I don't plan my life too far in advance." He and his wife, Jan, live in Lake Oswego, Ore., and have two children.

HEADLINE: DECORATING CONFESSIONS;
The Secret Shame of Ostentation

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SLESIN

 BODY:
"I'LL take it," a tall, elegant man whispered before slipping away into the crowd at the opening of the Winter Antiques Show in Manhattan.
"He'll take it," Blanche Greenstein echoed to her partner, Thomas K. Woodard. 
 Ms. Greenstein and Mr. Woodard, who are folk-art dealers, then placed a red "sold" sticker on the $3,500 architectural model. Many of their prime pieces already bore red stickers, including an early-19th-century pumpkin-pine and tin tollhouse window tagged $12,000.
"We sold it the first night and could have sold it 100 times since," Ms. Greenstein said. "The woman who bought it kept saying: 'I don't need it. I just love it.' "
Despite the recession, despite sales that antiques dealers describe as sluggish, despite waves of layoffs in architectural and interior design offices, there are some people who are still renovating, still decorating and always buying.
But even those who once justified any expenditure to achieve decorating splendor are now affecting a very low profile, a definite slink. In the decorating world, mum's the word right now. Call it the new guilt.
Decorating seems to have progressed from the "I did it all myself" school of the 1970's to the "Mario [or Mark or John] is doing it" line of the 1980's to the more socially acceptable, "Of course, we're not doing much of anything."
Lucy Greenberg works in a New York design firm and has just moved to a large Park Avenue apartment that she says needs "everything."
"But opulence is on the wane," she said. "In the past, everything was faux. Now we're back to the real thing.
"If I did decide to do 100 percent silk draperies on the windows," Mrs. Greenberg added, "I certainly wouldn't say anything to anybody."
Mario Buatta, the decorator, said: "The bug doesn't leave you People like me who have a buying sickness just don't stop. They might go for smaller-ticket items and keep quieter about it."
Mr. Buatta, who calls decorating an addiction, continued: "It's like a diet. You might say, I'm never going to be fat again, but sooner or later the pounds will be back. That's how it is with things that give you pleasure."
Of course, denial and abstinence have never been closely associated with interior decorating.
"We're the charlotte Russe, the extra cream," said Robert Metzger, a New York decorator who has made excess his signature. Like others in his profession, Mr. Metzger has recently had to react to a sea change and has toned down his interiors.
Of course, everything is relative.
"Now people want to look low-key in their spending approach," Mr. Metzger said. "It's just not appropriate to flaunt. That might embarrass someone or make someone feel bad. And that's just not nice."
As Mr. Metzger sees it, this new attitude includes "not serving caviar at your dinner party."
The guests at such a dinner party might have heeded Heather Cohane's publisher's letter in the November issue of Quest, a monthly magazine filled with features on the well-to-do and listings for luxurious real estate. To her friends who say "it's not chic to spend money," Ms. Cohane, citing concern for the economy, answered: "Please continue to buy. Since there is no need to tell anyone you're doing it, you can remain as chic as ever in your friends' eyes."
And Peter Marino asks, "What recession?" One of the designers who seemed to define the extravagant decorating of the 1980's, Mr. Marino is busier than ever, though half his business these days is overseas.
"What I hear most frequently from my American clients is, 'It's not the 80's,' or 'This is the 90's, you know,' " he said.
Most clients are not only keeping their decorating projects very quiet but demanding that their designers do the same. "Some people are dying to get their names in print," said Carolyn Sollis, the decorating director of HG magazine. "But others are worried about security, taxes, kidnappings and being too ostentatious."
Anthony Ingrao, an antiques dealer and interior decorator in New York, said, "I just can't reveal any names at all these days," adding that he had just sold "a very important chandelier by Charpentier for $75,000."
"That was probably too cheap, because I have five back-up offers," Mr. Ingrao said. Just don't ask him to tell you who they are from.
Mariette Himes Gomez, a New York designer who has championed a somewhat understated though not inexpensive look, said, "These days, the emphasis is more on creature comfort than on the art, antiques and views of the showy apartment."
Renovating when things get worn and accommodating growing children and new babies are part of what Mrs. Gomez called "the new utilitarian age."
"In uncertain times," said Glenn Gissler, a New York designer, " the home environment is one place you can have a sense of control, whether it's real or not."
Mr. Gissler, adding that he was "insanely busy," said that decorating these days is not about indulging every possible whim, but neither is it about doing without. "These days people may have to work harder to stay in the same place," he said, "but I hear them saying, 'Damn it, I'm going to have a place that's nice.' "
Decorating that doesn't look like decorating seems to be the trend. For example, when Barbara Toll, an art dealer, recently renovated her SoHo gallery, she wanted people to see the improvement. But she added: "I didn't want them to notice that I did anything to it at all. Like dyeing your hair: it looks different and better, but people can't put their finger on why."
Fixing up what one has rather than moving and starting over assuages a lot of people's decorating guilt.
"For seven years, we've wanted to have our own bathroom, and a gorgeous one at that," said Libby Bruck, who works for Reality Productions, a film and video company in Fairfield, N.J. and lives with her family in Montclair, N.J.
A whirlpool bath and a walk-in closet were on Mrs. Bruck's wish list. Now she has them, as well as a recently completed den and study over the garage.
"I'm thrilled," she said. "Fixing up the house you're in is not as pretentious as moving to a big mansion."
That attitude can even extend to items that were traditionally considered as basic as the kitchen stove or the living room sofa.
At George Smith, a SoHo store that specializes in expensive, emphatically dowdy upholstered English furniture, kilim-covered sofas are still being grabbed up like popcorn, at $8,800 to $12,000 apiece. Steven Shanstrom, the showroom manager, said about 200 have made their way out the door in the last two years.
"Even people who really didn't need another sofa couldn't resist the ones we had in our sale," Mr. Shanstrom said. "They think of them as a piece of art, and they make a space for them."
The same might be true for the current Rolls-Royce of stoves: La Cornue, which costs about $18,000. (Add $2,000 for copper finish.)
"My customers know they are a wild extravagance, but they justify it as a lifelong investment," said Michael Kaye, who manages a store in New York for Williams-Sonoma, which distributes the stoves. The store has sold 18 in the last two years.
"Think of it as a family heirloom that will enhance the value of your home and property," Mr. Kaye said. The company engraves the stoves with the family names of the owners.
Of course, for some people disclosure was never a consideration. "Most of our clients never talked about it anyway," said Betty Sherrill of McMillan & Company in Manhattan. "We can't say we're not in a recession, but we're an old firm and we didn't have the yuppies, and still don't have them. "
Mrs. Sherrill said she was currently renovating a triplex on Fifth Avenue and "working more in Texas again."
Howard Klein, a collector of tin toys and Western furniture, seems truly oblivious to the vagaries of the design trade. Mr. Klein, the creative director at the Clarkson N. Potter publishing company, lives in a spacious apartment on the Upper West Side that is being designed in a style he called "cowboy Deco."
"I'm such a careful shopper that I'm recession proof," he said. "It takes me so long to decide about anything that by the time I buy it, the economic climate can have changed completely."

HEADLINE: In Hard Times, Boarders in the Suburbs

 BODY:
AS her bills piled up last year, Grace G. became so worried about her finances that she felt she had only one option: to give up part of her home in a Westchester village to a stranger.
The stranger sleeps in an upstairs bedroom in the split-level brick house, prepares meals in the kitchen and keeps a toothbrush and a jumble of toiletries in the family bathroom. And each month, she pays Grace G. $325 in rent. 
 As hard times persist, more and more middle-class people around the country who never thought of taking in boarders are now quietly doing so, hoping to use the extra money to help pay mortgages or other debts that counted while the economy sagged.
Though there are no statistics on how many people are renting out rooms for the first time, services that place boarders say that in the last year, they have received a surge of inquiries from the kinds of homeowners they had hardly ever heard from: middle-class professionals living in expensive suburbs.
"There has been a great increase," said Mark W. Smith, president of Roommate Connection, which places boarders in the Boston area. "People are now registering with us who in years past would not have. People are very insecure about their futures, so they are taking in boarders to pad their savings accounts."
Many of these homeowners do not want their relatives, friends and neighbors to know outsiders are living with them, or that they have financial problems.
And some of these homeowners also do not report the rent as income on their Federal and state tax returns; some are violating zoning laws.
Perhaps most important, many people say that in their communities, taking in boarders is taboo. It is a custom of the poor and working classes, not of people living in expensive houses in quiet suburbs.
"We feel, the more private, the better," said an executive at a small computer company who is renting a room in his colonial-style four-bedroom house in Montvale, N.J., a suburb of New York City. "It's not something you jump up on a soapbox and talk about."
Like most of the homeowners interviewed, the man insisted that he not be identified. He and his wife took in a boarder, he said, because he feared being laid off and wanted another source of income.
"My job is only as safe as a job can be these days," he said, adding that the careers of a number of his friends in his field had been devastated by the recession.
He said his family had agonized over losing privacy and possibly renting to a noisy, messy or irresponsible boarder. He and his wife drew up a questionnaire for prospective tenants and agreed on some rules: no smoking, no guests, no loud music.
Their second-floor guest room was first taken by a 29-year-old electronics engineer, who paid $110 a week. He left in early December, after staying for a year.
A few weeks later, a 43-year-old executive of Mercedes-Benz moved in. That boarder, who also owns a house in southern New Jersey, usually spends four nights a week in Montvale, which is near his office.
He has his own bathroom and enters the house through a side entrance, so the family members see him only a few times a week, mostly in the kitchen.
"In the first few weeks, it wasn't so much apprehension as it was trying to discover some kind of feeling," the computer executive said.
Last month, Catherine Hanley began looking for a boarder for the upstairs bedroom in her 4,500-square-foot home in Carollton, Tex., a suburb of Dallas. "We think the money would be nice," she said, "but the loss of privacy and security is a little threatening."
Mrs. Hanley, who is a French teacher, said her husband, Timothy, recently lost his job as a claims manager for an insurance company. Mr. Hanley, 54 years old, had worked for the company for 25 years.
They bought their three-bedroom brick house in 1990, expecting that his salary and hers would pay the bills. Now they need the $500 a month a boarder would pay.
Grace G., who is divorced and works for a cosmetics company, had similar reservations the first time she advertised for a boarder. She lives with her 90-year-old mother and her 29-year-old daughter, who is a singer.
"I was very frightened because I didn't feel trusting," said Grace G., who is 54 years old. "But I figured that if I didn't do this, I would have to sell my house and move."
Now she has grown accustomed to the arrangement and enjoys the company of a boarder as well as the chance to meet new people, like the college student who lived in her house for six months. She now rents to a 32-year-old artist.
Besides adjusting to losing domain over part of their home, some of the new landlords said they felt forced to change their habits.
In December, Maj. David P. Dauer of the Army rented the basement of his town house in Reston, Va., to Rob Casto, an architect. Mr. Casto, who was referred by Roommates Preferred, a service in Washington that places boarders, pays $450 a month and has his own entrance.
Major Dauer, who works for the Defense Department in Washington, took in the boarder because he was worried about supporting his three children and his wife, Heather, who left her job with a telecommunications company after the children were born.
"Our expenses are going up rather than going down," he said. "Initially, I brought it up as just an off-the-wall type idea. But when I thought about it, the pieces fell into shape. It was my idea, but I had to convince my wife."
Major Dauer said he had become more accustomed to Mr. Casto than his children had. Now, they have to be quiet in the evening so they do not disturb the boarder.
"Our 4-year-old is still trying to figure out what this strange person is doing in our house," Major Dauer said.
He also said he had grown fond of Mr. Casto. They have similar interests, like construction.
Still, even after many months, some homeowners who have taken in boarders remain uncomfortable with the arrangement. They say they are always on guard.
"I do a lot of praying so that I'm protected and so that nothing happens to me," said a women renting out a room in her four-bedroom ranch house in Hialeah, Fla. "You just don't know."

Investigating a Murder Japan Wants Unsolved

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT

 BODY:

Rising Sun
By Michael Crichton
355 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $22.
In his novel "Jurassic Park," Michael Crichton invented an island theme park where dinosaurs came to life and wreaked bloody havoc on visitors from the North American mainland. In his new novel, "Rising Sun," he has dreamed up an even greater threat to Americans: the Japanese. 
 In "Rising Sun," Mr. Crichton steps into a classroom with a pointer, dims the lights and enacts a violent murder mystery. At its opening, Peter J. Smith, a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department who specializes in liaison work with foreign nationals, describes being summoned to investigate a murder that occurred at the gala opening of the Nakamoto Tower, the American headquarters of Nakamoto Industries. On the way, he picks up a senior officer in his department, John Connor, who immediately starts lecturing him on the difficulties of dealing with the Japanese.
Upon arriving at the party, Smith and Connor learn that the murder victim is a beautiful young woman named Cheryl Lynn Austin, known to have been involved with kinky sex, and that her killing was recorded on Nakamoto's highly sophisticated video surveillance system, which had been installed to "kaizen" the company's office workers; that is, "to observe workers during the day, and help them improve their efficiency."
But they also run into strong resistance to their investigation from one of Nakamoto's senior executives. And they soon discover that the tapes have been tampered with and cannot easily be analyzed because, as various characters explain, Japan is far advanced over the United States in the technology of video recording, and is able, through its insidious penetration of American society, to prevent Smith and Connor from doing their work.
Despite such obstacles, the plot of "Rising Sun" does thicken at a satisfying pace, and Smith and Connor are soon fighting an extensive cover-up whose motives reach to the heart of the Japanese industrial system. In the progress of the mystery's unwinding, we are treated to a cleverly contrived series of surprises, which occasionally even surpass plot expedience and take on the deep colorings of human irrationality.
Yet we never go for long without hearing the whack of Professor Crichton's classroom pointer against the slate of the blackboard. In his lectures, he attempts to illustrate how the Japanese compete with us unfairly, how they have taken away our manufacturing base, how they are rapidly buying up our remaining resources, how they are planning to run our economy and make us play inferior roles in it, how they have hired a vast army of lobbyists to blind us to what is happening and how when people try to point all this out they are accused of being racist when in fact Japan itself is a profoundly racist culture.
As a typical snatch of the novel's dialogue reads: " 'The Japanese can be tough,' Connor said. 'They say "business is war," and they mean it. You know how Japan is always telling us that their markets are open. Well, in the old days, if a Japanese bought an American car, he got audited by the Government. So pretty soon, nobody bought an American car. The officials shrug: what can they do? Their market is open: they can't help it if nobody wants an American car. The obstructions are endless. Every imported car has to be individually tested on the dock to make sure it complies with exhaust-emission laws. Foreign drugs can only be tested in Japanese laboratories on Japanese nationals. Foreign skis were once banned because Japanese snow was said to be wetter than European and American snow. That's the way they treat other countries, so it's not surprising they worry about getting a taste of their own medicine.' "
In short, by the time he springs his last considerable plot surprise, Mr. Crichton has managed to sum up the entire case made by books critical of Japan like Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr.'s "Trading Places: How We Are Giving Our Future to Japan and How to Reclaim It" (Basic Books), Karel van Wolferen's "Enigma of Japanese Power" (Knopf) and Pat Choates's "Agents of Influence" (Knopf), which are listed at the end in a bibliography along with more than three dozen other books pertinent in various degrees to Japanese-American relations. This back matter is introduced with a remark by Akio Morita, the founder of the Sony Corporation, "If you don't want Japan to buy it, don't sell it."
The trouble with "Rising Sun" is obviously that as a serious discourse on why we should begin waging economic war against Japan, the book is far too entertaining. And as an entertainment, it is far too didactic. Whenever you begin to worry over how far down the road the country may have gone toward selling its birthright, you recall that this is a highly contrived fiction. And whenever you begin to sweat over the trouble Peter Smith is getting into, you are snapped out of it by the sound of that pointer hitting on the blackboard.
Call this dystopian fiction then, the opposite of Edward Bellamy's utopian "Looking Backward" and more like Orson Welles's famous Mercury Theater of the Air adaptation of H. G. Wells's "War of the Worlds." Yet pray that it doesn't send people running hysterically into the streets, crying for another bombing of Japan, but instead moves them to thoughtful debate. "Rising Sun" is remarkably timely, given this country's increasing frustration over its Far Eastern rival. It even makes one wonder if contending with Japan isn't going to be the United States' next great mission now that the cold war is over. But let us also hope that Mr. Crichton's assiduously researched fantasy does not turn out to be too extremely timely.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
Deal Maker a Torchbearer? Trump Wants Olympics Here

BYLINE: By GERALD ESKENAZI

 BODY:
Donald Trump once rebuilt the skating rink in Central Park in four months. His latest dream is to bring the Summer Olympics to New York in the year 2004.
But it may be easier to get a casino permit in New Jersey than to convince the United States Olympic Committee that the Big Apple could manage the feat. The city was turned down for the 1984 Games (awarded to Los Angeles) despite the efforts of a committee headed by a former city official and businessman, Richard Ravitch. 
 And just this week, the city lost an Indy-car race it was to hold in September when talks broke down with the sponsor. The city also lost the Jets to Giants Stadium in New Jersey in 1984 when it was unable to come up with a timetable to refurbish Shea Stadium and its leaky bathrooms.
Still, Trump said in an interview that he spoke to Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday about his idea. "The Mayor responded favorably," said Trump. Ruby Ryles, a spokeswoman for Dinkins, said she could not reach him to confirm the conversation.
In any event, the U.S.O.C. must deal with an elected city official, and not an individual, even one as well known as Trump.
 
'Extraordinary Opportunity'
 Despite Trump's embattled financial empire, the builder sounded upbeat.
"This is an extraordinary opportunity and we will be bringing the Olympics to New York City, where it belongs," he said. "Hopefully, it will give a great boost to the economy."
Trump would not comment further. But it is known that he is a good friend of George Steinbrenner, the embattled majority owner of the Yankees, who also serves on the U.S.O.C.
But where would these Games take place? Trump is known to favor the construction of a stadium adjacent to Shea Stadium in Flushing, Queens. If not, he says that Giants Stadium could accommodate the Games. But that venue would have to be reconfigured, with stands removed, to house a 400-meter racing oval.
Trump would prefer the attendant drama of an Olympics in the year 2000. But that, apparently, cannot happen. The Games, staged every four years, have never been held consecutively in the same country. And Atlanta is already the host for the 1996 Games. Furthermore, the deadline for submitting bids to the U.S.O.C. for 2000 has passed.
As yet, only one United States city has approached the committee to be the host for 2004: Boston.
Trump's plans are so preliminary that a consortium of business leaders he plans to include -- such as the Tisch Brothers, Lew Rudin, and the heads of the three major television networks -- have not yet received letters telling them of his idea.
 
The Mayor Is the Man
 "Under no circumstances would we deal with an individual," said Mike Moran, director of information for the U.S.O.C. "The only person we'd deal with is the mayor of a city."
Trump was praised for finishing the skating rink after the city spent seven years and made little progress. But he also received a public black eye for his first venture in sports.
That was with the now-defunct United States Football League. Trump bought the New Jersey Generals, who played in Giants Stadium, and began hiring high-priced players, notably Herschel Walker and Doug Flutie. Trump then spearheaded a move to shift the league out of its springtime schedule and into the fall, where, presumably, it could compete against the National Football League.
Trump's profligacy was blamed for killing the league.

HEADLINE: Haiti: Tighten the Embargo

 BODY:
Rampaging military hard-liners have torpedoed a promising Haitian political compromise mediated by the Organization of American States. As a result more Haitians are dying, more are fleeing for their lives, and the eventual task of reconstruction has been made more difficult. The hard-liners seem unlikely to permit any settlement unless forced to by a more stringent regional economic embargo.
The embargo was imposed by the O.A.S. in the aftermath of the Sept. 30, 1991, military coup against Haiti's first freely elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Though it applied only to Western Hemisphere countries, the embargo was effective at first. By late November, critical supplies of gasoline were nearly exhausted. 
 But since then, three oil tankers have unloaded their cargoes. Haitian authorities say they have two months' worth of oil reserves. The leverage of regional diplomats over military and civilian leaders has been noticeably weakened.
Earlier this month, diplomats persuaded President Aristide to accept Rene Theodore as prime minister, a concession to critics of the mob violence that marred the President's seven months in power. Though a Communist, Mr. Theodore is a moderate who enjoys U.S. support.
But when it came time to ratify the Theodore appointment, Parliament backed off. Mr. Theodore has now become the target of a campaign of military intimidation. Last Saturday, police under army command attacked a meeting at which he was host, gunning down his bodyguard and brutalizing other national political figures.
With passions running high, compromises won't come easily. But without more pressure on the men controlling the guns, compromises won't come at all. A new torrent of refugees has made Washington eager for a quick solution.
The Bush Administration is now trying to decide how to step up pressure on Haiti's hard-liners. Invasion and occupation, Grenada or Panama style, is a bad idea. A 20-year U.S. occupation earlier this century did little to solve Haiti's problems. Freezing assets of the Haitian elite in this country might send a useful message.
But the most straightforward approach would be to add U.S. naval muscle to the existing O.A.S. blockade. Humanitarian deliveries could be increased, on a carefully monitored basis, even as the overall net is tightened.
Only by standing up to the hard-liners can Haiti be returned to democratic rule and its people delivered from their cruel ordeal.

HEADLINE: The Tinkerer;
Mr. Bush's New War, and Paper Sword

 BODY:
"This will not stand." George Bush's steely challenge to Saddam Hussein remains one of his most memorable expressions. Tuesday night, mired in recession and fighting for his political life, Mr. Bush invoked those words again in his State of the Union address. "I look at hard times and make this vow: This will not stand." This will not fly would be more like it.
When the President resurrects the metaphor of Desert Storm to demonstrate his commitment to economic recovery, he might reasonably be expected to deliver a program to match the threat. But nowhere did he come close to the economic equivalent of 550,000 troops. What his speech and new budget offer instead is a laundry list with no main text. What they disclose is not an anti-recession warrior but a tinkerer. 
 Give the President this much: He did not sugar-coat his problems. The state of the Union, he confessed, is not good; the time had come for him to "look homeward." Give him this, too: It's neither unexpected nor wrong for a President who's been under fire for ignoring domestic needs to look for an oratorical fix. Unfortunately, the President's rhetoric also illuminates how marginal are his remedies.
Time and again, Churchillian flourishes introduced blinding banalities. "This time, at this hour," he thundered, "I cannot take No for an answer." No to what? A capital gains tax cut! "The power of America rests in a stirring but simple idea: that people will do great things if only you set them free." How do that? Among other things, "modify the passive loss rule"!
If Mr. Bush gets lucky, and the economy comes around on its own steam, he may win applause for not having reached for more dramatic initiatives. Moreover, the first third of the speech, celebrating the triumph of democracy and the fortitude of its American defenders, was sharply written and compellingly delivered.
Mr. Bush hasn't come close to honoring his pledge to be the "environment President" and the "education President." But he finds himself in the enviable position of truly becoming the "disarmament President." This weekend, he pointedly reminded his audience, it is he -- not Clinton, Kerrey, Harkin, Tsongas or anybody else -- who'll meet with Boris Yeltsin to discuss $50 billion in arms cuts. A reduction in nuclear stockpiles will do nothing to hurt his chances in November.
What will hurt is a stingy response to real economic problems. And that's all, after weeks of buildup, that Mr. Bush now offers. Where his budget proposals are timid they should have been bold, and where they are bold they are often wrong. Hundreds of ideas spread over 600 pages, many individually meritorious, add up to a program that solves no problem well.
The serious response to recession he promised in New Hampshire amounts to little more than an accelerated schedule of tax refunds -- a rearrangement of timing, but not the amount, of tax bills. The President is justifiably wary of signing onto plans favored by some Democrats that include huge tax cuts and spending hikes. But there are safe ways to deliver adrenaline. A temporary across-the-board cut in payroll and income taxes of, say, $80 billion wouldn't raise the long-term deficit yet could stop a slide into deeper recession.
In his new budget, the President likewise ducks for cover on health care. To control skyrocketing costs, he firmly rejects Government price controls in favor of the discipline of competitive markets. But markets can't work unless consumers have incentive to seek cost-effective insurance. Budget Director Richard Darman originally urged therefore that wealthy families not get a full tax break for deluxe insurance. The budget language was killed; if the proposal is too, Mr. Bush will have undermined his program.
Mr. Bush proposes lavish tax breaks on real estate investors, capital gains and retirement savings. Yet the tax code already subsidizes real estate. And his insistence on cutting the capital gains tax rate remains extravagant and illogical. How would it promote future investment to cut taxes on past investment?
The new budget does contain one admirable clarion call. Mr. Darman focuses on mandatory spending -- programs driven by formulas rather than yearly appropriations. Means-tested entitlements like Medicare and unemployment insurance now account for an astonishing $800 billion. If such programs, excluding Social Security, could be held to a modest increase, the five-year saving would be enough to balance the budget. So Mr. Darman boldly proposes cutting subsidies for, among others, affluent farmers and rich Medicare recipients.
The trouble with this display of courage is that Mr. Darman knows its certain fate on Capitol Hill: This will not stand. However sensible, it's just another idea in a welter of proposals. If Mr. Bush wants to lead America in a wholehearted attack on recession, it will take more than a paper sword. If, conversely, he thinks the right thing to do is stay the course, let him say so.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Middle Class Hang-Up

BYLINE: By Ted Van Dyk; Ted Van Dyk is a longtime Democratic strategist.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
With style and shrewdness, Gov. Bill Clinton appears to have beaten the rap on his philandering and emerged stronger than he was before the Gennifer Flowers episode came up. Unless a second shoe (or bedroom slipper) drops to indicate he's a liar, his national exposure during his troubles has helped establish him more clearly as the Democrats' front-runner and likely nominee.
Now he faces a real challenge: to move beyond poll-driven boiler plate to presentation of a strong, relevant agenda that will genuinely address the country's problems and give voters a real reason to elect him. 
 Governor Clinton enters the New Hampshire primary homestretch with far more money and a stronger organization than his competitors. The media, perhaps overcompensating for window-peeping, are giving him more generous and ample coverage than the other Democrats. If he wins, as expected, his competitors may well be down and broke. This would provide an opportunity to forget parts of his platform that falsely promise voters pleasure without pain, and to draw real differences between President Bush and himself.
First, the Governor should abandon his shameless pandering to the middle class. Hardly a sentence passes his mouth without use of the words "middle class." The first two economic planks of his Plan for America's Future are naked tax cut appeals to voters that would do justice to Ronald Reagan. The first, titled Tax Relief for the Forgotten Middle Class, says "we should cut middle class taxes immediately by 10 percent." The second, an expanded children's tax credit, would provide an immediate $480 annual tax saving for each child in an "average income" family.
To provide billions of dollars to pay for these cuts, the Governor proposes vaguely to close unspecified tax loopholes for the rich, soak high income individuals and cut the Federal bureaucracy. In other words, he has no idea where he'd find the money but is making promises anyway and socking easy targets in the bargain.
More disturbing than the tax cut grandstanding is the shorthand at work in the repetitive use of "middle class." In 1980's and early 1990's political parlance, the term has been a code phrase used by moderate and conservative Democratic candidates to mean "taxpayers, not tax-eaters." Repeated and emphasized often, it signals 1980's Reagan Democrats that it is safe to come home to their party because poor, black, Hispanic, urban, homeless, hungry, and other people and problems out of favor in Middle America will no longer get the favored treatment they got from mushy 1960's and 1970's Democratic liberals.
The Governor also needs to clean up his act on trade. Leading Arkansas, dependent on international trade, he began his campaign by resisting the protectionism preached by Tom Harkin and Bob Kerrey. But he recently has used "getting tough on trade" and other code phrases, sprinkled with references to Japan, all meant to imply that foreign devils rather than our own failings are to blame for our economic weakness.
America needs a modern infrastructure; better educated, housed and nourished people; training and retraining for its workforce; an all-out attack on the homelessness, crime and drugs crushing urban areas, and a plan for economic investment and growth that will keep us competitive in changing world markets while reducing the red ink of the Reagan-Bush years. It will get none of these things through tax cut grandstanding, pandering to the middle class and easy protectionist jargon.
I've known Bill Clinton since 1972, when he joined the McGovern Presidential campaign as a young organizer. That Bill Clinton was filled with idealism, wanted to end the Vietnam War and was committed to justice for people without power. He has adjusted those views to succeed in populist but conservative border-state politics. Now he needs to think and act in a broader setting.
With the hard part nearly behind him, he needs to get serious -- beginning with tomorrow night's nationally televised prime-time debate among the Democratic Presidential candidates on the Public Broadcasting Service.

HEADLINE: Our Place in the Western Community

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I don't believe you go far enough in "American Abdication in Europe" (editorial, Jan. 11). It's not merely domination of Europe by Germany we have to worry about, but also our own position in the world.
By the end of the century, Europe will be united. Even a reluctant Britain will have joined the European Community, which will expand to include the balance of the Western European countries and Eastern Europe as well. Boris N. Yeltsin, the Russian President, has already asked for admission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the World Bank. In a few years, Russia and the other commonwealth nations will be in both, probably also in the E.C., creating a European market stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific, with close to a billion bright, industrious people, as inventive as we and richer in natural resources, especially with a developed Russian oil industry. 
 At the same time, Japan will lead the East, including the young tigers, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia and Thailand, and a reinvigorated China once its old-line leaders are no longer with us. India and Pakistan will lag, but they'll lean toward the East, while Africa will be in need for generations, eventually joining the West. This will leave us with Canada and the poorer nations of Central and South America. In such a competition, we would finish a distant third.
While it may be a hard pill for us proud Americans to swallow, our only chance to survive in this coming worldwide contest is by no longer thinking of ourselves as No. 1 but as a senior partner in a new confederation. If we don't want to be fighting constant wars to prove our weapons superiority or serve as hired policemen for the wealthier countries, we must stay in NATO and be as close as possible to the E.C., made up of countries from which most of our citizens emigrated.
If we're invited to join, we should. Canada would surely be allowed in immediately. Our other hemisphere neighbors, like the Eastern European countries, would follow as they qualified. African nations will be assisted, then welcomed into the community as their economies expanded.
I recognize that this is even more difficult to sell to the United States public than Franklin D. Roosevelt's attempt to get us into World War II before Pearl Harbor. He set the stage by giving aid to Britain, including warplanes. We'll have to use NATO as our steppingstone, but we must not allow ourselves to fall behind. We saved Europe. Let's unite with those countries before they leave us in the dust. It's human to forget past favors, like our having saved them from Hitler. It's going to be a two-power world, East and West. We must be an integral part of the West of the future, and that future is tomorrow, not the day after.

HEADLINE: Bethlehem Halts Dividends And Plans Cuts After Loss

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
The Bethlehem Steel Corporation, after reporting a loss of $638.1 million for the fourth quarter, said yesterday that it would cut its work force by 6,500 and stop paying its annual stock dividend.
The job cuts at the nation's second-largest steelmaker will amount to about 25 percent of the work force. The reductions will be made over the next two years through layoffs, early retirement programs and sales of parts of the company. 
 Like other big steelmakers whose main customers include the depressed auto, construction and machinery industries, Bethlehem has been buffeted anew by recession, low prices and competition from smaller, more efficient steel mills. The USX Corporation, which owns the nation's largest steelmaker, said on Tuesday that its steel group lost $165 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $51 million a year ago.
Bethlehem's jarring cutbacks will sever the company's historic link to workers and steel products made under the Bethlehem banner in Johnstown, Pa., since 1908.
The 1991 quarterly loss exceeded the loss of $516.8 million for the comparable 1990 quarter. Sales fell 14.2 percent, to $1.03 billion, from $1.2 billion in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. The latest loss included a one-time charge of $575 million for anticipated costs in the restructuring. Analysts said most of the costs were associated with severance, pension and health-care plans for the large number of workers who will leave the company by the end of 1993.
For the year, Bethlehem lost $767 million, compared with a loss of $463.5 million in 1990. Sales fell nearly 12 percent, to $4.32 billion from $4.9 billion.
The company said it would stop paying the annual dividend of 40 cents a share on its common stock to conserve cash. Bethlehem shares fell $2.25 yesterday, closing at $13.75 on the Big Board.
The company said it would search for buyers for the bar, rod and wire division based in Johnstown, but would close any plants in the unit that it did not sell. The unit includes 2,600 workers, with 1,900 in Johnstown and another 700 at plants in Lackawanna, N.Y., and near Baltimore in Sparrows Point, Md.
It also plans to sell a plant in Steelton, Pa., with 400 jobs, and several coal mines in West Virginia, which employ 800. Another 400 jobs will be lost from the shutdown of coke oven batteries at Sparrows Point. The rest of the job reductions will be throughout the company.
"We have been experiencing losses at these facilities for some time, and there is no reasonable prospect for their return to profitability," said Walter F. Williams, chairman and chief executive. He blamed environmental regulations, high labor costs, competition and imports for the decision.
But analysts said the steelmaker, based in Bethlehem, Pa., had dragged its feet, hoping to survive in a niche of the domestic steel business now dominated by smaller, lower-cost mini-mills. The smaller mills typically have lower cost advantages from newer equipment and nonunion work forces.
 
Once Employed 289,000
 The cutbacks will reduce Bethlehem's work force to 20,000, a staggering decline from 157,000 workers in 1953, when the steel industry was one of the most powerful forces on the nation's industrial landscape. Bethlehem's peak employment was 289,000 in 1943, during a wartime campaign to build 1,110 warships. Bethlehem acquired the Johnstown works some 56 years after it opened in 1852 as the Cambria Iron Company to make steel rails for the Pennsylvania Railroad.
Analysts said workers at the plants Bethlehem wants to sell probably would lose their jobs, at least for a while. That steel is sold mainly to auto makers and machinery manufacturers, who have increasingly turned to mini-mills like Nucor and Chaparral Steel for shipments since the early 1980's.
"The problem is that people working there are not interested in accepting concessions, having jobs or wages cut," said John E. Jacobson, an analyst at AUS Consultants in Philadelphia. "Once plants are closed for a few years, workers often lower their expectations" and buyers move in, he said.
But leaders of the United Steelworkers of America said Bethlehem rejected the union's cost-cutting proposals for the Johnstown division last year. "The union did everything it could to keep the division alive," said Andrew V. Palm, head of the union's District 15, which includes the Johnstown plant.
"We believed we had a handshake deal last summer" to change the labor agreement, he said. And Bethlehem intended to invest $140 million to $180 million for a new continuous caster and other equipment. But Bethlehem's directors rejected the agreement, he said.
Analysts said losses in the steel industry for 1991 would exceed $1 billion, partly because of slumping demand and prices that fell last summer to the lowest level in 10 years.

HEADLINE: CHINA SAID TO SELL PARTS FOR MISSILES

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO with ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
American intelligence reports indicate that China is continuing to sell missile technology to Syria and Pakistan despite statements by Chinese leaders that they are willing to curb missile exports, according to senior Administration officials.
Beijing has recently delivered to Syria about 30 tons of chemicals needed to make a solid-fuel missile and plans to deliver an additional 60 tons in March or April, said the officials, who added that the amount was enough to make a "significant" number of intermediate-range missiles. 
 It has also delivered to Pakistan guidance units that could be used to control the flight of M-11 ballistic missiles, they added.
The issue is important because the United States is ready to lift the sanctions on the sale of American satellite parts and high-speed computers that were imposed last spring after the United States learned that China had secretly delivered launchers for M-11 missiles to Pakistan.
President Bush, who favors removal of the sanctions, will raise the issue of China's proliferation practices when he meets at the United Nations on Friday with China's Prime Minister, Li Peng. Leading lawmakers and human rights organizations have sharply criticized the meeting, the first between the leaders since Chinese troops crushed the democracy movement in China in June 1989.
During the visit of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to Beijing in November, Chinese officials said they would abide by the provisions of a 1987 international agreement restricting the export of missiles and missile technology, but only if the Administration lifted the sanctions.
The Administration has made the issue of nonproliferation a linchpin of its post-cold-war foreign policy, and is especially eager to halt the transfer of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missiles to the developing world.
The President's plan to meet with Mr. Li reflects Mr. Bush's firm belief that the best way to moderate China's behavior is through dialogue, a strategy that has been criticized even inside the Adminstration.
"There was great controversy about whether the President should even meet Li Peng," a senior Administration official said. "It raised the whole debate about how best to bring the Chinese along -- by stiff-arming them or by coaxing them when they make a few moves in the right direction."
Administration officials have played down the significance of Friday's meeting, describing it as a short encounter and as a "courtesy" to the Chinese, who requested it.
When asked at a briefing today whether an announcement to lift sanctions was imminent, a State Department spokesman, Joe Snyder, said that once the two Governments completed the agreement reached during Mr. Baker's meeting in November, "the Administration plans to take the steps necessary to lift the June 1991 sanctions."
"We have no set timetable for lifting the sanctions," he said.
 
Divisions in Administration
 There are deep divisions in the Administration over the wisdom of lifting the sanctions. Many intelligence officials and some senior Pentagon officials oppose any easing of restrictions, while the White House is clearly in favor of such a move.
The State Department notified Congress in a letter in mid-December that it intends to lift the sanctions. But resistance by Chinese leaders to an American demand that they put their oral promise to Mr. Baker in writing has contributed to a delay, Administration officials said.
Some non-proliferation experts in the Administration are convinced that the recent sales to Syria and Pakistan would constitute clear violations of the agreement, known as the Missile Technology Control Regime, which was devised by the United States and other powers to limit the supply of ballistic missiles to the developing world.
But other officials use a broader interpretation, saying it is nearly impossible to determine whether the transfer of certain technology that might have dual uses is a violation.
The suspicion felt toward China in some quarters of the Administration was reflected in remarks by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney after a speech in Wisconsin this week. Mr. Cheney said that his "prime concern" with regard to China was proliferation.
"They have in the past, on occasion, been less than scrupulous in their concern for maintaining control over that technology," he said.
 
China's Policy 'Worrisome'
 Similarly, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee last week, Lieut. Gen. James R. Clapper Jr., Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, called Chinese arms sales and proliferation policies "worrisome," adding, "China is currently assisting many of the nations that we estimate will acquire a ballistic missile capability by the end of the decade."
China has vigorously denied selling entire missiles or warheads to Syria, Pakistan or any other country in the Middle East or Southwest Asia. Indeed, American officials say there is no proof Beijing has shipped such weapons.
Many American officials and independent non-proliferation experts have expressed growing concern, however, that China is circumventing the spirit of missile-control agreements by selling missile components. Such transfers are significant because developing countries can assemble the parts and, in some cases, market the technology themselves.
"These transfers would help both Syria and Pakistan develop a manufacturing capability for their own missiles and would even allow them to proliferate missiles to other countries," said Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, a private group. "It happens at the very time that China is promising to change its behavior."
 
Limitations to Guidelines
 A senior Pentagon official acknowledged the limitations of the missile control guidelines, saying they were "a way to keep a lid on things, but not strictly control" proliferation.
American intelligence reports over the last few years have also shown that China has discussed with Iranian officials the possible sale of M-9 missiles.
Launchers and M-11 training missiles were delivered to Pakistan last year, despite Beijing's pledges not to sell medium-range missiles in the Middle East and Southwest Asia. The Chinese view the M-11, which is said to have a range of about 180 miles and can carry a nuclear warhead, as a short-range missile, although the United States considers it a medium-range missile covered by the missile technology agreement.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Democrats Anxiously Monitor Clinton's Strength

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
These are jittery days for the Democrats, as they monitor the vital signs of Gov. Bill Clinton's campaign and watch the horizon for signs of a new candidate.
One Democrat on Capitol Hill described it as "CNN emotions," the unending ripples of political anxiety in the party since a supermarket tabloid leveled accusations that Mr. Clinton conducted a 12-year affair with a cabaret singer. 
 Mr. Clinton's allies say he is through the worst of the "feeding frenzy," and his campaign asserts that the candidate is back on track after denying the singer's accusations.
But Democrats -- those sympathetic to Mr. Clinton and those who hope he stumbles -- are still trying to assess the damage, and almost inevitably some Democrats are wondering whether other candidates will enter the race.
Howard Gelt, the Democratic chairman of Colorado, said, "There's been a little bit of talk out here, just as there's been around the country: Where's Al Gore, where's Sam Nunn, where's Mario -- again. That's just a nervousness that exists."
Mr. Gelt says the Arkansas Governor seems to be bearing up under the furor, but many Democrats argue that the real verdict on his political strength will come in the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 18.
The Clinton campaign is trying to declare the crisis over. George Stephanopolous, deputy campaign manager for Mr. Clinton, said today: "Look at the facts. The fact is, at the height of the scandal, Clinton raised almost half a million dollars in three days and received public endorsements from a host of public officials, while the polls either held steady or rose in New Hampshire."
He added, "The public has indicated it really didn't pay much attention to trash-for-cash journalism, and wanted to get back to the real issues."
Spokesmen for the potential candidates most often speculated about, including Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, dismiss the notion that they are reconsidering a race.
In a typical response, Jack DeVore, a spokesman for Senator Bentsen, said, "He has declined, when asked, to join in any of the speculation." Mr. DeVore added, "He has consistently been getting a lot of calls, and yes, the number of calls has increased."
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo reiterated this week that New York State's budget difficulties continued to preclude him from joining the race.
Mr. Gephardt is a favorite of many party insiders, because of his experience in the 1988 campaign and his message of economic nationalism, considered particularly acute during a recession. But spokesmen say he is planning to run for re-election to the Congress this year, although in an interview on NBC's "Today" program this week he did not seem to close the door completely on a Presidential bid.
The other campaigns are moving to quash the notion that a late-entry strategy could work. The campaign of Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska recently prepared a memorandum that outlined how difficult it would be for a candidate to enter the race at this point.
"In light of the Clinton situation, a lot of people would probably want to reconsider whether they'd like to be candidates this year," said Tad Devine, campaign director for Mr. Kerrey. "But I think if they look at it seriously, they will find they're effectively foreclosed because they will not be able to satisfy the filing requirements in a large number of states."
 
Missing the Deadlines
 Any new candidate would face formidable hurdles: By the end of January, filing deadlines will have passed in 18 states, which produce 40 percent of the pledged delegates to the convention, according to the Democratic National Committee. By the time the New Hampshire primary is over, filing deadlines will have passed in 27 states, covering nearly 60 percent of the pledged delegates, those who are chosen on the basis of primary and caucus results and are committed to particular candidates.
Still, Thomas E. Donilon, who was a delegate hunter for both Walter F. Mondale in 1984 and President Jimmy Carter in 1980, said a late entry, while unlikely, was "certainly not impossible." And Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said, "It's never too late, but I think that speculation is being grossly overstated."
In fact, all the talk may be only a sign of an unsettled race. Mr. Clinton has presented himself as the most "electable" candidate in the field, and many in his party, conservative and liberal, seemed to believe him. "What I hear from Democrats is down deep they hope he can survive this thing because they don't see anybody else who could be the nominee," said Natalie Davis, a member of the Democratic National Committee from Alabama, who described herself as uncommitted.
Just a few weeks ago, many of his supporters saw him on a painless glide path to an early nomination. Now, his rivals sense an opening, although they are careful not to seem to be capitalizing on his misfortune.
"My sense of Clinton's support was that it was powered very much by a perception here that he was the candidate best able to beat Bush," said Mr. Devine, interviewed by telephone in New Hampshire this week. "We'll have to see if that perception is damaged.
Tim Raftis, who heads the campaign of Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, argues, "I sense people are rethinking his electability argument, and not just on that, but also on his record in Arkansas."
All of this heightens the importance of New Hampshire, which will render the first primary verdict on Mr. Clinton's handling of the furor, including his appearance on the CBS News program "60 Minutes" and his acknowledgement of past difficulties in his marriage.
 
'I Want to Win'
 "This is all inane, stupid and insulting, and I hope the American people jam it down your-all's throat," Bob Slagle, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Texas, told reporters. "The national press corps is acting like a common street gossip in a small town."
Still, other Democrats are holding back. Representative Bob Wise of West Virginia, who said he was uncommitted but "very interested" in Mr. Clinton, said he wanted to wait a bit to see how well the Governor weathered the storm. "I want to win," Mr. Wise said. "I just don't want to have my heart broken one more time by somebody falling down."
Indeed, an important part of the party's psychology is the increasing conviction that Mr. Bush can be beaten -- if the Democrats rise to the moment. "The general attitude is, we can win it," said Mr. Brown, the party chairman. "I see Democrats all around the country, and the first thing they say to me is, we gotta win this thing. And if I say, who are you for, they say, 'I'm for the guy who can beat George Bush.' "

HEADLINE: Dinkins Orders Deep Cuts In an Austere Budget Plan

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins put forward an austere $29.4 billion spending plan yesterday that called for heavy cuts for all city agencies except the Police Department in the next fiscal year while holding the line on property taxes through 1996.
"I won't be glib," he said. "This plan does not contain much good news for New Yorkers in the short run. Someday I hope to be a good-news Mayor, presiding over good economic times." 
 The preliminary budget for the fiscal year beginning on July 1, which comes in the third year of the Mayor's four-year term, reflects the problem that has plagued him throughout his administration: how to satisfy increasingly demanding state fiscal watchdogs without abandoning his liberal agenda.
His approach is to be fiscally conservative while protecting his ambitious plan to expand the Police Department and shielding some social programs serving the poor, like drop-in centers for the homeless and infant mortality programs.
The cuts range widely among city agencies, but not evenly. The plan, which is subject to City Council approval, would put more police officers on the streets but fewer teachers in the schools and would settle for dirtier parks and more potholes.
The spending plan outlines a budget for the next fiscal year and shows how the Mayor proposes to keep the budget balanced in the three fiscal years after that. It avoids layoffs but freezes wages over the next two years. Leaders of the city's municipal labor unions said yesterday that they were pleased that the plan contained no layoffs but were concerned that it did not do enough to save jobs.
 
A Long Political Struggle
 The preliminary budget, only the first step in a long political struggle before a final budget is adopted in June, quickly drew cautious praise from the Council leaders and state fiscal monitors who had criticized earlier versions of the Mayor's long-term fiscal vision as unrealistic and timid.
The Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, a Democrat who controls enough votes in the Council to pass the final budget, said the plan was a good starting point for negotiations. "This is the first budget we've received from the Mayor that is a major step in the right direction," he said.
The budget now goes to the Council for preliminary hearings.
To fill a projected $1.5 billion gap in the next fiscal year and larger shortfalls in the next three years after that, the Mayor's spending plan proposes trimming more than 11,000 jobs through attrition by 1996; raising $115 million through new taxes on gasoline, automobiles and commuters' income next year; slashing spending on capital construction projects by 18 percent over four years, and freezing municipal wages at current levels for the first two years.
The plan also counts on "productivity" measures to pare $147 million from administrative and overhead costs of the sprawling municipal bureaucracy next year. For some agencies like the Social Services Department, the Mayor announced plans to take workers off the city payroll by, for instance, turning over the management of adult homeless shelters and some family preservation programs to private nonprofit groups.
Mr. Dinkins said his plan "doesn't depend on miracles or fiscal sleights of hand, doesn't put off till tomorrow the tough decisions that must be made today."
Still, the city's spending will actually rise by about $440 million next year, and the plan calls for cutting a mere 1,400 of the 211,000-strong municipal work force in the fiscal year beginning in June, though it promises to eliminate another 9,000 jobs by 1996. And while Mr. Dinkins proposed canceling construction projects ranging from new schools to a new jail on Staten Island, the bulk of the cuts will come in the last two years of the plan, in keeping with Mr. Dinkins's promise to fuel the local economy.
Among the plan's myriad effects, classes in schools would increase in size, about 50 percent fewer workers would be hired to fill potholes, parks would be visited by maintenance workers 8 times a month instead of 10 and the Fire Department would lose an engine company and two battalion command centers.
In a clear challenge to labor, the Mayor said he would freeze wages for the next two years unless municipal unions could pay for raises by saving through work-rule changes. He also said he would seek $150 million in labor concessions if some part of his plan fell apart.
Leaders of municipal labor unions warned that because the plan contained no wage increases in the next two years except through what is saved through concessions and work-rule changes, it would devastate city services and demoralize workers who may not be able to participate.
"We are not opposed to gain-sharing, but we are concerned that some union workers may not qualify for it because of the nature of the jobs," said Stanley Hill, president of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
Some of the larger cuts include $100 million in the 1993 fiscal year for the Board of Education, which will be asked to slash money for classroom supplies, after-school programs, summer school instruction and building maintenance. In the Sanitation Department, a cut of more than $36 million would mean the recycling program would not be expanded, and in the Transportation Department, a $31 million cut would curtail projects including street-sign repair and traffic engineering studies.
The plan calls for delaying a class of new police officers at the end of the 1993 fiscal year by a month to save money on paper by pushing the hiring into the next year's budget. But the Police Department will continue to grow over the next four years by 3,900 officers.
 
Crucial Element
 A crucial element in the Mayor's long-term fiscal plan is $700 million that would be raised by floating new city bonds and buying back older bonds now held by the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation. That would free sales tax revenues the city normally would pay to the corporation to back its bonds, the city's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael, said.
He said that the money would be used to "ease us over the hump" and that the plan would permanently shrink the government by enough to bring its long-term spending in line with revenues decimated by the recession. But the money would not be targeted toward specific programs that streamline the government, as some critics of the Mayor have urged, Mr. Michael said.
"That money is fungible," he said, adding that "there is no real earmarking of it."
Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which would play a large role in providing the aid, said the budget plan was "an improvement over the plan that was submitted last fall." But he expressed alarm about cuts in the capital budget that would curb construction of new schools and said he would support using the M.A.C. to raise money for that purpose.
The Mayor's plan also avoided using $200 million in surplus M.A.C. money that was available to it. City officials said that money might be used as a bargaining chip in negotiations with unions. It could be held out as an incentive get municipal labor leaders to provide savings, they said.
A good part of Mr. Dinkins's plan depends on actions by the State Legislature that are far from a forgone conclusion. The plan calls for a 5-cent gasoline tax that would cost the average driver about $25 a year, a property tax on automobiles and a tax on commuters that would provide the city $60 million a year.
Spokesmen for legislative leaders in Albany voiced skepticism about the property tax on automobiles and the gasoline tax, saying the two measures have repeatedly failed to win approval in the past, mostly because suburban legislators oppose them. The commuter tax will also face an uphill battle, they said.
"All three we've rejected in the past," said John E. McArdle, a spokesman for the State Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Long Island Republican. "We have no reason to believe that if submitted again they would meet a different fate."
Mr. Dinkins's plan also hinges on increases in state aid for schools and an accelerated state takeover of Medicaid costs that would require approval by the Legislature. Both are unlikely, given the state's dire financial situation, legislative leaders said.
"It's going to be tough," Steven Greenberg, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, a Queens Democrat, said.
Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private group financed by businesses, said he was disappointed that the Mayor's plan does not prune entire services out of the government but appears to borrow money and then reduce services over all. He said the use of the $700 million in refinanced bonds amounted to "deficit financing."

Chart: "CITY BUDGET: Proposed Tax Changes"
 
Highlights of Mayor Dinkins's tax proposals and the amount of added revenue they would yield in each of the next two fiscal years.
 
PROPERTY TAX FREEZE
 
1993: NONE
1994: $20 MILLION
 
The average rate would remain at $10.59 per $100 of assessed value in the 1993 fiscal year and would rise 2 cents starting in 1994 because of a planned increase in the "Safe Streets, Safe City" program.
 
INCOME TAX SURCHARGE MADE PERMANENT
 
1993: NONE
1994: $98 MILLION
 
The current temporary surcharge on city personal income tax, due to expire after the 1993 fiscal year, would become permanent.
 
COMMUTER TAX INCREASE
 
1993: $60 MILLION
1994: $60 MILLION
 
The tax on income earned in the city by nonresidents would be raised from 0.45 percent to 0.75 percent, with the proceeds going toward the station maintenance payments and other payments that the city and suburban counties make to the Metropolitan Transporation Authority. The increase would cost the average nonresident paying the tax about $130 per year after allowing for its deductibility on Federal tax returns.
 
GASOLINE TAX
 
1993: $40 MILLION
1994: $55 MILLION
 
A new city levy of 5 cents per gallon, with proceeds set aside in a special fund to maintain the city's bridges.
 
TAX ON CARS' VALUE
 
1993: $15 MILLION
1994: $60 MILLION
 
Replacing the auto use tax, a new 1 percent tax on the value of cars registered in the city, adjusted for the age of the car. The minimum tax would be $40 per year; an owner of a brand-new car worth $16,000 would pay $104. The proceeds would be set aside for the bridge maintenance fund.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin's Ambiguity Persists: Democrat Who Rules by Fiat

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Seven months since he became President of Russia and seven weeks since he led the dismantling of the Soviet Union, Boris N. Yeltsin remains an ambiguous and complex figure: a democrat who rules by decree, a populist who risks draconian reform, a public politician who defies easy classification.
Making his first visit to America as head of an independent Russia and heir to the atomic weapons of the Kremlin, he still carries traces of the clumsiness and inexperience that marked his first forays abroad. 
 But he has confounded foreign skeptics who thought he could never shoulder the mantle of independent power, claiming for Russia the legacy and responsibilities of Soviet power and demonstrating his intention to persevere in liquidating all vestiges of the cold war.
At home, Russians chafe and grumble under the steep price increases he ordered as the first phase of a bold economic gamble. But despite relentless sniping from foes and onetime allies, he has refused to retreat and has plunged into angry crowds around Russia to urge perseverance on his nation.
His critics concede his courage and his singular hold on the Russian masses, while his supporters chafe at his neglect of democratic processes as he issues sheaves of decrees and dispatches personal envoys to carry his will around the nation.
He is accused of accumulating the trappings of imperial power, moving in quick succession from his "White House" offices to the old Communist headquarters and finally into the Kremlin. But his team remains quaintly inexperienced and his actions often seem improvised, and he has made no effort to curb the steady flow of criticism from politicians and the press.
 
Views of a Leader
 He is arguably the most public leader in Russian or Soviet history, with a published autobiography and regular public appearances. But his thoughts and ambitions remain a mystery, and Muscovites seem unable to decide whether he is the cunning peasant of popular lore, a Communist boss in new clothing or a budding Russian potentate -- or something of them all.
A month ago, surrendering the levers of power to his victorious adversary, Mikhail S. Gorbachev declared in an interview: "I think the phenomenon of Yeltsin is still to be revealed. I wish he could always be consistent. I wish he were more democratic. It wouldn't hurt him."
The sentiment was widely shared then and still is now. But then it was Mr. Gorbachev's repeated error in his long struggle with Mr. Yeltsin that he failed to fully appreciate the consistency of Mr. Yeltsin's fundamental faith in democracy and reform, however vague his perception of either.
Somewhat like former President Ronald Reagan or Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Germany, Mr. Yeltsin has advanced in part by exceeding expectations. Americans dismissed him after his first visit as a boozing provincial politician, Russian intellectuals treated him patronizingly in opposition as a convenient foil against Mr. Gorbachev, and Mr. Gorbachev initially thought he could shoo him away like an annoying gnat.
Yet Mr. Yeltsin now has the central stage to himself, and if the reviews are modest, they are probably better than many expected.
"Yeltsin's first months in office form a complex, contradictory but generally encouraging picture," said Dimitri K. Simes, a senior associate with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington and a frequent visitor to Moscow.
"What is encouraging is his commitment to reform. He was not frightened by the first resistance to higher prices. He demonstrated flexibility, yet toughness with other commonwealth members. The buck stops with him. And in foreign policy his heart is certainly in the right place.
 
'Old Party Apparatus'
 "But he is still Boris Yeltsin. He is from the old party apparatus, and when the going gets tough he still has a tendency to rely on people of his type, people he knew, people he is comfortable with. The sense is that he is determined to proceed with reforms, but that very often he's bigger on intentions than on appreciation of nuance and complexity."
There is a growing perception, for example, that Mr. Yeltsin was had by President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine in launching the Commonwealth of Independent States. In Kiev they talk of the "Ukrainian fox" getting the better of the "Russian bear."
Mr. Yeltsin evidently thought that the commonwealth agreement would serve to preserve a measure of economic and military unity among the old Soviet republics. But no sooner was the ink dry and Mr. Gorbachev ousted, than Ukraine plunged ahead with preparations for its own currency and army, and finally with a claim to the Black Sea Fleet.
 
Dispute Over Fleet
 Mr. Yeltsin is now stuck with a nasty dispute, and his adversaries among Russian nationalists -- Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoi first among them -- have been handed a dandy political weapon in the form of Russian indignation at Ukrainian control of the Crimea.
At home, nobody questions Mr. Yeltsin's determination and courage in launching the economic reforms. But his Government, largely composed of people of marginal experience, does not yet inspire great faith.
Gennadi E. Burbulis, the Deputy Prime Minister, is a former ideology instructor from Sverdlovsk who ruthlessly dispersed his adversaries, but has demonstrated little skill in forging political alliances. Yegor T. Gaidar, the architect of the economic program, has had little experience in government, and Moscow businessmen say his foreign advisers, including Jeffrey Sachs from the United States, have little appreciation of Russian realities.
Mr. Yeltsin's decision to merge the K.G.B. and the Interior Ministry sent shivers through a nation only recently delivered of a police state, and his own newly formed Constitutional Court declared the super-security apparatus unlawful.
The Russian President's efforts at halting ethnic strife in the Caucasus, whether by trying to mediate between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in Nagorno-Karabakh or attempting to impose martial law in the rebellious region of Chechen-Ingushetia, proved humiliatingly futile.
Mr. Yeltsin has also repeatedly demonstrated that however strong his devotion to democracy or private enterprise, his understanding of them is shaky. Touring Russian cities recently, he alternated between attempts to explain the purpose of higher prices with peremptory and dubiously legal orders that store managers who raised prices too high be dismissed.
These and other shaky actions have fed sustained criticism not only from former Communists, but also from Mr. Yeltsin's former allies -- Mr. Rutskoi again first among them, followed closely by Ruslan Khasbulatov, the man Mr. Yeltsin backed as Speaker of the Russian Parliament.
And while Mr. Yeltsin has taken efforts to sharpen his image, tamping down his unruly shock of gray hair and acquiring a wardrobe of double-breasted suits, he still has his share of social bloopers -- like the time in Bonn last fall when he downed a glass of champagne at a gulp, Russian-style, during a series of formal toasts.
 
Steadiness on Market Policy
 Yet Mr. Yeltsin has earned credit for staying the course. His response to the Ukrainian challenges has been measured and calm, preventing the dispute from turning unduly emotional. Officials in his Government say he has not wavered in his support for the economic reforms, however strong the political and public outcries.
Despite rumors of heavy drinking, he demonstrates robust energy for a man of 60, maintaining a grueling schedule of travel and public appearances. He never loses control in public, sitting steadily through long speeches and delivering his own in a booming, authoritative voice.
If he was outmaneuvered by Mr. Kravchuk in the creation of the commonwealth, he has never wavered in his assertion of Russian primacy among the heirs to the Soviet Union, and has reassured the West by calmly assuming responsibility for the nuclear arsenal and the bulk of the military and by reaffirming Russia's adherence to extensive arms reductions.
If Mr. Yeltsin often acts as an "elected autocrat," it seems less a grasp for power than a search for what is expedient. That, as Mr. Gorbachev suggested, is worrying, but then it is no less than Mr. Gorbachev did when he assumed extraordinary powers. Unlike Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Gorbachev was never elected by popular vote.
 
A Strong Hand?
 Perhaps more to the point, the combination of democratic conviction and autocratic authority appears to be what Russia wants, and may well be the only force that can guide it through this critical juncture in its history.
Most Russians accept that the crisis in their land can only be countered through decisive action, and no leader comes anywhere near Mr. Yeltsin in popular acceptance.
A public-opinion poll by the Institute of Sociology conducted in Moscow this month found that 32.8 percent of those questioned had full confidence in Mr. Yeltsin, and another 19.6 percent answered "I rather trust him than not." His most active supporters were the young and businessmen.
"He is indispensable for the time being," Mr. Simes said. "There is no one else with his commitment to change who can carry the Russian people with him. That is what Americans have to understand, that with all his shortcomings, there is no constructive alternative."

HEADLINE: THE FEDERAL BUDGET: The Overview;
Mood of Compromise Prevails on Election-Year Budget

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
President Bush's budget director, Richard G. Darman, went to Capitol Hill today to begin the yearly ritual of negotiating with Congress over the President's tax and spending proposals, amid indications that both sides might be willing to strike some compromises in this election year.
Several Democrats welcomed Mr. Bush's proposal to impose some type of overall limit on the growth of Federal benefit programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Mr. Darman indicated that the Administration would consider some changes in the budget agreement of 1990, which severely restricts the ability of Congress to shift money from one category of spending to another. 
 Nonetheless, Mr. Darman said the Administration would firmly resist Congressional efforts to use savings from the military budget to pay for domestic programs, as many Democrats want to do. Some Democrats say the money cut from the Pentagon budget should be used for social programs and to help workers, cities and counties adversely affected by the closing of military bases and by cutbacks in production of warplanes, missiles, submarines and other weapons.
 
Tax Cut Possibility
 The budget director said Mr. Bush was prepared, under certain conditions, to use military savings to pay for a cut in taxes for families with children.
Mr. Darman's testimony today before the House Budget Committee tended to confirm the impression of many lawmakers that the Administration would be drawn into renegotiating the 1990 agreement. Once such negotiations begin, neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Darman could control their scope or outcome, lawmakers say.
The agreement, which set a statutory framework for national decisions on taxes and spending, was supposed to last five years. But many members of Congress and economists have concluded that it needs to be revised as a result of the reduced military threat to the United States since the collapse of Communism.
At the hearing today, Mr. Darman made a spirited defense of the President's budget request for the fiscal year 1993, which begins Oct. 1, and seemed to enjoy sparring with members of Congress. He found bipartisan interest in Mr. Bush's proposal to impose, for the first time, an overall limit on Federal spending for rapidly growing benefit programs like Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps.
Representative Leon E. Panetta, a California Democrat who is chairman of the committee, welcomed the proposal as a means of "achieving better control" over such benefit programs. Congress sets eligibility criteria and benefit levels for those programs, but does not directly control the total amounts spent each year; anyone who meets the eligibility criteria can obtain benefits.
Benefit payments accounted for 28 percent of all Federal spending in 1965, when Medicare and Medicaid were created. They now account for slightly more than 50 percent.
Referring to such outlays, Mr. Darman said, "The big gaping hole in the current budget enforcement system is the inherited structure of mandatory spending programs that just continues to grow without control or annual review, and without having to come before Congress or the President."
The ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, also welcomed the proposal for "an enforceable cap" on Federal spending for benefit programs. "We never have been able to get a handle on them," he said.
Lawmakers of both parties expressed concern that Congress and the Administration would try to outdo each other in cutting taxes in this election year, with the result that future budget deficits would be even higher than now projected.
Mr. Panetta said Mr. Bush's budget included a long list of proposed tax cuts and would tempt Congress to enter "a bidding war of the type we saw in 1981." In that year, Congress approved President Ronald Reagan's proposals to cut individual income tax rates and business taxes in an effort to stimulate economic growth.
The House majority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, said, "There should not be a bidding war over the tax and recovery package" this year.
Mr. Darman agreed that there was a political temptation to woo voters in an election year, and he said, "We ought to do everything we can to prevent that bidding war from breaking out."
 
Partisan Struggle Foreseen
 Despite the amicable atmosphere of today's hearing, many lawmakers say they expect partisan political warfare over the budget, as Democratic and Republican members of Congress struggle for advantage.
"We as Democrats are committed to prompt passage of an economic recovery program," Mr. Gephardt said. "Democrats will not obstruct, but we will try to improve the President's package. Democrats will cooperate, but we will not fold. We will provide a clear distinction between the allegiances and ambitions of the two political parties."
In a separate move, the White House today disclosed details of its plan for "a 90-day moratorium on any new Federal regulations that could hinder growth" of the nation's economy. Mr. Bush has asked the head of each Federal agency to identify rules that can be suspended, revised or repealed. Vice President Dan Quayle, as head of Mr. Bush's Council on Competitiveness, will have a central role in reviewing such regulations to determine if the costs outweigh the benefits.
The Vice President today invited businesses to suggest rules that should be changed or repealed. "Now's your chance," he told a group of lobbyists for companies regulated by the Government. "Come and tell us what regulations and rules are burdening the private sector. To the overzealous regulators: you've met the enemy and it's called the Competitiveness Council."
Mr. Bush established the council in 1989 to find ways of making the United States more competitive in international markets. The panel has concluded that Federal officials, including some appointed by Mr. Bush, impose too many regulations on American businesses.
Gary D. Bass, executive director of O.M.B. Watch, a consumer group that monitors the Federal Office of Management and Budget, said, "The 90-day moratorium is essentially a stop-work order" to regulatory agencies. He said it could endanger public health and safety by blocking rules that were to be issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and the Occupational Saftey and Health Administration.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin, in Britain, Warns Of Peril of Russian Unrest

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
At a stopover on his way to the United Nations, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia warned today that his country could collapse into "general unrest" and authoritarian rule if its economic reforms failed, and appealed for continued help from Western countries.
He left with broad promises, but not with much that he could take to the bank, just like the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, last July, after his meeting with leaders of the world's seven most powerful industrial democracies. 
 Mr. Yeltsin arrived at 10 Downing Street this morning on his first international trip since the Christmas collapse of the Soviet Union, with his financial and military advisers in a fleet of polished black Russian Zil limousines. After four hours of talks with the British Prime Minister, John Major, the Russian leader said he "respected" Britain's refusal to include its nuclear forces in any arms reduction talks.
Before leaving Moscow, Mr. Yeltsin had welcomed President Bush's announcement Tuesday night of major cuts in American ground-based and seaborne nuclear warheads, matched them with offers of even bigger cuts in Russia's sea-based systems, and called on Britain, France and China to "follow our example."
 
British Nuclear Force
 Mr. Major explained this morning that Britain would go ahead with plans to replace its Polaris submarine force, and much of its air force nuclear capability, with a deterrent force of four Trident submarines that could carry up to 512 warheads by the end of the 1990's. He told Mr. Yeltsin that it was "only a minimum deterrent force, threatening no one."
Before he left this afternoon, Mr. Yeltsin said Russia would no longer aim its missiles at Britain; he made a similar pledge concerning the United States last week. "The number of nuclear weapons at the disposal of the U.K. is not comparable with ours and therefore the matter is not really worth discussing," he said.
Most of their discussions concerned economic affairs, according to the two leaders and their aides. Mr. Major said Britain would press for full Russian membership in the International Monetary Fund by April of this year, and would urge the other industrial democracies to find ways of giving further assistance to the republic, "possibly in the form of a ruble stabilization fund."
In a joint declaration, Russia and Britain pledged to insure that nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction were held under secure control at all times. Mr. Major said that Britain would send a technical mission to Moscow to see what could be done to help the Russians store, dispose of, and safeguard nuclear materials from the weapons they dismantle as they cut back their military forces.
 
Advice for Russian Military
 He also said he had offered to send "a small number" of British Defense Ministry officials to the Moscow headquarters of Defense Minister Yevgeny I. Shaposhnikov to help with restructuring of the Russian armed forces and insuring effective democratic control. Mr. Yeltsin gave no indication whether he would welcome them.
Saying that Britain was determined to help democracy in Russia, Mr. Major enumerated the aid programs already underway, bilaterally and within the European Community, amounting to $670 million so far, and pointed to the Group of Seven wealthy industrial nations and the International Monetary Fund as the best sources of further assistance. The only new aid he mentioned today was $504 million Britain was making available for an International Monetary Fund program insuring export credits and investments in Russia and other former Soviet republics
"The only thing that can impede our progress will be general unrest," Mr. Yeltsin said, "and general unrest will happen if our reforms fail. Should the reforms fail, we shall face a new leadership and Russia will fall into the habits which tortured us for 74 years." Before leaving for the United States, he said the amount of aid the West was providing was "by no means" enough. "Deeds we need, not words," he said.
In a joint declaration, the two countries agreed to be "friendly states and partners within the international community," and promised to formalize their relationship in a British-Russian treaty.
Mr. Yeltsin then went off to visit Mr. Major's predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, and reboard his plane for New York.

HEADLINE: Russian Vice President Wants to Redraw Borders

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 30

 BODY:
In a nationalist broadside published today in the newspaper Pravda, Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi of Russia said he would take up the cause of Russia's "historical conscience" and seek a redrawing of borders that would reflect a "glorious page" in the nation's past.
Although Mr. Rutskoi did not mention the Crimean Peninsula directly, his latest statement -- another in a series that have put distance between him and his old running mate, President Boris N. Yeltsin -- threatens to sharpen an emotional issue that lies at the heart of a dispute between Russia and Ukraine. 
 The Crimea, including Sevastopol, home port for the Black Sea Fleet, was made part of Ukraine in 1954 by an order issued by Nikita S. Khrushchev, then the Soviet leader. But for many Russians, the Crimea is an inseparable part of their history, a region rich in romance, summer home to czars and writers, and scene of bloody battles in the Crimean War.
"For us, the decree of former Communist administrators, hasty decisions by the Politburo do not amount to a decree," wrote Mr. Rutskoi. "For us, the principal decree is Russia's thousand-year-old history. The demarcation of borders, and only the demarcation of borders, will dot all the "i"s and define Russia as a power, and not as a beggar within the Commonwealth of Independent States.
"Russians' historic conscience does not allow the mechanical association of the borders of Russia and of the Russian federation, thus denying what was a glorious page in Russia history."
Negotiations are under way over the disposition of the Black Sea Fleet, with the commonwealth expected to take command of its strategic components and Ukraine to assume control over the rest.
But the issue was clouded again this week by Mr. Yeltsin's abrupt and unannounced meeting with the fleet's commanders off Russia's Black Sea coast on the eve of his trip to Europe and the United States.
Mr. Yeltsin's trip and Mr. Rutskoi's article indicate that tensions between Russian and Ukraine are far from resolved. A week ago, the Russian Parliament called for a re-examination of the Crimean question, scheduling hearings for early February. At the time, Mr. Yeltsin voiced his regret that the issue was being raised at all, but popular sentiment might force him to change course.
Last month, Mr. Rutskoi, an air force general twice wounded in Afghanistan, angered members of Mr. Yeltsin's Government with a public and taunting critique of its plans to liberalize prices. Soon afterward, shunned by Mr. Yeltsin, he was stripped of the chairmanship of five committees he had been named to head.
Today, nearly a month after the price reforms began, Mr. Rutskoi declared them to be a political and economic disaster.
"The impoverishment of the population is taking on catastrophic proportions," he said. "Now it seems to me, we can already discuss our survival, as a Russian nation."
Other political figures, including the chairman of the Russian Parliament, Ruslan Khasbulatov, have joined Mr. Rutskoi in attacking the Government's economic policies, a position that is likely to gain favor as popular discontent over high prices and sluggish supplies rises.
Today's article in Pravda marked the second time in a just over a month that front-page display in the old Communist paper had been given to Mr. Rutskoi, who heads a party that is an offshoot of the defunct Communist Party.

HEADLINE: Influx From Ex-Soviet Lands Falling, Israel Says

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Jan. 30

 BODY:
As Israel presses the United States for loan guarantees to cope with a projected huge influx of immigrants from the former Soviet Union, officials here said today that the immigrant flow this month had sunk to its lowest in almost two years and could dwindle even further.
Jewish Agency officials attributed the reduced flow of immigrants to the acute difficulties facing those who have already arrived, cannot find jobs or decent homes and write back to friends and relatives in the former Soviet Union chronicling their tribulations. 
 "Sadly, we have to admit the facts," said Uri Gordon, chairman of the quasi-governmental agency's immigration department. "We are on the threshold of losing a great opportunity for immigration because of the dire unemployment situation and because of housing problems."
"If the existing situation continues, this may lead to a slow dying out of immigration," he said. "The Government has no answer to the question of employment. Until now it hasn't formulated a national plan for absorption. Every ministry is doing things for absorption on its own, but the plans have remained on paper."
The Jewish Agency, formed before Israel's founding in 1948, takes initial responsibility for immigrants, but their long-term fortunes here are the responsibility of Government ministries.
"Absorption is in crisis," Mr. Gordon said. "After three years of immigration from the Soviet Union, I see a situation of impotence. There is no long-term planning. I believe there'll be continued immigration, but the situation is worrisome."
According to the agency's provisional figures, 5,800 immigrants from the former Soviet Union have arrived so far this month, with 600 more expected before the start of February, a lower figure than those recorded during the Persian Gulf war, when Iraqi Scud missiles fell on Tel Aviv and other places. The last time the figure fell below 7,000 was in February 1990.
"No doubt the main reason for lower immigration figures is indeed hardships of absorption principally in the field of employment," said Gad Ben Ari, a Jewish Agency spokesman who took issue with Mr. Gordon's comments, saying there had been fluctuations in immigration patterns in the past. "I do not see this month's low figure as a significant change."
Even after Iraq's Scud attacks began last January, however, more than 7,000 immigrants arrived the month after and the flow rebounded to 13,000 in March 1991.
Since late 1989, when the wave of Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union began, some 350,000 immigrants have arrived in Israel. The wave peaked in December 1990, when, according to the Jewish Agency, more than 35,000 arrived, making 1990 a record year.
Since then, the figures have generally been lower.
Right now, Israel is heading for early elections in which the immigrants will play a double role both as an issue and as first-time voters.
The Labor Party's parliamentary chairman, Haim Ramon, said the party would agree to a proposal by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud Party that the vote be held on June 23. Up until today, Labor had been pressing for a June 16 election. But by tonight there had been no formal announcement of the election date.
The immigration issue has assumed a further dimension, moreover, as Israel seeks $10 billion in loan guarantees from the United States to cope with the influx. The American guarantees would make it easier and cheaper to raise commercial loans.
 
Contradictory Arguments
 The reportedly dwindling immigration figures, however, could promote two contradictory arguments: either that the sought-after amount is exaggerated or that the guarantees are more necessary than ever to persuade would-be immigrants that they will find a better life than those who have already arrived.
Israeli conversation is peppered with stories of Jews from the former Soviet Union finding only menial work despite high qualifications -- concert musicians playing on street corners, a computer systems engineer delivering milk, a doctor working as a hospital orderly.
The United States is seeking to link the loan guarantees to a halt to further settlements in occupied territories, but Ariel Sharon, the hard-line Housing Minister, reiterated today that Israel would continue building settlements throughout territory under its control.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Personal Finances;
Brown Avoids Doing the Expected, Even With His Own Money

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Jan. 24

 BODY:
Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California has always been a politician willing to take the big risk and the contrarian course, and he manages his personal finances in exactly the same way.
Over the last 20 years he has accumulated about $1 million in land, buildings and stocks, which in many instances, though not all, are holdings well out of the economic mainstream. 
 A few years ago, according to information drawn from Federal and state financial disclosure statements, Mr. Brown was probably worth more than he is now, perhaps several hundred thousand dollars more. But some of his riskier investments in real estate and newly formed advanced-technology companies have been hit hard by the recession. Some are now worth less than he paid, while producing no dividends or other income.
For example, an investment of $20,000 in the saturated apartment market here produced less than $200 in income last year. Similarly, investments in a mail-order prescription drug firm and a new Texas company that specializes in private satellite communications paid few if any dividends last year.
 
Fluctuating Assessments
 Mr. Brown estimated his financial worth today as closer to $750,000 than the more than $1 million shown on his financial statements and other public documents. But he acknowledged that a precise figure was hard to reach because of widely fluctuating assessments in the present economic climate. More than half his investments are in real estate, including an old San Francisco fire station that he converted into a house. The rest are divided fairly evenly between bank deposits and stocks and bonds.
Much of his financial worth, he said, resulted from investments he made after receiving cash gifts from his father, Edmund G. Brown Sr., the former California Governor who made his fortune through practicing law and investing, particularly in petroleum interests. The younger Mr. Brown would not disclose the size of the gifts from his father, but he said a good part of his wealth had also been accumulated through a law practice and by living as frugally as the priest he once wanted to be.
"My family has been very, very generous to me," he said. "But I've also been good at picking emerging stocks, such as newly started medical and communication ventures, the kind of things that appeal to my mind and imagination. The rest of what I've got comes from the law and from being one of the world's great savers -- living off less than $1,000 a month most of my life."
He recalled that when he was Governor here from 1974 to 1982 he lived in a bare-walled apartment rather than the Executive Mansion and moved about the state in an old sedan rather than a limousine.
 
'I'm Not Money Oriented'
 "I saved my money, and I saved the state's money," he said. "I'm not money oriented. But I've got enough for me, for a bachelor."
Mr. Brown had one of his best years in 1990, the last year for which figures are available. His stocks and real estate investments suffered from the recession, but his law practice brought in more than $50,000, and a longtime friend who is a Los Angeles real estate agent paid him a finder's fee of more than $50,000 after he found a buyer for a piece of property in a neighborhood favored by film stars.
Neither the agent, Joyce Rey, nor Mr. Brown would disclose details of the transaction.
The former Governor said much of his law practice consisted of "bringing in clients" for Fulbright & Jaworski, a major firm with offices around the United States and abroad.
In past elections Mr. Brown has accepted the maximum amounts of campaign money allowed from political action committees and individuals, some of them close acquaintances. But in the 1992 campaign he has made his major issue a vow not to accept money from political action committees or to take gifts larger than $100 from individuals -- one-tenth of the allowable amount.
Thus far, according to the latest figures available from Mr. Brown's campaign headquarters, he has raised only $700,000, ranking him last in collections among the five major Democratic candidates. He has not contributed any of his own money to the campaign.
"I've concluded that too many politicians get too close to the people who give them big money," he said. "I can make it through this campaign on the small gifts that are coming in and I won't be beholden to any big interests."
Mr. Brown's personal financial investments, in some instances, are in companies and ventures controlled by friends and political acquaintances. But in the current campaign, as in his previous ones, he has cut many of his business ties, resigning from the board of ICN Biomedicals, a California medical supply company that is part of ICN Pharmaceuticals. He also gave up his association with Fulbright & Jaworski.
Official documents released by Mr. Brown over the years show a slow but steady accumulation of wealth. Two decades ago he owned only a home in Los Angeles, valued at less than $100,000, and had an annual income of less than $40,000, all of it salary except for a few hundred dollars in interest and dividends.
Today, according to various government documents, he is worth fromroughly $1.2 million to $1.4 million. It is not possible to pin down the worth any more precisely because in disclosing his holdings to run for office he is required to give only a range of value for a piece of real estate, a stock or other financial entity.
Thus, he listed his interest in Glenborough Ltd., a San Francisco-based commercial real estate partnership, as worth from $100,000 to $250,000, and he reported his earnings in it in 1990, the last year available, as more than $2,500 but less than $5,000.
"Actually," he said in an interview, "it's worth about zero in the current real estate market."
At times, Mr. Brown's investment decisions have paid off handsomely, as they did in the mid-1980's, when he was able to sell a home in Los Angeles for more than $700,000, roughly 10 times what he bought it for 15 years earlier.
But real estate agents estimate that the converted fire station, which he and his father bought in 1989, is now worth about $200,000 less than the $1.2 million purchase price because of the recession.
On the other hand, Mr. Brown's other major real estate investment, 160 acres of undeveloped mountain property northeast of Sacramento, has increased in value since he purchased it in 1978. It is now assessed at $232,000, about $50,000 more than its assessed value in 1978.
Like many investors, Mr. Brown suffered heavily in the stock market in 1990. One major holding, Medi Mail, a new California company specializing in mail-order drugs, paid him less than $200 in dividends on an investment of over $50,000.
"It's one of those start-up, cutting-edge companies that I like to deal in," Mr. Brown said. "They'll take off eventually."

HEADLINE: Drive U.S. Cars (and Sensibly), Judge Says

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PONTIAC, Mich., Jan. 30

 BODY:
A judge has given a chronic speeder his driver's license back on the condition that he drive only American-built cars.
Alexander Zelikov, a 25-year-old professional test driver, lost his license to suspension in July after getting too many speeding tickets in his own car. 
 When he appeared on Tuesday in Oakland County Circuit Court in Pontiac, 25 miles north of Detroit, Judge Hilda Gage called Mr. Zelikov a "menace to the county." But she restored his license on condition that he drive to and from work on a single route, carry increased liability insurance and test only American-built cars for his employer, the Daikin Clutch Corporation, which supplies manual-transmission clutches to the Big Three and foreign automobile makers.
The order was prompted "by a sense of patriotism and a concern for the economy," said Judge Gage, who drives an Oldsmobile.
"What can I say," said Mr. Zelikov, "except that I have to drive and I'm not going to contest it. I have to go to work."

HEADLINE: Dow Rebounds by 19.90 And Closes at 3,244.86

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stock prices displayed some resilience yesterday, rebounding from the sharp selloff the previous day, but some analysts said the market was showing signs of weakness. After a 47-point drop on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 19.90 to finish at 3,244.86.
Analysts said the bounce was typical after a big selloff, and some said they expected a pullback, adding that when the Dow set a record on Tuesday other indexes lagged behind. 
 Robert C. Walberg, equity analyst for MMS International, said investors regained their composure after overreacting to comments about the economy on Wednesday by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. "People regained some confidence that if the employment numbers, due out next week, are weak, the Fed is likely to act," he said.
Another factor, Mr. Walberg said, is that there are still many investors waiting to enter the market, and Wednesday's selloff gave them that opportunity. But he found it disturbing that recent market gains had come with narrow leadership, with Coca-Cola and Boeing the strong Dow stocks yesterday. "If the rest of the troops do not follow these generals, then the battle will be lost," he said.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was down, but still heavy at 195.1 million shares, compared with 249 million shares on Wednesday, as the Big Board composite gained nearly three-quarters of a point, to 227.37. Gaining issues were ahead of losing ones, 888 to 789.
The recent pattern of high volume and volatility but little gains is another sign that the market may be near its top and ripe for a correction, Mr. Walberg added.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 1.28 points, to 411.62, with the American Stock Exchange up a similar amount to 410.92. Trading on the Nasdaq was heavy as the composite gained 5.06, to 621.37, while the Russell 2,000 gained a point to close at 204.87.
 
Blue-Chip Strength
 In early trading, the market failed twice to rally. But investors noticed little damage, with the support level of 3,215 on the Dow holding, and that seemed to encourage more buying. By midday, the blue chips were steadily higher, helped by strong gains in Coca-Cola, up 5 5/8, to 77 1/8; Merck, 2 7/8, to 155 1/4; Boeing, 2 1/8, to 52 3/4, and McDonald's, 2, to 44 1/4.
Among the economic data released yesterday, personal spending was up only three-tenths of 1 percent in December, and while personal incomes climbed 1 percent, that gain was partly attributed to increasing unemployment insurance payments.
eral Reserve will cut interest rates again, traders said. It was the first decline in three months, and the largest in more than a year.
In Big Board activity, strong fourth-quarter earnings and plans for a 2-for-1 stock split were behind Coke's performance yesterday.
Bristol-Myers Squibb and Immunex posted gains after they announced an agreement to exchange the marketing rights involving several cancer drugs. Bristol-Myers was up 7/8, to 80 5/8, and Immunex 5 3/8, to 62.
Many of the aerospace stocks that fell on Wednesday over concern about military budget cuts recouped yesterday. Boeing came back after it reported better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter, prompting a number of analysts to raise their 1992 earnings forecasts and repeat their "buy" recommendations.

HEADLINE: India Drops a Ban on Foreign Trademarks

BYLINE: By SANJOY HAZARIKA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Jan. 30

 BODY:
In steps aimed at opening the economy further, India's central bank announced today that it was dismantling an 18-year-old law that banned big foreign companies from selling products under their internationally known trademarks. It also ended an earlier rule that blocked the companies from owning property in India.
The developments came as Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, who heads a minority Government and is pushing ambitious economic changes, traveled to New York to attend a special United Nations Security Council meeting called by Prime Minister John Major of Britain. 
 This is Mr. Rao's first visit to the United States since he became head of Government last summer and started India's most wide-ranging economic changes since independence in 1947, slashing Government controls, rules and subsidies and undercutting the dominance of the public sector. He is expected to meet with President Bush, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and Prime Minister Li Peng of China.
 
Trademarks Are In
 The decision on trademarks means that multinational corporations can sell products ranging from soft drinks to computers with their original names.
For example, Pepsico, the soft drink giant, markets its drinks here under the brand name Lehar Pepsi. It has two Indian collaborators.
The easing of these rules are aimed at making foreign products more competitive and attractive to consumers in India. It also means that foreign companies can, theoretically, strongly challenge the country's powerful but largely protected private corporations in almost every sector.
United States Trade Representative Carla A. Hills has filed a legal case against India calling for the strengthening of its trademark, patent and copyright laws and enforcement, and has set a deadline of Feb. 26 for either an agreement or the imposition of trade sanctions. Today's action by India appeared to address only one of these three areas of concerns.
 
Delegations Are Visiting
 India's economic announcements, published today, were made during the visits of Mario Soares, the President of Portugal and the European Economic Community, and a powerful Japanese business delegation that has insisted on major changes in the country's investment policies. Although the changes began last year, the size of new investment has not been significant, and Western diplomats and business executives as well as politicians and officials here attribute this to a wait-and-see policy.
"Many foreign corporations want to see whether the Government will last, whether it will be able to implement its policies and whether there will be opposition from within," a senior executive with Digital Equipment, the computer company, said.
Cabinet ministers in Mr. Rao's Government have publicly spoken of adverse political repercussions of the liberalization, especially among peasants, who pay no income tax and benefit from Government subsidies for seeds, fertilizers and electricity, and from organized labor, worried by large-scale layoffs that could follow plant modernization.
In other moves, the Reserve Bank of India said that foreign companies, which were regulated by the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act aimed at increasing the inflow of foreign funds into India and curbing the outflow, will be allowed to buy property, set up direct trading offices, instead of depending on subsidiaries, and borrow money and accept deposits from the public.

HEADLINE: THE FEDERAL BUDGET: The Tax Battle
Divining the Winners;
Again, Parties Squabble Over Who Would Benefit From President's Plan

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
President Bush took pains this week to present his budget as one that would benefit Americans across the income spectrum, but it has set off a war of interpretation over which income classes would gain and by how much.
The budget ink had yet to dry before Democrats, pouncing on an issue that has helped them in the past, were criticizing the plan as another in a long line of Republican proposals that offered unfair windfalls to the rich. 
 Congressional Democrats asserted that the Bush proposals would cut taxes by $19,000 a year for the richest Americans while saving a middle-income family only $150.
"Big tax cuts for the rich, sacrifices for everybody else," said Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the House Budget Committee, in attacking the Administration's budget.
Republicans, as sensitive to the issue as their adversaries, were ready with their counter-analysis, which came in two strains.
Many Republican analysts agreed with the Democrats that wealthiest families would reap the largest immediate gains, primarily through a cut in the capital gains tax. But they argued that the Democrats' numbers overlook some important elements of the Bush tax-cut plan. And they added, as they have in the past, that even if the affluent win in the short run, this is not unfair because the tax cuts would stimulate the economy and provide jobs to Americans at all income levels.
This was the kind of argument that President Bush seemed to be making in his State of the Union Message. "Never has an issue been more demagogued," he said in defense of a capital gains tax cut. "A cut in the capital gains tax increases jobs and helps just about everybody in the country."
Other Republicans went even farther, saying that the Democrats were concocting phony statistics and that it was unfair to argue that the wealthy would gain at all. Because the appreciation on assets like stocks, paintings or real estate is not taxed until the asset is sold, the Republicans said, a cut in the tax would actually increase the taxes rich people pay by inducing them to sell things they would otherwise hold.
In the past, Congressional committees have produced detailed tables showing the effect of budget proposals on Americans at various income levels and they are expected to do it again in a week or two.
But in this election year, the debate has jumped ahead of the detailed reports.
 
Plan for Middle Class
 In his address, Mr. Bush mentioned a long list of proposals to help the broad American middle class, including those that would allow people to deduct interest payments on student loans, use Individual Retirement Accounts to help buy their first homes and increase the personal exemption for families by $500 a child.
But critics argue that the amount each family would save from those proposals is dwarfed by the savings the richest Americans would get from a cut in the capital gains tax.
Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, whose analyses are drawn on frequently by Democrats, prepared a study comparing the amounts. Mr. Greenstein totaled the tax savings in nine areas the President said would help the middle class, including new rules on I.R.A.'s, a credit of up to $5,000 for first-time homebuyers, and the increase in the personal exemption. Such proposals total $39.2 billion over six years and would be spread out among a very broad range of taxpayers. By contrast, Mr. Greenstein estimated that the capital gains cut alone would amount to about $19 billion a year, and would be concentrated among the richest.
In arguing that the wealthiest Americans would save $19,000 a year, Mr. Panetta was drawing on an analysis last fall by the Joint Committee on Taxation. That analysis showed that a proposed 30 percent cut in the capital gains tax would bring an annual savings of $12,761 to families with capital gains who earned more than $200,000 a year. The President has proposed a larger cut, of 45 percent, and Mr. Panetta extrapolated.
President Bush, in asserting that the Democratic argument amounted to demagoguery, said 60 percent of the Americans who had capital gains earned less than $50,000 a year. But the amounts middle-income Americans earn in capital gains are far exceeded by the claims at the top. The study by the Joint Committee on Taxation showed that 83 percent of the money earned in capital gains goes to families earning more than $100,000.
In arguing that a typical middle-income family would save $150 from the President's proposals, Mr. Panetta was focusing only on the increase in the personal exemption for children. He arrived at that figure by taking the proposed increase of $500 a child, multiplying it by two, the average number of children in a family, and applying a 15 percent tax rate, the most common.
Some Republicans agreed that the initial winners would be the wealthy. "The beneficiaries are certainly not low-income people and are more upper-income people than middle-income people," said a Republican Congressional aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
But many added that the figures used by the tax committee were flawed because they did not take into account the ways in which a capital gains cut would stimulate the economy, an argument repeated in Congressional testimony today by Richard G. Darman, the budget director. "It is helpful to the middle insofar as it ultimately creates more jobs," he said.
In addition, the figures tossed around by the Democrats do not take into account one of the President's major initiatives for working families, a tax credit of up to $3,750 to help families buy health insurance. While the bulk of that money is expected to help lower-income families, Democrats say they cannot calculate it because the Administration has provided no details.
And other proposals in the President's budget are intended to help those with modest incomes, but their effects are difficult to measure. Chief among them is an 18-month extension of a tax credit for those who build low-income housing.
Some Republicans, including Representative Bill Gradison of Ohio, the ranking minority member of the House budget committee, take a more defiant view in favor of cutting the tax on capital gains.
Lowering the rate does not really benefit the wealthy, he said, because it coaxes them into paying taxes they might otherwise not pay at all. Most wealthy people, he said, have the option of simply letting their assets accrue.
"How do you gain from paying more tax?" he said. "That's nonsense."

HEADLINE: Bush Budget Would Hurt Area, Officials Say

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
By continuing the decadelong trend of shifting the cost of social programs to the cities and states, President Bush's budget proposal would aggravate the increasingly desperate fiscal plight of the New York region, officials from the region said today.
In a rising chorus, the officials complained that the budget would give short shrift to a variety of programs they consider vital to urban areas, from mass transit to health-care costs. 
 Ultimately, some officials said, the budget would force more state and municipal tax increases, which would lead to new layoffs in both the public and private sectors and more than cancel any economic stimulus from the tax changes proposed by the President in his $1.52 trillion budget.
"The proposal continues the trend of abdication of Federal responsibility," the New Jersey State office here concluded in an analysis released today.
Brad C. Johnson, Washington counsel to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, an outspoken critic of the administration's domestic priorities, said, "It's a classic example of borrowing from Mario to pay George."
The worst news in the budget is for employees of defense industries, because of the President's plan to cut defense spending by $50 billion over the next six years. And few states are likely to suffer as much as Connecticut, because of the proposed cancellation of the Seawolf submarine, built by Electric Boat in Groton, and the scaling back of the Comanche helicopter, built at United Technologies' division in Stratford.
"President Bush, while proclaiming the need for economic growth, is sowing the seeds for economic decline in Connecticut," Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, said in a statement released today.
 
Costs Shifting or Cut?
 City and state officials across the region said the Bush budget would aggravate the region's problems by, among other things, capping the growth in the amount the Federal Government reimburses for Medicare and Medicaid.
"A threat of such severe losses puts the viability of the public hospitals, which serve primarily the indigent, at risk," said Judy L. Chesser, the New York City lobbyist, wrote in an analysis of the budget sent to Mayor David N. Dinkins.
The proposed budget for the 1993 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, includes a $600 million increase in funding for Head Start, a pre-school program for children from low income families. It would allow the program to add 5,700 more children to the 35,000 currently enrolled, New York officials said. But officials said there still would be only enough financing to enroll one in four eligible pre-schoolers.
The budget would increase Federal spending for some social programs, like educating the handicapped; some types of student loans, and AIDS research. And it includes $70 million to build a secondary sewage treatment plant in New York City, $2.5 million to dredge New York Harbor, $15.4 million for a courthouse on Long Island and $23 million to repair and renovate the Jacob K. Javits Federal Office Building.
But any benefits from those increases would be more than offset by cuts in other key social services, officials from the region said. The administration's budget would cut or eliminate financing to more than 30 other waste-water treatment projects, they said. And they said it would lead to the closing of about 300 community-based social-service organizations in New York City alone and the loss of about 5,000 jobs statewide.
"It's basically a wash," said Mr. Johnson.
The analysis by New Jersey officials found that while the state would gain money for some programs, it would lose $31 million for guaranteed student loans, $10 million for removing asbestos and $15.28 million for the construction of waste-water treatment centers.

HEADLINE: Are Champagne Prices in Store for Beer?

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
The local economy may be a mess, crime a constant threat and living costs still ruinous, but one of New York City's consolations has been some of the nation's kinder prices for beer. Now, the nation's largest beer producer is pitted against the city's independent beer distributors in a battle whose outcome, the distributors and city officials say, could create a wholesaling monopoly and raise prices by a dollar or more a case.
Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc., which supplies more than half of the city's beer, added a dollar a case on Monday to wholesale prices statewide on its most popular brands. The company will issue rebates only to those retailers who buy all their Budweiser and other company brands directly from the company's four franchised wholesalers. 
 The city's 70 independent distributors call this a scheme to drive them out of business. Anheuser-Busch would then raise prices gradually but substantially, city officials and the distributors say, costing New Yorkers at least $100 million a year.
 
Seeing a Sinister Plan
 Anheuser-Busch, based in St. Louis, responded that, far from raising prices, it plans to offer some discounts through the end of the year. "This is not a price increase," the company said in a statement, adding that its competitors have similar strategies. Independent distributors will still have a market, said Joseph V. Corcoran, vice president of the eastern sales region for the company. The goals, the company said, are to control quality and to persuade New Yorkers, who guzzle Bud like no other brand but pass up Bud Light, Busch and Michelob, to try these other company brews.
Carlos D. Nazario, owner of Metro Beer and Soda Distributors in the South Bronx, sees a more sinister plan, to kill off entrepreneurs who built Budweiser's popularity. Mr. Nazario, president of the 325-member Empire State Beer Distributors Association, said businesses like his ventured into neighborhoods where major brewers had scant distribution.
When his father, a Puerto Rican immigrant, founded Metro Beer 22 years ago, Budweiser was a minor presence, Mr. Nazario said. Now, it is so popular in the city's Hispanic neighborhoods that it accounts for 58 percent of his business, he said.
From the warehouse and store he bought just last year, his view now includes the Major Deegan Expressway and a dark future. "I don't think I can survive," he said.
Mr. Nazario stocked up before Monday, when his cost went up a dollar to $11.55 a case. But by the end of the week, he said, he will have to restock, passing that extra dollar along to the bars, restaurants, groceries and bodegas he serves. Inevitably, he said, they will switch their business to the franchise distributors to capture rebates of $1.15, including an extra 15-cent incentive.
Mr. Nazario's customers said they would have no choice but to buy elsewhere. "Let me tell you something," said Auero Soto, who owns the Metro Superette in Parkchester in the Bronx. "If the beer company raises a dollar from Carlos, he has to raise a dollar from us, and I have to raise a dollar from the customer. The customer is going to go somewhere else." Companies like Mr. Nazario's are also called home distributors, reflecting a time when each neighborhood and ethnic enclave had its own breweries, and the brew was delivered to homes. The tradition has persisted to the extent that about half the city's distributors are Puerto Rican, Dominican, Asian or black, often reflecting the makeup of their neighborhoods.
The independent distributors do what anyone trying to keep down the costs of a beer blast would do: they comparison shop. Often, they buy beer from upstate wholesalers willing to undercut the wholesalers closer to the city.
Leslie Gersing, a spokeswoman for Robert Abrams, the state Attorney General, said Mr. Abrams has long fought Anheuser-Busch's practices in court. "It's just another example of their anti-competitive behavior," she said.
Mark Green, the city's Consumer Affairs Commissioner, said he would urge the Justice Department to start an antitrust investigation of Anheuser-Busch. "It's a case of monopoly muscle," he said.
Once the company drives independent distributors out of business, he said, it will gradually raise prices $1 to $2 a case, with other brewers most likely to follow. Retail prices in the city, ranging from about $11 to $16 a case, now tend to be 10 to 20 percent less than the national average, he said. On sales of 100 million cases of beer a year, Mr. Green said, the added cost to New Yorkers would be at least $100 million.

HEADLINE: Coca-Cola's Earnings and Stock Climb

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its fourth-quarter profit had risen 22 percent, driven by strong sales overseas and a pickup of sales in the United States, and its stock jumped nearly 8 percent.
The company also said it planned to recommend a 2-for-1 stock split to its board at its February meeting. The split, if approved, is expected to be effective in April or May. 
 Coca-Cola stock climbed $5.625 a share yesterday, closing at $77.125 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. It was the fifth-most-active Big Board stock.
Fourth-quarter net income for the world's biggest soft-drink company rose to $358.4 million, or 54 cents a share, compared with $294.3 million, or 44 cents a share, for the period last year. The fourth-quarter results included a one-time after-tax gain of $18 million, or 3 cents a share, for the sale of the company's shares in the Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group to Coca-Cola Enterprises.
Revenues rose 12.6 percent, to $2.88 billion from $2.56 billion.
Roberto C. Goizueta, Coca-Cola's chairman and chief executive, signaled that the company's strong growth would continue this year. "In spite of harsh economic conditions in many world markets, we have moved into 1992 with undiminished momentum," he said. "This augurs well for the current year's results."
In the competitive domestic market, Coca-Cola increased its lead during the year over its main rival, Pepsico Inc. Coke now commands 41 percent of soft-drink sales in the United States, compared with Pepsi's 33 percent.
After a difficult year, Coca-Cola's fourth-quarter case sales picked up in the United States by 3 percent.
International business, which accounts for 80 percent of Coca-Cola's profit, grew at a healthy clip in the quarter, despite weakness in Britain.
The company's case sales grew by 6 percent in the European Community and Latin America. Case sales grew by 3 percent in the Pacific and Africa.
At Coca-Cola Foods, which markets the Minute Maid juice brand, orange juice volume increased 17 percent.
During 1991, Coca-Cola expanded into several new markets, including joint ventures in Hungary and Romania. The company also made investments in eastern Germany and Poland. Coca-Cola also formed a joint venture with Nestle S.A. to sell coffee and tea drinks.
Emanuel Goldman, a securities analyst with Paine Webber in San Francisco, said Coca-Cola's strong performance in a weak economy was attracting interest in the stock market. "Investors are still looking for companies that have demonstrated an ability to achieve strong growth though thick or thin," he said.
Mr. Goldman expects Coca-Cola to complete a stock-repurchase program this year, buying up to 15 million shares, a move that could push up the company's stock price.
For all of 1991, Coca-Cola earned $1.62 billion, or $2.43 a share, a 17 percent increase over the previous year's earnings of $1.38 billion, or $2.04 a share. Full-year revenues totaled $11.57 billion, up 13 percent from $10.24 billion in 1990.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans;
Executives Give Bush a Tepid Greeting

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 30

 BODY:
President Bush told jokes about Boris Yeltsin and the Super Bowl. He denounced "sweet-sounding quick fixes," "empty symbols and slogans" and "feel-good gimmicks." He tried out a new slogan for his economic growth programs: "It will work."
He even appeared before just about the friendliest audience the White House could find, the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, as he took to the road today to begin the campaign to sell his economic proposals outside of Washington.
 
Polite but Unenthusiastic
 But having announced that he would hold his political fire until after the March 20 deadline he set for Congress to pass his programs, Mr. Bush found himself restricted largely to a textbookish reprise of his State of the Union Message, without the oratorical flourishes of Tuesday night's speech or any of what he likes to call his "red meat" political lines. 
 The 500 or so business executives applauded when Mr. Bush scorned lawyers who sue business people and called for a cut in the tax on investment profits. But his listeners, many of whom said they were eager to begin helping the President with his political problems and the nation's economic troubles, were for the most part polite but distinctly unenthusiastic.
As Mr. Bush moved on to New York to meet with other world leaders, including Mr. Yeltsin, at the United Nations, an activity more to his liking than grappling with the economic and political consequences of the recession, some of those in the audience said they agreed with many of the points Mr. Bush made in his speech on Tuesday and here today.
Mac Thompson, an insurance broker, was more inclined to give Mr. Bush the benefit of the doubt. "He's addressing the right issues, even if it was just a repitition of the State of the Union without a lot new," he said.
 
'Preaching to the Choir'
 But some said he had waited too long to acknowledge the country's economic difficulty and then to take action to solve it. "This long-term denial has put us in a difficult position," said Charles Greene, executive director of public affairs for Bell of Pennyslvania. "Here he is preaching to the choir and many of the points he's making are valid, but no one seems too enthused."
Mr. Greene's response is precisely what some of Mr. Bush's political advisers had feared would occur because the President insisted on waiting for weeks to unveil his economic proposals in his State of the Union Message.
Before Mr. Bush decided to set the March 20 deadline, some campaign planners and conservative officials had urged him to ignore the advice of Richard G. Darman, the budget director, and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who had counseled Mr. Bush not to take on Congress immediately after his State of the Union Message.
 
No Direct Criticism
 The officials pressing for action have argued that the Democrats will not spring to Mr. Bush's aide simply because he refrains from criticizing them directly and have counseled the President to start his offensive. But today Mr. Bush only used Republican code words for "Democrat."
"This is no time for gloom and doom," Mr. Bush said. "It is time for action in Washington to restore confidence and get this economy moving again."
To help Mr. Bush regain his momentum and present his economic plan to the nation, the White House and the Bush-Quayle campaign are sending a stream of public officials, friendly business executives and other dignitaries around the country on his behalf.
For instance, Vice President Dan Quayle, Senator John McCain of Arizona, Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp and Carla A. Hills, the Trade Representative, are all going to New Hampshire in coming days, where Mr. Bush faces a challenge from the conservative columnist Patrick J. Buchanan in the Republican primary on Feb. 18.
 
A Joke Misfires
 But Mr. Bush has to play the central role, as he sought to do today in Philadelphia.
"Please be seated," he told his audience, which rose for him as he entered the room. "I don't want to keep Boris Yeltsin waiting later on."
Mr. Bush said the last few weeks "have been pretty high pressure -- high pressure time for me -- what with all the experts and the instant analysis and the columnists giving unsolicited advice. Thank goodness the Super Bowl is over."
The audience seemed puzzled, although there were a few scattered chuckles.
Trying to paint Democratic budget proposals as irresponsible, Mr. Bush said, "The air back in Washington has been thick with feel-good gimmicks that have nothing to do with true prosperity and everything to do with politics."

HEADLINE: ALBANY MEMO;
Mental Hospital Closings Draw Few Cheers

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 30

 BODY:
There is a certain purity to the logic of the case being made by state mental health officials that half of the state's 22 psychiatric hospitals should either be mothballed or reduced in size by the end of the decade.
The state has a dire need to expand community services for the mentally ill. But about 70 percent of its $2.4 billion mental health budget must be spent to maintain anachronistic hospitals that house only 12,500 of the estimated 185,000 New Yorkers with serious mental illnesses. 
 Therefore, the state officials reason, why not reduce the size of the hospital system, which gets more expensive each day because of badly needed renovations, and pump the savings into outpatient and community residential programs?
But the test of logic is only one hurdle that must be vaulted in Albany in order for the Legislature to adopt such a shift in policy. The larger obstacles are political, and it is unclear whether the political imperatives for closing the hospitals will overcome those for keeping them open.
 
Holding On to Jobs
 The report on closing and consolidating psychiatric hospitals that was released yesterday by the State Office of Mental Health outlined a preliminary plan. But opposition has mounted quickly in the communities that are home to the hospitals, largely because of the potential loss of thousands of jobs.
Three of the four hospitals scheduled for closure -- Gowanda Psychiatric Center in southern Erie County, Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center in Dutchess County, and Willard Psychiatric Center in Seneca County -- are the largest employers in their immediate areas. The fourth hospital is Kings Park Psychiatric Center on Long Island. Seven other hospitals would be substantially scaled back.
"Politically it's always difficult to close an institution because of the political pressures of the existing state workforce and the economic impact on the local communities," said Steven Greenfield, executive director of the Association of Community Living Agencies in Mental Health. "But we think that the state has to recognize that the purpose of these institutions is to serve people with mental illnesses."
The State Commissioner of Mental Health, Richard C. Surles, has long argued that the state's vast system of psychiatric institutions has drained badly needed financing from community-based mental health programs, where the vast majority of patients are served.
In good times, the state was able to afford the inefficiency. But the state's chronic budget problems have made it impossible to pay for the renovations needed to keep the hospitals up to Federal standards and to meet the growing demand for community mental health programs.
By closing and consolidating hospitals, the state could save an estimated $360 million annually by the end of the decade, according to Bruce Feig, the Executive Deputy Commissioner of the Office of Mental Health. That would nearly double the state's current budget of $440 million for community services.
As it is, Mr. Feig said, the state needs to add 12,000 community residential beds for the mentally ill to its existing pool of 28,000 and it also needs to expand outpatient mental health clinics and psychiatric emergency rooms.
But the recession also has left New York with an increasingly severe unemployment problem, and Mr. Surles's plan could mean the loss of more than 9,000 jobs. Many of the institutions scheduled to be either closed or cut back are in small communities in upstate New York.
The communities' complaints carry weight with the Republicans who control the State Senate, most of whom come from either upstate New York or the suburbs of New York City.
They may find allies in the Democrats who control the Assembly, most of whom hail from New York City, and who can be expected to question whether the state will expand community services quickly enough.
 
'Dumping' Charged
 Leaders of the unions that represent state workers are encouraging these questions.
"Without adequate funding of state-operated community-based services and the continuity of care into the community, this plan can only be called dumping," said Howard Shafer, president of the Public Employees Federation.
Mr. Feig said that more than half of the patients currently in state hospitals would require continued institutionalization because of geriatric conditions or severe mental illness.
He predicted that few of the patients who are discharged would become homeless as long as savings from hospital closings are earmarked for community programs. Some mental health activists have proposed legislation to insure that happens.
Senator Nicholas A. Spano, the Yonkers Republican who is chairman of the Mental Hygiene Committee, had his doubts.
"I don't see the commitment to a community-based system of care that would be necessary and I haven't seen the commitment to quality of care at the psychiatric centers that will be forced to carry an increased caseload," he said. "There are going to be a number of obstacles."

HEADLINE: THE FEDERAL BUDGET: Personal Savings;
An I.R.A. Plan for Middle-Class Needs

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
It goes by the name flexible individual retirement account, but what President Bush proposed this week might better be described as a savings program for middle-income people.
"It's a misnomer to call it a retirement plan," said Stephen Corrick, a tax partner at the Washington office of Arthur Andersen. "But it certainly is flexible and it provides tax-advantaged savings, and there's nothing wrong with that." 
 As part of President Bush's attempt to revive a sagging economy, the Administration proposed a series of tax breaks in the election-year budget for investors and middle-income families. Among them is the proposal to create a new type of I.R.A., to be called a flexible I.R.A.
Contributions to a flexible I.R.A. would not be tax deductible; by contrast some existing I.R.A.'s are deductible, primarily those for taxpayers without a company pension plan or whose incomes fall below $25,000 for individuals and $40,000 for couples. But earnings in a flexible I.R.A. could be withdrawn tax-free after seven years; by contrast, for existing I.R.A.'s the withdrawals are taxed.
 
Like a Municipal Bond
 "It's a great proposal for people who can take advantage of it," said Stephen Pennachio, a tax partner at KPMG Peat Marwick. "It's very similar to a municipal bond. And for those who cannot deduct the existing I.R.A.'s and who qualify for this, it's a wonderful opportunity."
Under the Bush Administration proposal, an individual with an adjusted gross income of under $60,000, a head of household with an adjusted income under $100,000 and a married couple whose adjusted income is under $120,000 can qualify to invest up to $2,500 a year in a flexible I.R.A.
A person withdrawing money from a flexible I.R.A. within three years would face a tax bill, plus a 10 percent early-withdrawal penalty. Withdrawals made between years three and seven would be taxable, but would not be penalized.
Tax planning experts say a flexible I.R.A. is designed for people who want to accumulate savings over a medium length of time, most likely to buy a house or finance a child's college education.
"The seven-year time period encourages people to keep it there and not grab it right away," said George E. L. Barbee, executive director of client services at Price Waterhouse. "Personally, it's a trade-off. I'd like to see people saving for retirement. But there's a real movement for help for a first home or for an education."
 
Answering the Critics
 For the economy, the program is designed to increase the domestic savings rate, which is considered crucial to long-term international economic competitiveness. At the same time, it is designed to answer critics of President Bush who say that far too many of his tax proposals are designed for the wealthy and ignore the middle-income earners.
The Treasury Department estimates that the plan will cost the Treasury $2.8 billion between now and 1997. It must be approved by a Democratic-controlled Congress and how Congress will react is unclear. But Robert Willens, a tax and accounting analyst at Lehman Brothers, said it was "very much a mainstream proposal" and in line with what many in Congress had been proposing as recently as last year.
Last year, for instance, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, submitted a bill to broaden the existing I.R.A. program in a variety of ways: to allow employees with corporate pensions to deduct them, to permit penalty-free withdrawals for expenses including college, costly health care and first-time home payments, and to set up a flexible I.R.A. savings plan similar to the one proposed by President Bush but for five years.
 
Tax-Free Investment
 That Bentsen plan was supported by 70 senators, more than a two-thirds majority, but it was immediately opposed by the Bush Administration, which said at the time, "We are not in favor."
Andrew Zuckerman, a benefits specialist at the Washington office of the accounting firm Grant Thornton, said the advantage of a flexible I.R.A. was that it could turn a taxable investment into a tax-exempt one. For instance, a person could invest the $2,500 a year permitted in the program in high-yielding corporate taxable bonds. The interest on these bonds, normally taxable, would escape taxation completely if left for seven years in a flexible I.R.A.
Mr. Willens of Lehman Brothers said that anyone considering investing in a flexible I.R.A. should compare the after-tax returns of an investment in a flexible I.R.A. with those of traditional tax-exempt investments, such as municipal bonds. Mr. Willens predicted that if the flexible I.R.A.'s were approved by Congress, "brokers are going to be marketing them for a lot of situations."
Investors with existing I.R.A.'s are cautioned by tax experts not to roll over their funds immediately into flexible I.R.A.'s since they would face a large penalty and tax bill for early withdrawal. This sum might be far greater than the returns that could accumulate tax free in a flexible I.R.A. and would not offset the costs of making a change.

HEADLINE: THE FEDERAL BUDGET: Incentives;
Businesses Want Broader Measures for Research

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 30

 BODY:
President Bush's proposed budget contains several notable incentives to spur research and development and improve the nation's competitiveness, many executives said today. But it stops short of the full-fledged effort that many business leaders say the nation needs.
The budget would increase Federal research and development expenditures, particularly for nonmilitary research in such areas as computers and biotechnology. There are also some tax incentives for industrial spending on research and new equipment, but experts say these measures would have only a modest impact. 
 Some executives said, however, that by increasing Federal research and development for civilian technology the Bush Administration seems to be softening its ideological resistance to helping particular industries.
"We see signs of making sure the Federal R & D budget supports industrial competitiveness," said Daniel F. Burton Jr., executive vice president of the Council on Competitiveness, a Washington lobbying group.
Under the President's proposal, which requires Congressional approval, overall Federal expenditures for research and development would total $76.6 billion, an increase of 3 percent from the year before.
Civilian research and development would increase by 7 percent, making up 41 percent of overall research spending in the fiscal year 1993, up from 39 percent in 1992 and well above the level during the years of the Reagan military buildup. Industry executives have long complained that too much Federal research spending goes to arcane military uses with potential few commercial spinoffs.
The budget also includes increased support for the Commerce Department's Advanced Technology Program and a new "critical technology" program, both of which the Administration had not supported in the past, Mr. Burton said.
"They are moving a little bit in the direction of technology policy," said John Mancini, senior vice president of the American Electronics Association. But he added, "It's a good first step but not enough in the long run."
Indeed, some executives said they were disappointed that President Bush, in his State of the Union address Tuesday, made little mention of competitiveness. Instead, he seemed to dwell on spurring home building, which would create new jobs but not help the nation in foreign markets.
Among the specific tax incentives the President proposed, executives said that by far the biggest boost could come from a cut in the capital gains tax to 15.4 percent from 28 percent for investments held at least three years. That could particularly help start-up companies that are backed by venture capital.
But such a cut in the capital gains tax has been repeatedly proposed by President Bush only to be derailed by Democrats in Congress who say that the benefits would fall mainly to the wealthy. This time, though, the President sounds more determined. And with the economy reeling, the Democrats might be more willing to go along.
Another proposed budget measure would make the research and development tax credit permanent. Companies would get a tax credit of 20 percent on increases in their research-and-development spending according to a complex formula.
Although the credit has been extended annually for years, making it permanent would end any uncertainty and provide an incentive for long-term increases in research and development, executives said.
But the tax credit will not benefit many companies in the development stage, particularly in biotechnology, because these companies do not yet make profits and therefore have no use for a tax credit.
"Is the R & D tax credit going to make me do anything differently?" said Roger Salquist, chief executive of Calgene, an agricultural biotechnology company in Davis, Calif. "The answer is no. It's just irrelevant."

HEADLINE: Hidden Costs in a Military Cutback

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
President Bush's plans to cut military spending by deferring production of newly designed weapons may result in serious delays and higher costs when they are actually built, manufacturing specialists say.
The "design now, build later" approach that is being proposed by the Defense Department aims to save 35 to 45 percent of the cost of new weapons by designing them and building test models, but delaying production until they are actually needed. The idea is to keep American weapons technology at the cutting edge without spending billions for unnecessary hardware, Defense Department officials have said. 
 But separating design from manufacturing is just the opposite of what the most advanced industrial companies are trying to do today. In fact, most American manufacturers have been imitating Japanese manufacturers of everything from cars and cameras by using "concurrent engineering" methods that closely link designers and production specialists. The objective is to design a product that can be easily and efficiently manufactured and to get engineers and designers to quickly correct any problems that might crop up in production.
"You have to consider manufacturing if you want to convert a design into something that is real," said Arun Maira, a production specialist at the Arthur D. Little consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. If it turns out that a designer has called for a part too big or with tolerances too tight for any machine in the factory to make, for instance, the whole project could be delayed until the part is redesigned or new machinery is installed. Working out such kinks is all part of the process, Mr. Maira says, and waiting months or years until a military conflict threatens might not be the best time to start working out the bugs in a system.
What is more, he says, if a design is approved and put on a shelf, the designers may not be available to make the necessary alterations years later in response to changing needs.
Such issues, long simmering, have become more urgent for the military contracting community in light of President Bush's State of the Union speech Tuesday and the subsequent release of Mr. Bush's proposed budget. The Administration has proposed shutting down production of the B-2 bomber, which is built by the Northrop Corporation in Southern California, after 20 of the Stealth airplanes are built.
The President has proposed to halt building Seawolf attack submarines, made by the General Dynamics Corporation's Electric Boat shipyard in Groton, Conn., after the first one is built. He is also seeking to delay production of the Commanche light helicopter, made by United Technologies' Sikorsky Helicopter division in Stratford, Conn.
Several missile systems will be stopped as well, if Congress accepts the President's plan.
 
Dual-Use Factories Discussed
 Some industry analysts say that continuing improvements in the quality of commercial products and the increasing flexibility of computer-controlled machinery offers at least the theoretical possibilty of dual-use factories, which could switch as needed from civilian to military production.
"It can work if certain conditions exist," said Edward A. Miller, president of the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences, a cooperative research organization in Ann Arbor, Mich. "It works if you have a strong commercial and industrial base."
For example, he said, aerospace companies capable of building airliners could quickly convert to military planes, particularly if the tooling to make military aircraft had been mothballed, rather than scrapped. Indeed, production of the U-2 airplane for high-altitude surveillance was resumed in 1980 after being shut down more than 10 years earlier.
 
Institutional Obstacles
 Still, even if elaborate computer-controlled factories can be made flexible enough to produce both civilian and military products, the nation's military procurement system will have to be thoroughly overhauled to make such an approach practical, military analysts say.
"It is not going to happen the way things are now," said Debra Van Opstal, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, who has studied the procurement process. "There are four different problems and each one is a show stopper."
A Senate committee staff member familiar with the issue said: "Converting military contractors to civilian products is one of the hardest things anyone can imagine doing. They have been operating as two parallel systems for decades, with very little contact."
But other experts say that civilian plants can be adapted to military products, and weapons plants to civilian products, if the same basic capabilities are present. "The Soviets built tanks and railroad cars in the same plant, so it is an example of using a similar process to make different products,' said Jacques Gansler, a former Pentagon official who is now a consultant. He added that in electronics, civilian products had improved so much that they now exceed military specifications.
"The control chip in your car is far tougher than milspecs, so you can design using civilian products," he said. "That was not true 20 years ago."
But Mr. Gansler agreed that Defense Department procurement procedures were an effective bar to producing military and civilian products in the same factories.
Ms. Van Opstal, the Washington analyst, said military auditors would not accept civilian accounting systems, forcing military contractors to install expensive separate reporting requirements to prevent fraud. To limit the reach of Government auditors now, she said, companies like Motorola and I.B.M. make similar products for civilian and military markets but build them in different plants.
The Government also requires contractors to turn over trade secrets, which are often divulged to competitors in future rounds of procurement bidding. Military procurement also includes a welter of special preferences, such as "Buy America" provisions, and narrowly drawn specifications that often differ from civilian products that perform better.
Mr. Gansler said he estimated that changing the Government's military procurement culture would take from 5 to 10 years, even with strong leadership from top Defense Department officials.
 
New Thinking on Prototypes
 Several manufacturing specialists said a key to making the "design now, build later" strategy work was to produce more prototypes than usual to prove that the weapons actually worked and could be made at an acceptable cost. Nowadays, test models are typically hand-built from specially made parts, and they differ from later production models.
"We have to redefine what a prototype means," said Ramchandran Jaikumar, a professor at Harvard Business School. "There is a difference between one that is an artifact in a laboratory and an effective prototype that is the result of a manufacturing process."
He said that by planning to produce enough prototypes to demonstrate the effectiveness and economics of production, contractors would have to perform concurrent engineering and arrange for an adequate network of suppliers. This would increase costs, he said, but help insure that the weapons could be made when needed. "Once you have an effective prototype," he added, "you can ramp up to high-volume production."
 
Parts Suppliers Are Crucial
 Parts suppliers are often the weak point in the production chain. If there is a shortage of landing gear because of bottlenecks at a subcontractor, aircraft production cannot be increased, even if all the other components are ready.
"Most things tend to be systems, so if you have a problem in the critical path, everything gets held up," said John Ettlie, a professor at the University of Michigan Business School.
Professor Jaikumar agreed. "You have to keep the infrastructure fit," he said, but added that if the technology and the production process were developed, switching from civilian to military production was mostly an organizational change. "As long as we know where we are going, that does not concern me as much," he said. "In World War II we did it in nine months."
But some experts question how long some components will last while they sit on the shelf. "There is an issue of how far you can go with mothballing," Mr. Maira said. Over time, critical subcontractors may change their businesses so much that they will no long be prepared to quickly convert to weapons work.
"After 10 or 20 years," he said, "you may have changes in critical parts or processes."

Loss by Dow Chemical of $92 Million

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MIDLAND, Mich., Jan. 30

 BODY:
The Dow Chemical Company said today that it lost $92 million in the fourth quarter because of a big charge against earnings to pay for plant closings and a lower estimate of the value of some oil and gas holdings.
The loss for the three months compared with earnings of $273 million, or $1.01 a share, in the fourth quarter of 1990, Dow said. 
 Fourth-quarter sales were $4.56 billion, 11 percent below the $5.14 billion in the period a year ago.
The special charge amounted to $370 million before taxes. Without it, fourth-quarter earnings would have been $146 million, or 54 cents a share.
 
Plant Closings Set
 The charge reflects Dow's Jan. 21 announcement that it would shut down Dow Canada's chlor-alkali and derivatives operation at Sarnia, Ontario, and at some plants in Pittsburg, Calif., Germany and Brazil.
Frank P. Popoff, president and chief executive, said all of Dow's basic products were affected by a slowdown in the global economy and weak pricing for Dow's basic chemicals. He said consumer products brought in 57 percent of operating income.
"Years like 1991 demonstrate the value of diversifying our product mix into value-added specialties," Mr. Popoff said. He predicted a return to profitability by the second half of the year.
For the year, Dow earned $935 million, or $3.46 a share, including a $213 million gain for the initial stock sale for its Destec Energy subsidiary. But the results were 32 percent below the $1.37 billion, or $5.10 a share, earned in 1990. Sales were $18.8 billion, 5 percent below a record $19.8 billion in 1990.
On the New York Stock Exchange today, Dow's shares rose $1.75, to $54.375.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Lower in Light Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved lower as interest rates rose further in light, nervous trading yesterday.
Credit market participants said the selling was a continuation of Wednesday's steep price decline, a slide apparently touched off by the suggestion by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, that the central bank was not likely to ease policy again soon. 
 "Greenspan made it clear he won't ease until after the refunding," a government bond trader said. "That means we have to figure out the levels at which we can underwrite all this new paper. And nobody in the market has the stomach to buy anything."
Next week, the Treasury will announce the size and configuration of its quarterly refunding auctions, to be held the second week of February. Four times a year, the Treasury sells 3-year and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.
 
Reduced Auction Seen
 Comments by officials from the Fed and the Treasury over the last few weeks have heightened expectations among traders that the size of next month's bond auction will be reduced.
But in light of the recent surge in negative market sentiment, traders said it would take a significant reduction in the auction's size to have a positive effect on long-term interest rates.
By reducing the size of the bond auctions, the Government would not only be seeking to reduce its interest costs, but would be hoping to encourage a drop in long-term interest rates.
"If the size of the bond is only cut back by a small amount, say $2 billion, I don't see any reason in the world why the new bonds won't be auctioned at around 8 percent," the trader said.
Long-term bond yields are now just above 7.75 percent. Earlier this month, they were below 7.40 percent.
Concern about coping with a heavy supply of new Treasury issues is a constant concern in the credit markets.
 
'Where Is the Recovery?'
 But the recent selloff remains a mystery to economists, who note that recent reports on the economy and inflation should be sending positive signals to potential buyers, not negative ones.
"Something is going on that is totally out of sync with reality," said Steven Slifer, an executive vice president and financial market economist at Lehman Brothers Inc. "I look at the economy and the numbers we have had, and I ask, 'Where is the recovery?' And yet, everybody is claiming that the economy is on the verge of recovery."
A troubling sign for the future was imbedded in yesterday's durable-goods report, which showed that orders fell by 5 percent in December.
While the overall figure is important, many economists prefer to look at what happens to order backlogs to get a reading on future production trends. And in December, the backlog for new orders fell for the fourth straight month.
"We know retailers got stuck with a lot of inventory they didn't want," in December, Mr. Slifer said. "My guess would be they will be cutting back still further. That implies additional cutbacks in production."
 
Little Effect on Trading
 The durable-goods report, on items expected to last three years or more, and a rise in weekly unemployment claims, another sign of economic weakness, had no effect on traders yesterday.
By late in the session, the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 10215/32 , down by 13/32 , to yield 7.78 percent.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered late yesterday at 101 3/8, down by 14/32 , to yield 7.29 percent. Prices of the 6 3/8 percent seven-year notes fell by 9/32 , to a late offered rate of 6.91 percent. And the 4 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 9914/32 , down by 3/32 , to yield 5.17 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates rose slightly.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.84 percent late yesterday, up by 3 basis points, or three one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 3.93 percent.
 
Gains in Money Supply
 In other developments, the Fed reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply posted strong gains during the week that ended on Jan. 20.
It was the second straight week of robust money growth, and placed growth in M-2 and M-3, the broadest aggregates, at 3.8 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively, over their fourth-quarter bases.
The Fed, which has the opportunity to revise its money growth targets in February, now has a target growth range of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent for M-2, the aggregate it follows most closely.
The money report had no effect on prices in the credit markets yesterday, and analysts said M-2 needed to expand a bit more rapidly.
"In this economic environment, I think a 4 percent rate would be better," said Stuart Hoffman, a senior vice president at the PNC Financial Corporation in Pittsburgh.
 
Bankers Trust Sale
 New-issue activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market slowed markedly yesterday.
The largest issue was a $200 million offering of two-year notes by the Bankers Trust Company.
The 5 3/8 percent securities were priced at $99.933 to yield 5.41 percent, or 30 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 4 7/8 percent two-year notes at the time of pricing.
Goldman, Sachs & Company was lead manager for the offering. The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated AA-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and AA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, a bid from an investor group led by Lehman Brothers won an offering of $100 million in college student loan bonds issued by Texas.
The securities, which are subject to alternate minimum tax provisions, were reoffered at yields ranging from 4.70 percent in 1995 to a maximum yield of 6.65 percent on bonds maturing in 2011.
The bonds are rated AA by Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said prices of most issues dipped by about an eighth of a point to a quarter of a point in quiet trading.
"When rates in the Treasury market back up like this, people just don't focus on corporates," one trader said.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal securities said prices of most widely quoted issues fell by an eighth of a point to a quarter of a point.

HEADLINE: Banking Regulation;
All of the Oratory in New Hampshire Isn't Likely to Make Borrowing Easier

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
When President Bush castigated regulators in his State of the Union Message on Tuesday for treating banks too harshly and creating a shortage of credit, he sounded a theme also heard from Democratic Presidential candidates but rejected by the regulators and many bankers.
These latest election-year outbursts are unlikely to loosen the strict standards of the nation's more than 10,000 bank examiners. Regulators still contend that failing to force banks to admit their mistakes would mislead investors and allow greater problems to fester untreated. 
 In New Hampshire, where Presidential hopefuls are congregating before the primary on Feb. 18, bank regulators and examiners are an especially easy target. Regulators late last year had to find new owners for seven insolvent New Hampshire banks that accounted for a quarter of the state's banking assets. The weak economy, a high level of loan defaults and the shift of many loans from insolvent banks to the Government's hands have caused a 21.5 percent decline in lending from New Hampshire banks since the end of 1990 -- the sharpest drop of any state.
 
Upset Over S.&L. Woes
 "There is real schizophrenia about bank regulation," said Robert L. Clarke, the Comptroller of the Currency and the top regulator for most of the nation's largest banks. "Taxpayers and Congress are upset at the cost of the savings and loans problems, which were brought on by lax regulation."
But businesses and legislators in states where the economy is weakest blame regulators for treating banks so harshly that the banks have cut back on lending. "Everybody wants the garbage to be picked up, but they don't want it to inconvenience anybody when it is dropped somewhere else," Mr. Clarke said.
Mr. Clarke, who leaves office at the end of February, failed last year to win confirmation to a new term amid conflicting accusations that he was both too harsh and too lenient on banks. "A lot of bankers thought the charges of leniency were hilarious," he said. As for charges of being too tough, he noted that this complaint has been common during recessions going back at least to the 1930's, and that regulators have worked hard in the last year to rein in overzealous examiners.
 
Administration Seeks Leniency
 Last year, President Bush and Treasury Department officials prodded bank regulators to clarify standards for evaluating loans and ask examiners to avoid using the bleakest possible assumptions. Regulators also reminded examiners to encourage arrangements for delinquent borrowers to repay their banks, rather than having the banks foreclose on the first sign of trouble.
Recent announcements by several California banks of heavy loan losses indicate that regulators and examiners have shown little response to all this prodding. The regulators' definition of a bad loan has not changed much, and examiners have not backed away from insisting that bankers recognize losses on loans that will not be repaid in full -- even if those borrowers happen to be paying interest on time.
Some of the Democratic candidates for President are also saying that regulators should do more to alleviate the plight of banks and borrowers.
 
Important for the Economy
 Paul E. Tsongas, a former Senator from Massachusetts, which has more than its share of banks hurt by delinquent real estate loans, says changes in bank regulation are among the most important ways of improving the economy. Mr. Tsongas has said he will "call in the banks and direct them to halt all foreclosures of viable businesses and homeowners whose loans are current."
Bill Clinton, the Governor of Arkansas is criticizing bankers and their regulators. On a recent visit to a paint brush factory in New Hampshire, Mr. Clinton was quoted by the American Banker as saying, "I would have regulators avoid foreclosing on banks whenever possible" and banks in turn should "stop foreclosing on mortgages whenever possible."
Many bankers who were shocked two years ago by the downturn in real estate prices and examiners' insistence that they admit their losses are now saying that examiners' standards are not much of a problem.
"On balance the bank examiners have been more right than wrong," said John B. Robinson Jr., an executive vice president at Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, Providence, R.I.

HEADLINE: Nassau's Bond Rating Is Lowered Over Fiscal Questions

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
With Nassau County's government locked in a stalemate and its celebrated Rebublican political machine in disarray, Moody's Investor Service yesterday lowered the county's bond rating, citing "substantial uncertainty" about its fiscal stewardship.
The rating, lowered from A1 to A, the fifth of seven investment grade ratings, remained one notch above ratings in neighboring New York City and Suffolk County, areas also hard hit by the recession. But rating officials warned that the county's rating could be lowered still further. 
 "Moody's will continue to monitor the implementation of the budget and take further rating action as needed," the agency said.
The rating was a reaction to the political and budgetary convulsions in the county, after the Republican Party -- which has ruled an expansive county government for most of the century -- abruptly reversed directions and moved to impose drastic spending cuts.
 
Cuts and Demonstrations
 Since then, the county has seen ever-worsening governmental gridlock, partisan infighting, legislative screaming matches and public demonstrations, as the Republican County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, struggled to carry out budget cuts that Republican legislators had adopted over his objections.
The budget calls for eliminating as many as 5,000 of 16,000 county jobs, according to some estimates, making deep cuts in health and social programs, and cutting in half spending on parks, the elderly and cultural events.
But typing in numbers on a budget document is a lot easier than carrying out the painful dismissals and program cuts that alienate thousands of residents -- and voters -- that the numbers require.
And in its rating decision yesterday, Moody's questioned whether the county would be able to carry out the drastic revisions -- or drift into a deep deficit. It also questioned some optimistic spending assumptions.
"This budget is extremely aggressive," said Michael Johnston, a vice president for public finance at Moody's. "Laying off a large chunk of the county's work force is not an easy task."
 
'Still a Good Rating'
 When the Republican legislators, led by the Republican county leader, Joseph N. Mondello, adopted the budget, Mr. Gulotta stood in front of the County Executive Building and told reporters that the budget was unbalanced and that it could lead to a downgrading of the county's $1.3 billion in outstanding bonds.
Yesterday, Mr. Gulotta said that he was disappointed that the rating was lowered, but attributed the reduction to the "recessionary economic downturn."
"The revised rating is similar to an A-minus grade in school instead of an A-plus," he said. "It is still a good rating."
But the lower rating could increase the county's borrowing costs when it sells $100 million in bonds this spring, said John V. Scaduto, the county treasurer.
County officials insisted that the county was moving as quickly as it could under complicated civil service rules to lay off thousands of employees and had already removed 1,000 from the payroll. But they said the spending cuts were so deep that they could require far more layoffs than the Board of Supervisors ever imagined.
The Republicans acted almost immediately after last November's elections, after Democrats made signficant gains on the County Board of Supervisors -- winning enough proportional votes to block Republican initiatives, though not enough to pass their own alternatives.
Mr. Gulotta's budget -- which called for a 25 percent increase in county property taxes and another $60 million in home-heating taxes -- was rejected by his own party, and replaced with another one that eliminated most of the tax increase.
 
Calling for More Trims
 Yesterday, Mr. Mondello, who has been provided with police protection in response to threats, county officials said, called the downgrading by Moody's regrettable, but said that it only "reaffirms my belief that the county must hold true to a course designed to reduce expenditures and provide county residents with property-tax relief."
"There can be only one answer to the county's fiscal situation and that is to cut costs," he said. "I will oppose any call for additional taxation with all of the resources at my disposal."
For weeks, the meetings of the Board of Supervisors have been faced with demonstrations and complaints by county workers, parents of children with birth defects, black and Hispanic groups, and women who support the right to an abortion, all of them angry about cuts in one clinic or service or another.
Adding to the confusion in the county is a continuing impass between Mr. Mondello and Democrats on the Board of Supervisors, that has prevented the passage of all but the most routine spending measures at board meetings.
Democrats, who with their new voting strengh have the authority to call emergency meetings, have already summoned their Republican colleagues to two meetings, including one scheduled for Monday, to explore the impact of the cuts.
So far this impasse has even blocked passage of an ordinance routinely passed during the first meeting of the year authorizing the county to issue checks to its employees. It is known as Ordinance One, because it is always the first ordinance on the calendar.
If not for a ruling by the County Attorney -- one contested by the Democrats -- concluding that last year's ordinance remains in effect this year, the county would have been barred from issuing checks to its employees.
The Democrats have challenged patronage practices by the ruling Republicans -- calling for layoffs of some of the 31 of 69 ranking Republican leaders in the county -- before other county workers are laid off.
But they have also linked the approval of Ordinance One to the allocation of more money for staff to the Democrats, a move the Republicans say smacks of patronage, too.
Asked whether the Democrats bore any responsibility for the downgrading, Benjamin Zwirn, the Democratic Supervisor from the town of North Hempstead, said: "How could we? It's not our budget."

HEADLINE: Weekly Jobless Claims Post Another Rise

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Jobless claims rose again in mid-January as 465,000 Americans made first-time visits to unemployment offices, the Government reported today.
The number of Americans filing initial claims rose by 24,000 during the week ended Jan. 18, up from the previous week's revised figure of 440,000, the Labor Department said. Originally, the previous week's level was reported at 447,000. 
 The claims number should add to momentum in Congress to speed a second extension of unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless.
 
Efforts to Extend Benefits
 The bill, which has President Bush's support, won unanimous approval today from the Senate Finance Committee. It is a $2.7 billion measure giving the recession's victims 13 additional weeks of jobless coverage.
Analysts said today's claims report could be a discouraging signpost for January's unemployment rate, due out next week from the Labor Department.
The rate could increase to 7.2 percent from December's rate of 7.1 percent, some analysts predicted. That would be a new high for the recession.
The jobless total has swelled by 2.1 million since the recession started. In December, there were 8.9 million people without work.
The latest advance in jobless claims was the second straight increase and more than erased the improvements seen around the first of January, when holiday-shortened workweeks spurred a decline in the number of people reporting layoffs.
Mid-January's rise in jobless claims is probably a delayed effect of big layoffs that occurred in November and December, said David Wyss of DRI-McGraw Hill.
 
Delays May Be Factor
 Because laid-off workers generally receive severance pay or vacation checks after they lose their jobs, it takes weeks for layoffs to show up in the claims number, Mr. Wyss said.
Nevertheless, he said, "labor markets are deteriorating; we're off to a bad start in 1992."
Because the claims number can be extremely volatile from week to week, analysts generally look at a four-week average for a better barometer of hiring practices. Today's report left that average essentially unchanged, at about 450,000.

HEADLINE: Congress Expected to Pass Scaled-Down Energy Plan

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Stripped of its most controversial provisions, the National Energy Strategy proposed by President Bush during the Persian Gulf crisis seems likely to pass this year, according to lawmakers, energy company executives and others.
The Senate version of the bill has been introduced again, minus the provisions on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and on stricter gasoline mileage standards for new cars, and may reach the floor as early as Monday. 
 The trimmed-down version still includes significant proposals for electricity regulation, electric energy efficiency, licensing nuclear power plants and interstate natural gas pipeline construction, among others.
The White House had initially insisted on the Arctic drilling provision, but on Capitol Hill many experts think that the President prefers a bill with no Arctic drilling to no bill at all. Mr. Bush gave the National Energy Strategy brief mention in the State of the Union Message.
The package was initially pushed by the Administration as a balanced plan that would cut energy imports and save the economy money, but it died last year when some senators pledged a filibuster over the Arctic drilling, and the Senate failed to muster enough votes to cut off debate. The strategy's real flaw, many in Washington say, was that it seemed to be less than the sum of its parts, tending to unite its fractious opponents, each opposed to a different part, rather than building support.
The head of the oil lobby, for example, lamented that access to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, known as A.N.W.R., could not even be debated in the Senate in part because of votes against cloture by a half-dozen senators who might have favored the drilling. But the six were dead set against proposed changes in regulations governing interstate operations by electric utilities, he said.
But the Senate is expected to try again in February, on the same package without the Arctic drilling and a stricter "Corporate Average Fuel Economy," or CAFE, standard, which would require Detroit to make more fuel-efficient cars. The two have no connection except a political one; environmentalists opposed to drilling in the wildlife reserve have put the mileage standards forward as an alternative, making one a kind of hostage to the other.
According to people who have lobbied for one part or another of the strategy, the consensus is that drilling in the Arctic refuge is a dead issue, at least for now, and so, therefore, is the fuel economy proposal. "Now Congress can consider the strategy without the bookends of A.N.W.R. and CAFE," Richard Dick Farman, the chairman of the Southern California Gas Company and the chairman of the American Gas Association, said in an interview. What is left might be better characterized as an approach rather than a strategy, but there are many other important proposals on the table, say the experts. Most of them have been floating around Washington long before Saddam Hussein briefly focused the nation's attention on oil.
They include freeing utilities from 50-year-old regulations that make it hard for them to operate across state lines; streamlining the licensing of new nuclear plants; ordering higher efficiency in new electric lights, air conditioners and motors; requiring state public utility commissions to consider changing their regulations to encourage conservation instead of new construction; simplifying the regulatory process for new natural gas pipelines; filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve with oil, and opening up the electric power transmission grid to something approaching common carrier status, like an airline, rather than a private channel among big utilities.
There is also a strong reason to take up the matter this year, before the election. Otherwise, said Representative Phil Sharp, the Indiana Democrat who is chairman of the House Energy Committee's Subcommittee on Energy and Power, elected officials may face a tough campaign issue. "How do you answer the question, 'For Pete's sake, what have you done about energy?' " said Mr. Sharp. At the moment Congress is more worried about the economy and other matters, he said, but "You don't want to have to answer, 'Other things got to be more important.' "
 
Opposing Interests in Congress
 He added that in a Congress representing the interests of both energy producers and energy consumers, "there never has been a time when we did a be-all and end-all energy strategy, but there are a lot of good things here."
Mr. Sharp and others who worked hard on a bill last year say they were encouraged by President Bush's mention of energy in the State of the Union address, because it was only a mention, not a table-thumping demand. "The energy strategy has entered a nonpartisan, neutral zone," said one Senate aide who was involved last year. "The Democrats know George Bush lost on A.N.W.R., which is what he really wanted, and George Bush knows there is still a lot of stuff he likes, and he is almost sure he will not get CAFE, which he doesn't like."
 
Talk of Caribou and Cars
 With the two issues of strong popular interest, the caribou of the Arctic and the cars of Detroit, now sidelined, said the aide, "what's left, we can discuss on its merits."
And the Administration seems willing. When the Secretary of Energy, James D. Watkins, gave details of his department's new budget, he again called for passage of the National Energy Strategy, but put a different cast on the question from what the White House did last year, when it was given as an all-or-nothing proposition. "Nothing's locked in concrete so hard that it can't be worked on the Hill," Mr. Watkins said.
The surviving issues are still contentious, of course, and the House, Senate and White House versions differ in many respects.

HEADLINE: Spending Weak, but Incomes Jump

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Personal spending slowed to a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent in December, the Government said today, as consumers continued to worry about their jobs and incomes.
At the same time, personal incomes jumped 1 percent, the largest increase in three years, but the gain was affected by several factors including unemployment insurance. 
 For the year, the Commerce Department said, incomes rose 3.3 percent, less than half the 6.8 percent increase in 1990 and barely beating a 3.1 percent increase in inflation.
 
Spending Is Off
 Consumer spending rose 3.9 percent during 1991, down from 6.4 percent a year earlier.
Larry Meyer of Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, an economic forecasting service in St. Louis, said: "Confidence is still down; the unemployment rate will probably continue to grow. We're not likely to see much more than 1 percent growth in consumption in the first quarter."
That would bode ill for the economy, since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of economic activity.
The differences between incomes and spending contributed to a 5.8 percent savings rate in December, up from 5 percent a month earlier. Americans' savings rate for the year was 5.3 percent, up from 5.1 percent in 1990.
In addition to an increase in unemployment insurance payments, the December gain in incomes was affected by increases in farm subsidy payments and a December bonus for motor vehicle industry employees.
Personal incomes totaled $4.92 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from $4.87 trillion in November and the biggest increase since a 1.3 percent gain in January 1989.
Personal consumption totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.95 trillion, up from $3.94 trillion a month earlier.
 
The Tax Effect
 Disposable incomes -- incomes after taxes -- rose 1.1 percent, the largest increase since a 3.3 percent advance, also in January 1989. Disposable incomes had slipped two-tenths of 1 percent a month earlier.
A key component of the income category -- wages and salaries -- increased $18 billion after gaining $2.7 billion in November.
The income and spending figures were not adjusted for inflation. When adjusted, disposable incomes rose just eight-tenths of 1 percent. Consumer spending, on the other hand, was unchanged from November.
Spending on durable goods -- generally items expected to last more than three years -- fell $400 million on top of a $3 billion loss the previous month.
Spending on nondurable goods dropped $1 billion, adding to a $400 million loss a month earlier.
Spending on services posted a $13.5 billion gain after rising $18.8 billion in November.

HEADLINE: Orders for Durables Off Sharply

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Orders to United States factories for durable goods plunged an unexpectedly steep 5 percent in December, the first decline in three months and the largest in more than a year, the Government said today.
The Commerce Department said the December decline, led by a huge decrease in the transportation sector, helped drive durable-goods orders down 4.6 percent, to $1.44 trillion, for all of 1991. That was the largest loss since the recession year of 1982, when orders fell 6.7 percent. 
 The durable-goods report was just part of a rash of discouraging economic news today.
A separate report said consumers' spending was up only slightly last month, three-tenths of 1 percent. Americans' personal income was up 1 percent, but that was partly attributed to rising jobless payments because of the economic slump. [Page D6.]
And a third report showed that more people sought jobless benefits through the middle of this month. It was the second straight rise in such claims and more than erased the improvements seen around the first of January, when holiday-shortened workweeks spurred a decline in the number of people reporting being laid off. [Page D6.]
Businesses -- and the Bush Administration -- are anxiously seeking any sign of revival. But Gilbert Benz, an economist with the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York, said the reports suggested "there basically will be no growth in the first quarter of this year."
 
'Maintaining Equilibrium'
 Robert G. Dederick, an economist with the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, concurred: "The economy is kind of standing on rubbery legs. It isn't falling down. It's maintaining its equilibrium, but it can do no more."
President Bush did not comment on the new economic reports during a speech to business executives in Philadelphia, but he saw reason for hope in other economic signs. "Inflation is down," he said. "Inventories are down. The market has been expressing optimism in the future. Interest rates are down, and this is no time for gloom and doom."
The Commerce Department reported that orders for long-lasting, usually expensive, durable goods, like cars and computers, fell to a seasonally adjusted $117.7 billion in December. The 5 percent decline was the largest since orders plunged 11.2 percent in November 1990.
Transportation orders were down 13.9 percent, accounting for most of the overall decline. If not for the transportation sector, total orders would have been down just 1.6 percent.
On the other hand, military orders soared 86 percent; without that gain the overall orders decline would have been a staggering 8.9 percent. Orders for military hardware are expected to decline in coming months because of cutbacks in the Pentagon budget.
In today's report, the Commerce Department revised November's increase in new orders to just four-tenths of 1 percent from the estimate of 1 percent made a month ago.
Unfilled orders also declined in December for the fourth straight month. Unfilled orders are a measure of whether current production capacity and manpower are able to keep up with demand. A drop in unfilled orders could signal fewer production lines and jobs.
 
Variation by Category
 Orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft were off seven-tenths of 1 percent after edging up one-tenth of 1 percent a month earlier. These orders are often a barometer of industry plans to expand and modernize.
Orders for industrial machinery and equipment also fell, down 3.2 percent after a 1.2 percent gain in November. Orders for primary metals fell 8.9 percent, after rising 2.1 percent in November.
Electronic and other electrical equipment posted the only advance in orders among the major categories, and computer and office equipment registered gains. They were up 2.8 percent on top of a 1.2 percent increase in November.

Profits Post 18.1% Rise At Johnson

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Buoyed by strong sales gains in pharmaceutical, professional and consumer products, Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that profits in the final quarter of 1991 rose 18.1 percent, to $274 million, or 83 cents a share, on $3.15 billion in worldwide sales. Net income in the final 1990 quarter was $232 million, or 70 cents a share, on $2.79 billion in sales.
For all of 1991, Johnson & Johnson, the world's largest health-care company, said net earnings were a record $1.46 billion, or $4.39 a share, up from $1.14 billion in 1990, when the company wrote off $125 million, after taxes, on Latin American operations, primarily in Argentina. Excluding the one-time charge, 1990 profits were $1.27 billion, or $3.81 a share, and the 1991 gain was 15.2 percent. 
 Sales last year were a record $12.45 billion, a 10.9 percent increase from 1990 sales of $11.23 billion.
Currency exchange fluctuations reduced sales in dollars by 2.6 percent, or $72 million, in the quarter and nine-tenths of 1 percent, or $106 million, for the year. The company, based in New Brunswick, N.J., does half its business abroad, in more than 150 countries.
Roy E. Larsen, the company's chairman, said profits rose last year even though the company increased spending on research and development by 17.5 percent, to $980 million; expanded marketing and promotion for a number of new products, and faced continuing problems with inflation in Brazil.
Neil B. Sweig, an analyst with Brenner Securities, reacted favorably to the company's report, saying, "They are operating on all eight cylinders in many dynamic markets." He noted that pharmaceutical sales rose 16.1 percent in the quarter, to $973 million, and 14.9 percent, to $3.795 billion, for the year.
Although it does not have a billion-dollar blockbuster prescription drug, Johnson had a dozen with sales of at least $100 million each in 1991.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Johnson & Johnson's stock rose $2.75 to close at $106 a share.

Precious Metals in Plunge On Doubt About Recovery

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Precious metals futures plunged yesterday on the Commodity Exchange in New York as investors showed doubts about the economy's recovery and about demand from industry for the metals in the near future.
Gold for February delivery settled $2.70 cents lower at $353.40 an ounce; March silver was 10 cents lower at $4.131 an ounce. 
 "The silver market broke down pretty nicely today," said Randolph Donney, a metals analyst with the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. "The theory has been that a pickup in economic activity will spur demand for industrial metals. With each passing week that the longs are in the market waiting for some evidence of that, the patience wears thin."
 
Volatility in Chicago
 Grains and soybeans futures had a volatile day on the Chicago Board of Trade and ended mixed after wild speculation that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia had been ousted.
Wheat for delivery in March settled 5 1/2 cents lower at $4.36 a bushel. March corn was 1/4 cent higher at $2.63 1/2 a bushel. March oats were 4 3/4 cents higher at $1.48 3/4 a bushel, and March soybeans were 3 1/2 cent lower at $5.72 3/4 a bushel.
Prices began slipping on follow-through selling after Wednesday's close, but the slide steepened on the Yeltsin rumor. A State Department spokesman said later that all appeared relatively quiet in the Russian Federation.
Soybeans continued to slide on continually improving conditions in South America, where the Brazilian soybean crop is getting plenty of moisture during a crucial growth period.
Losses were slashed toward the end of the session on word from Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan, who said more grain credits could be extended to the former Soviet republics if they continued to make timely payments on past loans.
Oil futures prices were mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Light sweet crude for March delivery settled 5 cents higher at $18.94 a barrel. February home heating oil slipped 1.85 cents, to 52.14 cents a gallon. Unleaded gasoline rose 0.90 cent, to 55.51 cents a gallon, while March natural gas retreated 1.4 cents, to $1.166 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Coffee futures on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New Yorkpicked up after nearly a week of straight declines.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher In a Hectic Trading Session

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar seesawed yesterday in hectic trading, falling first on weak United States economic statistics, rebounding strongly on a false rumor about a Russian coup and finishing mostly higher.
"It was a crazy day," said John McCarthy, chief foreign exchange dealer at the New York branch of Algemene Banc Nederland, a Dutch bank. "As a whole, the dollar remains quite resilient in the face of less than promising news." 
 Dealers said dollar selling prevailed through the early part of the global trading day, partly on the weakness reported Wednesday in fourth-quarter United States economic growth, the slowest since the 1982 recession.
The selling accelerated when the Government reported yesterday that factories received sharply fewer orders for durable goods in December and more people sought jobless benefits in the middle of January.
Then a false rumor raced through the foreign exchange market that the president of the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, en route to the United States, had been toppled in a coup.
The Russian Government officially denied it, but not before a surge in demand for dollars reversed the currency's slide. The dollar has historically proved to be the most sought-after currency in times of crisis. "There's no question that uncertainty in the former Soviet Union quickly moved people into dollars," Mr. McCarthy said.
Earl I. Johnson, vice president and corporate adviser at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago, said the dollar strengthened further on fears of a weakening economy in Germany, where labor unrest is growing.
He also said the Yeltsin rumor, though unfounded, was likely to keep the market nervous and predisposed to move into dollars. Nonetheless, Mr. Johnson said, the economic weakness in the United States was likely to restrain the dollar's value from appreciating very much.
"The economic fundamentals aren't there for the dollar to move up yet," he said. "The numbers don't point to an early recovery in the economy."
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.43 yen to close at 125.60 yen. Later in London the dollar fetched 125.95 yen. At the close in New York the dollar fetched 125.70 yen, up from 125.65 yen late Wednesday.
The British pound fell in London to $1.7740, from $1.8095 late Wednesday. In New York the pound fetched $1.7820, cheaper than its $1.7975 rate late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Scott Paper Reports Loss

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 30

 BODY:
The Scott Paper Company said today that it lost $157.7 million in its fourth quarter because of large restructuring charges and tough economic conditions.
The quarterly loss for the three months ended Dec. 28 compared with a loss of $51.5 million in the quarter a year earlier. Sales for the quarter fell to $1.32 billion from $1.43 billion a year ago. 
 For the year, Scott's loss compared with earnings of $148 million, or 80 cents a share, in 1990. Sales fell to $4.98 billion for the year from $5.36 billion a year earlier.
Scott is in the midst of reducing its work force to concentrate on its core businesses of personal care and cleaning products and coated printing and publishing papers. Special one-time charges related to restructuring and divestments cost the company $183 million in 1991, Scott said. Special charges in 1990 had cost $100 million.
A depressed economy, excess capacity on the part of Scott and the industry, and weak markets hurt earnings of the United States tissue business and its printing and publishing papers business, Philip E. Lippincott, chairman and chief executive, said.
The company's stock gained 62.5 cents, to $41, in trading today on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Basic Conflict In Budget Policy

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
IN his State of the Union Message, President Bush highlighted the key problem facing budget and fiscal policy: that the American economy's short-term needs and long-term requirements are in conflict.
"We must have a short-term plan to address our immediate needs and heat up the economy," he said. "And then we need a long-term plan to keep the combustion going and to guarantee our place in the world economy." 
 But, by using the heat-combustion metaphor, the President obscured the difference between policies intended to lift the economy out of recession faster by stimulative measures that would swell the budget deficit, and policies to insure long-term growth, which would require reducing the budget deficit. Continued deficits will weaken the national savings rate, which is already at 3 percent of national income -- the lowest of any industrial country. The low savings rate is a major cause of America's lagging investment, sluggish productivity growth and loss of ground in world markets.
As the details of his budget show, however, Mr. Bush and his economic advisers were well aware of the policy conflict and did try to reconcile measures to meet short-term economic (and political) aims with those required to attain long-term growth. The question is how well the President's budget plan achieves its double objectives.
For short-term stimulus, the President proposes a grab bag of measures, some old, some new, some borrowed from the Democrats, some blue sky. These include cutting the capital gains tax to 15.4 percent from 28 percent; enacting the Administration's banking reform proposals; easing the credit crunch by telling banking regulators to take it easy, and declaring a three-month moratorium on all new regulations that interfere with growth.
They also call for putting an extra $25 billion in some taxpayers' pockets sooner by reducing their income-tax withholding; providing a $5,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers and restoring "passive" loss rules allowing a netting of gains and losses for tax purposes, but only for "active" real estate developers, thereby partly reopening a loophole closed in the 1986 Tax Reform Act.
By this array of tax breaks and mostly temporary shifts, the President avoided proposing a big tax cut for short-term stimulus that might also aggravate budget deficits in the longer run.
Indeed, Mr. Bush is trying to offset part of the revenue loss from his short-term proposals by unadvertised spending cuts in areas ranging from aid to Appalachia to cuts in home heating and housing for the elderly and disabled. On the day after the President's speech, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, was not fighting the Administration so much as supporting it with his warning against stimulative tax cuts.
What the Administration is really counting on to turn the economy around by no later than midyear is the lagged effect of monetary stimulus the Fed has already put into the system, especially by its December cut of a full percentage point in the discount rate, to a very low 3 1/2 percent. The Administration's assumption is that the economy will accelerate as the year wears on, with gross domestic product growing at an average rate of 2.2 percent for the year and the unemployment rate falling slightly, to 6.8 percent by year-end.
Even if that wish comes true, the consolidated budget deficit for the fiscal year 1992, which the Administration had until recently projected at $360 billion, will rise to $401 billion, by its new estimate.
The real shocker in the President's long-range plan, however, is not the short- but the long-range budget projections, which show a deficit of $353 billion in 1993 and deficits averaging almost $200 billion each year from 1994 through 1997. The grand total from now till then would be $1.5 trillion.
Even after deducting the cyclical component of those deficits and outlays for savings and loan and bank insurance, the so-called adjusted structural budget deficits will total $1.3 trillion from 1992 through 1997. The structural deficit at the end of that six-year period will be $212 billion, compared with $268 billion at the beginning. That's a lot of negative saving. And it will do much to reduce business investment in new plant and equipment or research and development, which tax breaks cannot be expected to offset.
The Administration's failure to bring deficits down further and sooner stems significantly from the President's decision to make relatively small cuts in military spending. "By 1997, we will have cut defense by 30 percent since I took office," he said. He added, "These cuts are deep, and you must know my resolve: this deep, and no deeper."
Before the Soviet collapse, an estimated 60 percent of United States military spending was allocated to the deterrence or defeat of Soviet and Warsaw Pact aggression. A battle is now shaping up over whether, with the end of the cold war, deeper military cuts would be warranted in the nation's economic, social and security interests.

HEADLINE: UJB Fight By Chilmark

 BODY:
Chilmark Capital Partners, a New York investment group, said yesterday that it planned a proxy fight for one or more board seats at the UJB Financial Corporation, a Princeton, N.J., bank-holding company.
Chilmark, which acqured 9.9 percent of UJB late last year, said it had retained Dewe Rogerson Inc., a proxy soliciting firm, to aid in the contest for the April 20 shareholder meeting. 
 Chilmark said it wanted board seats to push UJB, operator of United Jersey Banks, to consider a merger, which it said could raise the company's stock price.
UJB has been hurt by the downturn in the New Jersey economy and real estate markets but has remained profitable.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, UJB shares gained 75 cents each, closing at $17.

HEADLINE: No Arts Cuts in Dinkins Fiscal Plan

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
Tucked away inside the four-year preliminary financial plan for the city released yesterday by Mayor David N. Dinkins is the assertion that despite drastic cuts for most city agencies the culture budget will remain unchanged.
The bulky document, which proposes allocating more than $100 billion over the next four years for everything from police and firefighters to libraries and schools, includes one brief paragraph headlined "Department of Cultural Affairs": 
 "In recognition of the importance of the city's cultural institutions and their education programs, the beneficial impact they have on the local economy, and the effects of the reductions taken in previous years, the plan contains no further expense reductions during the four-year period."
 
Spreading Joyful Word
 "There's a measure of good news in there -- no further cuts in the culture budget!" Barbara J. Fife, Deputy Mayor for Planning and Development, said yesterday. "Just about everything else -- 80 or 90 percent of all the other agencies -- got cut."
The Mayor's preliminary financial plan is only a first step. He is expected to introduce his so-called executive budget for fiscal 1993 in April, and the final budget for the year is not due to be approved by the City Council until June.
The maintenance of the culture budget is highly unusual, said Deputy Mayor Fife, in that the Mayor's plan anticipates reductions across the board adding up to $190 million in fiscal 1993, and rising to $525 million by fiscal 1996. "Some city agency reductions will go as high as 40 percent on top of large reductions that were taken the last few years," she said.
Arts administrators felt especially hard hit last year when the city's recession-straitened budget lopped 28 percent, or $24 million, off the original $87 million arts appropriation. Yesterday, they expressed relief.
"We welcome the announcement," said Harvey Lichtenstein, the president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music and chairman of the Cultural Institutions Group, a coalition of arts organizations that occupy city-owned real estate.
"The Mayor's assurance is essential," he continued, "because the current year's 30 percent cut in city funding for cultural institutions resulted in severe service cutbacks."
Speaking in his capacity as head of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Mr. Lichtenstein said that last year's cut obliged him to reduce both staff and programs by about 20 percent.
"Some museums were even harder hit," he continued. "They had to shut galleries and remain closed an additional day or two. Educational programs were especially damaged because bringing a lot of children into a museum requires a lot of maintenance, and so those programs got cut."
 
'We're Still Reeling'
 Jason Steven Cohen, the producing director of the New York Shakespeare Festival, said: "We're still reeling from last year's cut, which came to $301,000. We're gratified by the Mayor's decision, but I hope that in the budget process we can even have some of the earlier cuts restored."
Mr. Lichtenstein was quick to point out the importance of cultural organizations to the economy of the city. "Every dollar the city appropriates for cultural institutions," he said, "leverages $3 in private donations, and enhances the prestige and economic vitality of New York City."
Luis R. Cancel, the Cultural Affairs Commissioner, said, "The Mayor's financial plan is flying in the face of the recession, and against the sort of cuts that are being made in Albany, and the cultural community cannot help but deeply appreciate that."

HEADLINE: Review/Film;
A Variation on the Oedipus Theme

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY

 BODY:
European film makers are restless these days. They are roaming the world in search of something, though exactly what remains unclear. Possibly financial backing, maybe subject matter, perhaps something to believe in.
Wim Wenders took his cast and crew through seven countries before finally settling down in Australia to conclude his enjoyably peripatetic new-age comedy, "Until the End of the World."
Volker Schlondorff displays the same itch in his "Voyager," which was shot in Mexico, France, Italy, the United States and Greece. The new film, opening today at the Lincoln Plaza, is no less new age than Mr. Wenders's, though it considers the world in terms that evoke classic Greek tragedy rather than Jean-Luc Godard.
The multi-national auspices behind these films, and the variety of locations in which they were shot, appear to reflect an increasing rootlessness within the European film industry. As recent political and economic upheavals are evident in the manner in which the movies are made, the conditions are also manifest in the concerns expressed in the films themselves.
Politics and party lines are to be avoided. They may be out of date next week. In some ways, Mr. Wenders, Mr. Schlondorff and other European film makers today appear to be as uncertain as the characters within their films.
"Voyager," directed by Mr. Schlondorff and adapted by Rudy Wurlitzer from the 1957 Max Frisch novel, "Homo Faber," is about nothing less than fate and predestination as they operate in the curious story of Walter Faber (Sam Shepard).
The film is a modern variation on the Oedipus myth, recalled in flashbacks within flashbacks that start in June 1957, at the airport in Athens. Walter, an engineer who works with the United Nations, is a man who travels light or, as he tells someone: "Three or four days with a woman is the absolute maximum. After that I dissimulate."
He recalls his student days in Switzerland, just before World War II, when he abandoned Hannah (Barbara Sukowa), his pregnant lover, to return to the United States. He had told himself that he wasn't being a cad. Hannah had promised to get an abortion and his best friend, a German student named Joachim (August Zirner), had promised to look out for her.
Some years later, in another flashback, he remembers hearing that Joachim and Hannah had married, had a child and divorced. Still later he remembers taking a ship from New York to France and meeting Sabeth (Julie Delpy), a spectacularly pretty and sweet young student with whom he falls in love, at least in part because she reminds him of Hannah.
What with all of Walter's musing on the soundtrack about probability and coincidence, the audience is alerted to the truth about Sabeth's parentage long before it dawns on Walter. He only catches on after he and Sabeth have had an idyllic motor tour across the continent, and Walter is about to deliver the young woman to her mother in Greece.
In the film's abrupt and rather brutal conclusion, the gods intervene to punish Walter for his earlier transgression. The man of technology and science is brought to heel by laws that have nothing to do with his universe.
All of this plays with a lot more intelligence than you might expect. The English dialogue often sounds as if it had been translated from something else, but there is an engaging leisureliness, almost a lassitude, about the pace that invites contemplation.
Walter, as played by Mr. Shepard, is seriously eccentric and self-aware. He's a character of some stature. So is Sabeth. Because Miss Delpy is a most attractive actress, the love affair takes on such weight and meaning that the inevitable revelation seems an arbitrary intrusion by a doomily schematic plot.
It also seems to be worlds away from the world in which the film was made.
"Voyager" has been handsomely photographed in all sorts of exotic locations, though it might have been just as effective if shot in two or three fewer countries. It is well acted by Mr. Shepard and Miss Delpy, and is full of moments so particular and odd that they invite belief. Yet its tale of fate and predestination seems, at last, to be not timeless but absurd.
"Voyager," which has been rated PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned), deals with incest.

Barnes in Court
The controversial administration of the Barnes Foundation is now being legally challenged. The assault comes in the form of a suit alleging that the trustees of the foundation, a world-renowned institution in Merion, Pa., that has a priceless collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist art, have taken advantage of the foundation's assets. The suit was filed by the De Mazia Trust, which was established by Violette de Mazia, a protegee and close companion of the founder, Dr. Albert C. Barnes. Miss de Mazia, who died four years ago, was a driving force in the institution, which she served as a vice president and the education director.
The Barnes Foundation, established in 1922 by Barnes, a patent-medicine manufacturer, to perpetuate his art collection and his ideas about art education, has always been considered an eccentric, exclusive institution. Barnes, for example, was well known for refusing to allow important collectors like Walter P. Chrysler Jr. and distinguished scholars like Meyer Schapiro and Kenneth Clark to see any of his estimated 800 paintings and 200 sculptures. Before his death in 1951, the founder made another unusual decision: he gave Lincoln University -- a small, predominantly black college 45 miles west of Merion with no track record in art education -- the power to nominate the trustees of the Barnes Foundation.
Both the foundation and its trustees made news last May when a lucrative contract was signed with Alfred A. Knopf to publish for the first time color photographs of the foundation's collection. The holdings include 170 Renoirs, 55 Cezannes and 20 Picassos. The deal was signed a month after the Newhouse Foundation made a $2 million donation to Lincoln University. The head of the Newhouse Foundation, and the son of its founder, is S. I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of the corporation that owns Knopf.
In its petition filed on Jan. 21 in Montgomery County, Pa., the De Mazia Trust charges that the Barnes trustees used the catalogue contract as a lure for the donation to Lincoln University. (Three out of the five trustees of the Barnes Foundation are also on the board of Lincoln University, and the fourth, Richard H. Glanton, the president, is the university's general counsel.) The donation, they say, should have gone directly to the Barnes Foundation, which owns the artwork to be catalogued. The De Mazia Trust contends that because of the contribution to Lincoln, the Barnes trustees dismissed bids made by other publishers. They say other publishers would have given the foundation a contribution of several million dollars but that their efforts were ignored.
Mr. Glanton's response was: "That's not true. We had four serious proposals. We asked each publisher for a minimum of a $500,000 advance and only one publisher met our request." He added that Harry N. Abrams, the New York-based publisher, submitted the "second best" proposal.
But Paul Gottlieb, the president and publisher of Abrams, denies this. "The Barnes Foundation had no idea what they would have gotten out of us," said Mr. Gottlieb.
Mr. Glanton said on Wednesday that Knopf had awarded the Barnes Foundation a $750,000 advance for publishing the collection, a sum Mr. Gottlieb called "staggering" for an art book. He added, "I don't really believe that's what the advance is."
According to Susan D. Ralston, the editor of the catalogue at Knopf, "$750,000 is an erroneous figure."
"The real amount is a private matter between the Barnes Foundation and Knopf," Mrs. Ralston said, adding that the contract was for two books. The first book, a selection of the Barnes Foundation's great works, is to be in bookstores by the fall of 1993. While Mrs. Ralston said that no writer had been decided on, a name that keeps surfacing is that of J. Carter Brown, the director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington. Mr. Brown announced his resignation last week but is to remain in the post through this year. The second part of the contract is a catalogue raisonne that may be published in more than one volume. Consulting with the Barnes Foundation on the selection of art are several institutions, including the National Gallery, the French National Museums and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
After the suit concerning the book contract was filed in Montgomery County Orphans' Court by the De Mazia Trust, the Barnes Foundation asked the court to withdraw a petition it made in March to ease visiting-hour restrictions, change investment policies, raise admission fees and allow the building to be used for social functions. But last week Louis D. Stefan, a Montgomery County judge, refused to let the foundation withdraw its suit. Instead, the judge asked the trustees to produce the foundation's financial documents as well as minutes of its board meetings.
"The Attorney General also opposed the request to withdraw the petition," said Judge Stefan in a telephone interview. "He wants to enable the court to look into the allegations raised by the De Mazia Trust and to resolve the serious issues currently being raised." Judge Stefan said that a hearing was tentatively scheduled for March.
Mr. Glanton called the allegations in the suit "very regrettable," and said the foundation's books and records would be open to the court.
The de Mazia suit is the most explosive challenge to the Glanton-led board of the Barnes Foundation. It clearly draws the line between the trustees, who want change, and Barnes loyalists, who would like to preserve the status quo. The De Mazia Trust, along with a group of past and present students, is committed to preserving the 70-year-old foundation's emphasis on art education. The trustees say they are trying to modernize the foundation and make its outstanding but little-known art collection available to a wider audience.
The trustees made their first move in this direction in April, when they petitioned the court for permission to sell up to 15 paintings from their collection to raise what they said was a badly needed $15 million to modernize the deteriorating galleries and to supplement the $10 million endowment that now generates only $1 million annually for operating costs. (It is normal museum practice to sell works of art only to acquire other art, not to use the proceeds for operating costs.) But three months later, the foundation changed its mind, citing adverse publicity as the reason for deciding not to sell works from its collection.
Meanwhile, the board is considering other options that would go against the very strict indenture set up by the foundation's creator. Among the prohibitions laid down by the irascible Dr. Barnes was a stipulation that the collection may never be moved from the present 1926 building that houses the artworks. But the trustees would like to close the museum for renovations and send the collection on tour to other museums like the National Gallery of Art. "It is one of the options under consideration," Mr. Glanton said. "But I cannot really comment any further."
 
A Shrinking Whitney
 The Whitney Museum of American Art is losing two of its three Manhattan branches. It has been asked to vacate by August its first-floor gallery in the Equitable Center, at Seventh Avenue and 52d Street, where the museum has been holding exhibitions for the last six years. By the end of September, the space at 33 Maiden Lane, which has housed the Whitney's downtown gallery since 1988, will be transformed into an I.B.M. marketing and education center.
"It's another sign of the times," said David A. Ross, the director of the Whitney. "These branches were a way of keeping more of our collection on view." Mr. Ross also pointed out that the timing for the closings was particularly bad since the museum's expansion plans have been postponed until the economy picks up.
Since their inception, the branches have always been well attended. During fiscal year 1991, for example, 40,000 people visited the Whitney's downtown branch; about 100,000 passed through the Equitable Center branch. "The branches fulfilled an important purpose," said Mr. Ross. "The Whitney has about 10,000 works of art in its collection and even when the entire third and fourth floors are used, there may only be about 200 artworks in an installation. Without these branches, fewer people will have a chance to see the depth of of our collection."
In financial terms, Mr. Ross said, these branches were neither a drain nor an income producer. Admission to all of the Whitney's branches are free and corporations like Equitable Life Assurance, International Business Machines and Park Tower Realty financed their operating costs.
Equitable, as well as I.B.M. and Park Tower Realty, which jointly own the building on Maiden Lane, said each company would continue to give the museum financial support, as they have in the past. But each corporation had different reasons for closing its branch of the Whitney: at Equitable, Mary Mannarino, the manager of public relations, said the company had decided to "support a wider number of institutions who would benefit from the good location." Ms. Mannarino also explained that Equitable would not be making any public announcement about future exhibitions until the spring.
At the Whitney's Maiden Lane location, an award-winning space designed by the New York architects Tod Williams and Billie Tsien, Paul Neuman, a media spokesman for I.B.M., said the decision to close the gallery wasn't an easy one since they were losing a mini-landmark. "We are downsizing and shrinking our real-estate holdings," he said. "We simply needed the space." Meanwhile, Park Tower Realty, in an effort to continue its association with the museum, is planning to help the Whitney find a new location. "We haven't actually begun the search," said Kate Coburn, Park Tower's director of marketing. "But we will be finding the Whitney a new downtown home."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 21, 2005

 CORRECTION:
 An article on Dec. 14 about a judge's decision to let the Barnes, Foundation move its art holdings from Merion, Pa., to Philadelphia misstated the number of works by Renoir, Cezanne and ,Picasso, in the collection. (Several articles since 1991 have also variously misstated those figures as ,well as the number of works by Matisse.) There are 181 Renoirs, not ,170;, 69 ,Cezannes, not ,55;, and 46 ,Picassos,, not ,20., There are 59 Matisses, not 60. An e-mail message from a reader last week pointed out the errors.

HEADLINE: The Word's Turn: Urban Poets Re-emerge

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN

 BODY:
A CREWCUT young woman, wearing only black, intones with a sultry, hypnotizing voice: "You moan with/the insanity of such/raw miraculous movements." The poem she is reading this night -- her own -- proceeds to describe an overwhelming sexual encounter. The crowd at the nightclub cheers when she finishes, and then 5 audience judges rate her effort: she averages an 8, on a scale of 0 to 10.
A gangly young man prone to arm flails, her competitor in a surreal contest called a Poetry Slam, counters with a string of non sequiturs loosely tied to American malaise: "Zombies do well in an addictive society/. . . The Pope will let you kiss his ring but he won't let you wear his hat." His scores run from a 7.9 to a 10. As the winner, he receives the $10 grand prize; but not before the contest host makes sure to remind the listeners that "the best poet always loses." 
 Such frenetic scenes occur every Friday at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, a drafty, bare brick loft in the East Village. And while the Nuyorican seems to be the only New York City club that has started regular Poetry Slams, dozens of other night spots and cafes in the five boroughs and beyond have regular poetry events on weekends. The self-indulgent verse sessions of the 1950's Beats have returned, this time with 90's political outrage and hip-hop energy.
"It's an incredibly active scene," says Eve Packer, who calls herself a performance poet and often reads to the musical accompaniment of a live band called the Future. "People hang out, dance, drink, yell, and the work is very urban, very rhythmic, full of sex, drugs, violence, politics, anger, humor. And it's not a depressed scene, it's not introverted or tortured; that's a 50's image."
The monthly New York City Poetry Calendar, founded as a skimpy broadsheet in 1976, has grown unwieldy, with up to a dozen listings per day at more than 60 venues. About two-thirds are old reliables like libraries, churches, art galleries and bookstores; a few private homes also appear. The rest are night spots and cafes that typically discovered the muse less than three years ago.
Bob Holman, the fast-talking host of the Nuyorican's Slams, attributes the scene's new vitality to a cold, high-tech world, where people long for human contact; to rap's "driving the wax out of the ears of teen-agers"; to academic poetry's prevailing lifelessness, and to frustration with empty verbiage spewed by politicians and advertisers. Money is also a factor: poetry helps fill seats at slow hours.
"It's one of our better nights here," says Kerry Smith, owner of Right Bank, a three-year-old bar in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. His biweekly Sunday readings rank as one of the hipper spots in town to bare a soul, says Kathe Burkhart, a poet who lives nearby and won a Nuyorican Slam this month. (Mr. Holman crowned her "Slum Goddess of the 90's"; her most colorful selection raged against the ways women adapt to men and men torment women and concluded, "he will give up nothing for you./Not yet.")
 
Not Quite So Current
 The Moroccan Star, on the other hand, a Middle Eastern restaurant near the Brooklyn Borough Hall, presents Sunday open readings that feel like circa 1975 group therapy. Sponsored by the New Press, which publishes a poetry quarterly, the sessions recently prompted John Todras to berate his ex-wife in verse ("Some marriages resemble tossing dice") and Carol Blair to agonize over memories of the Joel Steinberg trial ("Joel, Hedda, Lisa/. . . ecstasy's violent eruption").
The Ear Inn's 14-year-old program is slicker, presenting two established, although experimental writers on Saturday afternoons. Jerome Sala recently mused on commercialism at the cozy tavern, in SoHo, surrounded by women in earth tone blouses and men in faded lumberjack shirts. "O new coke,/it's not your taste we hate so much/as your lack of integrity," one poem complains, and another warns, "no purchase is necessary to disintegrate."
Sin-e, a two-year-old East Village coffee house with soothing peach walls, attracts sleek young men in black leather jingling with chains, as well as 70-ish widows with spiky hair and bemused smiles. Its programs are as varied as its listeners; a few weeks ago, Dorothy Shubow Nelson contemplated global change ("I see icons everywhere/yet no longer see myself/in relation to anything greater/than the places that I go") and Veronica Vera, a self-described porn queen, read a chapter of her racy autobiography.
A few blocks north, the Pyramid Club presents a year-old poetry series heavy on progressive topics like "treatments of the issues of gayness," says Larry Jones, the program's organizer. The Public Theater's cafe started poetry sessions this year, and Max Fish, a Lower East Side bar so cool it keeps its phone number unlisted, provokes "great reading; people really let their hair down," says Ms. Packer, the poet. Like everywhere else she performs, she adds, "there's that arc of contact and energy with the audience; you create a spark and it builds and builds."
 
It Began in Chicago
 The Nuyorican remains her favorite stage. Founded in 1974, the space closed for renovations in 1982 and didn't reopen again until 1989. To spice up its second incarnation, the directors borrowed an idea from a Chicago bar, the Green Mill Lounge, where Slams have occurred since 1986. "I didn't trademark the name, because I wanted it to spread and spread easily," says Marc Smith, a Chicago poet who is the Slam's inventor and who has watched it expand to 20 other cities so far.
At the Nuyorican, low-cost, highly drinkable wines and beer flow at a bar near the entrance; ethnic groups mingle comfortably, and the staff encourages dancing in the aisles during breaks. But despite the cafe's charms and the spoken-word boom, it is affected by the recession, as are some of its colleagues.
The New Press must shift its programs from restaurant to restaurant, as managers grow tired of late-drinking literati. The Knitting Factory, a renowned setting for avant-garde work in the East Village, no longer pays its poetry readers because New York State has dramatically cut grants for literary efforts. And Webo, a popular performance and poetry club in the East Village, opened in 1990 and died of debt in 1991.
A lot of these places have closed because they can't afford the rent, says Miguel Algarin, a co-director at the Nuyorican, which fortunately owns its own quarters.
"We're not making money," says Mr. Holman. "We're not a smash success. That would require a wholesale rethinking of what culture and civilization are about."

Syndicator Gives ABC Easy Fast Break on Profit

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
The future of network sports comes into a slightly sharper focus Sunday when college basketball returns to ABC at 1 P.M. with a doubleheader package of games featuring U.C.L.A.-Louisville and Kentucky-L.S.U.
It will dribble and quack like network college basketball. But it won't be. The games are produced by Raycom Inc., the Charlotte, N.C., sports syndicator, in what is called a time buy. 
 Raycom is paying ABC $1.8 million for six weeks of network air time to put on 26 games that will be shown regionally, like ABC's college football schedule. Raycom controls the games and sells the advertising. ABC sheds virtually all of its overhead and makes an easy profit, a reversal from recent losses on basketball.
Last spring, ABC was telling colleges how much it would reduce its rights fees to them when Rick and Dee Ray, the husband-and-wife owners of Raycom, approached the network with their time-buy concept.
"We were looking to reduce rights fees by 40 to 60 percent," said Tony Petitti, programming director of ABC Sports. "We lost millions last year. This was a good way to turn a loser into a financial contributor to ABC."
ABC's disappointing 3.0 Nielsen rating for college basketball last year was attributed to the glut of games on network, local and cable dials. "Ratings were down and rights fees were growing," said Petitti.
Enter Raycom, which this season will produce 462 college basketball games that will be seen on outlets like ESPN and the Prime Network or syndicated to local stations.
"We've always wanted a national sell on basketball," said Ken Haines, executive vice president of Raycom. "Our history has been regional sales and combining regional sales for an almost national buy for advertisers."
Crucial to the Raycom-ABC deal is the difference in corporate economics. Because Raycom is not a union shop, it can produce the games for at least 25 percent of what they would cost ABC. Raycom also had the collegiate and conference connections to secure the rights to games that ABC wouldn't normally get on its own.
Said Petitti: "We've taken all the risk out of college basketball."
That's the idea. Networks are struggling to get out from under the burden of big sports losses. NBC is losing money on pro football. CBS is losing about $500 million from the value of its $1.06 billion major league baseball deal.
In every nook and cranny of the sports divisons, small and large cuts are being made to nudge events toward or into profitability.
But in the world of the time buy, the networks see possibilities spawned by outsider producers like Raycom to shed the risk of paying for rights while gaining a guaranteed profit by renting their time for a few hours at a time.
The litany of time-buy events on the networks is growing. Last December, for example, Raycom bought time on CBS to show the Blockbuster Bowl.
Others showcase a mix of legitimate made-for-TV programming like "The Skins Game," and "The Tournament of Champions," a seniors ski event. Still others are trash sports, like the "Reebok Arnold Schwarzenegger Classic," a bodybuilding competition that aired last October .
Bob Horowitz, vice president and general manager of GGP, one of the most active outside producers buying time on the networks, said, "A network feels it can get a network quality show from our outfit or IMG or Don Ohlmeyer, and delivered in a way that everybody wins in the end."
Of course, what makes the outside-produced programming seem more like it emanates from the networks is that the productions often employ network talent. Among the annoucers on ABC's Raycom games are Brent Musburger, Dick Vitale, Jim Valvano, Gary Bender, Cheryl Miller and Mark Jones. The networks' hope is that the presence of their own broadcasters won't simply be masking a chintzy nonnetwork production.
Haines wants the ABC package to be a harbinger of Raycom's future. "This gives us another means of distribution that has long been the sacred domain of the three major networks," he said. "There's certainly every indication that other sports will be packaged like this. But the TV marketplace has been so unpredictable that it's foolish to think it will happen for sure."
The future of sports may see more arrangements like the ABC-Raycom deal, or joint ventures between networks and outside producers, or instances in which networks create and market their own event without paying fees to a league or sanctioning body (as NBC has done with its beach volleyball).
What is certain is absolutely nothing. Even the presence of the networks themselves.

HEADLINE: A Better City Spending Plan

 BODY:
Mayor David Dinkins's new financial plan for New York City is a welcome step in the right direction -- toward the kind of lasting reforms that might finally bring the budget into long-term balance. Even so, it has flaws that need to be addressed if the city is to have a credible fiscal policy to help it through this recession.
What's very right about the plan is its heart. Despite painful cuts, it doesn't sacrifice day care, infant mortality programs, full-day kindergarten or other efforts aimed at helping those most vulnerable. 
 Mr. Dinkins and his budget experts have resisted the temptation to understate the severity of the city's fiscal problems; they are realistic in their economic predictions. And the Mayor repeatedly asserts that he is dedicated to structural reforms in city government.
He has made some lasting reforms, but could do more -- especially since his plan calls for refinancing city bonds, a fancy term for increased borrowing to cover operating expenses.
Most important, Mr. Dinkins needs to demand more from the municipal labor force. To his credit, the Mayor is showing more independence in dealing with the unions that helped elect him. He's calling for a reduction of about 20,000 city-financed jobs by July 1996, and says there will be no wage increases unless the unions agree to save money by being more productive.
That still falls short. The Mayor is relying on attrition, a haphazard system. Moreover, linking wage increases to productivity is bound to be less effective than using the stick of layoffs. The plan leaves too much to the good faith of self-interested unions.
Another worrisome feature is the deep cut in capital spending on such projects as school construction, housing and highways. Mr. Dinkins is appropriately concerned about the high cost of debt service. But capital spending can stimulate the economy, and delaying rehabilitation of aging infrastructure is risky. The city should explore financing through the Municipal Assistance Corporation, to minimize the impact of capital cuts.
Despite its weaknesses, the plan demonstrates that the Mayor and his administration are learning to adjust to tough times. Mr. Dinkins has time to refine his strategy. Meanwhile, he has given New Yorkers fresh evidence of his resolve.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Best in Him

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
The President gave the State of the Union Message the very best he had in him, and that is the saddest part of all.
Nobody had to tell him how important it would be to the nation and his own future. He had said so for weeks. 
 Not often has a State of the Union Message been made before Americans more eager to give a President a real chance, for his sake and theirs.
Mr. Bush's millions of still-loyal admirers were rooting for him before he said a word. But also pulling for him were millions of other Americans who had voted for him once but were not sure they would do it twice.
As general recession deepened into specific depression in so many lives -- or because his decision to walk away from victory in the Persian Gulf war became so obviously a historic error -- they were no longer convinced he had the stuff to be President. Still, many of them were open -- waiting for him to show they were right the first time after all.
And among Americans who had not voted for him there were those who looked at the array of Democratic candidates and found none made them get up and jig. Surely there were a great many ready for him to prove that the experienced, known President was better than an untested senator or governor.
If these were good times, Mr. Bush could have rested his case for trust and re-election after reciting his lists of foreign affairs achievements. He could have done that because he does have some achievements -- but also because none of the Democrats running nor the Democratic Party itself, whatever that is, has shown the knowledge or courage to challenge him with a list of his foreign policy errors, reversals and backpedaling.
But in these times he had to get on fast to the recession. And only one thing would really have been good enough -- the full truth. The closest he could come was a couple of sentences about how we are in "hard times" and that unemployment is "too high," some industries in trouble, growth not what it should be.
That's it? Is that supposed to be the whole reality about factories shutting down across the country, retailers crowding bankruptcy courts, the livid scandal of banks failing or on the edge, thousands of Americans lining up in the cold for a handful of rotten jobs, the President himself going on a Fuller Brush trip to the scornful Japanese and the realization of so many Americans that they are not only worse off than they were when Mr. Bush was elected, but that for their children, life is likely to be worse yet?
Speaking the truth is not only important morally and emotionally, but to find out how we got where we are and how in Heaven's name to get out.
To accomplish truth, Mr. Bush would have had to tell Americans that some of the policies of his own Administration and his predecessors' were in some great part responsible and exactly what those policies were and how he proposes to correct whatever mistakes he made himself.
That would be difficult for him to say. But then, it is difficult to stand in line for an unemployment check or send in hundreds of resumes that are never answered while keeping up a brave face before the children.
Since he was not capable of telling the full truth he could not build on it to create a coherent plan unified by purpose and philosophy, strengthened by candor and clear to the public. He gave us instead a grab bag of tax proposals.
Some were useful, like housing credit. One is a bad joke -- lending us for a few months a part of the withholding tax the Government so kindly keeps for us without paying us interest. Mr. Bush wants us to spend that money quick, not even thinking of trying to save some before we have to pay it back.
If he had presented the capital gains tax as part of a real plan, instead of in a hodgepodge, the propriety of reducing taxes on "gains" eaten up by inflation might have impressed the public.
He called it all a "plan for America." A week from now ask yourself precisely what the plan is, how it is supposed to work, how it will shorten these hard times and prevent others from hitting the country. As a matter of fact ask yourself right now.
But it was the best he had in him. So maybe we should not be too hard on him -- as long as he promises not to make any more public jokes about vomit.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Tomorrowland Glimpsed

BYLINE: By LESLIE H.GELB

 BODY:
Five years from now, historians will scan this week's events and say they snapped into focus, briefly yet sharply, the future of world politics. That future was barely glimpsed in President Bush's mostly backward-looking State of the Union address. But it was splashed all over the newspapers.
The news revealed a world where money is talking as perhaps never before. Money power is dictating not just economic choices but political futures, from Western Europe to China. Money is on the verge of being used with astonishing creativity to deal with conflicts in the Middle East and nuclear safety in the old Soviet Union. Money is reshaping battle lines between nations and international corporations in maddeningly unpredictable ways. 
 You could see this week the unusual sway of money on foreign policy and basic political decisions.
Germany's powerful central bank threw its weight around on fundamental political issues. The Bundesbank let out this word: If West European leaders want a single currency, as they pledged at the Maastricht summit, they had better speed steps toward political union. European leaders will have to take heed.
So will Chinese Communist Party bureaucrats, to comments reportedly just made by Deng Xiaoping. The ancient titan told central planners that they had lost their battle. "Reforms and greater openness [to foreign trade and investment] are China's only way out," he said. His message was that the party would have to alter course and loosen economic controls in order to keep political power.
You could appreciate this week how money will be deployed as a creative tool to resolve lingering military problems.
A centerpiece of the Mideast peace parley in Moscow was the creation of a working group on regional economic development. In time, that may prove to be the critical lubricant in making compromises possible between economically stagnant Arab states such as Syria and Jordan and cash-starved Israel.
It has also become clear that Western leaders are coming together on using aid to stem the expected flow of nuclear know-how from the ex-Soviet states. The idea is to pay former Soviet nuclear scientists and technicians to stay put and help dismantle Soviet nuclear arms and fix decaying nuclear power plants.
Your eyes would cross this week in following how money is driving governments toward protectionism even as corporations reach across borders to each other and to governments to circumvent expected barriers.
Almost unnoticed, leaders of six Southeast Asian nations announced on Tuesday a plan for a regional free-trade zone. Their economies are dynamic. And their Governments are girding to protect themselves if the GATT free-trade talks break down and if Mr. Bush's hoped-for North American Free Trade Agreement hurts them.
At about the same time, the French Government acknowledged that its state-owned electronics industry could not survive alone. Paris approved American-controlled I.B.M. buying into Groupe Bull. The deal could mean new life for both against Japanese rivals.
On the same day, the Russian Federation awarded a contract to explore huge offshore oil and gas deposits to a Japanese-American consortium. If the study pans out, investments could total $16 billion. That is far higher than any presently envisaged Western aid plans. The arrangement could also help Japan's chances of regaining its northern islands from Moscow.
You could faintly hear more familiar menacing sounds this week, also connected with money. Germany's leaders warned Russian and Ukrainian leaders about their military plans. It seems these ex-Soviet states intend to maintain armed forces far larger than any European state. No one can be comfortable with that prospect, especially as U.S. troops are reduced. And South Korea made public a plan to increase its air and naval forces and build up its defense industries as U.S. forces withdraw. South Korea, China and Japan will not be at ease with one another without America either.
Money is hurrying the U.S. toward the security sidelines just when peace would feel more comfortable if America were still strong. And money is making peace an anxious state of affairs.

HEADLINE: Boris, Lend Me a Hand

BYLINE: By Jack Kemp; Jack Kemp is Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. This article is adapted from an essay in the Heritage Foundation's Policy Review.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When the "reactionary forces" in Congress recently voted to slash financing for President Bush's "perestroika" plan to privatize public housing and empower low-income residents to become homeowners, I couldn't help but notice the irony.
Today, Russia may be on the verge of the most exciting experiment in entrepreneurial capitalism since 1776. The Russian Government is chopping away at the status quo with enthusiasm. Meanwhile, the most stultified legislative bureaucracy since the fall of the Supreme Soviet -- the U.S. Congress -- is resisting our efforts to launch a historic new war on poverty. 
 A decade ago, when some colleagues and I introduced the first urban enterprise zone bill, I often inveighed against Soviet totalitarianism. Now, 69 enterprise zone bills later, St. Petersburg looks as if it's going to get enterprise zones before American cities.
Nevertheless, as one who wants to reform America's socialist-style public housing, I have a few ideas that might help Russia.
Since World War II, the U.S. has produced more than 70 million new housing units, enabling more than 60 million families to own homes today. In the former Soviet republics, 75 percent of the housing is government-owned. Privatizing the housing stock poses a great challenge.
All apartment residents should be given the right to buy their apartments at a nominal price to establish the principle that you can't get something for nothing. The new Russian housing law, which endorses homeownership, is on the right track. But the law's complicated pricing system is a recipe for bureaucracy.
There are two central questions that come up regarding any plan to sell off Russia's high-rise housing: who will own the land and who will maintain the buildings? For me, these are familiar questions, as the Bush Administration is engaged in a revolutionary effort to let our own public housing residents manage and buy their own homes.
Like the new resident management corporations in American public housing, the residents of Moscow's high-rises could form cooperative or condominium associations as a prelude to ownership. The association would arrange for maintenance through a combination of resident-management employees and private contractors furnished by the new entrepreneurial economy.
Finally, the Russian Government should foster new housing construction, not by investing public resources but by eliminating all significant barriers to private sector homebuilding.
President Yeltsin, you are fortunate because the new Russian legislative bodies are eager for change. And to think it all began when you stood on top of a tank outside the Russian White House. When you're in Washington tomorrow, you could try the same trick on Capitol Hill. If you bring the bullhorn, I'll bring the tank.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Private Life Serves as Distraction

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The surge in interest in the personal life of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who is campaigning for the Democratic Party's Presidential nomination, shows a disturbing trend in American politics. All too often, the American public seems to identify a politician's competence or suitability for elected office with his or her personal life. This unfortunate penchant for sensationalism, which much of the news media feed on, denigrates the political process and eclipses the pressing issues.
There is little evidence in history to support the view that with moral piety comes political effectiveness. Winston Churchill, one of the great statesmen of the 20th century, was certainly no icon of piety. His taste for liquor was well known. John F. Kennedy's personal exploits did not prevent his rise to the highest elected office and place in history. 
 Regardless of the validity of the accusations leveled against Governor Clinton, I believe that this American preoccupation with personal "affairs" tends to obscure the real problems of our time. Perhaps, if our society focused less on sensationalism and the private lives of candidates, and more on the economy, health care, drugs, the homeless, AIDS (the list goes on and on), we might be able to elect a President who can lead and help America in the challenging and frightening times ahead.

HEADLINE: A Way to Get the Trade Deficit in Balance

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Now that President Bush's trade visit to the Orient has ended in disappointment, it may be time to take stronger measures to eliminate our trade deficit. Here is a simple mechanism that could balance trade:
Each time we exported something, the buyer would receive a chit that allows the bearer to export goods of the same value to us. These chits could be freely traded. All imports to us would have to be accompanied by a chit for equivalent value. The requirement of equal value would balance exports and imports. 
 Since our exports would be accompanied by a valuable chit, their cost would effectively be lowered. That exporters to us would have to obtain a chit would raise the cost of their exports. Since exports must equal imports, the cost of the chits must rise until the balance is achieved.
Foreign producers would still compete with one another for the most cost-beneficial exports. Domestic producers would compete with one another much as before, but would now have a price advantage against foreigners -- the price of the chits.
The transition could be smoothed. Our exports are now equal in volume to about 80 percent of what we import. At first, chits covering only 80 percent could be required to accompany imported items. This should cause no change in trade patterns. The percentage could be made to rise to 100 percent over, say, five years.
Flow of money for services should be included in the chit system, but not flow of money for capital investment and purchase of United States debt. Management of these flows would then be a separable problem.
The exchange rate of the dollar is supposed to have much the same effect as such a chit system would, but the exchange rate is perturbed by capital flow and by Government intervention. Devaluing the dollar would make it cheaper for foreigners to purchase industries and assets in this country, something that we do not want to have happen.
A fundamental economic problem may be that we now have only one unit of account, the dollar. Policy makers try to use the dollar to insure all kinds of balances: trade balance, inflation-deflation balance, Government deficits, family budgets. But one unit of account may be insufficient for all these functions.
Gold used to be a second unit of account with different functions from currency. The suggested import-export chits would likewise be a second unit of account. Pollution chits have been widely discussed. It is possible that even more units of account might be useful for economic problems other than the trade deficit.
Forcing our trade into balance in this way would not solve our serious domestic problems: low productivity, low savings rate, high Federal deficit. It might give us some breathing time to put our house in order before we have to sell the whole store to the Japanese.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Journal;
Now, Journalists Renege On Election Promises

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Jan. 30

 BODY:
It is still early in the Presidential campaign, as political analysts have repeatedly determined, but the press coverage is beginning to take a familiar shape. In fact, this week there were two events on national television that could ultimately qualify as official defining moments.
The first, of course, was when Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas went on "60 Minutes" to make what was probably the most public confession in the history of marriage problems. The next came Tuesday night when Mr. Clinton's confession was analyzed -- along with questions on the economy and President Bush's understanding of the middle class -- by what was probably the largest biased sample in the history of instant polling. 
 This sort of thing was not supposed to happen in 1992. Academics and politicians and journalists have spent much of the last four years preparing reports on what went wrong in 1988: obsessive coverage of supposed character issues, endless analysis of strategies and polls instead of who stood for what. Studies showed that a majority of the press coverage concerned the horse race, not the issues.
Journalists vowed to reform this year, but it didn't take them long to be distracted by questions of sex, polls and campaign strategy. Is it all right to report a supermarket tabloid's allegation of adultery? And if not, why did we just do it, and why can't we stop talking about it? Would the State of the Union Message be a defining moment or a victim of the expectations game? How was Bill Clinton's television strategy affecting the polls? How were the polls affecting the President's television strategy?
 
Didn't Seem Worthwhile
 This coverage seems to have made the public even more unhappy than usual with the press. Polls this week showed that most people considered accusations of marital infidelity an unimportant issue, but the extensive publicity guaranteed that these accusations were the only thing that many voters knew about Mr. Clinton. Here in New Hampshire it is unusual to find anyone who approves of the way the story has been covered.
"I'm trying not to pay any attention to all the stuff about Clinton supposedly having an affair," said Mary Ann Foley, 34 years old, who is training to be a truck driver in Londonderry. "I know the press is in the business of selling newspapers and getting ratings, but I don't think it's right. I want to hear about the issues. I'd like to find out more about Paul Tsongas's positions."
This campaign started with good intentions and a spate of articles and television pieces on the issues and the candidates' views. The economy was discussed at length, and some newspapers and newscasts went beyond the candidates' positions to present what may be the most important bit of economic information for voters: Most economists think that politicians' current proposals would do little to end the recession and could be damaging in the long term.
But such issues got pushed aside this week by the Clinton tabloid story, which soon made it to front pages and the top of newscasts. It got confusing. On Tuesday, The Boston Globe's front page proclaimed, "Poll Shows Clinton's Lead Undiminished," while The Boston Herald's banner headline said, "Clinton on the Run." Meanwhile, analysts on television programs like "Nightline" berated themselves for considering such a sordid topic. The passionate discussions usually began with a disclaimer that carried all the moral authority of "We can't go on meeting like this."
 
Quick and Skewed
 And then there were the polls, the campaign strategists' reactions to the polls, and the voters' reactions to the strategists' reactions. By the time President Bush delivered the State of the Union Message on Tuesday night, the chief question raised by analysts on television was not whether his proposals made any sense but how the Democrats and voters would respond to his staff's strategy.
The most ambitious effort to gauge reaction was conducted by CBS immediately after the speech in a program called "America on the Line." It invited viewers to make free phone calls to computers in Omaha and participate in the biggest instant telephone poll ever held. Within a few minutes the computers had heard from 74,200 callers across the country, and Connie Chung reported a result: 53 percent of the callers said they were worse off than four years ago.
"It's important to note here that this is quite dramatic," she said to Dan Rather, and explained that a CBS News poll a month earlier had found only 30 percent of people in the worse-off category. "Dan, it's gone up to 53 percent. Perhaps the group that's calling us now, these across the country, are quite upset, quite angry. This does not bode well for President Bush on the night of his sState of the Union."
Well, it would not have boded well for President Bush if he had had to talk to those angry thousands -- or pay for the calls -- but otherwise it meant very little.
 
Science by the Wayside
 The instant poll involved an unrepresentative sample of Americans, those who were still tuned in after the State of the Union address, from which were selected only those sufficiently motivated to reach the computer in Omaha -- no mean feat, since only about 1 out of every 100 calls got through. And it was further biased by the stories of desperate unemployed and sick people that the viewers were shown during the polling.
"It's a good measure of the number of people who are watching the network and of the intensity of the feelings that lead them to respond," said Philip E. Meyer, an expert in polling who teaches at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "But it's of no value at all as a measurement of the distribution of public opinion on an issue."
To CBS's credit, it also conducted a nationwide survey of a randomly selected sample, and Dan Rather briefly reported the result: 32 percent of 1,241 people surveyed considered themselves worse off than four years ago, or about the same as in the poll a month previously. So much for the dramatic change.
But by the end of the program Ms. Chung was again talking about the people's pessimistic mood as the tally of callers grew to 314,726. The final result showed that 54 percent declared themsleves worse off, 70 percent thought President Bush did not understand the middle class, and 45 percent were not satisfied with Mr. Clinton's televised confession.
Mr. Rather closed with a solemn word about the importance of voting, although it was not exactly clear what voters were supposed to have learned. Perhaps they could conclude that people who have time to call a computer in Omaha also have time to worry about Mr. Clinton's personal life -- although probably not as much time as the nation's journalists.
