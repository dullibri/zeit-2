HEADLINE: INSIDE ART 

BYLINE:  By Carol Vogel 

 BODY:
A Big Find For the Met
 When one thinks of artists' responses to the horrors of war in the 20th century, Picasso's "Guernica" generally comes to mind first, then the allegories of Max Beckmann. 
 After Labor Day, when the second floor of the Metropolitan Museum's modern-art galleries reopen after a summer of repairs and renovations, visitors can see another artist's response to the war of his time.
"Being With" (1946), a reaction to World War II by the Chilean-born Surrealist painter Roberto Matta, will hang on a wall by itself. This large canvas (180 by 87 inches) depicts an inferno of sorts with robotic, mutant, almost skinless creatures. Some of their arms are bound; some have been splayed or tortured or have their heads encased in wire. 
This painting is one of the museum's latest acquisitions. "He'd obviously seen 'Guernica,' " said William S. Lieberman, chairman of the Met's Modern art department.
Mr. Lieberman, a former curator at the Museum of Modern Art, knows the painting well. In 1947 the Modern included it in a show called "Large-Scale Modern Paintings."
"It was the first time the Abstract Expressionist painters had seen easel painting this large," Mr. Lieberman said. "They were more used to murals that size."
A decade later "Being With" was shown at the Modern again, this time in a retrospective of Matta's work organized by William S. Rubin, then the chief curator of paintings and sculpture at the Modern. After that, Mr. Lieberman said, he heard the painting went to Switzerland.
"I thought it had been lost," he said.
But one day, when Mr. Lieberman was having lunch with Danny Berger, a consultant to the Met, Mr. Berger mentioned that he had seen the painting and that it belonged to Jeffrey H. Loria, a Manhattan art dealer who also owns the Florida Marlins baseball team. "I hotfooted it over to his office, and by God, there it was," Mr. Lieberman said. The museum bought the painting, which experts said could be worth up to $500,000, with two acquisition funds.
The painting is the first important work by Matta to enter the Met's collection. Other holdings of his work include a drawing from 1942 and a small painting from 1949.

From War to 'Peace'
On Aug. 18, "Peace," a large bell modeled after those found in Chinese temples, with a gilded life-size cast of the Chinese artist Zhang Huan's naked body hanging next to it, will be installed on the plaza of the Ritz-Carlton in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Zhang Huan, who created the work, inscribed the names of his ancestors from his native village inside the bell. 
Viewers may ring the bell not with a gong, but with the sculpture of Mr. Zhang Huan's body, as a symbolic way of forcing a confrontation between the artist and his past.
"We have been following Zhang's work for a while, and his proposal stood out as the strongest" candidates for that space, said Anne Pasternak, executive director of Creative Time, the public arts organization presenting the project with the Ritz-Carlton and the Battery Park City Authority.
During the first week in October the artist will stage a performance with 25 Buddhist Shaolin kung fu practitioners from a temple in Flushing, Queens. While Mr. Zhang Huan hangs inside the bell, the others will demonstrate traditional forms of kung fu.

Shuttered in Brooklyn
Forget about going to the Brooklyn Museum of Art for the next two weeks. From Monday through Aug. 19, it will be closed and its 300 employees will be furloughed for one of the two weeks. Employees will rotate in shifts so everyone won't be gone at the same time. 
The museum was forced to close because of city budget cuts for the new fiscal year, museum officials said. When the closing was announced in May, the museum thought its budget would be cut by more than $2.4 million.
But now, because of changes to the budget, the reduction is only $836,700, on top of previous cuts made since 9/11. While that figure is significantly lower than anticipated, it is still big enough to close down an institution suffering, like most New York museums, from less private philanthropy and foundation support during the poor economy.
Staff members said they were depressed about losing a week's pay and at seeing the exhibition schedule reduced.
Many also wondered why the museum was selectively adding employees when it could not afford to pay the ones it already had, and why the museum hired an image consultant at great expense to "make it a more visitor-friendly museum," as one employee said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

A Modern Moment
So eager are curators at the Museum of Modern Art to show off their collections while the museum's Manhattan home is closed for expansion that it will be showing selected objects from its architecture and design collection at the International Art + Design Fair. 
"They gave us some space and we're assembling the objects," said Terence Riley, the museum's chief curator of architecture and design. "Except for the car show at MoMA QNS, nothing from our department has been on view for four years." The design galleries were among the first to be shut when the museum began construction.
That the museum would agree to show at a commercial fair held annually at the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan is not as surprising as it might seem. The opening-night gala on Sept. 24 just happens to be a benefit for the Modern's architecture and design department.
"It's at the main crossing, so it is not in the middle of the commercial space," Mr. Riley said.
The show will be chronological, beginning with an elevator grille designed by Louis Sullivan for the Chicago Stock Exchange, built in 1893-94 and demolished in 1972. Also on view will be the first car to enter the museum's collection: the Italian Cisitalia "202" GT designed by Pinin Farina in 1946. Several chairs will be shown, including the Vermelha chair, created by the Brazilians Fernando and Humberto Campaga in 1993, and the Sandows Chair, by the French designer Rene Herbst, from 1928.

HEADLINE: British Airways Posts Quarterly Loss 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 31 

 BODY:
Just one day after it resolved a costly labor dispute, British Airways reported its worst quarterly loss today and said a major strike in mid-July would cost up to $65 million.
 Like other airlines, British Airways, the largest European airline, has lost business because of the war in Iraq, the effect of the SARS virus on air travel and a general economic slowdown, even as low-cost airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair lure European passengers with low fares. (Ryanair offered tickets from Stansted Airport near London to Eindhoven in the Netherlands for as little as $3.20, plus taxes.) 
 British Airways said today that its net loss for the first quarter ended June 30 was $:63 million ($101.5 million), in contrast to a net profit of $:40 million in the period a year ago. Not only that, it said a wildcat strike by check-in staff at Heathrow Airport in mid-July would cost up to $65 million. Analysts said the strike could tip the airline's annual loss to its worst since it became private 16 years ago. 
Rod Eddington, the chief executive, said on a conference call today that the strike was "terrible for customers, terrible for B.A. staff and terrible for the business."
The walkout forced the cancellation of 500 flights in a dispute over the introduction of an electronic swipe-card for staff to clock in and out of work. The airline and labor unions agreed to a compromise settlement to the dispute this week.
Mr. Eddington said the newest losses resulted from "the most testing period in aviation history," but insisted that British Airways would not be distracted from a major cost-cutting effort that has trimmed over 11,000 jobs since August 2001.
European airlines are expected to report losses of up to $2.5 billion this year, but many analysts said British Airways is cutting costs more decisively than its European rivals.
Despite the losses reported today, the company's share price rose as investors took heart from an assurance by Mr. Eddington that the company would meet its cost-cutting targets.
Recovery "is going to happen first and faster than at other airlines," said Andrew Light, an analyst at the Smith Barney unit of Citigroup, while the losses were as steep as some analysts were expecting earlier this month.
According to British Airways, some $:79 million of losses resulted from a single write-off associated with the sale of its Deutsche BA subsidiary last year. The company acknowledged, however, that first- quarter sales fell 11 percent, to $:1.8 billion as it lowered fares to lure customers after the war in Iraq.
British Airways seeks the bulk of its revenue from high-end business travelers, mainly on the trans-Atlantic route to the United States. "You have got an aggressive restructuring that, if anything, is ahead of plan," Mr. Light said. "Already the Atlantic route is doing quite well and the rise in the stock markets and corporate earnings suggests that business travel should start to recover."
British Airways said its costs in the first quarter were 5.4 percent lower than one year ago and it is on track for further cost reductions by March 2005.
Andrew Green, a fund manager at SG Asset Management, said investors had looked beyond today's losses partly because the Deutsche BA write-down was a "book loss" while British Airways itself was cutting costs despite higher fuel bills and generating cash.
"You are getting all that when the aviation cycle is at its lowest and the only way is up from here," he said. "It's a bit of an abnormal period and people don't expect conditions to be like this again."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares End Losing Streak on Word of Stronger Growth

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wall Street advanced yesterday on news that the economy grew at a much stronger pace than was expected in the second quarter and that new jobless-benefits claims fell for a third consecutive week.
 The market also rose for the month of July. Its standout achiever was the Nasdaq composite index, which climbed for a sixth consecutive month -- a feat not seen in eight years. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index completed a five-month winning stretch, something they had not accomplished since 1999.
Upbeat earnings from Exxon Mobil and Procter & Gamble contributed to the advance yesterday, the market's first in four days. Stocks did pull back from sharper gains in the last two hours of trading. Such late-afternoon retreats are common on the last trading day of the month, when portfolio managers make adjustments to maximize returns and look good to shareholders.
After climbing as much as 197.97 points in earlier trading, the Dow closed up 33.75 points, or 0.4 percent, at 9,233.80. The gain erased some of the 84.52 points lost in the previous three sessions. The broader market was also higher. The Nasdaq rose 14.11 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,735.02, and the S.& P. advanced 2.82 points, or 0.3 percent, to 990.31.
The Nasdaq rose 6.9 percent in July, its sixth monthly gain. The last time the Nasdaq had a streak that long was the 10-month period from December 1994 through September 1995. For the month, the Dow rose 2.8 percent and the S.& P. added 1.6 percent. July was the fifth consecutive winning month for the two gauges, something last seen in the five-month period that ended January 1999.
The Commerce Department said the economy as measured by gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.4 percent in the second quarter, well ahead of the 1.5 percent pace economists had forecast.
The Labor Department said new applications filed last week for unemployment benefits fell 3,000, to a five-month low of 388,000. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago also reported encouraging data on manufacturing in the Midwest. The group's index of area business activity rose to 55.9 in July, on a seasonally adjusted basis, from 52.5 in June, according to Dow Jones.
A reading above 50 signals that manufacturing is expanding. The July reading exceeded analysts' forecast of 53.8.
Good earnings news also lifted the market. Exxon Mobil advanced 26 cents, to $35.58, on second-quarter profits that surpassed Wall Street's estimate by 6 cents a share.
Procter & Gamble rose 12 cents, to $87.87, on fiscal fourth-quarter profits that were a penny a share higher than analysts had predicted.

Treasury Prices Fall
(By Bloomberg News)
Treasuries tumbled yesterday, pushing 10-year-note yields to their highest level in a year, after a government report showed second-quarter growth exceeded economists' forecasts. Declines were exacerbated by investors' selling Treasuries to protect against mortgage-related losses.
The 10-year note finished its worst month since May 1984.
"The bubble has burst," said Robert DeLucia, managing director and chief economist at Cigna Retirement and Investment Services in Hartford, with $80 billion of assets. "We're clearly in a bear market for Treasuries."
By late in the day, the benchmark 10-year note fell 24/32, to a price of 93 26/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.41 percent from 4.31 percent on Wednesday.
And the 30-year bond dropped 1 19/32, to 100 8/32. Its yield jumped to 5.36 percent from 5.25 percent.

HEADLINE: Illinois Court Drops Order to Raise Judges' Pay 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 31 

 BODY:
The Illinois Supreme Court vacated today its order that the state give its judges cost-of-living increases, leaving a trial court to decide the issue instead. 
 The court also dropped its demand that Daniel W. Hynes, the state comptroller, defend himself against a possible contempt charge for failing to administer the increases. 
 This afternoon, paychecks with the lower salaries were sent. 
The Supreme Court ruling defuses the controversy that had been mounting for a week between the judicial and executive branches of state government, though it does not resolve the underlying question of whether the 900 judges in the state will be given a 2.8 percent raise. That would add about $4,000 to the seven Supreme Court justices' $158,000 salaries. Other judges earn more than $127,000. 
Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich vetoed the $3.8 million in increases this month, citing the state's $5 billion shortfall. State judges, though, have sued the governor, contending that a legislative resolution from 1990 requires cost-of-living increases for judges and that leaving salaries unchanged despite inflation violates the state Constitution by effectively diminishing the judges' pay. 
"They decided to be less imperialistic about this and go with some due process," said Cheryle Jackson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Blagojevich.
"The court today took one step, one good step, by ending their attempt to unilaterally order themselves pay increases," Ms. Jackson said. "Now they should take the next step, think about public good, and end their lawsuits to give themselves a pay raise in the worst fiscal crisis in our state's history."
The court retreated after State Attorney General Lisa Madigan had filed a motion saying the justices had acted outside their jurisdiction in ordering Mr. Hynes to issue paychecks with unsecure financing to issue paychecks with unsecure financing and to appear before them to explain himself. The motion did not deal with the cost-of-living adjustments, commonly known as cola's.
"We believe that the best way to address the questions about the judges' cola's is through a judicial proceeding in a trial court," a spokeswoman for Ms. Madigan, Melissa Merz, said. "That is the most appropriate vehicle."
A spokesman for the court, Joe Tybor, declined to discuss the issue. 
Mr. Hynes's spokeswoman, Karen Craven, said he "has always felt that a legal action filed in the appropriate jurisdiction with proper notice is the way to resolve this issue, and today's order accomplishes that."

HEADLINE: Motorola Wins $4 Billion in Dispute Over Loans to Turkish Family 

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Motorola won a $4.26 billion fraud judgment yesterday against members of a wealthy Turkish family who got loans from Motorola to expand a cellular phone company.
 Motorola lent more than $2 billion to the Uzan family for the phone venture. Nokia of Finland, a co-plaintiff, lent $700 million. The ruling said that at least $1 billion was diverted to other companies controlled by the family for spending on luxury items and for their personal accounts. 
 In addition to the financial award to Motorola, Judge Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court in Manhattan ordered the Uzans, who control Telsim, Turkey's second-largest cellphone company, to turn over more than 66 percent of Telsim's stock to the finance unit of Motorola and 7.5 percent of the shares to Nokia. 
Judge Rakoff said the shares were pledged to an Uzan company that held them on behalf of Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., and Nokia as collateral for the loans. The Uzans, working with associates and companies they controlled, later arranged for Telsim to issue new stock to dilute those shares without notifying Motorola or Nokia and then stripped them of voting rights to prevent their taking control of Telsim when the loans were not repaid, according to the ruling.
The case was tried under Illinois laws that did not allow Judge Rakoff directly to order a cash judgment for Nokia. But Judge Rakoff ruled that the Uzans would owe Nokia $1.71 billion, or twice the amount of the unpaid loans and interest owed if they did not transfer the stock within a week of the judgment becoming final. 
"They have sought to advance and conceal their scheme through an almost endless series of lies, threats and chicanery," Judge Rakoff said.
The Uzans, who did not appear at the trial in February, said yesterday that they would appeal the decision and expected it to be reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
The Uzans have argued that the entire conflict reflects their suppliers' unwillingness to face up to the losses stemming from the global crash in the telecommunications markets, recession in Turkey and a large devaluation of the Turkish lira. They said the main issue was whether Telsim's problems were beyond their control and that the terms of the agreements called for arbitration of such issues in Switzerland. 
The ruling was the latest milestone in a worldwide legal battle. Last week, a court in Geneva said that it had not seen enough evidence that Motorola was defrauded to warrant freezing Uzan assets in its jurisdiction. A number of other courts, including a Swiss court, in Zurich, had backed the efforts by Motorola and Nokia to attach assets, although not always to the full extent they requested. 
The Uzans, whose family fortune was estimated last year by Forbes magazine at $1.3 billion, began with a construction company founded by Kemal Uzan. The empire, now run primarily by his sons, Marat Hakan Uzan and Cem Cengiz Uzan, includes major investments in finance, media, utilities and industrial companies. Their holdings also include real estate, including at least seven apartments in New York.
Motorola hopes to begin liquidating Uzan assets it controls in the United States and Britain as soon as the 10-day period to seek a stay elapses, according to Howard Stahl, a lawyer for the company. Those assets are valued at $40 million to $50 million. The Uzans have not yet decided whether to try to stop the sales, according to R. Stan Mortenson, a lawyer working for them.
Judge Rakoff's ruling gives Motorola permission to go after every entity controlled by the Uzans, not just the family members and the three companies named as defendants in the suit. But, given all the room left for further legal maneuvering, Motorola may be the least of the Uzans' current worries.
Their far-reaching empire in Turkey has been under severe pressure because of growing conflicts with the Turkish government, which has seized two power plants operated by Uzan-controlled utilities and the bank that is the centerpiece of the Uzan financial holdings. 
Cem Uzan, 43, is the leader of the Youth Party, which has been gaining ground in Turkish politics. But his attacks on Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan have given the government added incentive to pursue longstanding complaints about the family's business practices. Family members who were stakeholders in the seized bank have been barred from leaving the country. 
Motorola and Nokia have both written off the full value of their investments. Motorola said it had not yet determined how it would treat any money it might recover. Motorola's shares, which surged briefly past $10 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, settled back to end at $9.04. Nokia's shares, which trade most heavily on the Helsinki stock exchange in its home country of Finland, hit a peak of $15.46 when trading in New York began but closed at $15.30, up 2 cents.

HEADLINE: Some Exemptions Are Proposed on Predatory Lending Laws 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued proposed regulations yesterday that are expected to exempt national banks from many state laws against predatory lending, including those in New York and New Jersey.
 While the comptroller made no ruling on the predatory lending laws in New York and New Jersey, the proposal would exempt national banks from provisions that are similar to those in the two states. 
 The regulations, which could be approved in several months after a comment period, would permit the comptroller to give "a very quick response" to a request from a national bank for exemption from the New York and New Jersey laws, a spokesman said. That ruling would then apply to all national banks. State-chartered banks and mortgage lenders would still be subject to the laws. 
The comptroller also proposed a standard on predatory lending. The proposed rule "would prohibit national banks from making loans that they cannot reasonably expect to be repaid without recourse to the borrower's collateral."
But, in a statement, John D. Hawke Jr., the comptroller, said, "We have no evidence that national banks are engaged in predatory lending practices."
Yesterday's action by the comptroller brought immediate criticism from Diana L. Taylor, the superintendent of banks in New York.
"I am concerned because this is an unelected official in Washington who is overruling state legislators by regulatory fiat," she said. "The state legislature has a better idea of the consumer situation in the state than an unelected official in Washington."
Maude Hurd, the national president of Acorn, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, said: "To a homeowner, there's no difference between a predatory loan that comes from a national bank subsidiary or from a mortgage company. They lose huge amounts of their equity and are locked into excessive interest rates just the same."
She also said, "Contrary to what the banks claim, there is evidence that national banks and their subsidiaries have been involved in predatory lending."
The proposed regulations came as the comptroller specifically exempted national banks from the predatory lending law in Georgia. That decision came on a request made in February by an Indiana bank.
Efforts by states to enact predatory lending laws have been running into obstacles all year.
A principal obstacle has been restrictions by credit agencies on their ratings for pools of mortgages from the states with predatory lending laws. These restrictions make it harder to resell in the secondary market the so-called high-cost mortgages that are most likely to violate predatory lending laws, restricting access to such loans.
But the comptroller's decision could make it possible for the rating agencies to give credit ratings to mortgage pools with high-cost loans originated by national banks in Georgia and in other states once they are exempted from the state laws. Adam M. Tempkin, a spokesman for Standard & Poor's, said the comptroller's statement was being reviewed.
The comptroller's action comes after a similar move by the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, which exempted federal savings associations from the predatory lending laws in New York and New Jersey. The law in New York City is being challenged by the Bloomberg administration and is not yet in effect.
The comptroller and the Office of Thrift Supervision together are close to achieving the goal of legislation filed in the House earlier this year that would permit federal law to overrule state laws on predatory lending.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
On 10th Avenue, a Boom in Apartments

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
A residential no man's land three years ago, 10th Avenue from West 48th to West 56th Streets has sprouted three mixed-income apartment buildings in three years, and more housing is planned.
 The buildings have a total of 702 rental apartments that have been leased or are being leased. At each building, 80 percent of the units are rented at market rates, and the rest are reserved for low- and moderate-income families. 
 Six hundred more mixed-income residences in two towers are planned as part of the redevelopment over the next three years of two city-owned sites that cut an L-shaped swath from 51st to 53rd Streets. But the developer, the Dermot Company, is not certain if the units will all be rentals or a mix of condominiums and rentals. 
In front of those planned towers a cluster of former tenement buildings along 10th Avenue at 51st and 52nd Streets have been or will be rehabilitated by the nonprofit Clinton Housing Development Corporation, producing 39 apartments for low-income families.
Nancy Packes, president of Halstead/Feathered Nest Leasing Consultant, said the activity is a "natural extension" of the development of the last two decades along Eighth and Ninth Avenues. On Eighth, five apartment complexes with 2,105 rentals have been completed or are under way, while Ninth has filled with restaurants, clubs and boutiques.
"It is always a question of expansion around a nucleus," Ms. Packes said.
In 2001, when the Gotham Organization opened the 222-apartment Foundry, the first of the 10th Avenue rentals, on a site between 54th and 55th Streets, the area was "a chockablock of industrial buildings, car dealerships and studios," said David L. Picket, Gotham's president. 
But, he added, it was just a matter of time before the activity from Ninth Avenue spilled over to 10th Avenue, where there were sites to develop.
Mr. Picket's company is also developing a 150-apartment rental on Ninth Avenue at 55th Street, where an empty Food Emporium once stood.
Anthony Borelli, district manager of Community Board 4, said much of the recent activity is in the Clinton Urban Renewal Area, from 50th to 56th Streets and 10th to 11th Avenues, and "that's progress," but the hope "is to strike a balance" with preservation.
Height restrictions are in place from 41st to 59th Streets and from Eighth Avenue to the river, and they limit new midblock buildings to seven stories or 66 feet to blend with existing structures. But on the corner, buildings can be as high as the underlying zoning allows.
In Manhattan's still sluggish rental market, the developers of the 10th Avenue buildings are using different strategies to woo new tenants and retain existing ones. 
The latest building to begin leasing is the Westport, with 371 apartments, which the Related Companies is developing at West 56th Street. Rents for the studio to two-bedroom apartments in Related's building are $1,995 to $4,695 a month, said Nicole Berlyn, the company's director of marketing. 
She said Related has offered incentives like one-month free rent since leasing at the 27-story building began in June and so far has leased 150 units. Ms. Berlyn attributed the pace of leasing, in part to "the energy of an up-and-coming neighborhood."
There are no incentives at the Clinton, the seven-story, 109-apartment midblock building on 48th Street, which the Brooklyn-based Hudson Companies has developed with partners. Instead, David Kramer, a Hudson principal, said, "We set our rents slightly under those of the other new buildings in the neighborhood." 
He said that since leasing began in March, all but one of the studio to two-bedroom apartments have been leased at rents of $1,395 to $3,400 a month.
Mr. Picket said the Foundry's rents had dropped 10 to 15 percent compared with original prices for most of the studio to two-bedroom units, which now lease for $1,700 to $3,500 a month. As for incentives, he said, "We offer free rent or lower rent depending on if the tenant is new or existing."
Last March the Dermot Company was selected by the city to redevelop the sites on 51st to 53rd Streets. Stephen N. Benjamin, a Dermot principal, said it plans to also have 40,000 square feet of retail and community space, including a health club, an arts center and a park. The $200 million redevelopment is to be called Clinton Green, in part because it will incorporate "green" building principles.
"Tenth Avenue is a desirable place to live today," Mr. Benjamin said. "With Clinton Green we will build on that foundation."

HEADLINE: Faster 2nd-Quarter Growth Fuels Optimism 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The United States economy threw off its sluggish growth in the second quarter and expanded at a 2.4 percent annual rate, pulled up by rising military and consumer spending and, at long last, a revival in business investment in computers and software, the government reported yesterday.
 The spring upturn has nearly every forecaster, even the pessimists among them, signing on to the proposition that the national economy is finally breaking out of the weak, jobless recovery that has lasted for 18 months. A surge in growth is expected for the rest of the year. What is uncertain is whether it will last into 2004 or whether the economy will drop back into weakness. 
 "If we can go from an economy driven by discount pricing and mortgage refinancing to one driven by job creation and income growth, that will keep the upturn going, and there is some evidence that is starting to happen," said James W. Paulsen, the chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, who considers himself a cautious optimist. 
The second-quarter performance stood in contrast to the two previous quarters, in which the gross domestic product, the most popular measure of the nation's output of goods and services, rose at a weak annual rate of 1.4 percent. 
The hope among the forecasters is that the rebound will be strong enough to push economic growth to a sustained annual rate of at least 3.5 percent -- enough to end months of constant job losses and make payrolls increase again. Since the start of the recovery, in November 2001, economic growth has averaged only 2.6 percent a year, and the latest report suggested that the second-quarter strength came mainly from spending that might not last.
The second quarter, from April through June, included the war with Iraq and featured the largest rise in military spending since the fall of 1951, in the midst of the Korean War. Then the quarterly rise was 110 percent; this time it was 44 percent, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported. The jump in military spending contributed 1.69 percentage points to second-quarter G.D.P. growth, or 70 percent of the total rise. Economists questioned whether such growth in military spending could be sustained over subsequent quarters.
The next-largest contributor to growth in G.D.P. was a 3.3 percent rise in consumer spending. Stepped-up purchases of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans accounted for a third of that increase. Low interest rates and cash-back incentives stimulated the vehicle sales, along with spending money freed up through mortgage refinancing.
The boom in mortgage refinancing may be coming to an end, however. With expectations growing for a stronger economy, interest rates are rising. The 10-year Treasury note, to which many mortgage rates are tied, has risen by 1.3 percentage points since June 13, to 4.41 percent.
"The backup in interest rates will cause us to lose the support from mortgage refinancing by early next year, and that will sap the economy's momentum," said William Dudley, the chief domestic economist at Goldman, Sachs. "It suggests that the robustness may not prove sustainable." Mr. Dudley nevertheless predicted the economy would expand at a 3.5 percent annual growth rate through the rest of this year.
Three other reports, also released yesterday, contributed to the optimism. New applications for unemployment benefits dropped by 3,000 last week, to a five-month low of 388,000. The Employment Cost Index, which measures total spending for wages and benefits, rose by a mild 0.9 percent in the second quarter, suggesting that the upturn in the economy proceeded without much pressure on corporate profits from rising labor costs. And the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago index jumped in July, to 55.9 from 52.5 in June. The executives surveyed said that new orders for their merchandise were particularly strong.
A sleeper in the G.D.P. report may explain the apparent rise in orders. Companies, most of them retailers, drew down $17.9 billion in inventories of unsold merchandise in the second quarter. Many economists expect this to be followed by an increase in orders and production to replenish shelves. Even a small inventory swing, from the decline in the second quarter to, say, no change in the third quarter, could contribute nearly three-quarters of a percentage point to annual economic growth.
"The potential for big growth numbers in the last half of the year comes from the fact that inventories have been down and the trade deficit also has hurt the economy," Mr. Paulsen said, referring to a rise in imports, or production abroad, to satisfy consumer spending. "What if we get a quarter in which inventories rise and the trade deficit goes down. Suddenly, you can get into numbers like 5 percent G.D.P. growth."
That would get the economy through the short term, until the end of the year. Over the long term, much of the hope for a sustained recovery rests on a revival of business investment in equipment and software, which sank steadily for nearly two years, bringing on the recession in 2001, and forcing the economy into a weak recovery. A year ago, however, business investment began to show signs of life, and the latest gain, 7.5 percent, was the strongest quarterly performance in three years.
Most of the investment was to replace aging computers and software, but some was probably for expansion, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported. That heartens James Glassman, senior domestic economist at J. P. Morgan Chase. He stirs together rising investment, rising business confidence and falling interest rates for corporate borrowing and sees in the mix sustained growth.
"Somewhere in the country there will be more hiring," Mr. Glassman said, "and that creates more income and more spending, and then we are on a virtuous cycle to recovery."

HEADLINE: State of Decline 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
From smog to silicon, from the sexual revolution to the tax revolt, the future has usually arrived in California first. Now the Golden State is degenerating into a banana republic. Can the nation be far behind?
 The recall isn't just a case of hardball politics. It's also a grand act of evasion: in the face of a severe fiscal crisis, voters are being invited to focus not on hard choices but on personality. Replacing Gray Davis with someone more likable isn't going to pay the bills. 
 And California's slide into irresponsibility, in which politicians refuse to acknowledge any connection between the government services the public demands and the taxes that pay for those services, is being replicated all across America.
Thanks to the end of the tech boom and the bursting of the tech bubble -- with an assist from energy price gouging -- California's budget has plunged into deficit. State and local governments faced with deficits normally respond with a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. That's what Mayor Michael Bloomberg has done in New York, it's what Gov. Pete Wilson did in California's last fiscal crisis, in the early 1990's, and it's what Mr. Davis proposed earlier this year.
But California's Constitution requires that budgets be passed in the State Legislature by a two-thirds' margin -- which gives the Republican minority blocking power. And that minority has refused either to vote for any tax increase, or to make realistic proposals for spending cuts.
You often hear claims that excessive spending is responsible for California's budget woes. True, budgets grew rapidly after the mid-1990's. But California began the 1990's by slashing outlays in response to a fiscal crisis, and most of the subsequent growth was simply a return to pre-crisis levels. As analysts at the nonpartisan California Budget Project point out, real state spending per capita was only 10 percent higher in 2002-03 than it was in 1989-90 -- that is, most of the spending growth was simply a matter of keeping up with the population and inflation.
The key factor in rising California spending has been the effort to rebuild a crippled education system. 
Proposition 13, the 1978 cap on property taxes, led to a progressive starvation of California's once-lauded public schools. By 1994, the state had the largest class sizes in the nation; its reading scores were on a par with Mississippi's. 
Voters wanted this shameful situation remedied. Indeed, much of the recent growth of education spending was mandated bya rather complex measure called Proposition 98. So when conservatives denounce "runaway government spending" in California, what they're really talking about is the effort to hire more teachers and repair decrepit school buildings.
Still, now the state faces a huge deficit, and spending must be cut. But shouldn't the state also seek more revenue? During California's last crisis, Governor Wilson increased the sales tax and temporarily raised income taxes on top brackets. This time Governor Davis proposed doing more or less the same thing -- but Senate Republicans refused to go along. Their counterproposal relied entirely on spending cuts -- but, tellingly, offered no specifics about what, exactly, should be cut. 
This week the stalemate was finally resolved, sort of. The budget that was passed contains one significant tax increase, a rise in the vehicle licensing fee -- for technical reasons, this didn't require a vote. And it uses elaborate fiscal footwork to evade restrictions on state borrowing, passing the problem on until next year. It's better than no budget at all, but it's a monument to political irresponsibility.
Which brings me to the final point: is Washington any better than Sacramento?
Outside the Social Security system, the federal government is now running a deficit equal to a third of its spending -- worse than California. The administration says it will never, ever contemplate increasing taxes; it says it will narrow the deficit through spending restraint, but has never said what spending it intends to restrain. 
If the federal government isn't in crisis, that's only because -- unlike state governments -- it isn't obliged to balance its budget each year. And so far bond markets have been willing to give the feds the benefit of the doubt.
But the people now running the country are every bit as irresponsible as those blocking a serious response to California's crisis. And sooner or later that irresponsibility will have the usual consequences. California, here we come.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Governors Island Is His Oyster Now

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
HE is no Robert Moses. 
 Although he smiles puckishly about his new job like a toddler who has been given a giant Lego set, James F. Lima does not think of Governors Island as a field for his dreams, one in which he can erect monoliths and bulldoze whoever or whatever stands in his way. 
 Mr. Lima, who was chosen last month by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to be president of the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation, the agency overseeing the island's redevelopment, sees his role as building a consensus -- a word not usually considered part of the imperious Moses' everyday vocabulary. 
"I have a lot of ideas for Governors Island, and I'm incredibly excited about exploring some of these ideas," Mr. Lima said in a recent interview. "But ultimately I will have been successful if I help all the people who have vested interests realize a shared vision that will take advantage of what is an extraordinary place."
Mr. Lima, a polished and measured man of 39, talked about his ideas in his quietly disarming style as he showed a reporter around the 172-acre former Army and Coast Guard base. He even managed to answer calls about the co-op he and his partner are trying to buy in Brooklyn Heights. (Memo to seller: watch out. This guy led the negotiations with the federal government that transferred the island to the city and state for $1, a better deal than Dutch settlers got when they bought it from Indians in 1637 for two ax heads, a string of beads and a handful of iron nails.)
Mr. Lima, a housing and development mandarin, would like to have plays and concerts in Castle Williams, an early-19th-century fort and prison whose curved sandstone walls are eight feet thick. He thinks low-slung Georgian brick buildings set around lawns on the island would be ideal for a college campus. He imagines athletics on the island's seven ball fields, and in its two pools. He thinks a demure hotel and conference center -- one that may take advantage of the island's nine-hole golf course -- would be a good idea for raising the $20 million a year needed to preserve the island's 60 vintage but decaying buildings.
Only the rebuilding of ground zero has the scale to overshadow the development of Governors Island, just 800 yards off Wall Street yet lushly shaded and tranquil with wraparound views of the harbor and skyline. Gambling and housing interests -- and, more recently, the City University -- have had their eyes on the island. The agreement with the federal government bars large-scale commercial and housing development.
Mr. Lima said he wanted to hear from "all corners of the city," both power brokers and those who may be plain broke, before putting forth any master plan. "If you're a kid in an overcrowded tenement in Chinatown, you could come here and learn about marine estuaries," he said. "This should be a resource, not just for tourists but for all parts of the city."
His Clark Kent style seems to have served him well where he has worked: the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the City Council's land-use subcommittee's staff, Forest City Ratner Companies (the developers), and most recently the city's Economic Development Corporation (where he is a senior vice president of the special projects division). 
He has had to navigate local politics and clashing business interests in redeveloping parts of the Rockaways, East New York, central and east Harlem, downtown Flushing and Downtown Brooklyn. In the latter project and the Governors Island transfer, he worked closely with Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, which helps account for his choice as the island's master builder. (His selection must be approved by the island's 12-member preservation board.)
MR. LIMA is the youngest of five children. His father, Henry, grew up on a farm in Rhode Island but became a restoration contractor, taking on some of the mansions around Newport. James Lima worked four summers for his father (who divorced his mother, Patricia, when he was 10). One restoration job was the occasion for one of the big adventures of his life -- getting stuck in a historic island lighthouse with five other workers during a hurricane. "We were stranded on this little island," he said, "six guys watching the waves come in ready to sweep us all away."
He majored in architecture at Columbia University but did his graduate studies, also at Columbia, in real estate development. "I think I decided I like having greater control over the whole range of project decision-making -- finance, zoning, infrastructure," he said. "I enjoy all the complexities." While an undergraduate, his roommate was Paul LaMedica, now a 42-year-old mortgage broker, and the two have been together ever since.
In his first job at the housing department, he also got a taste of how master-builder dreams can run into the shoals of economic downturns and other factors. He was assigned to come up with a plan for rebuilding the 300-acre Arverne neighborhood in the Rockaways, once a retreat of seaside bungalows that the city tore down in the 1960's. Mr. Lima is proud of the plan that he and community leaders and builders prepared in 1990. But the first 32 two-family houses in what is to be a 2,300-home community are still being built and will not go on sale until September. 
Mr. Lima, in other words, could have a long time to tinker with his new toy.

HEADLINE: Trade Center Arguments Fade, And a Single Vision Is Emerging 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
After months of arguing over Daniel Libeskind's winning design for the World Trade Center site, officials overseeing the rebuilding said yesterday that they had resolved most of their differences, and many agreed that the Libeskind plan was now likely to be built in substantially recognizable form.
 Three developments, in particular, appeared to reflect a growing consensus on how the colossal project should take shape. 
 Yesterday, for example, in announcing that a renowned Spanish architect, Santiago Calatrava, had been selected to design the site's new transportation terminal, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the 16-acre trade center site, essentially ruled out the idea of building an office tower atop the terminal. That ensures that its presence will rival the 1,776-foot tower and the memorial to victims of the Sept. 11 attack as signature elements of the redevelopment. 
Also yesterday, the Port Authority reached an agreement with the federal government that allows for the tower to be built on the northwest corner of the site, as Mr. Libeskind planned, rather than closer to the train station, as had been proposed by Larry A. Silverstein, the developer who holds the rights to office space at the site.
And the Bloomberg administration yesterday signaled its willingness to let the rebuilt trade center expand beyond its former boundaries, incorporating nearby parcels of privately owned land and allowing the disbursal of the 10 million square feet of office space into a less-crowded layout, as proposed by Mr. Libeskind.
Together, those developments put major rebuilding officials -- in the mayor's and governor's offices, the Port Authority and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation -- in agreement to a degree that has not occurred since the redevelopment project began.
"There's no question that everything is coming together," Charles A. Gargano, the vice chairman of the Port Authority, said yesterday. "I'm optimistic that things are now going to move forward very quickly."
City and state officials in particular have sparred over a number of issues recently, including the future of the development corporation and its $1.3 billion in remaining money for the rebuilding. 
"There's been a lot of talking about critical issues that are necessary to resolve before the more detailed planning work can get done," Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, said yesterday. 
"But we all feel under a significant amount of pressure to move this forward quickly," he added. "So we feel it's time to bring them to a close and move forward."
To be sure, some of the remaining details could become sticking points, and not all of the players may agree with the prescribed outcomes. While rebuilding officials say they have all but ruled out proposals by Mr. Silverstein to build an office tower over the train station and to move the 1,776-foot tower closer to the transportation hub, Mr. Silverstein's spokesman, Gerald McKelvey, said yesterday that he had not been told of those decisions and declined to comment further. 
But in the three months since Gov. George E. Pataki outlined a speedy timeline for the beginning of construction on the site's major projects, several issues appear to have won the approval of participants on all sides.
Mr. Libeskind, for example, had initially expressed a desire to be the lead architect on the train station, which several officials have referred to as a downtown Grand Central Terminal. But just as with the iconic tower, which will be designed by Mr. Silverstein's chosen architect, Mr. Libeskind will accept a secondary role. 
Because federal money will be used to build the station, the Federal Transit Administration required an architect with more experience on transportation projects. Now, Mr. Libeskind will set the "architectural design guidelines" for the terminal, while Mr. Calatrava will be the lead architect.
He will work as part of a team called the Downtown Design Partnership, a group that includes the engineering firms of DMJM+Harris and STV. Their work will include the design and engineering of the terminal and the underground concourses connecting the PATH commuter lines and the subway lines that run through or near the site. 
In a statement yesterday, Mr. Libeskind called Mr. Calatrava's work outstanding, adding, "Today is a great day in the rebirth of Lower Manhattan." 
Mr. Calatrava's office in Zurich is closed until mid-August, and his spokeswoman in the United States said he was traveling and could not be reached for comment.
The selection of Mr. Calatrava pleasantly surprised many of the civic and architecture groups that have closely followed the rebuilding effort. Mr. Calatrava is known primarily for his designs of railway stations and bridges throughout Europe. He has also designed the roof of the Athens Olympic Stadium for the 2004 Games and an addition to the Milwaukee Art Museum. 
"He's the poet of the train station," said Fredric Bell, the executive director of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects.
"His designs capture the spirit of movement," he added. "They are not static. Everything is moving and dynamic. I think he will be a true complement to the Libeskind plan."
Because both Mr. Libeskind and Mr. Calatrava are known for their strong personalities, it is unlikely that they will agree on everything. 
But Terence Riley, chief curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art, said, "The chances for success are more than reasonable as long as it is very clear what each architect is responsible for."
Other important agreements regarding the trade center also appear to have emerged recently. The Port Authority has been studying where to place the security screening areas to be used by trucks making deliveries to buildings on the trade center site. 
Rather than restore them directly beneath the site, the agency's engineers have pushed to place them beneath two sites immediately south of Liberty Street that are currently occupied by the Deutsche Bank building, which will be torn down, and a parking lot. 
Those sites are being considered for some of the office space that would be moved off of the trade center property. Mr. Doctoroff said yesterday that he agreed that the areas beneath those sites could be better for truck screening.
The Port Authority also has agreed with federal officials that the United States Customs House, which formerly occupied the northwest corner of the site, will be moved to another portion of the site, freeing that corner for Mr. Libeskind's 1,776-foot tower.
Kevin Rampe, the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, said details remain to be worked out. 
"I don't want to be Pollyannaish," he said. "But all of the critical issues where there's been disagreement have either been decided or are nearing resolution."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Digital (Fill in the Blank) Is on the Horizon

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Nancy Savoy does not share the rapture of her technophile husband, Tom, when he starts talking about hardware and software, kilobits and megabytes.
 "My eyes glaze over," she said. "I'm not nerdy." 
 But Ms. Savoy, whose life is already surrounded by many of the amenities of modern technology -- a personal computer, high-speed Internet access, a cellphone, a digital camera and a DVD player -- did not hesitate when she was approached recently about joining a pilot program for digital home technology. 
Hers will be one of 20 families in the Boston area that will soon try out networked appliances, including next-generation ovens, which can both cook and refrigerate food and can be controlled remotely by using cellphones or personal computers.
"This is one of the answers to every busy mom's needs," said Ms. Savoy, a part-time tutor who has three daughters, ages 11, 13 and 20. "I'm eager to try it."
The technology world has been preoccupied in recent years by the boom-and-bust investment cycle -- the collapse of the dot-com bubble, the sharp fall in share prices on the Nasdaq stock market, and depressed spending by many large corporations. 
But there has been no such boom-and-bust cycle in the embrace of digital technology and its promise of benefits for communication, automation and new forms of art. And consumers, rather than paring back, are increasingly turning to all sorts of digital gadgets and services -- cameras, music players, videodisc players, advanced television sets, cellphones, instant messaging, e-mail, online shopping, high-speed Internet access.
"It's a step-by-step upward trend," said Nicholas Donatiello, president of Odyssey, a market research firm in San Francisco.
Since 1999, just before the technology boom collapsed, the percentage of households in the United States with personal computers -- which many experts thought was leveling off -- has in fact increased to 64 percent from 50 percent. At the same time, the share of households online has risen to 59 percent from 33 percent, and the use of digital cameras has climbed to 17 percent of households from less than 3 percent, according to Odyssey's research.
Some digital products are rapidly overtaking the conventional ones. Digital cameras are expected to outsell film-based cameras this year in the United States, the Photo Marketing Association International says. Just two years ago, more than twice as many film cameras were sold as digital cameras. And in the first six months of 2003, the value of DVD rentals at video stores outpaced VHS tape rentals for the first time, according to the Video Software Dealers Association.
The digital advance, to be sure, represents a challenge to many companies. The music industry's travail as people used their personal computers to copy MP3 music files and swap them over the Internet is a prime example. And a week ago, Eastman Kodak announced that it would cut as many as 6,000 workers from the payroll as its film sales fell, largely as a result of the growing popularity of digital cameras.
Beyond commerce, the influence of digital technology is being felt more and more in science, the arts and education. A report this year by a panel of the National Science Foundation, "Revolutionizing Science and Engineering Through Cyberinfrastructure," found "a new age has dawned in scientific and engineering research, pushed by continuing progress in computing, information and communication technology."
Digital technology is so malleable a tool because it renders everything -- words, numbers, music and images -- in bits, or binary digits, the 1's and 0's that are the computer's vernacular. The bits can be copied, transported, assembled and manipulated, using increasingly powerful computers and clever software, in limitless ways.
One field, among many, that has benefited from steady advances in computer simulation and analysis is research into the structure and workings of the human brain. 
"There has been an explosion in the use and impact of computation in recent years," said Dr. David Van Essen, a professor of neurobiology at Washington University in St. Louis. "And in many ways, it is still very early days in the use of digital tools in neuroscience."
Hollywood, too, is pushing the limits of digital technology. The special effects in most movies are increasingly dependent on computing, as are the most successful animated films, like this year's "Finding Nemo" from Pixar Animation Studios.
The cultural impact of the technology extends well beyond films, into art and music. "All the creative arts have become digital," said Michael Century, chairman of the arts department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. "That is forcing us to rethink what it means to train people in the arts. The goal is to nurture integrated, multimedia creative minds."
Spending on information technology over all, most of it by corporations, is down about 5 percent worldwide since its peak in 2000, according to the International Data Corporation. Still, the level of spending -- at $867 billion last year -- remains high, more than twice that a decade ago.
Even big companies that are curtailing their spending say they remain confident in the power of technology to help them reduce costs, improve service and gain a competitive edge. General Motors has trimmed its information technology budget in recent years to just under $3 billion annually, and its plans call for further cuts next year. But G.M. is investing steadily in software and computer systems to increase its use of the Internet to communicate more closely with suppliers, dealers, industry partners and customers.
"Despite a difficult economy, that Web-based work to expand our external connections continues unabated," said Anthony E. Scott, the chief of technology for information services at G.M.
So while the disappointment of investors in technology stocks understandably gained a lot of attention, this market reaction tended to obscure a fundamental truth: the use and absorption of technology in society has not gone hand-in-hand with the psychology of investors. 
For consumers, the next big migration of digital technology is beyond the personal computer to music players, cameras and television sets. Among computer makers, Apple is an early leader in fashioning its Macintosh computers as "digital hubs" for the home and developing add-on devices like its popular iPod music player.
Other computer makers are pursuing similar strategies. Gateway, which has struggled to compete in the PC business, is in the midst of a sweeping transformation, said Ted Waitt, the chairman and chief executive. It is overhauling its product line to offer digital television sets and DVD players, which can be linked to personal computers. Later this year, the company plans to offer Gateway music players and digital cameras. "We want to be a branded integrator of home digital products, and not viewed as only a PC company," Mr. Waitt said.
Hewlett-Packard, the industry leader in computer printing, recognized years ago that digital cameras were closely related to its printing technology for capturing and rendering images. It introduced its first digital camera in 1998. "In essence, a digital camera is a computer with a lens," noted Chris Morgan, a Hewlett vice president. "And in our PC products, you'll see more focus on digital imaging."
In the last couple of years, the digital camera has become a mainstream product thanks to improvement in computer chips and storage, with performance typically doubling every 18 months. So digital pictures have become sharper, camera prices lower and besides, the images can be e-mailed or printed, all without film.
Because digital technology is so flexible -- programmable, in computing terms -- digital products, if not wisely designed, can be maddeningly confusing to use. Some digital cameras have that kind of flaw, and the common complaint of frustrated users is telling: "This isn't a camera, it's a computer."
Such issues of design and usability are magnified in home technology experiments, as in the high-tech kitchen pilot project in suburban Boston. If digital technology is really going to be brought into the home, it has to be domesticated -- engineered to work more like an appliance and less like a general-purpose computer.
"This technology has to be integrated and simplified for the average consumer," said Tim Woods, vice president of the Internet Home Alliance, a corporate group sponsoring the kitchen project. "Teenagers and techies will put up with plenty of aggravation to get technology to work. Mom will not. Her life is too complicated."
The project, called Mealtime, will run for about four months, beginning the middle of this month. The companies supplying equipment and technology include Whirlpool, Icebox, I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Sears, Roebuck. Besides the networked oven that can also chill food, each household will have a refrigerator linked to the Internet for automated reordering of groceries through Peapod, the online grocer.
"We're trying to bridge the world of the Internet with the world of white goods," said Bill Bodin, director of an I.B.M. advanced technology laboratory.
The companies involved all recognize they are taking part in an experiment that may well be ahead of its time. "We fully realize that this is something that could take years to really take off," said Tim Langan, director of emerging home solutions at Sears. "But we have to understand this technology, and how people may use it, if we're going to be relevant."
And for all her aversion to technobabble, Ms. Savoy -- whose long days are filled with her tutoring work and household chores, and shuttling her 11- and 13-year-old daughters to soccer, ice hockey, tennis and music lessons -- remains enthusiastic.
"I see it as a way to plan ahead and simplify my life," Ms. Savoy said. "And I'm always willing to try new things."

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
State Still Oversees City's Budget Plan Despite Albany's Own Fiscal Woes

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
As the governor and the State Financial Control Board approved the city's budget plan yesterday, the event was laced with historical paradox.
 The state, in essence, gave its stamp of approval to the city's plan to balance its current budget without going into debt even as the state's own spending plan hinges on $4.2 billion in borrowing for current expenses, a trick state law prohibits the city from using. 
 It was the equivalent of a parent telling a child to do as I say rather than as I do, several budget watchdogs said.
When the Financial Control Board was formed in 1975, the roles were reversed. The city was deeply in debt and borrowing money on a monthly basis just to meet its payroll, and the state was, by comparison, a flush and well-run operation. 
Today, after nearly 30 years under the strict fiscal rules the state imposed on the city, the city has some of the most transparent and cautious budgeting practices in the country. By law, four agencies monitor the city's finances, and if the city fails to balance its budget or pay its debt, the state takes over the city's finances.
The state government, meanwhile, has become addicted to fiscal gimmicks, one-time revenues, off-budget authorities and, this year, a questionable borrowing mechanism to deal with its financial crisis, fiscal experts said. And there is no fiscal watchdog on the state level to object, beyond bond raters.
"It's ironic that the state holds the city to much higher standards than it holds itself," said Marcia Van Wagner, the chief economist at the Citizens Budget Commission.
Indeed, one of the main risks for the city's finances next year is the precarious state of the state's finances. Because Gov. George E. Pataki and legislative leaders relied heavily on borrowing and other one-time revenues, the gap lawmakers have to close in the state budget will be at least $5.3 billion. The governor and the Legislature may well be forced to drastically reduce aid to the city to make ends meet.
"The state's budget is still in deep trouble," said State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, a Democrat.
Mr. Hevesi, like other members of the Financial Control Board, praised Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg yesterday for steering the city through the recent crisis. He said the mayor and the City Council have reduced spending by about $3 billion this year and raised taxes by $2.7 billion, bitter medicine that has driven his popularity down, according to polls, but has left the city in relatively sound financial shape going into next year. 
The comptroller said the state, however, had merely put off much of its budget woes until next year, borrowing $4.2 billion in bonds backed by the state's general fund and money it receives from tobacco companies as part of a court settlement. The bonds will be used for paying salaries and other recurring expenses, a cardinal sin in budget-making. "The state has depended on one-shots and borrowing to such an excessive degree that it means you haven't solved the problem," Mr. Hevesi said. "You have just postponed it."
Governor Pataki first proposed the idea of borrowing to help close the state's $12 billion gap when he presented his budget in January. In May, the Legislature passed tax increases to pay for some spending the governor had cut, but left the borrowing in the plan, though it adjusted the collateral. The governor vetoed large parts of the budget, and the Legislature promptly overrode his vetoes. The borrowing remained, however, and at least one bond rating agency downgraded city bonds. 
Asked yesterday about the state's borrowing and the double standard for the city, Mr. Pataki said, "I'm proud of the fiscal policies we have had at the state level since I have been governor." He also added that "the budget that was adopted over my objections this year does not reflect my fiscal policies," even though the bonds had been his proposal.
Spokesmen for the legislative leaders, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, pointed out that, had the state not borrowed money, the city would have received far less aid for schools and other programs. All told, the Legislature restored about $1 billion in aid for the city that the governor had cut or not included in his budget.
"Were it not for the actions the State Legislature took and the budget we adopted, the city would be in a lot worse shape," John McArdle, a spokesman for Senator Bruno, said.
State budget officials say Mr. Pataki's original plan was to use the borrowed $4.2 billion to ease the pain of reducing the size of government over two years, but the Legislature opted to use it all this year.
They also point out that the city's debt burden as a percentage of its budget is still about three times the state's, because of the huge borrowing former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani approved. Finally, they contend that the gap the city faces next year, $2.8 billion, is about the same size in proportion to the city's $43.6 billion budget as the $5.3 billion gap is to the state's $92.8 billion budget.
Yet fiscal monitors say the city's willingness to shrink the work force by 9,000 over the last two years and cut services while simultaneously raising taxes means the Bloomberg administration is on the road to a balanced budget. The state, meanwhile, has merely put off many tough decisions, monitors said. That is largely because lawmakers used the tax increases they enacted to avoid deep cuts to education aid and medical services, rather than to replace the governor's proposed borrowing.
"It's just borrowing on top of borrowing," Mr. Hevesi said yesterday, "and borrowing is just putting off the problem."

HEADLINE: Filling a Creative Void at Ground Zero 

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
The site plan represents the destruction of Sept. 11. Now the architecture will provide the creative response. That's the implicit message in the selection of Santiago Calatrava to design a permanent replacement for the PATH station that was destroyed by the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001. At last, the controversial plan developed by Daniel Libeskind for the site begins to make sense. From it, great things might grow.
 Mr. Calatrava, 52, is the world's greatest living poet of transportation architecture. A native of Spain, Mr. Calatrava trained as both an engineer and an architect. He is best known as a designer of bridges, train stations and airports, masterworks of our time. Long before the word "infrastructure" had entered the lexicon of contemporary architecture, Mr. Calatrava had taken this genre of design to the level of genius. 
 Though his main office is in Zurich, in recent years Mr. Calatrava has been living part time in New York. His first American project, a time capsule designed for The New York Times, is displayed at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The Milwaukee Art Museum addition, his first major public building in this country, opened last year to critical acclaim. Mr. Calatrava is also well known in New York as the architect of a project as yet unrealized: a new transept and spire for the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Morningside Heights.
Admirers have long detected a spiritual dimension in Mr. Calatrava's secular work, particularly in Spain. The Communications Tower and City of Science complex, designed for Valencia, has the tripartite arrangement of a Gothic cathedral. The Montjuic Communications Tower in Barcelona gestures skyward like a waving hand, as if to consecrate the air through which electronic messages pass. Inevitably, with its taut cables suspended from a single inclined pylon overhead, the Alamillo Bridge in Seville sparks images of celestial harps.
Some structural engineers have criticized Mr. Calatrava for including expressive forms not strictly required by functional needs. That is like attacking an apple for not being an orange. Twentieth-century functionalism is only one of the cultural strains on which Mr. Calatrava has drawn. His sources also include geometry, human anatomy, animal skeletons and other natural forms. Kinesthetics, the perception of movement, is also central to his work. It harks back to a time when expressive form in architecture stood for exuberance and generosity, not a failure to economize.
The choice of Mr. Calatrava is the clearest sign yet that the rebuilding of ground zero will be an achievement of cosmopolitan dimensions. The city has come far from the time, just more than a year ago, when it had entrusted the design process to a local group of insiders bereft of a vision adequate to the historical challenge before them.
It is doubly amazing that this sign of serious intent should be issued by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, an agency whose architectural standards in recent years have slipped comfortably downhill.
Some New Yorkers who have been following recent developments at ground zero may find themselves secretly hoping that there will be fireworks between Mr. Calatrava and Mr. Libeskind. They may get their wish. In the past several months, Mr. Libeskind seems to have forgotten that he was retained not to design buildings, but to assist the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation in preparing a master plan forthe 16-acre site.
The corporation appears to have forgotten this, too. It seems that the louder Mr. Libeskind has voiced his demands, the more control he has been awarded over the design of buildings planned for the site. And the state agency has yet to produce an actual master plan.
In his presentation to the agency last December, Mr. Libeskind called for "great architects" to help realize his vision. A client would not, in any case, hire a designer of Mr. Calatrava's stature simply to execute the ideas of an architect who has given some New Yorkers cause to fear that he may have difficulty distinguishing sunlight from shade.
With architects of the quality of Mr. Calatrava, many New Yorkers will find it easier to appreciate the value of Mr. Libeskind's original inclusive approach. A stylized re-creation of the shock waves felt around the world on 9/11, the Libeskind plan has aroused opposition on the grounds that it would inflict a perpetually open wound on Lower Manhattan. The wound would serve a constructive purpose, however, if it were surrounded by unmistakable signs of the city's resilience.
Memory Foundations: that is the name of the proposal Mr. Libeskind submitted last year, and it is a good one. There is much to be remembered on this site, much life along with death. And we must learn to see this project literally as a re-membering, a putting together of pieces that have been violently torn apart.

HEADLINE: Plan to Move More Inmates Out of State Draws Criticism in Connecticut 

BYLINE:  By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Since Connecticut began moving some of its convicts to out-of-state prisons four years ago to ease overcrowding and save money, it has paid a steep price in lawsuit settlements and stinging criticism over two prisoners who came home in body bags.
 The program has fared better in the last few years, and does better still in the budget lawmakers approved this week. Tucked into the fine print of the budget, which cleared the State Senate last night, is a plan to quintuple the number of prisoners shipped to other states. 
 The Democrats who control the Legislature had been hostile to the transfers, which have moved nearly 500 inmates to Virginia prisons. But Democratic leaders have agreed to let Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, transfer another 2,000 of the state's 20,832 inmates in exchange for money for pilot projects that might reduce the prison population. 
Lawmakers are also hoping to reap an eventual $18 million a year in savings that could be used to blunt other spending cuts and tax increases, as well as to avoid the huge investments and political scuffles required to build new prisons.
But the stepped-up transfer program -- which drew little notice amid the wrangling over other, higher-profile issues like state aid to local governments -- is drawing groans from many quarters that are just now hearing about it. These include the unions that represent the state's corrections officers, who worry about lost jobs; defense lawyers, who say the distance will make it hard for them to interact with clients; community advocates, who say the millions of dollars spent out of state would be better applied to the local economy; and families of inmates, who say the transfers cause them great hardship.
They and others accuse Governor Rowland of putting savings ahead of common sense. Some have even suggested he may be trying to help his former chief of staff, David O'Leary.
Mr. O'Leary, who left the governor's inner circle in 1997, is now a $4,500-a-month lobbyist for Corrections Corporation of America, a Nashville-based company that is one of the nation's biggest operators of for-profit prisons. Steve Owen, a spokesman for the company, said it was interested in the contract to handle Connecticut's overflow and had more than enough empty beds, though none are in the Northeast.
"It stinks," said Tom Sellas, a union lobbyist, calling the proposal "another deal where Rowland is going to take care of one of his old friends."
Michele Sullivan, the governor's spokeswoman, said that "there has not been any contact by Mr. O'Leary with the governor's office" on this topic and that "we don't even know whom he specifically represents." Besides, she said, "Any selection would have to go out for bid."
Mr. O'Leary described himself as a friend of the governor, but said it was "totally untrue" that Mr. Rowland's interest in exporting prisoners had anything to do with cronyism. 
Many inmates' relatives, however, complain about the price they say they will pay. They say the smartest thing the governor could do to combat crime would be to help inmates stay in touch with family and friends.
"Eventually, these prisoners will be released, and they won't have the support system they need, and they'll end up back in prison," said Anne McNamara of Stamford, whose son has been incarcerated in Virginia for the last three years. "Exporting prisoners is breaking the backs of the families of the prisoners."
Connecticut began shipping out prisoners in late 1999, joining at least 20 other states. Its agreement awarded Virginia $11 million a year in exchange for housing 500 inmates at Wallens Ridge, a state prison it had just completed on a remote mountaintop in Big Stone Gap.
From the start, Governor Rowland pushed to expand the program, but he met with opposition from Democratic leaders in the General Assembly, including Representatives William R. Dyson and Michael P. Lawlor. They favored alternative ways of combating overcrowding, like making it harder to put people back in prison for technical violations of their parole, and argued that transfers should be a last resort.
The transfers to Wallens Ridge were also a fiasco because of harsh practices there. Within the first year of the program, two inmates died. The first, David Tracy, committed suicide within a few months of his release date. The second, Larry Frazier, died after guards used a stun gun on him. Connecticut paid $750,000 last year to Mr. Tracy's heirs and $1.1 million to Mr. Frazier's to settle charges that both men had medical conditions that should have precluded their transfers.
By late 2001, Connecticut had ceased using that prison and begun shifting prisoners to the Greensville Correctional Center in Jarratt, Va.
By most accounts, that prison has a much better track record, and Connecticut's Department of Corrections fills the 500 beds there entirely with volunteers. Among the many draws cited by inmates who volunteered to go are the ability to smoke, enjoy soft drinks and spend more time outdoors -- as well as an abundance of female corrections officers. "The inmates like it there," said Gerard A. Smyth, Connecticut's chief public defender.
If Greensville could absorb all 2,000 Connecticut inmates to be moved under the expanded transfers, many say the program would be easier for its critics to swallow. But Virginia correction officials will not confirm that they have space.
The numbers in the new budget suggest that Virginia is not the only option being considered for the 2,000 inmates. An analysis by Connecticut's Office of Policy and Management shows that the state spends an average of $89 a day on each inmate it houses itself, and $68 on those it sends to Virginia. Private prisons, it reports, charge only $58 a day.
So, to get the full $18.25 million a year in savings that was built into the budget, Connecticut would have to send at least 1,000 inmates to private prisons. State officials say that while that may be what the budget numbers imply, they would be under no requirement to send inmates to private prisons when the time comes and would use beds that became available in places like Greensville, given the chance. 
Some critics argue that Connecticut would be better off investing money in programs that reduce recidivism. For that reason, Representatives Dyson and Lawlor said they agreed to drop their opposition to the transfers only when the governor promised $2.5 million this fiscal year and $5 million next to support a long list of proposals they have championed for years.
Shelley Stellmacher of Waterbury, whose husband, Russell, was sentenced last summer to 10 years in prison for robbing a drug dealer, says those investments will come as a comfort to inmates' families.
She said her husband put in for a transfer to Greensville last fall when they were having marital problems and then regretted it once they made up. Taking off from work, she has visited him four times. But because they both recently had surgery, the phone soon became their lifeline. Each 15-minute collect call, the only kind inmates are typically allowed to make, cost her $10. So, she said, even though she works for SBC Communications, her phone was disconnected when she was unable to pay the bill.
If 2,000 more families end up with similar problems, Ms. Stellmacher said, her heart goes out to them. "Think about what this does to the families left here in Connecticut."

HEADLINE: A War America Can Afford to Stop 

BYLINE:  By Chester A. Crocker; Chester A. Crocker, professor of strategic studies at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, was assistant secretary of state for African affairs from 1981 to 89.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The news that peacekeeping troops from Nigeria and other West African countries will head into Liberia next week and that Charles Taylor, the country's thuggish ruler, may go into exile at that time is to be cheered. But it should not become an excuse for the United States to delay or decide against sending ashore its own forces to ensure Liberia's return to security and political stability. 
 Liberia is not just another African country. It is an American creation, founded by former slaves 150 years ago, reflecting our image and legacy. American leaders have been ducking the Liberia challenge since Mr. Taylor launched his rebellion in 1989. But President Bush (in word if not yet in deed) appears anxious to break with tradition. Nonetheless, a fierce debate continues within his administration, hampering America's capacity to lead and to bring relief to Liberia's suffering people. 
 Skeptics make a number of arguments. They argue that, with plenty of work ahead in Iraq and Afghanistan, America's military is severely stretched and that another commitment of scarce combat unitsis the last thing it needs. Some fret about the possibility of getting sucked into a morass and make allusions to Somalia and the hideous imagery of "Black Hawk Down."
In addition, these doubters, hoping to avoid action, have knowingly set the bar of conditions for American deployment too high -- insisting not only that West African forces precede us and that Mr. Taylor depart, but also that a stable cease-fire be in place among the Taylor loyalists and the two major rebel groups. 
But their main criticism has been that Africa simply doesn't matter -- that it is not, as candidate Bush put it in 2000, part of America's "national strategic interest." In other words, let the other Africans and the postcolonial Europeans deal with it -- even in a nation whose capital, currency, flag and political structure all bear an American imprint.
Some of these arguments make more sense than others. Yes, American forces are stretched -- but if they are too stretched to spare the few thousand marines President Bush has already put on ships headed to West Africa, then the time has come for a major reassessment of America's readiness for global leadership. If we worry about being able to keep the peace in Liberia for a few months, we should worry even more about the conclusions being drawn from this uncertainty by our rivals and allies alike -- particularly the Chinese, the North and South Koreans and the Japanese. 
As for the Somalia analogy, it is simply a red herring. Liberians are not warlord-controlled Somalis -- they are not spoiling for a fight, especially with the country they have always looked to for partnership and even salvation. For a better comparison, consider what happened in neighboring Sierra Leone in 2000. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain showed how 1,200 well-trained combat troops, through a skilled, time-limited intervention, could resuscitate a floundering United Nations operation and bring political stability. 
Most important, the Liberia crisis does, in fact, affect significant United States interests. Our efforts would restore order not just in Liberia but throughout a troubled region whose stability affects American interests in combating terrorism and promoting good governance. Liberia is a specific example of the broader challenge posed by failed states everywhere, which we are (slowly) grasping are the incubators of almost every hostile challenge to American interests and values around the globe. And if Washington wants other countries to help in sharing security burdens that fall on its shoulders in the future, it is essential that it play a lead role in Liberia today. Finally, this is about stopping, relatively quickly, a humanitarian disaster at reasonable cost.
In some ways, the intervention has, in effect, already begun. The American ambassador to the United Nations, John Negroponte, is working on a resolution to give the organization's authorization to the peacekeeping forces of the Economic Community of West African States and any other members of a coalition of the willing. This resolution would also call for a follow-on, blue-helmeted United Nations peace operation to shepherd the country through reconstruction and political transition.
In addition, the American 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit will be in position to act within a few days. America has committed $10 million for military logistics and support to the African countries' initative. A seasoned American diplomat and former Air Force major general, Jacques Klein, has been tapped by the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, to run its Liberia transition effort. American interests are represented by a gutsy, experienced ambassador, John Blaney, who has put the heat on Liberian factions to rein in their gunmen and kept the American flag flying in Monrovia, the capital, despite pressures from some in Washington to take it down and look away.
President Bush needs to recognize that the African nations' decision to send in troops is our chance to act -- that making our role contingent on verified cease-fires or on Mr. Taylor's confirmed departure would risk losing the momentum gained this week and only encourage mischief among the leaders of Liberia's armed factions, whose control of their own forces is uncertain. 
Liberians, at this point, are not capable of finding their own way back to peace. They want American troops -- not just African neighbors -- on the ground to ensure even-handedness. A self-confident American administration should not hesitate to have its forces deploy alongside African troops to ensure that Liberia's 14-year nightmare will finally end.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
Toronto Uses a Concert To Send Out a Message

BYLINE:  By NEIL STRAUSS 

DATELINE: TORONTO, July 31 

 BODY:
Can rock 'n' roll save a city's economy? When Jerry Grafstein, a Canadian senator, was introduced as "a senator from SARS" at a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe this year, he decided it was time to repair the reputation of Toronto, where there have been 42 SARS fatalities, the most outside Asia. In the process perhaps something could be done about the multimillion-dollar losses of the city's tourism and hospitality industries.
 So he and Dennis Mills, also a member of Parliament, looked for ways to send a message to the world that Toronto was free of severe acute respiratory syndrome and ready for the tourist and convention dollar again. 
 They decided there was only one answer: classic rock. 
They privately raised most of the $7.1 million that the concert promoter Michael Cohl said he needed for the show. ("Quite frankly," Mr. Grafstein said, "there was no way international millionaire rock stars were going to get subsidized by the government.") The event, organized in just two months and unofficially dubbed SARSstock and SARSfest, drew some 450,000 people to Downsview Park on Wednesday to see the Rolling Stones, Justin Timberlake, AC/DC and others.
If Woodstock was an antiestablishment event, SARSstock celebrated a return to the established order with patriotic announcements, maple-leaf-flag waving, advertisements that Toronto was open for business again and a lineup loaded with local acts like Sam Roberts, the Tea Party, Blue Rodeo, Rush and the Guess Who. Though the Flaming Lips, a lovable Oklahoma psychedelic-rock act with animal-costumed dancers, donned surgical masks onstage, scarcely any SARS posters, face masks or T-shirts could be seen in the audience.
Concertgoers seemed to be too tired of reading and hearing about SARS to make a point of it. Several people interviewed said they were there to see the Rolling Stones, to celebrate newly relaxed police policies on marijuana possession or simply because talk about the concert dominated the city.
But why stop with SARS, politicians decided. "We're having the largest barbecue in the world," Mr. Grafstein said of the quarter-mile stretch of barbecue stands at the concert, "because we're suffering from mad cow disease, and that's hurting our meat business." One case of an infected cow in Alberta this year led the United States, Japan and other countries to ban Canadian beef.
So Toronto politicians made a show of barbecuing meat and eating it in front of concertgoers and the press. The idea behind SARSfest was that if self-involved rock-'n'-roll stars and politicians didn't feel they were risking their lives by touching Toronto's doorknobs and digesting itsbeef, then neither should other people.
The concert had an additional benefit unseen on television: it lifted the spirits of a population depressed by an economic slump. An estimated one-third of hospitality workers are out of work and another third have taken pay cuts. For a day, as shown by the hyperbole delivered onstage between acts by the hosts Dan Aykroyd and Mike Bullard, Toronto felt like the excitement capital of the world.
The sun was scorching and the sightlines at the concert were atrocious, but few negative incidents were reported other than the handful of arrests and cases of heat exhaustion, dehydration and overdose that are an unavoidable side effect of large festivals. After the show, police officers in riot gear with canisters of Mace strapped to their backs lined the barricades around the stage, prepared for the worst. But though the grounds were crowded to nearly immobility and there was no well-organized plan for the crowd to disperse, the audience remained relatively calm.
The only unpleasantness was the crowd's reaction to Mr. Timberlake, whose beat boxing and crooning of modern R&B couldn't be any more different from the classic rock of the other headliners. He was visibly upset when his first song was greeted by boos and a barrage of water bottles. To his credit, he re-emphasized the positive message of the concert and strung his remaining songs together without pausing for audience reaction, ending his set ahead of schedule.
When Mr. Timberlake returned to the stage to perform "Miss You" with the Rolling Stones (with Mr. Timberlake and Mick Jagger inserting elements of "Cry Me a River"), he was again a target for water bottles. The Stones guitarist, Keith Richards, came to his rescue, stepping to the foot of the stage and challenging audience members to throw bottles at him. After quelling the crowd somewhat, he and Mr. Timberlake gave each other a high-five.
The best onstage moments came from the playful shenanigans of the Flaming Lips, the familiar melodies of the Guess Who and the full-on fist-pumping Australian rock of AC/DC, which further won over the crowd when its guitarist, Angus Young, dropped his trousers to reveal boxer shorts emblazoned with a Canadian flag.
As for the Rolling Stones, though it may sometimes seem as if the band is in it only for the money these days, at least they gave the audience its money's worth.

HEADLINE: Contractor Running Disease Lab At Plum Island to Be Replaced 

BYLINE:  By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Federal officials said yesterday that they would hire a new contractor to run the Plum Island Animal Disease Center, which has been the target of a prolonged strike and safety complaints for nearly a year.
 The decision was announced by Marc S. Hollander, the acting director of the research center, which is on an island off the North Fork of Long Island. His staff is revising the entire contract itself and expects to have a new operator by the end of this year, he said. 
 The decision was praised by two leading critics of the current contractor, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and the local congressman, Representative Timothy H. Bishop, both Democrats.
Union workers at the center went on strike almost a year ago, on Aug. 13. Attempts to settle broke down as the contractor, LB&B Associates of Columbia, Md., brought in replacement workers. The union and others have accused the management and the replacements of unsafe practices.
Safety concerns about the nearly 50-year-old facility were heightened in June, when the Bush administration and Congress shifted control of the center from the Department of Agriculture to the new Department of Homeland Security.
Some local residents voiced fears that the laboratory might expand its work to include bioterrorism research on dangerous diseases affecting humans, though officials have said they have no such plans. Other residents support such a move, citing patriotic reasons as well as hopes that the change might help the local economy.
The center has 97 federal workers in various jobs doing research and administration and tending to the animals. An outside contractor employs another 91 who run the boats to and from the island for the staff and visitors, and provide maintenance and cleaning.
LB&B Associates held that contract for seven years, then this year brought in an affiliated group, North Fork Services Joint Venture. LB&B's chief operating officer, F. Edward Brandon, said last night that he was shocked by Mr. Hollander's announcement, adding that he had learned of it only from reporters.
The announcement said: "As part of our ongoing assessment, we have concluded that the current terms and scope of the North Fork Services Joint Venture contract are insufficient to operate the facility in accordance with our standards and mission responsibilities."
It is too early to say exactly how the contract will be changed, Mr. Hollander said. 
Whether the strikers might get their jobs back was not clear. Senator Clinton and Representative Bishop expressed that hope, and Mr. Hollander indicated that there might be new hiring under the new contract.

HEADLINE: NORTH KOREA SEEN AS READY TO AGREE TO WIDER MEETINGS 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said today that North Korea appeared ready to agree to proposed multiparty talks to resolve the impasse over the North's refusal to dismantle its accelerating nuclear weapons program.
 Administration officials and Asian diplomats said that while no formal word had been received in Washington, there were several indications that months of pressure had been successful in getting North Korea to meet the American demand for talks to include South Korea, Japan and possibly Russia. China took part in discussions with the United States and the North in April. 
 Foremost among the new indications was an announcement from the Foreign Ministry in Moscow that North Korea had accepted the proposal for multiparty talks with the other countries, including Russia. It had not been clear until then that Russia would take part. 
Subsequently, administration officials said that in a telephone conversation on Wednesday, President Hu Jintao of China had told President Bush he expected a positive response from Pyongyang, the North Korea capital.
Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said the United States was "very encouraged" by these signs, but he and other officials said there had been no formal acceptance transmitted. Asian and American diplomats said that the talks could occur in August but that September was more likely.
The issue of who should take part in such talks, while seemingly obscure, has been contentious throughout the latest crisis over North Korea, which began last October when it admitted that it had violated a promise not to produce nuclear weapons.
North Korea has said that its main security threat comes from the United States, and that it would negotiate only with Washington. It also said it would reach a deal to end its nuclear weapons program only in return for infusions of aid and American guarantees that it will not be attacked.
The Bush administration has refused to exclude Japan and South Korea from any negotiation, in part because their publics would not tolerate a deal arranged without them and also because Washington feels any possible deal is more enforceable if more nations take part.
"The more people are involved, the more chances of a deal that will be respected," a senior administration official said. "That's the reason we have not gone along with bilateral talks. It's much better if North Korea negotiates with people on whom it depends for help."
The new development on the talks was seen as significant but far short of anything indicating an imminent breakthrough on substance. Among other things, the administration is still divided over how much of a concession to make to North Korea's demand for a nonaggression guarantee in return for an agreement to dismantle the nuclear program.
Many hard-liners in the administration openly question whether any promise by North Korea is worth accepting, on the grounds that it cannot be trusted, especially since it agreed to end its nuclear program in 1994 and then renounced that agreement last year. That occurred after the United States confronted the North with incriminating evidence that it had secretly restarted the program.
Some administration hard-liners say they would prefer to put pressure on North Korea economically, politically and perhaps militarily in hopes that the government would collapse. But they say they also support the negotiation approach, in part because they think the talks will fail and provide a stronger reason for raising pressure.
American officials said that in an effort to let North Korea save face, Washington had originally sent word that it would be willing to accept the idea of talks with China, North Korea and the United States, in an initial phase, as long as they were followed by five- or six-way talks, as demanded by the United States.
But officials said today that the word from China and others, including some nongovernment emissaries who had been in touch with North Korea, was that the North was willing to forgo the initial phase.
Although Mr. Bush has brought Russia, China, South Korea and Japan into the process, it is not clear what each party would be willing to accept as a final settlement. 
North Korea's basic demand for a nonaggression guarantee from the United States has been rejected by Washington. American officials say they would be willing to considermaking a statement to that effect as part of an accord, but the idea of a treaty was ruled out this week by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.
A senior administration official, speaking anonymously, was more blunt. "Nonaggression agreements went out with the 1920's," he said.
A separate part of any agreement with North Korea would address its demand for vast amounts of energy, food and economic assistance. Administration officials say such aid can be forthcoming only after it is clear that the North had dismantled its nuclear program irreversibly.
As for how the impasse over the talks appeared to have been overcome, administration officials and Asian diplomats said China had played a crucial role. They said that in October at Mr. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Tex., the president told Jiang Zemin, then China's president, that improved Chinese-American relations hinged on China's help with North Korea, whose nuclear arms program had just been confirmed.
An Asian diplomat said that at first China did not take North Korea's nuclear threat seriously but that intelligence evidence had convinced Mr. Jiang and his successor, Mr. Hu, that a North Korean nuclear program could lead to nuclear weapons proliferation in South Korea, Japan and perhaps Taiwan.
At the same time, this diplomat said, China feared that the Bush administration's hard-liners would gain advantage in determining policy, possibly provoking a military conflict in the region.
The United States has persuaded a dozen nations to declare their willingness to interdict missile exports by North Korea. Some Asian diplomats worry that such steps might be provocative to the North.
The United States did not ever make clear whether Russia would take part in the talks with North Korea, but Moscow appears to have seized on the opportunity to do so, perhaps to keep its influence in the region. An Asian diplomat said the North might have, in like fashion, seized on the idea of having Russia take part in order to bring a potentially friendlier nation to the talks.
As if to reinforce the influence of administration hard-liners, one of their camp's members, John R. Bolton, the under secretary of state for arms control, delivered a stern denunciation of Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, in a speech today in Seoul, South Korea.
"Kim Jong Il seems to care more about enriching uranium than enriching his own people," he said. "While he lives like royalty in Pyongyang, he keeps hundreds of thousands of his people locked in prison camps with millions more mired in abject poverty, scrounging the ground for food. For many in North Korea, life is a hellish nightmare."

HEADLINE: Mayor Aims To Ride Wave Of Recovery 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that New York City had turned the corner on its financial crisis and, after two extraordinarily painful years, appeared to be on the verge of an economic revival. His remarks sounded a theme he plans to take across the city's five boroughs as he tries to restore his embattled image.
 "New York has weathered the most difficult part of our fiscal crisis," Mr. Bloomberg said in his annual presentation to the Financial Control Board, a state agency that monitors the city's fiscal health. "While we still face fiscal challenges, I believe our worst days are over." 
 The mayor's assessment -- and the praise he received yesterday from the governor and the state and city comptrollers for managing the city through this fiscal storm -- will be the foundation for a determined pitch to lift his public image as he begins the second half of his four-year term, his aides acknowledge. 
"Now that the budget is passed," said William T. Cunningham, the mayor's communications director, "and we are getting reports that things seemed to have stabilized, that gives us a chance to get out of here and go to the places that this budget affects."
Mr. Bloomberg's report stood in sharp contrast to the one he offered to the board just a year ago, when he disclosed that the city was in such a dire fiscal state that he was essentially throwing out the just-adopted budget and asking his commissioners to cut an additional $1 billion in spending.
Now, through a combination of extra state and federal aid, $2.7 billion in new taxes and belt tightening by every city agency, finances have at least stabilized, he said.
"We struck a prudent balance, we think, between maintaining the quality-of-life services and a policy of paying for our own expenses rather than leaving them for our children," Mr. Bloomberg said at the board's Midtown offices.
His message appears aimed at reminding some New Yorkers why they voted for him in 2001. The central premise of his unlikely election campaign then was that New York needed a savvy businessman to lead it out of its worst fiscal crisis in at least a decade. 
But the mayor has been battered in the polls, and his credentials as a Republican have suffered since he reversed a campaign promise and embraced tax increases, which he said were necessary to bail the city out. 
Now, armed with a balanced budget and a four-year spending plan that anticipates large, but not insurmountable, deficits, Mr. Bloomberg appears intent on bragging about the results.
"I think it is pretty well documented that the mayor said, 'You can blame me when things are bad,' " Mr. Cunningham said. "And now instead of blame, it will be recognition that the mayor was the one who made the tough choices, stayed the course and did what had to be done."
Mr. Bloomberg, whose approval rating in recent months had dropped lower than that of any mayor since the 1970's, has already started a campaign-like journey across the city, leaving behind the comforts of the Blue Room at City Hall for daily appearances at a center for the elderly, a homeowner association gathering and a Rotary club.
But Mr. Bloomberg's task ahead will be difficult. He has to win back the confidence of a broad swath of critics: conservatives who feel abandoned, business leaders who hate his reliance on taxes, homeowners who are still seething over the 18.5 percent increase in property taxes last fall, parents who want more answers about the changes to the school system, and anyone who has lost a job in the last two years. He also faces the wrath of smokers, who have turned the city's ban on smoking in restaurants and bars into an anti-Bloomberg campaign.
Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire businessman who came to politics late in life, will at least be able to focus now on a topic he knows a lot about: finances. But his ability to connect with voters and to convince them that he deserves much of the credit for leading the city out of its financial plight may be the first real test of his ability to win a second term in 2005.
The report to the Financial Control Board is a required annual exercise, as the board must certify each year that the city remains essentially solvent and can therefore manage its own financial affairs. The governor, the state comptroller and the city comptroller sit on the board.
This year, as in the past, there was never really an issue of solvency for the control board to address. The crisis this year was really of a policy and politics nature -- how many services to cut; how much to raise taxes, if he raised them at all; and how much to ask agencies to cut back.
But it was up to the mayor and the City Council to figure out a formula to close a budget gap of about $8 billion, an enormous amount even for a city with a $43.65 billion budget.
In particular, Alan G. Hevesi, the state comptroller, singled out the mayor for praise, saying that while not everyone could agree with all of the components of the package, it did result in a balanced budget. But he criticized a plan worked out by the mayor and the State Legislature to spend an estimated $5.1 billion over 30 years to relieve the city of about $2.5 billion worth of debt outstanding from the fiscal crisis of the mid-70's.
Mr. Hevesi also noted that it was unlikely that the mayor would deliver on his plan to pay for any raises offered to city labor unions with concessions from the workers, like a longer workweek or more flexibility in assignments.
"I don't believe that has ever happened in history," said Mr. Hevesi, referring to other mayors who have failed to get similar cost-free settlements.
Mr. Bloomberg chose not to respond to Mr. Hevesi's comments. He chuckled instead and shifted the focus to the positive, sounding as if he was giving a stump speech, even though the audience was largely made up of state and city bureaucrats.
"These past 18 months have not been an easy time for New York," he said, listing the signs, like higher Wall Street profits, that the economy is starting to turn around. "We rebounded from the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, and we are rebuilding. In the last months we have been forced to make difficult decisions, to not take the easy way out, but to find ways to do more with less."
Lines like these will no doubt become familiar refrains. But observers say that even with a balanced budget in hand, he has a great deal of work ahead in rebuilding his reputation with voters.
"What is the good news here?" said William B. Eimicke, a professor of public administration at Columbia University. "People are still not getting jobs, the schools are not better and the economy is not better. If I am the public, what have I won so far? He made the hard choices, but what can he tell the citizens they have gotten out of it so far? Where are we?"

HEADLINE: THEATER IN REVIEW; 
Capitol Steps -- 'Between Iraq and a Hard Place'

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
John Houseman Theater
450 West 42nd Street, Manhattan
Through Aug. 31
 Nothing argues as strenuously for a whirlwind of change to howl through Washington as the latest show by the Capitol Steps, "Between Iraq and a Hard Place." An irreverent musical satire troupe, Capitol Steps was founded by Congressional aides in 1981 and rooted in Washington, and pays intermittent visits to New York. The latest show, with a rotating cast of five who impersonate various public figures and with spirited piano accompaniment by Ken Lundie, its music director, is playing at the John Houseman Theater. 
 In skits and musical comedy and pop songs fitted with new lyrics, "Between Iraq and a Hard Place" pokes fun at the high and mighty from the White House and the halls of Congress to New York, France, the Middle East and beyond. Right off the bat, to the tune of "Springtime for Hitler" from "The Producers," the show twits the state of the economy, and it maintains its saucy spirit for the next hour and a half, including intermission.
As a show of hands indicates, there are probably more Democrats in this audience than in Congress, and the impudence of the humor in Capitol Steps and the cleverness of some of its material may prove a tonic to theatergoers who recall, as a President Bush character does in the show, that most Americans didn't vote for him anyway.
But the problem is that Capitol Steps is blasting away at some shredded targets. By now, not much comic novelty resides in portrayals of the president as less than bright, of Bill Clinton as having a fidelity problem and of Hillary Rodham Clinton as having a Bill Clinton problem. Is there much more to be said about Ariel Sharon and Yasir Arafat? Aren't Bob Dole and Monica Lewinsky relics of yesteryear's headlines? Even Saddam Hussein and the fickle French have been picked clean, though Trent Lott of Mississippi, the former Senate majority leader, yields some laughs in "It's Not Easy Being White," as does Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, leaning against a piano and singing about going to war in Iraq to the tune of "Mona Lisa."
That's not to say that Capitol Steps doesn't look for new material. When it turns to New York, Mayor Bloomberg's antismoking measures, satirized to the tune of "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," and the Jayson Blair scandal at The New York Times, to the music of "Get Me to the Church on Time" from "My Fair Lady," give the show a local angle.
The spoonerism routines, always a highlight of these shows, are still there, but one is better than the other. 
Not many shows of this sort can maintain a consistently lofty level of insolence from start to finish. So to say that "Between Iraq and a Hard Place" is uneven is not to dismiss its creators, Bill Strauss, Elaina Newport and Mark Eaton, who have done well for a long time. But it does argue that they and their audience would profit from some new faces in Washington and elsewhere on the world stage. LAWRENCE VAN GELDER

Shares Decline on Lackluster July Employment Report

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks dropped yesterday, as the economy unexpectedly lost jobs last month and a gauge of manufacturing fell short of economists' forecasts. 
 The government reports tempered optimism that corporate profits would grow fast enough during the second half of the year to support higher share prices. 
 "We're going to need to see an improving job market to prove the economy is doing better and give justification to the equity prices we have right now," said Allan Meyers, who helps manage $30 billion for Fifth Third Bank. He recently bought shares of Citigroup and American International Group. 
Johnson & Johnson slipped after Merrill Lynch downgraded shares of the company. John Hancock Financial Services dropped after cutting its 2003 sales forecast.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 79.83 points, or 0.9 percent, to 9,153.97. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 10.16 points, or 1 percent, to 980.15. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 19.40 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,715.62.
The Labor Department said the economy lost 44,000 jobs last month, the sixth consecutive decline, and the unemployment rate fell to 6.2 percent from 6.4 in June. On average, economists had predicted the creation of 10,000 jobs and a rate of 6.3 percent.
Stocks extended losses after the Institute for Supply Management's factory index rose less than expected. It increased to 51.8 in July, below the 52 forecast by economists in a Bloomberg survey. The index was at 49.8 in June. A reading over 50 indicates expansion, while under 50 reflects contraction.
The shortfalls contrasted with statistics Thursday on second-quarter growth, Midwest manufacturing and jobless claims that exceeded economists' forecasts and lifted share prices. The S.& P. 500 has risen 22 percent from its 2003 low in March. 
"The market has clearly discounted a recovery," said Bob Sitko, portfolio manager at the USAA Investment Management Company, which oversees $27 billion in San Antonio. "We'd better get one and we'd better see continued improvement in corporate profitability, otherwise this rally's over." 
More than 80 percent of S.& P. 500 companies have reported quarterly results, and earnings have climbed an average of 8.8 percent, according to Thomson Financial. Analysts forecast profit will increase 13.4 percent this quarter and 21.3 percent next period, Thomson Financial said.
Johnson & Johnson fell $1.36, to $50.43. Daniel Lemaitre, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, cut his rating to neutral from buy, citing concern about competition in the stent market.
John Hancock shed $2.03, to $30.62. The company reduced this year's sales forecast for retail annuities, institutional investments and life insurance to levels below last year's. 
J. P. Morgan Chase, the second-largest United States bank by assets, fell $1.69, to $33.36.
XL Capital Ltd., the biggest Bermuda-based insurer, fell $4.40, to $75.10. The company's second-quarter profit failed to exceed the $1.94 a share average forecast of 17 analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. 
Cigna shed $1.23, to $45.55. It reported a quarterly loss of $53 million because of higher reserves for reinsurance expenses. 
Airline shares, including Delta Air Lines, fell after the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, said its second-quarter loss almost doubled to $623 million. UAL, which filed for the industry's biggest bankruptcy in December, fell 3 cents, to 48 cents. Delta lost 67 cents, to $11.23. The AMR Corporation, parent of American Airlines, slipped 40 cents, to $8.95. 
AT&T climbed 84 cents, to $22.10. WorldCom, a rival seeking to emerge from the largest bankruptcy in United States history, was suspended from competing for new government contracts. 
Walt Disney added 60 cents, to $22.52. It had fiscal third-quarter profit of 19 cents a share, topping the average analyst forecast by 3 cents, according to Thomson Financial. Sales climbed 6.6 percent, to $6.18 billion, on higher television and film-studio sales. 
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday. The 10-year Treasury note increased 4/32, to a price of 93 30/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.40 percent from 4.41 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond gained 21/32, to 100 29/32. The bond's yield decreased to 5.31 percent from 5.36 percent on Thursday.

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS BRINKLEY; Douglas Brinkley is director of the Eisenhower Center and professor of history at the University of New Orleans.

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
Writers are usually unabashed about claiming authorship for their work. So it's curious that many of the alumni of one of the most significant American literary projects of the 20th century were ashamed of it: the Federal Writers' Project, a program of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration. 
 Created in 1935, in the heart of the Great Depression, the Writers' Project supported more than 6,600 writers, editors and researchers during its four years of federal financing. When the government funds expired, Congress let the program continue under state sponsorship until 1943. Although grateful for even subsistence wages in a time of economic despair, few participants deemed it a badge of honor to earn $20 to $25 a week from the government. 
 But the Library of Congress takes a different view. With little fanfare, it has been unpacking boxes of extraordinary Writers' Project material over the last few years from warehouses and storage facilities. After an arduous vetting process, much of it is now available to the public. 
What is becoming clear, says Prof. Jerrold Hirsch of Truman State University, in Kirksville, Mo., is that the editors of the project believed that they could build a national culture on diversity. "They faced a great challenge coming out of the 1920's, where white supremacists, via WASP primacy and the K.K.K. and anti-immigration laws, held sway," Mr. Hirsch said. "In the Federal Writers' Project, ethnic minorities were celebrated for being turpentine workers or grape pickers or folk artists."
John Cheever was one of the program's unenthusiastic participants. A child of proud Massachusetts Republicans who had called the W.P.A. short for "We Poke Along," he was ashamed of working as a "junior editor" at the program's Washington office. He once described his duties as fixing "the sentences written by some incredibly lazy bastards." 
Nonetheless, Cheever's experiences at the Writers' Project provided the material for many of the best scenes in his 1957 novel, "The Wapshot Chronicle." 
Cheever wasn't the only one who found inspiration at the Writers' Project. Others included Conrad Aiken, Nelson Algren, Saul Bellow, Arna Bontemps, Malcolm Cowley, Edward Dahlberg, Ralph Ellison, Zora Neale Hurston, Claude McKay, Kenneth Patchen, Philip Rahv, Kenneth Rexroth, Harold Rosenberg, Studs Terkel, Margaret Walker, Richard Wright and Frank Yerby. 
These federal employees produced what would become the renowned American Guide Series, comprising volumes for each of the 48 states that then existed, as well as Alaska. The Writers' Project also turned out many other regional, city and cultural guides, like Algren's "Galena, Illinois" and Wright's "Bibliography of Chicago Negroes." All in all, it published more than 275 books, 700 pamphlets and 340 "issuances" (articles, leaflets and radio scripts).
Eudora Welty even served as photographer for the Mississippi guide. W. H. Auden called the whole project "one of the noblest and most absurd undertakings ever attempted by a state." 
Cataloging the output has been a long project. John Cole, director of the Center for the Book at the Library of Congress, has been working on it since 1978, when he first read Jerre Mangione's seminal study "The Dream and the Deal: The Federal Writers' Project, 1935-1943."
"The Library of Congress has its work cut out," Mr. Cole explained in a telephone interview from his office on Capitol Hill. "It's an amazing collection. The Federal Writers' Project helped us rediscover our heritage in a more detailed and colorful way than it had ever been described. I'm thinking here of both the state guides and all of those other publications that they put out -- the collection offers the best examples of local history and oddball anecdotal stories ever amassed."
Nearly 3,000 of the oral history interviews are now available on the Library of Congress's W.P.A. Life Histories Web site, memory.loc.gov/ ammem/wpaintro/wpahome.html, with more to come.
In the last few years, some good biographies of the most notable alumni have been published. But no one has yet tackled a broad-based study of the thousands of untested but talented young writers who fanned out across the continent in search of a collective self-portrait of America. Recently, though, a number of scholars and researchers have begun to track the literary paper trail, unearthing documents and writings that have been packed in boxes for decades.
Pam Bordelon, a writer in Pensacola, Fla., for example, has spent the last 10 years editing interviews and compiling artifacts from the project's Poets Recording Expeditions Into the Floridas. She has traveled all over the state, searching for Writers' Project work done by Hurston, who was hired to collect folklore during the 1930's.
"I was just blown away by the richness," Ms. Bordelon recalled. "The voices in Florida alone are unbelievable." 
David A. Taylor, a writer, and Andrea Kalin, a Washington filmmaker, have begun work on "American Voices," a documentary focusing on the Writers' Project in four states: New York, Florida, Illinois and Nebraska. One discovery is unpublished correspondence between Cheever and Ellison, who met at the project. 
"The F.W.P. was much more than guidebooks and oral histories," Ms. Kalin explained. "It was where social and economic history met the individual imagination in literature." 
But it is difficult to trace authorship for the W.P.A. guides. Mr. Bellow, for example, left mention of his Writers' Project work at the Chicago office out of his entry in Who's Who in America. In "Bellow," his biography of the author, James Atlas writes that Mr. Bellow was humbled to be toiling alongside hard-drinking literary heroes of the proletariat, like Algren and Jack Conroy, editor of the leftist journal The Anvil. Mr. Bellow explains in the book, "I rather looked up to them, and they looked down on me."
Mr. Bellow, whose first Writers' Project job was inventorying Illinois periodicals at the Newberry Library, was later assigned to write 20-page profiles of writers like John Dos Passos, Sherwood Anderson and James T. Farrell. Mr. Atlas discovered the essays only a few years ago when he was researching "Bellow." 
"They're incredible essays, very advanced for somebody 21 or 22 years old," Mr. Atlas said. Mr. Bellow, he said, was ecstatic to reread them recently, amazed that they still existed.
Wright and Walker were also first published while employed in the Chicago office. Studs Terkel, another veteran, used the oral history techniques he learned in the late 1930's as his model for books like "The Good War" (1984) and "Working" (1974). And Albert Murray, perhaps Ellison's closest friend as well as the author of classic works like "South to a Very Old Place" (1971), maintains that without the Writers' Project, Ellison would not have written "Invisible Man."
"It was because of the Writers' Project that I first got to read pieces Ralph was writing on his own," Mr. Murray recalled in a telephone interview from his home in Harlem. "It pulled him away from music and focused him on writing. It put writers and artists in touch as they had never been before. It was even more intense than the Harlem Renaissance. Throughout 'Invisible Man' there are sketches and caricatures of people he met during the Federal Writers' Project." 
Ellison himself is quoted in a Library of Congress document as saying that the Writers' Project helped him better understand the powerful connection between serious literature and folkways. "I tried to use my ear for dialogue to give an impression of just how people sounded," he notes in the document. "I developed a technique of transcribing that captured the idiom rather than trying to convey the dialect through misspellings."
But Ellison, like many of his peers, didn't like to talk much about his days as a government employee. "He wanted to move away from it," Mr. Murray said. "It was his training ground. But he had higher concepts of art than the W.P.A. Guide Series." 
Yet to many, the guide series are treasures. William Least Heat Moon said he wouldn't have written "PrairyErth: A Deep Map" (1991) without the Nebraska guide. When John Gunther hit the road for his memoir "Inside U.S.A." (1947), his suitcase bulged with W.P.A. Guides. So did John Steinbeck's when he set out to write "Travels With Charley: In Search of America" (1962). 
"The complete set comprises the most comprehensive account of the United States ever got together, and nothing since has even approached it," Steinbeck writes in the book. "It was compiled during the Depression by the best writers in America, who were, if that is possible, more depressed than any other group while maintaining their inalienable instinct for eating."
Steinbeck points out that many of the printing plates for the guides were smashed in the wake of a late-1930's witchhunt by Representative Martin Dies Jr., Democrat of Texas, who insisted that the W.P.A. was a Communist plot. But the Library of Congress has hundreds of boxes of the guides' raw material: correspondence, interview transcripts, slave narratives, research notes and photographs. It is one of the most underused and untapped historical collections in America.
With help from the library staff, Ms. Bordelon, for instance, unearthed tape recordings or transcripts of recordings of these Florida sources: Earltha White, who ran a soup kitchen in the slums of Jacksonville; a Cuban cigar maker from Ybor City; white squatters in the Everglades; Izzelly Haines, a midwife, who recalls delivering her first baby; and Norberto Diaz, whose tale of the race-related murder of a friend in Key West inspired Stetson Kennedy, a project folklorist, to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan. 
"Whenever anyone asks me what it was like working with the Works Progress Administration and recording Florida folk songs back in the 1930's for the Library of Congress," Mr. Kennedy once said in a radio broadcast, "I tell them we were as excited as a bunch of kids on a treasure hunt."
In "On Native Grounds" (1942), Alfred Kazin said the Writers' Project, originally a "drive toward national inventory which began by reporting the ravages of the Depression," ended with triumphant "reporting on the national inheritance." He concluded that it changed the course of American literature forever.

HEADLINE: Muting The Call To Service 

BYLINE:  By Dave Eggers; Dave Eggers is author of "A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius."

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
A little over a week ago, in New Orleans, I met two young women who had driven hours, through the heat of July, in rural Louisiana, to talk to me about tutoring kids. Sarah Garb and Megan Peterson are both in their early 20's, both graduates of very good colleges, and both have been living in Clinton, a tiny Louisiana town far from any large city, a town with quite literally one stoplight. They were Teach for America participants who had committed two years of their lives to teaching in low-performing schools. After they talked with me and a pair of men who run a tutoring center through Tulane University, it was 11 p.m., and time for them to drive back. 
 I just finished a tour where I spoke to would-be volunteers in nine cities about the number of public school students who can use their help and spare time, in whatever quantities, for tutoring and mentoring. Eighteen months ago, a few friends and I started a nonprofit afterschool tutoring program in San Francisco called 826 Valencia. Our goal was to make it easy for volunteers to help students between the ages of 8 and 18 with their English and writing skills. Because we're flexible about volunteers' time commitments and because the teachers of San Francisco are burdened with ever-increasing class sizes and diminished resources, we've been overflowing with volunteers and our programs are growing every month. The need is there, and people want to help. 
 But Sarah Garb and Megan Peterson, the two teachers from Clinton, went much further than just helping out in their spare time, as the volunteers at 826 Valencia do. When I met them, they were not what one would think of as born crusaders, and they certainly didn't grow up thinking they would one day be teaching in rural Louisiana. They looked very much like two people who might be living in Lincoln Park in Chicago, or the Upper East Side, or the Marina District in San Francisco, enjoying considerably more comfortable lives. But instead they were far from all of that, struggling every day, earning just above minimum wage, and every day making a huge difference in the lives of the fifth and sixth graders whom they were teaching. And more remarkably, they had chosen to stay. That is, after their two-year commitment expired in June -- they made arrangements with the school district to stay, perhaps indefinitely, in Clinton.
The power of Teach for America is that it can redirect lives, it can make bright young people aware of where they're most needed and where they'll find the most rewarding work. This is why we need Teach for America, and why we need AmeriCorps, the national service program that helps finance Teach for America and other initiatives (Habitat for Humanity and Save the Children, for example). AmeriCorps gives annual grants to 50,000 volunteers, who serve up to a year and receive an award of $4,725 toward higher education as well as a modest living allowance. Last year, AmeriCorps made it possible to bring thousands of full-time teachers to hundreds of schools, from New Mexico's Navajo Nation to the District of Columbia. 
And lest you consider AmeriCorps a program made up of wealthy white college graduates padding their resumes: I recently visited the San Jose, Calif., chapter of City Year, another AmeriCorps-sponsored program. Here, volunteers help in schools, run theater workshops and provide afterschool programs during the week and learning programs for middle and high school students on the weekends. The volunteers I met represented the broadest spectrum of race, ethnicity and economic background imaginable. There was a 20-year-old single mother trying to raise two children on an AmeriCorps stipend and a 19-year-old Princeton-bound volunteer from Las Vegas. They were an inspiring group -- all energized, all ready to do what they were called upon to do, all even wearing matching uniforms -- white shirts, tan shorts. 
AmeriCorps -- and the initiatives it supports -- has become, for an entire generation, the model for service. But unless something is done very soon, the number of AmeriCorps participants will be slashed by as much as 50 percent in the next few months. Five of the 13 City Year programs will be forced to shut down, leaving tens of thousands of students around the country without the benefit of its tutoring, mentoring and literacy efforts. 
AmeriCorps needs an emergency infusion of $100 million just to maintain its current operations. While the Senate voted to appropriate the money, the House of Representatives refused to approve the emergency funds -- and then adjourned for the summer. Meanwhile, the administration has been largely silent -- and it remains unclear whether it will press Congress to provide the funds in September.
Which is confusing, considering how vocal President Bush has been about the need to maintain and even expand our national service programs. At one time, in fact, the president proposed expanding AmeriCorps to 75,000 members. "We need more talented teachers in troubled schools," the president said in his 2002 State of the Union address, the first after 9/11. "U.S.A. Freedom Corps will expand and improve the good efforts of AmeriCorps and Senior Corps to recruit more than 200,000 new volunteers."
It was the president's words that encouraged young people to send in AmeriCorps applications. Thousands of outrageously qualified applicants were prepared to quit high-paying jobs, to put off graduate school, to move to, say, rural Louisiana -- all in the name of national service, in the name of doing something selfless for a country that needed healing. AmeriCorps approved new volunteer slots and assumed it had the support of Congress and the president. Now, on the eve of a new school year, Congress and the White House have turned their backs on these volunteers. 
Must we note that the $100 million that could save AmeriCorps is less than one-tenth of what we spend in Iraq every week? Is it too obvious to mention that the president, who long scorned nation-building abroad while encouraging education here at home, is now clearly choosing the former over the latter?
It's no secret that many in the G.O.P. have long favored the dissolution of AmeriCorps. And though the process won't necessarily be speedy, Republicans in the House are well on their way to making the program a thing of the past. And what happens then? Who or what steps into the chasm created by the White House's failure to act? No one knows. But what is certain is that a generation that was beginning to engage with government, with citizenship and service, will be abandoned, and will be given good reason to shrug back into an easy and familiar, "Well, what did you expect?" sort of cynicism. In fact, the best and most idealistic members of this generation are the ones who will feel most betrayed. Preventing this is within Washington's power -- and $100 million is, relatively speaking, a paltry amount to pay for keeping alive the volunteer spirit of the youth of this country.

HEADLINE: Senate Approves Treaty Updating Limits on Airlines' Liability 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
The Senate approved on Thursday night a treaty that will give the families of passengers killed on international flights the same rights to recover damages as those on domestic flights. The move sets aside a 70-year-old system of liability limits, and generally gives Americans the right to sue in this country even if the accident occurred elsewhere.
 The new rules will replace the Warsaw Convention of 1929, a document approved by the kings of Poland, Italy and Egypt and partly updated in the years since. Many modern travelers know the name of the treaty from the fine print on the back of airline tickets. 
 The replacement treaty was drafted under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organization and will take effect 60 days after the 30th country approves it; 29 were already on record as having done so as of today, and the United States would be the 30th unless the paperwork is completed in some other country first, officials said.
The treaty was approved by unanimous consent.
The new rules will guarantee relatives of people killed in aviation accidents compensation of $141,000 without regard to the airline's fault, and more unless the airline can prove another party was at fault. The Warsaw limit was $75,000, although in 1996, under prodding from the United States Department of Transportation, major American carriers and many foreign carriers serving this country agreed to waive that limit.
The new agreement, known as the Montreal Convention, after the city where the civil aviation organization has its headquarters, also expands the list of places where a family can sue, to include the passenger's place of residence if the airline does any business there, in addition to the traditional ones: the country of departure, the country of the intended destination, the country where the ticket was purchased and the country where the airline is based. Damage awards from American courts are far larger than those from courts of most other nations.
Jeffrey N. Shane, the undersecretary of transportation for policy, said, "This long overdue treaty will provide far more humane treatment for claimants." 
George H. Williams, whose son George W. Williams was killed in the explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, said, "The $75,000 cap was just completely unrealistic in today's economy." In that case, he said, families of the 270 victims were released from the Warsaw limit when they convinced a court that the airline had shown willful negligence, but the new treaty does not require such a finding.
"This is a very big deal," said Warren Dean, a lawyer who represented the major American airlines in the negotiations. He said the limits irritated passengers and "it was not a liability system that suited the carriers in terms of the way they saw their relationship with their customers."
Reflecting recent changes in the airline industry, the treaty also clarifies that if a passenger buys a ticket from one airline and is carried on another under a code-sharing arrangement, both are fully liable for damages. 
Supporters of the Montreal Convention predicted that once the treaty takes effect, other countries would sign on. The system also raises damage limits for nonfatal accidents, and simplifies rules on shipping cargo, allowing more electronic records. 

CORRECTION-DATE: August 5, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about a vote by the Senate to give the familiesof passengers killed on international flights the same rights to recover damages as those on domestic flights referred incorrectly to the person who signed the Warsaw Convention of 1929 -- establishing liability limits -- on behalf of Poland. It was the president, not a king. (Poland last had a king in 1795.)

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Dipped in July For Big Three 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
American consumers gave the auto industry its best month of the year in July. Unfortunately for Detroit, they did so by buying vehicles with foreign nameplates.
 General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler all said today that their sales of cars and trucks fell last month, even though the companies are collectively offering the biggest incentives ever. 
 The companies blamed their declines on the comparison with July 2002, when industry sales jumped to breathless rates in response to rebates, interest-free loans and lease deals that were then the best the car companies had ever offered. 
The industry's annual selling rate for July was an estimated 17.3 million vehicles, according to Autodata, an industry analysis firm in Woodcliff Lake, N.J. That compared with 18.1 million vehicles in July 2002. Over all, sales of cars and light trucks declined 4.82 percent last month from the same month a year ago.
Last year's strong selling rate, however, was achieved with incentives that were a third smaller, on average, than the ones offered now -- evidence that at least where Detroit companies are concerned, incentives are losing some potency.
That is not the case with foreign carmakers. Toyota and Honda of Japan, Hyundai of Korea and Mercedes-Benz and BMW of Germany all said that they had the best July sales ever, eclipsing last year's strong performances. Collectively, import nameplates captured 40.1 percent of the new-car market last month, the third month this year in which they have sold two of every five new cars bought in the country.
By contrast, Detroit companies ended July with two percentage points less than they held a year ago, according to Autodata's statistics.
That decline came despite the fact that American automakers are far outspending the foreign nameplates when it comes to incentives. In June, the most recent month for which full information is available, the Big Three spent a record $3,516 a vehicle in incentives, according to Edmunds.com, an automotive consumer Web site.
That compared with $1,898 for European automakers, $1,369 for Korean automakers and $1,030 for Japanese automakers. Last July, the Big Three spent $2,813 a vehicle on incentives, according to Edmunds.
And there is no sign that the incentives being poured on by Detroit will moderate any time soon. G.M.'s chief sales analyst, Paul Ballew, told analysts and journalists today that he did not expect to see any reduction in incentives as the industry moved into the 2004 model year, which traditionally starts Oct. 1 (although new model year vehicles are already on sale in some cases). "I don't want to lead the industry to expect incentives to drop," Mr. Ballew said during a conference call.
G.M. has by far been the industry's leader in incentives, which Mr. Ballew prefers to call "pricing." He has strenuously defended the various promotions, including bonuses to current customers who buy G.M. vehicles and generous discounts to company employees and family members, as methods to make vehicles more affordable.
"We expect to retain our competitive position," Mr. Ballew said.
His forecast on incentives is precisely opposite what Chrysler's chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, said last week, when Chrysler reported a loss of $1.1 billion for the second quarter. Mr. Zetsche said he was basing his expectations for better second-half results on the assumption that new vehicles would not require as much in incentives to attract buyers.
On the whole, industry executives are optimistic that the second half will be at least slightly better than the first, when sales ran at an annual rate that was about 500,000 vehicles slower than in 2002. Leaders at the various companies said they thought that a stronger economy would persuade consumers to visit showrooms.
"We have been forecasting a strong second half, and July industry sales are a good sign of that happening," said Jim Press, the executive vice president for Toyota Motor Sales. In a company statement, he continued, "Tax cuts have taken hold and many of the economic indicators are positive, which bodes well for the automotive industry."
Indeed, Toyota is one of several import companies reporting strong demand for their newest models. Dealers, for example, have 7- to 10-week waiting lists for a new version of the Sienna minivan, for which some are charging more than the sticker price, a practice frowned upon by the company.
In a bid to get around that, Roxi Vandermark, of Brambleton, Va., said she drove three hours to buy her Sienna in Allentown, Pa. "To save about $2,000 was worth it," Ms. Vandermark said in an e-mail message.
Meanwhile, Toyota executives in the United States are pleading with executives in Japan to build more of the new xB, a squared-off sport utility aimed at the industry's youngest and hippest buyers. The xB is one of two vehicles sold under Toyota's new Scion nameplate, which went on sale last month in California and will be rolling out nationwide over the next year.
Similarly, Honda is seeing strong sales of its two newest S.U.V.'s -- the Element, which is built in Ohio, and the Pilot, built in Ontario. Their popularity is why Honda has picked up 1.1 percentage points of market share this year, a remarkable feat in a market in which every tenth of a point is hotly contested. Further, Honda's incentives average just $420 a vehicle.
Richard Colliver, the executive vice president for sales at American Honda, said, "We're on track for a record year with minimal incentive spending based on the strength of our product lineup."

HEADLINE: Lockheed Shooting for Stars As Space Unit Gets Big Break 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG

DATELINE: DENVER, July 28 

 BODY:
Lockheed Martin is poised to return to the roots that it planted in the stars.
 The force behind that move will roll off the floor of Lockheed's Atlas rocket factory 20 miles south of here. When the United States Air Force ruled last week that employees of the Boeing Company had used internal Lockheed documents to give Boeing an unfair edge in bidding for rocket launching contracts in the mid-1990's, it compensated Lockheed by taking seven of those contracts -- worth a total of about $1 billion -- away from Boeing and handing them to Lockheed. 
 The Air Force also gave Lockheed an additional three launchings, barred three Boeing space units for an indefinite period from seeking future contracts and promised to help Lockheed build, at an estimated cost of $200 million, a launching site for the Atlas V rocket at Vandenberg Air Force Base in central California.
The Air Force's decision could help revive parts of Lockheed's space program, industry experts and analysts said. The program, based here, struggled in the last decade, as Lockheed lost several government contracts to Boeing. One analyst said Lockheed's traditional domination of the space technology race, starting in the 1950's, had made it complacent as Boeing was ramping up operations in the 1990's. 
Now, because of investigations into corporate espionage by several Boeing workers, Lockheed gets the chance to undo its stagnation, to essentially rewrite the recent history of its space program.
"What this means is Boeing's five-year effort to displace Lockheed as the leading provider of space services has come to an end," said Loren Thompson, a military analyst at the Lexington Institute in Arlington, Va. "Its strategy has failed. From this point onward, there will be a level playing field."
While this development is important to Lockheed's reputation, and having more government contracts undoubtedly helps offset the industry slump in commercial sales, the increase in launchings will not make a big difference in Lockheed's bottom line. Rocket launchings accounted for less than 4 percent of Lockheed's $26.6 billion in total revenue last year, analysts said.
Revenue from the space program -- $5.3 billion last year -- will obviously get a boost, though, and both Lockheed, the No. 1 military contractor, and Boeing, which is No. 2, could try to persuade the Air Force to pay more for rocket launchings it has already contracted for, said Paul Nisbet, an analyst at JSA Research in Newport, R.I.
But in recent years, space technology has taken a back seat at both companies to military contracting directly related to the waging of war.
For example, Lockheed, based in Bethesda, Md., has become much better known for its work on the F/A-22 fighter jet and Joint Strike Fighter programs, both of which are strong sources of income for the company. That is a far cry from the 1960's, when some of Lockheed's most prestigious programs were tied to space exploration. In 1965, for instance, the two astronauts on the first Gemini mission rode a Titan II rocket built by Martin Marietta, which later merged with Lockheed.
Lockheed has been reluctant to discuss the Air Force's decision. It has declined to make any executives available for interviews, and a company spokesman said, "it's too soon to speculate" on how the additional government business and California launching site will affect Lockheed financially.
The spokesman, Jeff Adams, added that "we're currently in close discussions with the Air Force to work on the appropriate business model for the reallocation of these launches." The Air Force said that the reallocation will give Lockheed 14 launchings, rather than 7, and Boeing 12, rather than 19.
The Atlas V rocket is at the heart of the reversal of fortune for Lockheed's launching program. In 1998, the Air Force awarded contracts to both Lockheed and Boeing to produce a new family of disposable rockets. Boeing came up with the Delta IV rocket, while Lockheed designed the Atlas V, which would carry payloads of more than 19,000 pounds into orbit.
Lockheed finished assembly of the first Atlas V rocket at its factory here in April 2001, then promptly shipped it to the company's launching site at Cape Canaveral, Fla. Lockheed has launched three Atlas V's, while Boeing has launched one Delta IV. Boeing is scheduled to launch another Delta IV on Monday.
The Air Force's recent judgment "puts Lockheed's program on better economic footing, but given the number of launches, it's still a small business," said Howard Rubel, an analyst at the Soundview Technology Group, based in Old Greenwich, Conn. "It's an important business, though, and it really extends the heritage of the Atlas and Titan vehicle families, and that's very important."
This boon for Lockheed -- and the setback for Boeing -- can be traced back to a relationship that formed in the 1990's between a disgruntled Lockheed engineer and a Boeing manager during the bidding process for the rocket contracts.
After that process began in 1994, Air Force investigators said, the engineer, Kenneth Branch, left Lockheed with 25,000 pages of documents that detailed his employer's bidding strategy for the rocket contracts. Mr. Branch was then hired in January 1997 by William Erskine, a manager at McDonnell Douglas, specifically for access to the Lockheed papers, the Air Force said. Boeing bought McDonnell Douglas later that year.
Boeing has said its senior executives knew nothing of the two men's activities. In 1999, the company fired the men for having the Lockheed documents and began slowly returning the papers to Lockheed. Mr. Branch and Mr. Erskine then sued Boeing for wrongful termination, saying that executives knew of the documents. A court later dismissed the suit.
Investigators later found that Boeing had dragged its feet on turning over the documents to the Air Force -- the entire process took four years, military officials said.
In a news conference on July 24, Peter B. Teets, under secretary of the Air Force, said "the quality of information was sufficient to provide great insight into Lockheed Martin's proprietary cost and pricing." Philip M. Condit, the chief executive of Boeing, immediately put out a statement apologizing for his company's actions. 
The Justice Department said it was still pursuing a criminal investigation of the matter. Mr. Adams, the Lockheed spokesman, said his company would pursue a civil suit against Boeing.
"Lockheed Martin has a clear responsibility to its customers and its shareholders" to press the matter in court, he said. "As a result of Boeing's conduct, our ability to compete in those space markets was impaired."
Dan Beck, a Boeing spokesman, said that his company was "disappointed" in the Air Force's judgment, but that "we accept their decision and we're working with the Air Force to resolve any remaining concerns or issues they might have so we can demonstrate we can continue working with them in good faith and as a partner in the launch business."
Analysts said Lockheed's losing the bulk of the rocket contracts in 1998 was a substantial blow to its space program. The Air Force gave Boeing most of the government rocket launchings, while Lockheed had to rely more on commercial launchings to make money. When the telecommunication industry slumped, the commercial satellite industry followed suit, and Lockheed was left with a troubled launching division.
The Air Force's decision last week puts both companies on almost equal footing in relation to future launchings. "From now on," Mr. Nisbet said, "both contractors will split 50-50 future launch contracts."
After losing out to Boeing, Lockheed walked away from investing in a West Coast launching site because it did not think it would have enough business to justify the capital spending, Mr. Thompson said.
That shut Lockheed out of the market for launchings over the North and South Poles, because it would have been too dangerous to launch satellites into polar orbits from Lockheed's base at Cape Canaveral, Mr. Thompson said. Rockets going above the poles can be launched only from the West Coast to avoid having them travel over heavily populated areas, he added. With the new site in California, Lockheed will be able to make such launchings.
Still, the space industry has not been kind to companies in recent years. In mid-July, Boeing said it would have to take a $1.1 billion pretax charge against second-quarter earnings, mostly because of sharply reduced expectations for its rocket launching business. The same day, Loral Space and Communications, the big satellite maker, said it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Lockheed has its own woes. For example, revenue from its manufacture of the 15-story external fuel tanks for the space shuttle program looks shakier than ever, given the program's slowdown. Investigators have traced the cause of the Columbia accident in February to hardened foam falling off the fuel tank and smashing into the shuttle's left wing.

HEADLINE: Verizon Talks Bog Down as Deadline Nears 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
With a strike deadline set for tomorrow morning, Verizon and its two main unions again reported no progress yesterday in negotiations that were assisted by the top federal mediator.
 Spokesmen for the company and the two unions said the talks remained deadlocked over job security, with the company demanding contractual language that would make it easier to shed workers, while the unions continued to insist on strong language for job security. 
 "Our job is to protect as many jobs as we can," said Jim Spellane, spokesman for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. "These are human beings who aren't going to have a lot of other places to go in this economy and this industry if they're thrown out of work." 
Neither side was voicing optimism yesterday, with the unions saying that 78,000 workers would walk out at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow if no new contract was reached by then. 
The strike would involve workers in states from Virginia to Maine. It is not expected to affect regular phone service, but might cause delays in installing new phone lines.
"I can't say there is any reason for optimism when it comes to the major issues," said Jeff Miller, chief spokesman for the Communications Workers of America, Verizon's largest union.
That union has a $250 million strike fund, which it says could provide weekly strike benefits to its 60,000 union members at Verizon for at least four months. In contrast, the electrical workers have no strike fund for their members although the union is setting up a food bank to help members if there is a walkout.
Executives at Verizon, the nation's largest telecommunications company, have warned that a long strike could hurt not just the union workers but all of the company's 228,000 employees as well as 190,000 retirees and 425,000 dependents.
As they did for the last three days, the two sides held repeated meetings yesterday with Peter Hurtgen, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. At times, union and management negotiators met together with Mr. Hurtgen; at times he met separately with each side.
Officials with the agency declined any comment on the talks.
Two intertwined issues -- job security and management flexibility -- have become the overriding focus of the negotiations, pushing most other issues to the rear. 
"It's a dominant issue, and until we get past it, it will be hard to get to anything else," a Verizon spokesman, Eric Rabe, said.
Other issues include management's demand to have its unionized workers pay more for health coverage and the union's demand that Verizon stop fighting efforts to unionize nearly 20,000 workers at Verizon Wireless.
Verizon began putting far more emphasis on gaining increased flexibility to manage its work force two weeks ago after an arbitrator ordered it to reinstate 2,300 laid-off workers. The arbitrator ruled that Verizon had illegally violated the contract by laying off those workers. 
The current contract bars Verizon from carrying out layoffs "as a result of any company-initiated 'process change,' " like hiring outside contractors or closing offices. It allows layoffs in response to outside events, like the loss of a big contract, that significantly and directly reduce the need for a large number of employees. 
Verizon argued before the arbitrator that the slump in the telecommunications industry, the sharp decline in its traditional telephone business and fierce competition in wireless and high-speed Internet service were outside events that would allow it to lay off workers.
When the arbitrator ruled against Verizon, the company pushed all the more in negotiations for flexibility to reduce and transfer its work force.
"We feel this contract has to give us some flexibility to deal with the much more challenging business environment we're operating in," Mr. Rabe said. "The language in the contract that's expiring grew out of a wholly different era when we didn't face the type of competition we face today and didn't face the same technological shift we face today."
Under the current contract, Verizon can transfer 0.7 percent of the work force in a given state each year, but the company, union officials say, wants to increase that to 8 percent a year.
Union officials say the company merely wants to move union jobs to lower-paying, largely nonunion states. Verizon executives declined to discuss their plans to transfer workers, noting, however, that some call centers are overstaffed and others understaffed.
Mr. Miller, the communications workers' spokesman, denied that Verizon needed more flexibility, noting that it has reduced its work force by 15,000 over the last three years, largely through attrition and buyouts.
"This job protection language has been in the contract for nine years, and they've been able to live with it for nine years," he said. "It hasn't kept them from cutting jobs. They just want to be able to cut jobs faster and cheaper."
At a demonstration by Verizon workers in Boston on Thursday night, John Kelly, a technician for eight years, said he was not eager to go on strike.
"You do what you have to do," he said. "No one wants to go out. But they want to take jobs from workers in Massachusetts and move themout of state or move them overseas. We can't let them do that."
Seeing unionized employment decline in the traditional phone business, Verizon's unions have pressed the company to agree to methods to make it easier to unionize workers in its fast-growing wireless business. The communications workers' union is eager for a contract like the one it obtained with Cingular Wireless in which that company pledged not to fight unionization efforts, paving the way for the union to organize 15,000 workers there. 
Verizon executives insist that it would be inappropriate to negotiate over its wireless business because the communications workers' union already has a side agreement with Verizon Wireless on procedures for unionization efforts; that agreement does not expire until August 2004. In addition, executives argue that Verizon's wireless operation is a separate corporate entity, which is owned 55 percent by Verizon and 45 percent by Vodafone.
Verizon executives say that the best way for the unions to maximize the number of union jobs at the company is to help maintain the company's competitiveness in its traditional phone business and elsewhere.

Unemployment Rate Falls, But Job Losses Continue
The economy shed 44,000 jobs in July, the Labor Department reported, though the overall unemployment rate edged down.
 The rate fell, to 6.2 percent from 6.4 percent in June, because the number of people looking for jobs declined faster than the number of people holding them. People have been withdrawing from the labor market because of their poor job prospects. Page A1. 

Stocks dropped on reports of the lost jobs and a lower-than-expected reading for a manufacturing index. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 79.83 points, or 0.9 percent, to 9,153.97. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 10.16 points, or 1 percent, to 980.15. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 19.40 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,715.62. C4.

Tax Cut Spurs Dividend Payouts
Standard & Poor's said that 183 companies raised dividends in July in the wake of a new tax law cutting taxes on dividends. The figure was up from 131 in July 2002 and the most for any July since 1979, when many more companies paid dividends. C2.

Bankrupt UAL Reports a Huge Loss
UAL, the parent of United Airlines, said its second-quarter loss was $623 million, or $6.26 a share, including $300 million in government aid, as revenue fell 18 percent. C2.

Earnings Soar at ChevronTexaco
Earnings at ChevronTexaco nearly quadrupled, and the company vowed to become more profitable with an overhaul that will include selling many gasoline stations. C2.

Screens Are Gaining Favor in Europe
Several new laws in Europe, like one in Britain mandating window and door screens in food-processing premises, are providing growth areas for many companies. C3.

Warning Sends Euro Disney Down
Euro Disney shares had one of their biggest one-day declines after the company cautioned that it might not have enough cash to pay debt owed to its banks and to its principal shareholder, the Walt Disney Company. C14.

Xerox Ordered to Pay $300 Million
Xerox was ordered by a federal appeals court to pay about $300 million to settle a dispute over how it calculated retirement benefits for former employees. C4.

Cigna Posts a Loss of $53 Million
Cigna reported a net loss of $53 million, or 38 cents a share, in contrast to net income of $215 million, or $1.50 a share. C14.

First-Half Profit Up at Lloyds TSB
Lloyds TSB Group said that profit rose 4 percent in the first six months, to $:1.15 billion ($1.86 billion) as its consumer lending and savings businesses improved. C3.

Inquiry Clears Duke Energy
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said that it had cleared Duke Energy of intentionally withholding electricity generated from its California power plants from the market during the 2000 to 2001 energy crisis. C4.

Societe Generale Earnings Rise
Societe Generale said that its profit rose 85 percent in the second quarter, lifted by improved investment-banking earnings and the sale of a stake in Credit Lyonnais. C3.

PERSON: Nicholas A. DiMarzio 

HEADLINE: Man in the News; 
A Concern for Cities -- Nicholas Anthony DiMarzio Jr.

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J., Aug. 1 

 BODY:
Nicholas A. DiMarzio grew up across the street from Sacred Heart Cathedral on Ridge Street in Newark, and he said he wanted to be a priest before he was sure what being one meant.
 Now Bishop DiMarzio will be leading the Diocese of Brooklyn after four years as bishop of Camden, which has 445,000 Roman Catholics. It is his first church posting outside his native New Jersey. 
 "The Brooklyn Diocese is one city, and here in the Diocese of Camden, we have the three or four different dioceses," Bishop DiMarzio said in an interview today. "There is the shore, where the churches are crammed three months of the year; the farms, where we have thousands of immigrants coming to work; and suburbs, where we have to deal with all the growth. And, of course, this city." 
The welfare of Camden, one of the poorest cities in the country, has been a special focus for Bishop DiMarzio, but it has been only one of the three themes of his work. The others were coping with the diocese's sexual abuse scandal and ensuring the rights of immigrants.
He helped found the Greater Camden Partnership, aimed at breaking down the rigid social and economic boundaries that define so much of New Jersey's demographic landscape. Working with other churches and nonprofit groups, Bishop DiMarzio brought private investment in housing and business into the city and frequently argued Camden's plight to state officials.
"He has done a lot of good by bringing the Catholic Church to the table both in the city and regionally," said the Rev. Floyd L. White III of Woodland Presbyterian Church, located in one of Camden's poorest neighborhoods.
Bishop DiMarzio arrived in 1999 from Newark, where he was the auxiliary bishop. One of his first tasks was to help settle the scandal over the sexual abuse of minors by priests that became public a few years into his tenure. He arranged payments totaling $880,000 to 23 plaintiffs in abuse cases in March, and has continued to fight lawsuits by plaintiffs who would not settle.
Some of his responses struck parishioners as bold. In the spring of 2002, he devoted all 32 pages of The Catholic Star, the diocesan newsletter, to the abuse scandal. The issue included an interview with a victim of abuse. He devoted an entire issue to the topic, the bishop said at the time, to be sure everyone understood the church's policies.
Bishop DiMarzio also took the decisions about handling complaints of abuse out of the hands of the diocese by installing a toll-free complaint line that would connect callers to a lawyer, Laurence E. Rosoff, a former municipal court judge who was instructed to deal directly with the police on any abuse that arose. It was the bishop's policy that civil authorities, not the church, were best equipped to investigate allegations of sexual abuse. 
"He's not afraid to share power, and to take risks," said the Rev. Michael J. Doyle of Sacred Heart Church in Camden. 
Nicholas Anthony DiMarzio Jr. was born in Newark on June 16, 1944, when his father, Nicholas Sr., was still in the military. His father, who worked as a Newark city health inspector, has since died, but his mother, born Grace Grande, lives near her son in suburban Camden. Bishop DiMarzio is the oldest of three children. All four of his grandparents are from southern Italy.
Since his first day at his parish elementary school, Bishop DiMarzio has kept to an all-Catholic educational path. He attended St. Benedict's Preparatory, earned his bachelor's degree from Seton Hall, a Bachelor of Sacred Theology at Catholic University in Washington, and his master's degree in social work from Fordham University.
It was not untilhe began working toward his doctorate in social work at Rutgers that he entered a secular academic environment. "It did me good," he said today. "It gave me a chance to see things differently, to see different points of view."
It was as a young priest in Jersey City, Bishop DiMarzio said, that he took up the lives of immigrants, and he would lobby Congress for more lenient laws as head of the Conference of United States Bishop's Office of Migration and Refugee Services. When it comes to immigration law, he is not a strict constructionist.
"We're trying to prevent terrorism with all this security legislation, and yet we've got five to eight million people living and working among us and we don't even know who they are," Bishop DiMarzio said. "How can you have security that way?"
Bishop DiMarzio has retained enough of his college Spanish to say Mass in the fields for migrant workers every summer, and for the last few summers he has brought five Mexican priests to New Jersey to expand the field Masses. The experience, he said, has taught him the futility of labeling immigrants legal or illegal.
"I know this is a subject of public opinion debate," he said. "But they are already here, living among us. We should legalize them all."

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Britain: Production Rose In July 

BYLINE:  By Heather Timmons (NYT)

 BODY:
 British manufacturing expanded in July for the first time in nine months, according to the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, a trade group. 
The group's manufacturing activity index rose to 50.9, up from 49.5 in June. A reading above 50 indicates that manufacturing is expanding. The survey also showed that export orders dropped in July, with that gauge falling to 49.1 from 50.2. While some British manufacturers benefited from the pound's decline against the euro, its strengthening against the dollar hurt business with the United States. Heather Timmons (NYT)

A Tough Crowd

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
Michio Shimazawa is a fan's fan, a rabid follower of the Pittsburgh Steelers. If only the National Football League could clone him.
 A university professor in his 50's, Shimazawa has followed the Steelers since their heyday in the 1970's. He can reel off names like Terry Bradshaw, Rocky Bleier and Jack Lambert without skipping a beat. He has never seen a game in person, yet his enthusiasm for American football remains undiminished. 
 "I like the variety, the passing, the blocking, the running," said Shimazawa, who checks two Japanese-language Web sites for Steelers fans daily and once visited Three Rivers Stadium in the off-season. "The Steelers don't have a lot of money to buy the best players, but they have good teamwork."
Fans of American football like Shimazawa are the exception in Japan, where baseball, soccer and sumo wrestling dominate the sports landscape. The N.F.L. has tried for years to develop a network of fans, players and teams in Japan, the country with the world's second-largest gross national product, but progress has been slow and uneven.
Still, the N.F.L. will continue its attempt to win over the Japanese on Saturday, when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the defending Super Bowl champions, play the Jets at the Tokyo Dome in the league's preseason opener. (The game will start at 5 a.m. Eastern time.)
The game, called the American Bowl, first came to Japan in 1989, when the economy was booming and a visit by foreign teams was considered exotic. Several Super Bowl champions and marquee players like Joe Montana and Emmitt Smith helped draw huge crowds and ignite talk that a pro league would someday start in Japan.
By the mid-1990's, though, recession and familiarity had taken some of the shine off the game. Attendance slipped and ticket prices remained high. Meanwhile, fans were drawn to an emerging soccer league and became interested in following big-name Japanese baseball players in the United States. The N.F.L. no longer comes to Japan every year.
The league continues to promote football through licensing agreements and television contracts, and with grass-roots activities like teaching flag football. Several Japanese players have joined NFL Europe teams. 
But any chance of developing a pro league, as the N.F.L. has in Europe, remains remote because the number of fans, however loyal, is still small.
"You need three resources to build a league: fans, broadcasters and sponsors, but none are in enough supply right now," said Munehiko Harada, a professor at Osaka University of Health and Sports Sciences. "A professional league is not realistic now."
Despite its limited support, football has deep roots in Japan. The game arrived in 1934 when Paul Rusch, an American teaching here, helped form several teams. The sport grew after World War II, thanks partly to the presence of the United States military. Today, 224 colleges field teams, with more than 9,000 players.
Fewer than half as many high schools have teams, though. Compared with baseball and soccer, two of the most popular team sports, football requires large amounts of equipment and money, not to mention big fields, which are in short supply in Japan's densely populated cities. Japanese athletes also tend to play one sport year-round, so it is harder to recruit players.
In the 1970's, Japan's largest companies formed the X-League, which now includes 71 teams in four tiers, much like in soccer. Some games are televised, but attendance is sparse and most seats are filled with team members' family and co-workers. Layoffs and cost-cutting have made it hard for teams to field squads made up entirely of employees, so some players freelance for rival companies.
With budgets squeezed, corporations are unlikely to funnel more money into their teams, which have only limited appeal as an advertising vehicle when the fan base is small. Even the best teams have budgets of about $2 million, hardly enough to pay for the resources and the players needed in a professional league.
Then there is the task of finding fans like Shimazawa. Most Japanese view football as a sport for huge men who like to test their machismo by wearing shoulder pads and butting heads.
"One of the challenges we face is overcoming the perception that the sport is violent," said Gordon Smeaton, vice president of NFL International. "Small guys feel small when they watch the game on television. So we're teaching people that football is not so hard to play."
To do this, the N.F.L. isweaving its way into school curriculums. About 160,000 elementary school and junior high school students now play flag football in Japan. The N.F.L. also helps teams acquire the equipment they need. Video football games have also sold well in Japan.
The N.F.L. has made headway on college campuses, too. Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, which won this year's Rice Bowl to become the nation's top team, has the only sports marketing class in the world devoted entirely to the N.F.L. Joe Taneda, who has taught the class for three years, said his students wanted to learn how professional leagues really worked.
"In Japan, the athletes are professional because they are paid to play, but the teams and leagues are not run well," Taneda said. He said 500 students signed up for his class this year.
Sports management is still a new field in Japan. Most teams are run by executives more interested in putting their logos on jerseys than in finding good players to wear those jerseys. In baseball, only the Tokyo Yomiuri Giants are said to make money. Minor league systems are thin, and players are treated more like employees than specialists.
This attitude toward organized sports and player development is perhaps the biggest hurdle if the N.F.L. ever pursues a full-fledged professional league. In the meantime, the N.F.L. will have to keep searching for the next generation of die-hard fans like Shimazawa.

XEROX TO PAY $300 MILL ION IN PENSION DISPUTE

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 The Xerox Corporation was ordered yesterday by a federal appeals court to pay about $300 million to settle adispute over how it calculated retirement benefits for former employees. Xerox recorded expenses of $183 million, or 25 cents a share, in the first quarter in anticipation of losing its appeal. 
The company still needs to assess yesterday's ruling, a spokeswoman, Christa Carone, said. Xerox was sued by retirees in 2000 over the methods it used to determine payments to 25,000 employees. The United States District Court in Illinois ruled in favor of the retirees in October, and Xerox appealed. Any payment would come from the company's Retirement Income Guarantee Plan, which has denied any wrongdoing, the company said last year. Shares of Xerox fell 15 cents, to $10.65.

HEADLINE: Time to Move 

BYLINE:  By David Newman; David Newman is professor of political geography at Ben Gurion University of the Negev.

DATELINE: BEERSHEBA, Israel 

 BODY:
When he met with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel in Washington this week, President Bush urged him yet again to freeze expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, whose existence is a constant roadblock in peace negotiations, including the "road map" now in play. Judging from Mr. Sharon's noncommittal response, Mr. Bush's plea fell on deaf ears.
 It seems an intractable problem. Anyone who has seen the settlement network will know that it is not simply a few temporary outposts like those evacuated by the Israeli government in the past few months as a means of gaining some international support. It is a collection of small towns, industrial and commercial areas, schools and colleges, roads and public services. When one travels around the settlements, it seems that they've put down roots for good. 
 Yet at the same time several factors are raising questions about the long-term future of these settlements. The peace process itself may be the biggest threat to them, but there are others. Indeed, many of the settlers themselves, belying their reputation as a right-wing monolith, are saying they're willing to consider leaving. 
A survey released last week by the organization Peace Now indicates that more than 70 percent of settlers, a significant increase from previous polls, would agree to eventually leave the West Bank and Gaza if they were compensated, while 29 percent are ready to leave right away. Seventy-one percent of them said they believed that a peace agreement that would require them to leave their settlements was inevitable. 
While some hard-line settlement leaders disputed the survey results, the fact remains that a growing number of the 230,000 settlers are beginning to ask whether it is now time to consider their options. Most of them may be ideologically opposed to a peace agreement with the Palestinian Authority, but they are realistic and want to plan for their future, rather than to wake up one day and to find themselves left behind by the withdrawing Israeli forces.
Their thinking has been greatly influenced by the knowledge that it is Mr. Sharon who is negotiating Israel's position. He, more than almost any other Israeli politician, was responsible for creating the settlement network. But he was also the defense minister who oversaw the destruction of the Northern Sinai settlements in the early 1980's, in the wake of the Camp David peace accords between Israel and Egypt. Paradoxically, Mr. Sharon, the hope of the right-wing settlers and their supporters, is one of the few leaders who could enforce a mass evacuation policy if required by a peace agreement.
Another factor troubling settlers is the security fence that Mr. Sharon is so intent on building between Israel and the West Bank. Much of the debate over the fence has focused on how it isolates and divides Palestinians, but it also hurts the settlers. Despite all the cartographic machinations of the fence's planners, most of the West Bank settlements find themselves on the wrong side of this new physical barrier. If this fence, as many predict, becomes the basis for a future political border between Israel and a Palestinian state, then these settlements will have to be evacuated. 
And if it is going to happen in the not too distant future, the settlers seem to be asking themselves, why not now? Why not get out of here in an orderly fashion, get compensation from the Israeli government, and prepare new settlements inside Israel, rather than wait until an agreement is signed and then have to scramble for homes, schools and jobs. 
The economic slump in Israel -- it is experiencing one of the worst recessions in its history -- is also affecting settler opinion. Forced to adopt an austerity budget, the government has made cuts for the first time in the settlers' package of benefits and tax concessions. Not all of the settlers moved to the West Bank for ideological and irredentist reasons. Many wanted to be able to build large houses and enjoy middle-class lifestyles that they couldn't have afforded in Israel. For these settlers, the loss of those benefits makes living in the territories unattractive. 
The settlers are also losing the limited public support they once had. Survey after survey shows that the wider public does not support the settlements and that it will not allow them to delay an accord. The last thing that the settlers, apart from the hard-liners, want is to be seen as the peace spoilers.
When Palestinians attacked them over the last three years, the settlers comforted themselves with the belief that the hard-line Sharon government would eventually take care of terrorism and that, meanwhile, they would continue to enjoy the economic benefits that had persuaded many of them to move in the first place. But now it is the hawkish Mr. Sharon who is building the separation fence and negotiating the road map agreements, while an even greater hawk, Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is taking away some of their economic benefits.
It's obvious that no peace agreement will ever go into effect without the evacuation of the settlements. So it is time that the Israeli government prepared a practical blueprint, including generous financial compensation, for such an evacuation. While many of the settlers will continue to oppose all notions of leaving, last week's survey shows that there is an increasing number who are prepared to evacuate even before a final peace agreement. The government should take advantage of this opportunity.

HEADLINE: Shares Drop as Euro Disney Warns It Is Low on Cash 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
Shares in Euro Disney posted one of their biggest one-day declines in almost a decade today, after the company cautioned that it might not have enough cash to pay debt owed to its banks and to its principal shareholder, the Walt Disney Company.
 The company said it had begun talks with its creditors to waive its debt covenants, and was optimistic about reaching an agreement. 
 The slowdown in tourism because of the Iraq war, the SARS scare and Europe's economic slump are buffeting the hotel and theme park business. The shock came less than a year after Euro Disney opened its $615 million, 62-acre Walt Disney Studios Park next to its Disneyland Paris theme park, east of Paris in Marne la Vallee, where Euro Disney is based. 
Euro Disney said overall revenue in its fiscal third quarter, which ended June 30, was 275.6 million euros ($309.8 million), down 7 percent from 297.3 million euros ($334.2 million) in the period last year. Revenue at its resort segment was 268.8 million euros ($302.6 million), down nearly 9 percent from a year ago.
Investors pummeled Euro Disney shares, which fell almost 23 percent before recovering to close down 11 percent at 0.54 euro (61 cents).
The company said in a statement that revenue for its first three fiscal quarters was 748.2 million euros ($841 million), up 2 percent from a year ago, largely thanks to the new studio park. It features film and television studio attractions and is based on similar Disney parks in the United States. Revenue at Euro Disney's Disney Village and seven theme hotels was 307.1 million euros ($345.2 million), up 6 percent for the nine-month period.
Andre Lacroix, who took over in July as chief executive, said Euro Disney sought "a mutually acceptable resolution to our future financing needs," including ways to pay back loans totaling 167.7 million euros ($188.5 million) to Disney due in June 2004.
The company has total debt of 2.2 billion euros ($2.5 billion), with around 1.7 billion euros ($1.9 billion) of that subject to being called by June 2004 at the option of creditors.
Euro Disney's main creditor besides Disney is the French savings bank Caisse des Depots et Consignations, which specializes in real estate. 
Earlier this year, Disney agreed to forgo licensing fees and royalties from Euro Disney for the last nine months of Euro Disney's 2003 fiscal year. It also postponed their payment for 2004. Disney is Euro Disney's largest shareholder, with 39 percent of its stock.
On Thursday, the Walt Disney Company said operating income at its troubled theme park unit dropped 25 percent in the second quarter, but that the drop was largely offset by strong results in television and films.
Aurel Leven Securities, a French brokerage firm, said there was little likelihood that Euro Disney would face insolvency, given strong political backing in the Paris region, where Euro Disney is an important employer. In a note to clients, the firm said, however, that "the Euro Disney situation remains nonetheless very troubling."

HEADLINE: A Bush Faults White House On the Return Of 12 Cubans 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
Gov. Jeb Bush this week criticized a White House decision to return 12 Cubans suspected of hijacking a boat in July.
 The governor's criticism of his brother's administration, in an interview with The Miami Herald on Thursday, came at a time of mounting tensions between the Republican Party and Cuban exile groups, who say that President Bush has fallen short on promises to ratchet up economic and political pressure on Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader. 
 Miami-Dade County's 600,000 Cuban-Americans played a major role in the president's victory over Al Gore in 2000, and with another election year approaching, the exile groups are letting the White House know in increasingly bitter terms that they are unhappy. 
The latest point of conflict was the administration's decision to return 12 Cubans whom the Coast Guard intercepted on a boat it discovered in international waters off the Bahamas on July 15. The Cuban government said the 12 had hijacked the vessel, tying up three men who had been guarding it.
Under the "wet foot, dry foot" policy adopted by the Clinton administration, Cubans who reach land in the United States can stay, but those who are intercepted in the water must be sent back. Cubans are the only people who benefit from such a policy; Haitians who try to enter the country by boat or raft, for example, are automatically sent home. 
But exile groups, which have long attacked that policy, say the decision to return the 12 Cubans last month was particularly egregious because three Cubans who hijacked a boat in April were executed after the United States sent them home. Administration officials say they received assurances from the Cuban government that the 12 would not be executed, and instead would receive prison sentences of up to 10 years.
Several Democratic presidential contenders have sided with the exile groups, including Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who said the decision was "an abandonment of American values" during a visit to South Florida this week that included a stop in Little Havana here.
In his remarks to The Herald, Governor Bush said: "Despite the good intentions of the administration to negotiate the safety of these folks, that is an oppressive regime and given the environment in Cuba, it's just not right" to send them back. He also hinted that the White House would modify its Cuban policy before the presidential election.
Jill Bratina, a spokeswoman for Governor Bush, reiterated his statement today. She said the governor had not discussed the decision with his brother, but had asked high-ranking officials in the administration to review it. "The governor agrees with the president's policies on Cuba and feels that the president has been a strong advocate for the people of Cuba," she said, but added that "unfortunately, in this instance it was not an appropriate decision."
At the White House, President Bush's press secretary told reporters, "Our policy is one of a safe, orderly and legal migration," and added, "We expect that policy to be implemented and carried out in a consistent way."
Scott McClellan, the press secretary, added that while there were "very few" issues on which the Bush brothers disagreed, "One thing that we do agree on is that there's a very oppressive regime and that we stand together in our dedication to helping the Cuban people realize freedom."
Joe Garcia, executive director of the Cuban American National Foundation, the most prominent Cuban exile group, said the exile community had "waited long enough" for the Bush administration to take a harder line against the Castro government.
"This isn't just some Republican; it's someone that this community felt it went to the mat for," Mr. Garcia said of President Bush. "It isn't about the 12 that got returned, but the 11 million on the island and the promises made over three years ago to the Cuban-American community."
Mr. Garcia said that while he applauded the governor's statement, he was insulted by the suggestion that a policy change would come before the election. That, he said, suggested that the Bush administration cared about Cuban votes, not Cubans. "That's demeaning and degrading to a community that demonstrated loyalty and commitment to the Bush family," Mr. Garcia said.
On Thursday, Mr. Garcia's group held a news conference here to urge the government not to send back 19 Cubans intercepted on Monday in a boat near the Cuban coast. At least some of those apprehended, Mr. Garcia and other Cuban-Americans say, are dissidents who risk severe punishment if they are sent home.

HEADLINE: U.S. and North Korea Announce Accord on Wider Atom Talks 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
North Korea and the United States announced today that they had agreed to hold regional talks over North Korea's nuclear weapons program, in a victory for the Bush administration, which resisted 10 months of pressure to hold one-on-one talks with the North.
 By guaranteeing seats at the table to North Korea's neighbors -- China, Russia, Japan and South Korea -- Washington hopes to draw regional players into a pact that would verify the dismantlement of the North's nuclear weapons program, probably in return for international economic aid and an American promise not to attack North Korea militarily. 
 Since the nuclear crisis erupted last October with North Korea's admission that it had built a secret weapons program in violation of a 1994 nuclear freeze accord, the North has insisted on one-on-one talks with the United States. The leadership of the isolated nation apparently feared that in group talks the other countries would gang up on it. 
Today, North Korea finally agreed to group talks. In a face-saving move they claimed authorship of the idea and asserted the group talks would be a fig leaf for one-on-one talks. Using the initials for the country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said it "put forward a new proposal to have six-party talks without going through the three-party talks and to have the D.P.R.K.-U.S. bilateral talks there."
But Bush administration officials say they do not see the group framework as cover for one-on-one talks.
"Obviously they can always directly talk to us in the multilateral setting," Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, told reporters in Washington today. "If you're sitting at a table, someone can talk across that table."
On Thursday, as North Korea's acceptance of group talks was percolating through the Bush administration, John R. Bolton, the American undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, warned a South Korean audience here, "We do not envision these talks as where the U.S. and the D.P.R.K. stay in the room, while everyone else goes out for a cup of coffee."
From Washington, President Bush said he was hopeful that Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, "because he's hearing other voices, will make the decision to totally dismantle his nuclear weapons program, that he will allow there to be complete transparency and verifiability."
"And we're optimistic that that can happen," he added.
In Tokyo, Mr. Bolton hailed what he called "the acceptance of the U.S. proposal on multilateral talks."
In the regional chess game, experts here noted today that North Korea's concession on the format was announced by Russia, not China, traditionally its closest ally.
"It really shows that China has changed," said Victor D. Cha, a Korea expert at Georgetown University who is visiting here. "The North Koreans must feel they don't trust the Chinese to deliver. That is why the North Korea chose to make this announcement through Russia, not through China. North Korea is losing confidence in China as being on their side."
China used to describe its relationship with North Korea as close as "lips and teeth." 
Ten years ago, Hu Jintao, a Chinese Politburo member, traveled to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, to mark the 40th anniversary of the armistice that ended the Korean War. Last week, Mr. Hu, now president of China, neglected to send an official delegation to Pyongyang to mark the 50th anniversary.
In the intervening decade, South Korea became China's sixth-largest foreign investor, and China became South Korea's largest trading partner. Last year, trade between China and South Korea hit $44 billion, almost 100 times as much as the $500 million in trade between China and North Korea. Chinese gifts of food and oil accounted for most of the $500 million.
China increasingly considers its impoverished neighbor as a liability, an economic failure that will collapse one day, flooding northern China with millions of refugees. On the security side, China fears that North Korea's nuclear program is spurring Japan to join the United States in a missile defense program and is softening attitudes toward an eventual "Japanese bomb."
"China's fear is Japan's nuclearization," said Lee Ki Tak, a former national security adviser to South Korean presidents. "China has abandoned cooperation with the Kim Jong Il regime."
Similar readings were heard today in Japan and South Korea.
"China's move apparently left the North Korean leadership with an impression that China might 'dump' North Korea if it fails to show flexibility," the Japanese Kyodo News wrote in an analysis from Tokyo. "North Korea has obviously made a concession in announcing that it has agreed to have talks with the U.S. within a six-nation framework; this is a sure sign that Pyongyang isfacing a make-or-break battle for the survival of the Kim Jong Il regime."
In Seoul, the Kospi stock index jumped 1.9 percent at the news, closing at a high not seen since December.
But editorials in early editions of Seoul's Saturday newspapers cautioned against optimism. 
"There has only been a vague expectation for success," the newspaper JoongAng Ilbo warned about the long effort to get the North to agree to the group format. Warning of long and tortured talks ahead, the newspaper concluded, "The North Korea regime is in a struggle for survival."

HEADLINE: Unions Vow Harder Fight Against Wage-Freeze Plans 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
New York City's municipal union leaders said yesterday that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's more upbeat view of the city's financial picture would make them fight all the more against the wage freezes he had proposed.
 "There's no doubt that what he said weakens his case for a wage freeze," said Arthur Cheliotes, president of Communications Workers Local 1180, which represents 7,500 municipal middle managers and supervisors. "We will not entertain a wage freeze, not when we're required to work with a smaller staff carrying greater workloads and all the increases in the cost of living." 
 On Thursday, Mr. Bloomberg told the Financial Control Board, a state agency that monitors the city's budget, that the city's finances had turned a corner. He talked of a manageable budget deficit of about $2 billion next year, although those figures do not assume any wage increases for city workers. 
Mr. Bloomberg has said he will not award wage increases to more than 250,000 city workers unless the unions agree to productivity gains to finance the raises. The contracts for most city workers expired months ago, but Mr. Bloomberg faces little pressure to reach new contracts soon, except for his desire to put into place new measures to increase productivity.
"It is clear the city still faces financial risks, and I am still disappointed that we were not able to convince our labor leaders that they should assist New York in its time of need," he said. "This coming fiscal year I will appeal to them again to put aside their self-interest and help their fellow New Yorkers."
After those remarks, Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, blamed Mr. Bloomberg for rejecting offers she said the city's unions had already made to save money. She sought to strike a conciliatory tone, walking up to the mayor and kissing him on the cheek.
"The union members want to be part of the solution," she said, after the mayor's presentation. "They want to engage in the give and take."
But in a letter sent to municipal labor leaders on Thursday, Ms. Weingarten, who is also chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee, took a tougher tone. 
"I am disappointed that the mayor seems to have forgotten that the M.L.C. met him more than halfway," she wrote, referring to proposals that she said would have provided more than half the $600 million in productivity savings he was seeking.
"City workers have sacrificed during these difficult budget times. Thousands of laid-off workers, including hundreds of my own members, are now on unemployment or welfare."
Lillian Roberts, executive director of District Council 37, an umbrella union representing 125,000 municipal workers, said the better fiscal picture made her union less willing to accept a wage freeze.
"I am hopeful that the city's improved financial condition increases the chances for our members to get the fair contract they deserve," she said.
Mr. Cheliotes angrily dismissed Mr. Bloomberg's plea for unions to put their self-interest aside.
"We're not talking self-interest," he said. "We're talking survival. The cost of living has gone up, and like everybody else, we have to pay fare increases, tax increases, toll increases, tuition increases. The cost of living to our members has gone up, and they have to be made whole." 
Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said he was willing to discuss increasing productivity with the city. As before, he said the city should award the police for the lower crime rates they had already achieved.
"This has been the most productive Police Department in the city's history," he said. "We've brought down crime, but time and time again, the city has refused to recognize that to pay for it."
Mr. Lynch said the union was willing to discuss lengthening work shifts for the police, something Mr. Bloomberg has proposed because it could save the city millions of dollars. "But it has to be done in such a way that the savings are passed along to the members," Mr. Lynch said.

HEADLINE: Congressional Memo; 
Grand Old Ploy: Punt, Cringe and Win

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
Congressional Republicans call it their "winning ugly" strategy.
 Even when controlling both chambers, Republican leaders have discovered that advancing their social and economic agenda is much easier when they punt contentious legislation into House and Senate negotiations, where Republicans are firmly in command. 
 The latest example came this week when Senate Republicans, flummoxed in their push to pass an energy bill before leaving town, resorted to resurrecting and passing last year's Democratic energy proposal just to get into talks with their House brethren.
That same path has been followed all year on difficult bills: get a budget, tax cut or Medicare bill off the floor and out of the line of fire -- even if it has flaws that make lawmakers cringe -- and force it into conference for a thorough massaging. 
"An obvious advantage to being in the majority, even if it is a tiny majority like ours, is that you control the conference," Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said today as the Senate adjourned until Sept. 2. "It is elementary that if you can get a bill to conference, you have a wide latitude to produce a bill the majority is comfortable with and the president is comfortable with."
It may be elementary, but it is not exactly the textbook version of how a bill becomes law.
Conference committees operate largely behind closed doors with staff members writing much of the bill. And the minority party has very little leverage, which of course is the idea. The energy measure, for instance, will now be under the stewardship of two Republican industry allies: Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico and Representative Billy Tauzin of Louisiana.
Senate opponents can always filibuster a final conference report if they can line up sufficient opposition. But traditionally it is tougher to stall a measure in its final form, just one step away from becoming law.
Nevertheless, Republicans might find that relying on conference committees is no guarantee of success when they return next month. Their chief domestic priority, adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare, is now in conference and the House and Senate versions are considerably different. So are the two chambers' views on how to extend an increase in the child tax credit to lower-income families.
"We've got a long way to go," Bill Frist, the Senate majority leader, said today as he ticked off the accomplishments of the Republican Senate in his seven-month tenure.
Looking ahead to the fall, he said the Senate would take up limitations on class-action suits and consider a plan to create a fund to resolve thousands of asbestos-related claims. And he said Republicans would get a deal on prescription drugs. 
The unusual deal on the energy measure allowed the Senate to go into its break on a higher note than it appeared likely as late as Thursday. Dr. Frist and Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, engaged in a standoff over the energy measure and Dr. Frist's decision to hold a series of votes on judicial nominees that Democrats are blocking.
But when Republicans and Democrats grabbed what both viewed as an energy bargain, it opened the door to quick approval of the bill, a $983 million emergency spending measure, a renewal of intelligence programs and other legislation. The House had exited a week earlier.
While Republicans were celebrating what they saw as progress, Democrats took a different view. In their report card on the Republican leadership's work, they found the results lacking on most fronts. "Senate Republicans have taken every opportunity in the 108th Congress to push a right wing-agenda, often refusing to compromise or moderate extreme views that are at odds with the values of the majority of Americans," the Senate Democratic Policy Committee said in a statement.
The fall promises no respite from the partisanship. Dr. Frist and his leadership team said they would continue to press the Democrats on the conservative judicial nominees and Democrats will persist with inquiries into the administration's handling of intelligence issues related to Iraq. 
And while the newly passed Senate energy measure might go into the conference talks as the Daschle-Bingaman energy bill -- named for its original Democratic authors, Mr. Daschle and Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico -- Dr. Frist said it would emerge a completely different animal.
"When the president signs that energy bill, it will be, in essence, a Bush-Domenici-Tauzin energy bill," Dr. Frist said.

HEADLINE: JOB LOSSES IN JULY ADD TO MIXED SIGNS ON THE ECONOMY 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
The economy shed 44,000 jobs in July, the Labor Department reported yesterday, though the overall unemployment rate edged down. 
 The rate fell, to 6.2 percent from 6.4 percent in June, only because the number of people looking for jobs declined faster than the number of people holding them. People have been withdrawing from the labor market in greater numbers because of their poor prospects. 
 The latest data on job losses, which came a day after the Commerce Department's mildly encouraging report on economic growth last quarter, left economists wondering what to believe. 
"One has to hope that the upturn in business confidence is going to be reflected in these numbers as well," said Robert V. DiClemente, chief United States economist at Citigroup. In the meantime, he said, "it's just been a persistent pattern of lingering weakness in the job market."
The economy grew at an average annual rate of 2.4 percent in the second quarter, and economists guessed that it might have accelerated to a pace of 4 percent by the end of June. Such a rate, if sustained, is considered strong enough to spur hiring. Yet in July, the jobs did not appear.
The lack of improvement in the labor market despite some economic progress has added fuel to the battle fires in Washington and has frustrated job seekers across the country. Since the most recent recession ended in November 2001, the nation's payrolls have shrunk by more than a million workers.
In a telephone interview yesterday, Elaine L. Chao, the secretary of labor, called the latest figures "confusing" and attributed the dwindling of the labor force to unusual seasonal factors. She said the tax credit checks recently mailed to families with children would help to stimulate demand; she also said she hoped Congress would approve $3,000 grants to help the long-term unemployed with training and relocation.
Democrats in Washington charged that the three waves of tax cuts advocated by the White House had done little to ensure that new jobs accompanied the economic recovery.
"This is the almost predictable consequence of a policy of tax cuts that have not strengthened the country but weakened it," said Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island. "We sent checks out, but we neglected millions who have family and are struggling. If we're serious about getting the economy going, we've got to start targeting tax relief to middle- and low-income families who will go out and create demand."
The labor force thinned by 556,000 people last month, with the number of employed workers dipping by 260,000. These declines followed gains of comparable size in June. The unemployment rate dropped for almost every demographic group except whites for the second month in a row. Among whites, the rate remained at 5.5 percent, its highest level since April 1994.
Payrolls contracted for the sixth straight month. Along with the July decline, the Labor Department revised its June report to reflect a decrease of 72,000 jobs rather than 30,000. Jobs in the manufacturing of long-lasting goods like motorcycles and microwave ovens slipped by 54,000, according to the survey of payrolls, which provides more reliable estimates of employment month to month. Wholesale and retail trade combined lost about 29,000 positions.
Bucking the trend, real estate and lending added almost 10,000 jobs in July, in a likely reflection of low interest rates and home refinancing activity. But the largest gains -- and perhaps a lonehopeful sign -- came from temporary help, which picked up 41,000 people.
The uptick could imply that companies will soon consider hiring permanent workers, too, said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, who runs a research concern in New York that has been among the most accurate forecasters of the economy in the last three years. On the whole, though, Ms. Ramirez cautioned that the Labor Department's report was less positive than it appeared at first blush.
"The job numbers, especially the unemployment rate, really looks a lot better than what the reality is," she said. "There hasn't been job formation or the labor force growing because people have had a lot of trouble entering the labor force." College graduates have had a hard time finding their first jobs, she explained, and people whose unemployment benefits have run out may have stopped looking for jobs.
Tracking this group, called discouraged workers, can be difficult, because the Labor Department does not adjust the relevant statistics for seasonal changes. Instead, Ms. Ramirez said, she looks at other indicators: "If you look at it from the receipts line on state budgets, tax revenues are so much lower than expected. It's hard to capture it all with the employment numbers."
Mr. DiClemente took the opposite point of view, asserting that the figures might underestimate the strength of the labor market. He was especially suspicious of the slump in hours worked each week, which at an average of 33.6 in July were the lowest on record, and the widespread job losses in manufacturing.
"These large declines across the board in all these factory industries -- it doesn't ring true," he said. "The fact that they're so uniformly depressed is what raises the flag. Maybe there's something here in the summertime seasonal patterns that eluded a good read."
He added that a positive reading in the Institute of Supply Management's index of manufacturing activity, also released yesterday, "does tend to cast doubt on the validity of the factory hours, because it confirms every other survey." Given Thursday's report from the Commerce Department, he estimated that the economy began the third quarter growing "at the very least at a 4 percent rate."
Expansion at that speed would probably be enough to create new jobs, given a population growing by 1 percent a year and productivity increasing by about 2 percent a year. At its meeting in two weeks, Mr. DiClemente concluded, the Federal Reserve Board might not take yesterday's employment numbers too seriously.

 MORNINGSIDE HEIGHTS
By Cheryl Mendelson.
326 pp. New York:
Random House. $24.95.
 WHEN the characters in Cheryl Mendelson's first novel are looking for entertainment, they often pick up the works of great 19th-century authors like Thackeray and George Eliot. In providing the members of her modern-day cast with such reading matter, Mendelson is, at one level, simply underlining their literary tastes; but at another, she is paying homage to her predecessors. Thackeray, Eliot and Jane Austen (invoked after two of Mendelson's characters see a film adaptation of "Sense and Sensibility") are, above all, social novelists who place their protagonists in carefully modeled worlds. That Mendelson intends "Morningside Heights" to be such a book is clear even from its title, which asks us to see the lives the novel depicts as representing a broader context: a socially mixed Manhattan neighborhood at the end of the 20th century.
With her motley cast, Mendelson paints an accurate, often comical portrait of the Upper West Side. The dramatis personae include Mr. Morales, a building superintendent, "better educated and more intelligent than his employers on the co-op board guessed"; elderly Mary O'Reilly, "retrieving her mail, in an elegant 60's-style suit incongruously paired with worn athletic shoes"; Father Merriweather, a nebbishy Episcopal priest who was once a lawyer; and the "tall, gaunt, intimidating" Smith-Smythes, who "signed brazen petitions, wrote public letters that were signed by Nobel Prize winners and held secret meetings with fugitives, the proceedings of which were reported verbatim the next day in the world's various Timeses." The central characters are Charles and Anne Braithwaite: he "a solidly second-rank baritone at the Met, who had accepted that he would never rise further"; she "once regarded as a promising pianist," now the full-time mother of three children who "attended private schools and got carefully chosen outside lessons and classes." In typical Manhattan fashion, the whole Braithwaite brood is crammed into a two-bedroom apartment.
Charles and Anne claim to have a strong marriage, but it is the sort of relationship in which a wife knows her husband "had an inner account book, where he kept a record of her moral flaws," and in which a husband can think the following of his wife: "How hard Anne worked, how much she gave up and did without, never suspecting, it seemed to him, that her petty domestic sacrifices had no tendency at all to produce cash or put food on the table -- as though she thought that moral payment were coin of the realm. So she suffered her little deprivations. . . . Thereby, in her own mind, she earned the right to spread her table with lobster, caviar and rare apples grown only in a small Civil War-era orchard somewhere south of Pittsburgh, and to spend thousands of dollars on tiny old violins for Ellen and Stuart. For all her orderly practicality, there were ways in which Anne's mind was really deranged."
It's no surprise, then, that the Braithwaites ignore their conjugal difficulties and throw themselves into worrying about the marital prospects of their two best friends, Morris Malcolm, an irascible biologist engaged in genetic research, and Merrit Roth, a beautiful cultural critic, who (ironically) writes on "the history of women's roles and the family." Anne feels "genuine sorrow on Merrit's account, for in her mind the joys of husbands, pregnancies and children were life's best." When Merrit hasn't found these by the age of 38, Anne concludes that "Merrit's life is an emergency."
Obviously, Merrit and Morris will eventually end up together; less clear is why all these cultured intellectuals are so preoccupied with marriage and babies. Charles and Anne seem to agonize over Morris and Merrit as a kind of pastime, but the behavior of the singles themselves is puzzling. In the midst of huge, potentially career-breaking shenanigans in his former lab, Morris proposes marriage to a brand-new girlfriend, for whom his feelings are at best lukewarm. Merrit's research gathers dust on her desk while she frets over comments her gynecologist made about infertility and fends off a volley of proposals from a young professor.
When Mendelson's characters aren't pondering marriage, their thoughts turn immediately to its bedfellow, the great New York topic: real estate. This straitness of focus troubles me, particularly because the novel's peripheries are rich with more interesting material. Subthemes and subplots abound: what, for example, it means to be a second-rate musician, and to be married to one, having given up one's own art to look after his children; what damage is inflicted by the backbiting and competition in Morris's world of scientific research; the changes gentrification wreaks on a neighborhood; and the emotional consequences of the death of Lizzie Miller, the old lady in apartment 9D, which also triggers a chain of events that culminate in a courtroom drama. None of these stories are fully realized because, as if it were a narrow cousin of "Persuasion," the book's chief aim is to see everyone fitted neatly into the social order.
The sometimes muddled writing in "Morningside Heights" is surprising, given the clean prose of Mendelson's first book, "Home Comforts," a hefty volume of nonfiction that provides perhaps the only context in which "entertaining" and "treatise on domestic economy" can correctly be used in the same sentence. One might overlook the galumphing description of Morningside Heights at the start of Chapter 1, but once the story begins to roll, you begrudge the detour in Chapter 2 for more neighborhood lore. And do there need to be three scenes of Merrit uncovering deep truths about herself with her analyst?
Most of the lackluster writing is garden variety, composed of scenes and sentences a more experienced author would simply have excised. ("The kind of interest that sustained marriage was bestowed on its object, not created by it" is one of many examples.) I suspect that with experience Mendelson may also regret her decision to tie a neat bow at the end of each plot line, especially given her stated intention to write two more volumes about these characters. Yet if "Home Comforts" is the true index of Mendelson's capabilities as a writer, the forthcoming installments of the "Morningside Heights" trilogy might be worth looking forward to. After all, now that the marriage plot has been exhausted, she may feel free to bring other, more engaging matters to the fore.

 SURVIVORS IN MEXICO
By Rebecca West.
Edited by Bernard Schweizer.
264 pp. New Haven:
Yale University Press. $26.95.
 "SURVIVORS IN MEXICO" is the book everyone who has ever written anything would love to write. Witty and entertaining, substantive and reflective, insightful and well documented, in splendid and uncommon prose, Rebecca West's travelogue -- meandering commentary and ruminations on Mexico from pre-Columbian civilization to traffic in the capital during the mid-1960's -- is a model of British sophistication and knack for seeing the other. One can quarrel, of course, with her choice of icons: in some cases she could have looked harder and longer. Clearly, Frida Kahlo was a cult figure for foreigners long before Salma Hayek or Christie's took her under their wing, but not necessarily a central figure in Mexican history; the relevance of Trotsky to 20th-century Mexico is arguable at best, even if a piece on Trotsky in Mexico for The New Yorker was the original pretext for West's trip to Mexico in 1966, with a return in 1969, and for her manuscript. Yet West, like so many other foreign visitors to my country over the years, saw things in Mexico that on occasion Mexicans detect only vaguely or opaquely.
Mexico has always fascinated travelers or conquerors, and it has been blessed since time immemorial by foreign scrutiny, sympathy and severity. From Bartolome de las Casas' chronicles of the destruction of pre-Columbian civilization by the Spanish, to Edward Weston and Tina Modotti's lenses, through the fiction of Graham Greene, D. H. Lawrence and Malcolm Lowry, and biographies by Ralph Roeder, John Womack and Friedrich Katz as well as Alan Riding's journalism, the country has enjoyed -- and on occasion suffered from -- the attraction it has exercised over scholars, painters, exiles and judges. 
So West is not alone, though her genre, as far as Mexico is concerned, may be. She was well on in years when "Survivors in Mexico" was assembled, nearly half a century after the publication of her first novel, about World War I. As Bernard Schweizer, the assistant professor of English at Long Island University who pulled West's manuscript together for publication, explains in his excellent introduction, she never had a very clear idea of where exactly she wanted to go with the book. So it is more a collection of insights and intelligent, well-informed notions than a shapely text. But then again, that is perhaps the way travelogues should be, and certainly the stream of thought about everything from the Conquest to housing in the capital is as rich a treasure as the last Aztec emperor's could have been.
Perhaps the most penetrating aspect of the book is West's insight into Mexico's modern-day ambivalence toward its past. From the beginning she picks up on a peculiarity that many of my countrymen ignore: the paradox of a mestizo country that identifies exclusively with its Indian past. Referring early on to the proverbial taxi driver as he proudly boasts of his Indian ancestry and denounces the Spaniards and their crimes and misdeeds, she wryly remarks, "The substance of the polemic is slightly surprising to the foreigner, because the speaker is unlikely to be a pure Indian," as indeed today less than 10 percent of Mexico's inhabitants are. "The man is not denouncing some monstrous invader of his people's lands, as Poles might denounce the Nazi Germans; he is denouncing some of his ancestors for maltreating other of his ancestors, which, as he is both, must lead to schizophrenia." In recent times, some people in Mexico, including myself, have mused about an equivalent case of split personality: the ingrained resentment and knee-jerk animosity against the United States that undoubtedly still imbues most of Mexico's political and intellectual elite, this in a country where 90 percent of every conceivable foreign tie is with the United States, and one-tenth of whose citizens live and work north of the border.
On the infinitely complex question of race relations in modern Mexico -- an issue brought to the fore by the Chiapas uprising of 1994, though now somewhat forgotten as Subcommander Marcos has faded from the national political scene -- the author of "Black Lamb and Grey Falcon" is rightly admiring of Mexico, and at the same time slightly simplistic. When she concludes that "looking at the Mexican brown majority, it appears possible that it is immune from insult and injury because, to use a Shakespearean phrase, there was good sport at its making," she is minimizing what many consider a rape of an indigenous civilization by a European conqueror and the ensuing black legend of the near-genocidal decimation of New Spain's inhabitants in the 16th century (which, to do West justice, she does deal with later on). In all fairness, though, she also glosses over some of the less attractive features of Aztec civilization, notably human sacrifice and its role in the structure of society and the militarism of Tenochtitlan; there are elliptical references to human sacrifice early on in the book, and then a more explicit, though still only passing, comment 
on Cortes's encounters with this important characteristic of Aztec society, which West herself acknowledges that she "forgot." 
She grasps the fundamental nature of modern Mexico: a mestizo society in which an immense majority of the population, unlike that of most other countries in Latin America whose pre-Columbian peoples survived the Conquest, is made up of people similar to one another. On occasion West takes the point a bit far, as when she states that "if a white man and a man of mixed blood quarrel, it is simply as if a dark man has fallen out with his brother who takes after the other side of the family and is fair." One of the more intractable forms of racism in Mexico is the discrimination against the darker mestizos by the whiter ones, and, perhaps more important, the silent but significant "whitening" of Mexican elites over the past three decades. 
But none of this detracts from West's recurrent insights into modern Mexican life and peculiarities, which are always expressed with wit and wisdom. On Mexico's demographics -- even today probably its central predicament, because of the legacy of the past -- she notes, "The Mexican uterus makes nonsense of all public enterprises before they get off the drawing board." On our perpetual inclination to consider ourselves unique and different, in ways shared with and common to most countries, she mocks sympathetically: "Mexicans will explain to you at immense length that their religious condition is immensely complicated and special to themselves, but in fact the faith seems to be as it is all over the world today."
Mexico today faces challenges perhaps more daunting than at any time since the revolution that West mentions only briefly at the end of "Survivors in Mexico." Once the remarkably vital drive toward modernity that emerged from the revolution died out in the 1960's, and after the new, contradictory drive of the 1990's, presided over by Carlos Salinas and Ernesto Zedillo, proved too weak to propel the nation into the 21st century on the right track, Vicente Fox and democracy have tried -- so far in vain -- to haul Mexico toward security, equality, prosperity and competitiveness. It would seem that the marvelous nation and culture visited and admired by Rebecca West has yet to recover its balance after losing sight of the revolution and missing the tides of democracy and economic reform. 
Mexico's human and material resources are nearly infinite, and consequently there is nearly always another chance. Nearly, but not certainly: the country has to come to terms quickly with its past -- a history to be remembered, not worshiped; with its present -- an opportunity that does not last forever; and with its future -- which will inevitably differ from the myths it has wrapped around its past, and whose relevance has outlived its welcome. None of this is impossible. Mexico, with a little help from its friends, and with more reflections and insights like the ones West offers her posthumous readers today, will undoubtedly succeed at doing a bit better than just surviving.

HEADLINE: Double Lives On The Down Low 

BYLINE:  By Benoit Denizet-Lewis; Benoit Denizet-Lewis is a writer living in Boston. His last article for the magazine was about a biological girl living as a boy.

 BODY:
In its upper stories, the Flex bathhouse in Cleveland feels like a squash club for backslapping businessmen. There's a large gym with free weights and exercise machines on the third floor. In the common area, on the main floor, men in towels lounge on couches and watch CNN on big-screen TV's. 
 In the basement, the mood is different: the TV's are tuned to porn, and the dimly lighted hallways buzz with sexual energy. A naked black man reclines on a sling in a room called "the dungeon play area." Along a hallway lined with lockers, black men eye each other as they walk by in towels. In small rooms nearby, some men are having sex. Others are napping. 
 There are two bathhouses in Cleveland. On the city's predominantly white West Side, Club Cleveland -- which opened in 1965 and recently settled into a modern 15,000-square-foot space -- attracts many white and openly gay men. Flex is on the East Side, and it serves a mostly black and Hispanic clientele, many of whom don't consider themselves gay. (Flex recently shut its doors temporarily while it relocates.) 
I go to Flex one night to meet Ricardo Wallace, an African-American outreach worker for the AIDS Task Force of Cleveland who comes here twice a month to test men for H.I.V. I eventually find him sitting alone on a twin-size bed in a small room on the main floor. Next to him on the bed are a dozen unopened condoms and several oral H.I.V.-testing kits.
Twenty years ago, Wallace came here for fun. He was 22 then, and AIDS seemed to kill only gay white men in San Francisco and New York. Wallace and the other black men who frequented Flex in the early 80's worried just about being spotted walking in the front door. 
Today, while there are black men who are openly gay, it seems that the majority of those having sex with men still lead secret lives, products of a black culture that deems masculinity and fatherhood as a black man's primary responsibility -- and homosexuality as a white man's perversion. And while Flex now offers baskets of condoms and lubricant, Wallace says that many of the club's patrons still don't use them.
Wallace ticks off the grim statistics: blacks make up only 12 percent of the population in America, but they account for half of all new reported H.I.V. infections. While intravenous drug use is a large part of the problem, experts say that the leading cause of H.I.V. in black men is homosexual sex (some of which takes place in prison, where blacks disproportionately outnumber whites). According to the Centers for Disease Control, one-third of young urban black men who have sex with men in this country are H.I.V.-positive, and 90 percent of those are unaware of their infection. 
We don't hear much about this aspect of the epidemic, mostly because the two communities most directly affected by it -- the black and gay communities -- have spent the better part of two decades eyeing each other through a haze of denial or studied disinterest. For African-Americans, facing and addressing the black AIDS crisis would require talking honestly and compassionately about homosexuality -- and that has proved remarkably difficult, whether it be in black churches, in black organizations or on inner-city playgrounds. The mainstream gay world, for its part, has spent 20 years largely fighting the epidemic among white, openly gay men, showing little sustained interest in reaching minorities who have sex with men and who refuse to call themselves gay.
Rejecting a gay culture they perceive as white and effeminate, many black men have settled on a new identity, with its own vocabulary and customs and its own name: Down Low. There have always been men -- black and white -- who have had secret sexual lives with men. But the creation of an organized, underground subculture largely made up of black men who otherwise live straight lives is a phenomenon of the last decade. Many of the men at Flex tonight -- and many of the black men I met these past months in Cleveland, Atlanta, Florida, New York and Boston -- are on the Down Low, or on the DL, as they more often call it. Most date or marry women and engage sexually with men they meet only in anonymous settings like bathhouses and parks or through the Internet. Many of these men are young and from the inner city, where they live in a hypermasculine "thug" culture. Other DL men form romantic relationships with men and may even be peripheral participants in mainstream gay culture, all unknown to their colleagues and families. Most DL men identify themselves not as gay or bisexual but first and foremost as black. To them, as to many blacks, that equates to being inherently masculine. 
DL culture has grown, in recent years, out of the shadows and developed its own contemporary institutions, for those who know where to look: Web sites, Internet chat rooms, private parties and special nights at clubs. Over the same period, Down Low culture has come to the attention of alarmed public health officials, some of whom regard men on the DL as an infectious bridge spreading H.I.V. to unsuspecting wives and girlfriends. In 2001, almost two-thirds of women in the United States who found out they had AIDS were black.
With no wives or girlfriends around, Flex is a safe place for men on the DL to let down their guards. There aren't many white men here either (I'm one of them), and that's often the norm for DL parties and clubs. Some private DL events won't even let whites in the door. Others will let you in if you look "black enough," which is code for looking masculine, tough and "straight." That's not to say that DL guys are attracted only to men of color. "Some of the black boys here love white boys," Wallace says.
While Wallace tests one man for H.I.V. (not all DL men ignore the health threat), I walk back downstairs to change into a towel -- I've been warned twice by Flex employees that clothes aren't allowed in the club. By the lockers, I notice a tall black man in his late teens or early 20's staring at me from a dozen lockers down. Abruptly, he walks over and puts his right hand on my left shoulder.
"You wanna hook up?" he asks, smiling broadly.
His frankness takes me by surprise. Bathhouse courtship rituals usually involve a period of aggressive flirtation -- often heavy and deliberate staring. "Are you gay?" I ask him. 
"Nah, man," he says. "I got a girl. You look like you would have a girl, too."
I tell him that I don't have a girl. "Doesn't matter," he says, stepping closer. I decline his advances, to which he seems genuinely perplexed. Before I go back upstairs, I ask him if he normally uses condoms here. 
As a recurring announcement comes over the club's loudspeaker -- "H.I.V. testing is available in Room 207. . . . H.I.V. testing in Room 207" -- he shakes his head. "Nah, man," he says. "I like it raw."
If Cleveland is the kind of city many gay people flee, Atlanta is a city they escape to. For young black men, Atlanta is the hub of the South, a city with unlimited possibilities, including a place in its vibrant DL scene. 
I went to Atlanta to meet William, an attractive 35-year-old black man on the DL who asked to be identified by his middle name. I met him in the America Online chat room DLThugs, where he spends some time most days searching for what he calls "real" DL guys -- as opposed to the "flaming queens who like to pretend they're thugs and on the DL." William says he likes his guys "to look like real guys," and his Internet profile makes it clear what he isn't looking for: no stupid questions, fats, whites, stalkers or queens.
I told him I was a writer, and he eventually agreed to take me around to a few clubs in Atlanta. With one condition: "You better dress cool," he warned me. "Don't dress, you know, white."
William smiles as I climb into his silver Jeep Grand Cherokee, which I take as a good sign. Two of William's best friends are in the car with him: Christopher, a thin, boyish 32-year-old with a shaved head, and Rakeem, an outgoing 31-year-old with dreadlocks who asked to be identified by his Muslim name. We drive toward the Palace, a downtown club popular with young guys on the DL. 
William doesn't date women anymore and likes guys younger than he is, although they've been known to get more attached than he would prefer. "Yeah, he's always getting stalked," Rakeem says enthusiastically. "The boys just won't leave him alone. He's got this weird power to make boys act really stupid." 
It's easy to see why. William radiates confidence and control, which serve him well in his daytime role as an executive at a local corporation. He says his co-workers don't know he likes men ("It's none of their business," he tells me several times), or that after work he changes personas completely, becoming a major player in the city's DL scene, organizing parties and events.
Christopher, who sits in the back seat with me, is the only one of the three who is openly gay and not on the DL (although he won't tell me his last name, for fear of embarrassing his parents). Christopher moved to Atlanta when he was 24 and was surprised when black men in the city couldn't get enough of him. "They would hit on me at the grocery store, on the street, on the train, always in this sly, DL kind of way where you never actually talk about what you're really doing," he says. "That's actually how I met my current boyfriend. He followed me off the train." 
Rakeem, a roommate of William's, moved to Atlanta five years ago from Brooklyn. He says he's "an urban black gay man on the DL," which he says reflects his comfort with his sexuality but his unwillingness to "broadcast it." People at work don't know he's gay. His family wouldn't know, either, if a vindictive friend hadn't told them. "I'm a guy's guy, a totally masculine black gay man, and that's just beyond my family's comprehension," he says.
While Rakeem and William proudly proclaim themselves on the Down Low, they wouldn't have been considered on the DL when men first started claiming the label in the mid-90's. Back then the culture was completely under the radar, and DL men lived ostensibly heterosexual lives (complete with wives and girlfriends) but also engaged in secret sexual relationships with men. Today, though, an increasing number of black men who have sex only with men identify themselves as DL, further muddying an already complicated group identity. And as DL culture expands, it has become an open secret.
For many men on the Down Low, including William and Rakeem, the DL label is both an announcement of masculinity and a separation from white gay culture. To them, it is the safest identity available -- they don't risk losing their ties to family, friends and black culture. 
William parks the car in a secluded lot about a block from the Palace. As he breaks out some pot, I ask them if they heard about what happened recently at Morehouse College, where one black student beat another with a bat supposedly for looking at him the wrong way in a dormitory shower.
"I'm surprised that kind of stuff doesn't happen more often," William says. "The only reason it doesn't is because most black guys are sly enough about it that they aren't gonna get themselves beaten up. If you're masculine and a guy thinks you're checking him out, you can always say: 'Whoa, chill, I ain't checking you out. Look at me. Do I look gay to you?' "
Masculinity is a surprisingly effective defense, because until recently the only popular representations of black gay men were what William calls "drag queens or sissies." Rakeem takes a hit from the bowl. "We know there are black gay rappers, black gay athletes, but they're all on the DL," Rakeem says. "If you're white, you can come out as an openly gay skier or actor or whatever. It might hurt you some, but it's not like if you're black and gay, because then it's like you've let down the whole black community, black women, black history, black pride. You don't hear black people say, 'Oh yeah, he's gay, but he's still a real man, and he still takes care of all his responsibilities.' What you hear is, 'Look at that sissy faggot.' "
I ask them what the difference is between being on the DL and being in the closet. "Being on the DL is about having fun," William tells me. "Being who you are, but keeping your business to yourself. The closet isn't fun. In the closet, you're lonely."
"I don't know," Christopher says. "In some ways I think DL is just a new, sexier way to say you're in the closet."
Both have a point. As William says, DL culture does place a premium on pleasure. It is, DL guys insist, one big party. And there is a certain freedom in not playing by modern society's rules of self-identification, in not having to explain yourself, or your sexuality, to anyone. Like the black athletes and rappers they idolize, DL men convey a strong sense of masculine independence and power: I do what I want when I want with whom I want. Even the term Down Low -- which was popularized in the 1990's by the singers TLC and R. Kelly, meaning "secret" -- has a sexy ring to it, a hint that you're doing something wrong that feels right.
But for all their supposed freedom, many men on the DL are as trapped -- or more trapped -- than their white counterparts in the closet. While DL guys regard the closet as something alien (a sad, stifling place where fearful people hide), the closet can be temporary (many closeted men plan to someday "come out"). But black men on the DL typically say they're on the DL for life. Since they generally don't see themselves as gay, there is nothing to "come out" to, there is no next step.
Sufficiently stoned, the guys decide to make an appearance at the Palace. More than anything, the place feels like a rundown loft where somebody stuck a bar and a dance floor and called it a club. Still, it's one of the most popular hangouts for young black men on the DL in Atlanta.
William surveys the crowd, which is made up mostly of DL "homo thugs," black guys dressed like gangsters and rappers (baggy jeans, do-rags, and FUBU jackets). "So many people in here try so hard to look like they're badasses," he says. "Everyone wants to look like they're on the DL." 
As I look out onto the dance floor, I can't help doing the math. If the C.D.C. is right that nearly 1 in 3 young black men who have sex with men is H.I.V.-positive, then about 50 of the young men on this dance floor are infected, and most of them don't know it. 
"You have no idea how many of the boys here tonight would let me" -- have sex with them -- "without a condom," William tells me. "These young guys swear they know it all. They all want a black thug. They just want the black thug to do his thing." 
While William and many other DL men insist that they're strictly "tops" -- meaning they play the active, more stereotypically "masculine" role during sexual intercourse -- other DL guys proudly advertise themselves as "masculine bottom brothas" on their Internet profiles. They may play the stereotypically passive role during sex, they say, but they're just as much men, and just as aggressive, as DL tops. As one DL guy writes on his America Online profile, "Just 'cause I am a bottom, don't take me for a bitch."
Still, William says that many DL guys are in a never-ending search for the roughest, most masculine, "straightest looking" DL top. Both William and Christopher, who lost friends to AIDS, say they always use condoms. But as William explains: "Part of the attraction to thugs is that they're careless and carefree. Putting on a condom doesn't fit in with that. A lot of DL guys aren't going to put on a condom, because that ruins the fantasy." It also shatters the denial -- stopping to put on a condom forces guys on the DL to acknowledge, on some level, that they're having sex with men. 
In 1992, E. Lynn Harris -- then an unknown black writer -- self-published "Invisible Life," the fictional coming-of-age story of Raymond Tyler, a masculine young black man devoted to his girlfriend but consumed by his attraction to men. For Tyler, being black is hard enough; being black and gay seems a cruel and impossible proposition. Eventually picked up by a publisher, "Invisible Life" went on to sell nearly 500,000 copies, many purchased by black women shocked at the idea that black men who weren't effeminate could be having sex with men. 
"I was surprised by the reaction to my book," Harris said. "People were in such denial that black men could be doing this. Well, they were doing it then, and they're doing it now." 
That behavior has public health implications. A few years ago, the epidemiological data started rolling in, showing increasing numbers of black women who weren't IV drug users becoming infected with H.I.V. While some were no doubt infected by men who were using drugs, experts say many were most likely infected by men on the Down Low. Suddenly, says Chris Bell, a 29-year-old H.I.V.-positive black man from Chicago who often speaks at colleges about sexuality and AIDS, DL guys were being demonized. They became the "modern version of the highly sexually dangerous, irresponsible black man who doesn't care about anyone and just wants to get off." Bell and others say that while black men had been dying of AIDS for years, it wasn't until "innocent" black women became infected that the black community bothered to notice. 
For white people, Bell said, "DL life fit in perfectly with our society's simultaneous obsession and aversion to black male sexuality." But if the old stereotypes of black sexual aggression were resurrected, there was a significant shift: this time, white women were not cast as the innocent victims. Now it was black women and children. The resulting permutations confounded just about everyone, black and white, straight and gay. How should guys on the DL be regarded? Whose responsibility are they? Are they gay, straight or bisexual? If they are gay, why don't they just tough it up, come out and move to a big-city gay neighborhood like so many other gay men and lesbians? If they are straight, what are they doing having sex with guys in parks and bathhouses? If they are bisexual, why not just say that? Why, as the C.D.C. reported, are black men who have sex with men more than twice as likely to keep their sexual practices a secret than whites? Most important to many, why can't these black men at least get tested for H.I.V.?
The easy answer to most of these questions is that the black community is simply too homophobic: from womanizing rappers to moralizing preachers, much of the black community views homosexuality as a curse against a race with too many strikes against it. The white community, the conventional wisdom goes, is more accepting of its sexual minorities, leading to fewer double lives, less shame and less unsafe sex. (AIDS researchers point to shame and stigma as two of the driving forces spreading AIDS in America.)
But some scholars have come to doubt the reading of black culture as intrinsically more homophobic than white culture. "I think it's unfair to categorize it that way today, and it is absolutely not the case historically," says George Chauncey, the noted professor of gay and lesbian history at the University of Chicago. "Especially in the 1940's and 50's, when anti-gay attitudes were at their peak in white American society, black society was much more accepting. People usually expected their gay friends and relatives to remain discreet, but even so, it was better than in white society."
Glenn Ligon, a black visual artist who is openly gay, recalls that as a child coming of age in the 70's, he always felt there was a space in black culture for openly gay men. "It was a limited space, but it was there," he says. "After all, where else could we go? The white community wasn't that accepting of us. And the black community had to protect its own."
Ligon, whose artwork often deals with sexuality and race, thinks that the pressure to keep homosexuality on the DL does not come exclusively from other black people, but also from the social and economic realities particular to black men. "The reason that so many young black men aren't so cavalier about announcing their sexual orientation is because we need our families," he says. "We need our families because of economic reasons, because of racism, because of a million reasons. It's the idea that black people have to stick together, and if there's the slightest possibility that coming out could disrupt that, guys won't do it." (That may help explain why many ofthe black men who are openly gay tend to be more educated, have more money and generally have a greater sense of security.) 
But to many men on the DL, sociological and financial considerations are beside the point: they say they wouldn't come out even if they felt they could. They see black men who do come out either as having chosen their sexuality over their skin color or as being so effeminate that they wouldn't have fooled anyone anyway. In a black world that puts a premium on hypermasculinity, men who have sex with other men are particularly sensitive to not appearing soft in any way. Maybe that's why many guys on the DL don't go to gay bars. "Most of the guys I've messed around with, I've actually met at straight clubs," says D., a 21-year-old college student on the DL whom I met on the Internet, and then in person in New York City. "Guys will come up to me and ask me some stupid thing like, 'Yo, you got a piece of gum?' I'll say, 'Nah, but what's up?' Some guys will look at me and say, 'What do you mean, what's up?' but the ones on the DL will keep talking to me." Later he adds: "It's easier for me to date guys on the DL. Gay guys get too clingy, and they can blow your cover. Real DL guys, they have something to lose, too. It's just safer to be with someone who has something to lose."
D. says he prefers sex with women, but he sometimes has sex with men because he "gets bored." But even the DL guys I spoke with who say they prefer sex with men are adamant that the nomenclature of white gay culture has no relevance for them. "I'm masculine," as one 18-year-old college student from Providence, R.I., who is on the DL told me over the phone. "There's no way I'm gay." I asked him what his definition of gay is. "Gays are the faggots who dress, talk and act like girls. That's not me."
That kind of logic infuriates many mainstream gay people. To them, life on the DL is an elaborately rationalized repudiation of everything the gay rights movement fought for -- the right to live without shame and without fear of reprisal. It's a step back into the dark days before liberation, before gay-bashing was considered a crime, before gay television characters were considered family entertainment and way, way before the current Supreme Court ruled that gay people are "entitled to respect for their private lives." Emil Wilbekin, the black and openly gay editor in chief of Vibe magazine, has little patience for men on the DL. "To me, it's a dangerous cop-out," he says. "I get that it's sexy. I get that it's hot to see some big burly hip-hop kid who looks straight but sleeps with guys, but the bottom line is that it's dishonest. I think you have to love who you are, you have to have respect for yourself and others, and to me most men on the DL have none of those qualities. There's nothing 'sexy' about getting H.I.V., or giving it to your male and female lovers. That's not what being a real black man is about."
Though the issues being debated have life-and-death implications, the tenor of the debate owes much to the overcharged identity politics of the last two decades. As Chauncey points out, the assumption that anyone has to name their sexual behavior at all is relatively recent. "A lot of people look at these DL guys and say they must really be gay, no matter what they say about themselves, but who's to know?" he says. "In the early 1900's, many men in immigrant and African-American working-class communities engaged in sex with other men without being stigmatized as queer. But it's hard for people to accept that something that seems so intimate and inborn to them as being gay or straight isn't universal."
Whatever the case, most guys on the DL are well aware of the contempt with which their choices are viewed by many out gay men. And if there are some DL guys willing to take the risk -- to jeopardize their social and family standing by declaring their sexuality -- that contempt doesn't do much to convince them they'd ever really be welcome in Manhattan's Chelsea or on Fire Island. "Mainstream gay culture has created an alternative to mainstream culture," says John Peterson, a professor of psychology at Georgia State University who specializes in AIDS research among black men, "and many whites take advantage of that. They say, 'I will leave Podunk and I will go to the gay barrios of San Francisco and other cities, and I will go live there, be who I really am, and be part of the mainstream.' Many African-Americans say, 'I can't go and face the racism I will see there, and I can't create a functioning alternative society because I don't have the resources.' They're stuck." As Peterson, who says that the majority of black men who have sex with men are on the DL, boils it down, "The choice becomes, do I want to be discriminated against at home for my sexuality, or do I want to move away and be discriminated against for my skin color?" 
So increasing numbers of black men -- and, lately, other men of color who claim the DL identity -- split the difference. They've created a community of their own, a cultural "party" where whites aren't invited. "Labeling yourself as DL is a way to disassociate from everything white and upper class," says George Ayala, the director of education for AIDS Project Los Angeles. And that, he says, is a way for DL men to assert some power.
Still, for all the defiance that DL culture claims for itself, for all the forcefulness of the "never apologize, never explain" stance, a sense of shame can hover at the margins. It's the inevitable price of living a double life. Consider these last lines of a DL college student's online profile. "Lookin 4 cool ass brothers on tha down low. . . . You aint dl if you have a V.I.P. pass to tha gay spot. . . . You aint dl if you call ur dude 'gurl.' . . . Put some bass in ur voice yo and whats tha deal wit tha attitude? If I wanted a broad I would get one -- we both know what we doin is wrong."
The world headquarters of the Web site www.streetthugz.com is a small, nondescript storefront next to a leather bar on Cleveland's West Side. The site's founder, Rick Dickson, invites me to watch one of its live Web casts, which he says feature "the most masculine DL brothers in the world doing what they do best."
Rick opens the door holding a cigarette in one hand and a beer in the other. Inside, a group of young black men sit in a thick haze of cigarette smoke as the song "Bitch Better Have My Money" plays from a nearby stereo. By the far wall, two men type frantically on computer keyboards, participating in 30 chat-room conversations at once. Near the street-front window, which is covered by a red sheet, there are three muscular black men in their early 20's.
Rick sits down and lights another cigarette. A part-time comic who goes by the stage name Slick Rick, he has a shaved head, piercing green eyes and a light-skinned face with a default setting on mean. Twice a week, Rick's thugs, as he calls them, perform a sex show for anyone who cares to log on. Although less than a year old, the site has developed a devoted following, thanks mostly to chat-room word of mouth. "We're going to be the next Bill Gates of the Internet industry," he assures me. "We got black DL thugs getting it on, and that's what people want to see!"
One of the site's most popular stars is a tall, strikingly handsome 23-year-old former Division 1 basketball player, who goes by the name Jigga. When I first meet Jigga about 10 minutes before the show, he's naked, stretching and doing push-ups in an adjacent room as he peppers me with questions about journalism and sportswriting. "I want to be a sportswriter," he says. "Either that, or a lawyer. I love to argue." 
Unlike some of the other streetthugz stars who dropped out of school and hustle for money, Jigga says he comes from a close middle-class family and always did well academically. Considering all that, I ask him how he came to find himself here. "It's some extra cash," he says. "But mostly, it's 'cause I like the attention. What can I say? I'm vain." Jigga says he has sex with both men and women, but he doesn't label himself as bisexual. "I'm just freaky," he says with a smile. 
Like many guys on the DL, Jigga first connected to other DL men through phone personals lines, which still have certain advantages over Internet chat rooms. "You can tell a lot right away by a voice," he says later. "There are guys who naturally sound masculine, and then there's guys who are obviously trying to hide the fact that they're big girls."
At 10:07 p.m., seven minutes behind schedule, Rick announces, "It's show time at the Apollo." He unfolds a burgundy carpet that serves as the stage, and Jigga and two thugs take their places. The phone won't stop ringing as viewers call to make requests ("Can I talk to Jigga when he's done?"), and Rick answers each call with an enthusiastic reference to the caller's location. "Hey, we got Detroit in the house! Say wuzzup to Detroit!" 
The show temporarily goes "off air" when Chi, a 32-year-old promoter for the site, trips over the MegaCam's power cord. While someone else plugs it back in, he takes a seat on the sidelines. Thin and deceptively strong, Chi looks younger than his age. He has a tattoo on his left arm, which he tells me is a reminder of his gang days. Back then, he says, before he moved to Cleveland, his life was a disaster: he had three kids with three women and spent most of his 20's in jail for drug trafficking.
Chi says he doesn't deal drugs anymore -- not since his mother, a heroin addict, died with a needle in her arm. Today he works at a fast-food joint in a shopping-mall food court and is a talent scout for Rick, which means that if he spots a young black man with "the look" (tough, masculine and preferably with a wild streak), he'll ask him if he'd like to take some pictures for money -- or, better yet, act in one of the site's live sex shows. Chi has a fiancee he has been with for four years. 
When Rick has seen enough foreplay, he throws condoms at the boys. Rick has been making a big deal to me about how his site promotes safe sex, which he insists is a moral obligation at a time when so many young black men in America are dying of AIDS. But previous viewers of the show told me they didn't see condoms being used, and the site boasts of keeping everything "raw." I ask Rick about the discrepancy. "It's just an expression, man," he says, and explains that the sex is sometimes simulated. 
The actors seem somewhat bored, but the point, I gather, is not what they do on camera, but how they look. And these guys look straight -- in fact, they look as if they might rather be having sex with women. That, Rick knows, is the ultimate turn-on in much of the DL world, where the sexual icon is the tough unemotional gangster thug.
"Do these guys ever kiss?" I ask Rick.
"Well," he explains, "thugs don't really kiss. Sometimes they stick their tongues in each other's mouths, but it's not really kissing. Gay people kiss. DL thugs don't kiss."
In May 1986, Sandra Singleton McDonald showed up at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, eager to begin her research into diseases affecting blacks in the South.
"Well," said a young research assistant there, "then you'll want to look into AIDS."
McDonald laughed. "Baby, you must have misunderstood my question," she said in her loving, motherly voice. "I'm talking about African-American diseases."
"Yes, I know," the man said. "Like I said, you'll want to look into AIDS."
McDonald did, and what she learned floored her. "This wasn't just a gay, white man's disease like we had all been told from the beginning," recalls McDonald, the founder of Outreach Inc., an Atlanta-based nonprofit organization providing services to those affected by AIDS and substance abuse in the city's black communities. "I went out and told leaders in the black community that we needed to start dealing with this now, and they looked at me like I was crazy. People were outraged that I was even bringing this up. They said, 'Oh, be quiet, that's a white problem.' But why would we think that a sexually transmitted disease would stay within one racial group, or within one geographic area? It made no sense. The public health community made a lot of mistakes and gave out a lot of wrong information. Once we became aware of the impact of the disease, we did a lot of blaming and shaming so that we could feel O.K. and say, 'This isn't about us.' "
Five years later, that fiction ceased to be viable when Magic Johnson told a national television audience that he was H.I.V.-positive. AIDS organizations were flooded with calls from panicked black men and women wanting to know more about the disease. Meanwhile, Magic dismissed the rumors that he'd slept with men during his N.B.A. career, insisting he didn't get infected through homosexual sex, but rather through sex with a woman. Young black men on inner-city basketball courts weren't so sure. They wondered if maybe Magic had men on the side. 
That it took Johnson's announcement to introduce the reality of AIDS to the black community goes to the depth of the denial around the disease. By 1991, 35,990 African-American men had been reported with AIDS (roughly half having contracted it through sexual intercourse), accounting for about a quarter of all AIDS cases in America. But while there was a mass mobilization around AIDS in the early 80's among gay white men, there was no similar movement among black men with AIDS, black leaders, politicians, clergy or civil rights organizations. "There was a real sense in black communities that you had to put your best face forward in order to prove that you deserve equal rights and equal status, and that face didn't include gays and IV drug users with AIDS," says Cathy Cohen, author of "The Boundaries of Blackness: AIDS and the Breakdown of Black Politics." "It's been a very slow process for the black leadership in America to own up to this disease. Not acknowledge it in passing, but own it."
Black churches, which are the heart of many African-American communities, were particularly slow to respond to the crisis, and many still haven't, even despite the disease's ravages within their parishes. In 1999, after female congregants of Cleveland's Antioch Baptist Church told their pastor that they were H.I.V.-positive, the church started an AIDS ministry that has been applauded for its courage and effectiveness. Still, the black church -- like many in white America -- is careful not to condone homosexual behavior. "Some gays want a flat-out, standing-on-the-tower affirmation from the church that the gay lifestyle, or the lifestyle of whoring around with men, is acceptable," says Kelvin Berry, the director of the Antioch program. "And that's not going to happen."
Combating AIDS in these communities also means confronting popular conspiracy theories that claim that H.I.V. was created by the U.S. government to kill black people. One study in the 90's by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference found that 54 percent of blacks thought H.I.V. testing was a trick to infect them with AIDS. In the early 90's, the rapper Kool Moe Dee and Spike Lee expressed concern that H.I.V. was a part of a calculated campaign intended to rid the world of gay men and minorities, and as recently as 1999, Will Smith told Vanity Fair that "possibly AIDS was created as a result of biological-warfare testing."
Pernessa C. Seele, founder and C.E.O. of the Balm in Gilead, an international AIDS organization that works with black churches, explained, "For the most part, we don't want to get tested, and we don't want to get treatment, because we really believe that the system is designed to kill us." She continued: "And our history allows us, or helps us, to believe that. We have documented history where these kinds of diseases have been perpetuated on us. And that's why it's so important for the church to get involved. Black people trust the church. We don't trust health care. We don't trust doctors and nurses, but we trust the church. So when the church says, 'Get tested,' when the church says, 'Take your medicine,' people will do it."
Other black AIDS organizations are focused on prevention. In some cases, the strategies are straightforward: push condoms, distribute clean needles. But reaching men on the DL is difficult. James L. King, a publishing executive, spoke about his former DL life at a National Conference on African-Americans and AIDS. "I sleep with men, but I am not bisexual, and I am certainly not gay," King said. "I am not going to your clinics, I am not going to read your brochures, I am not going to get tested. I assure you that none of the brothers on the Down Low are paying the least bit of attention to what you say." 
Earl Pike, executive director of the AIDS Task Force of Cleveland, agrees that many of the prevention messages aimed at black men have been unsuccessful. "Up to this point, we've failed to make a convincing case to young black men about why they should listen to us when we tell them to put on a condom, mostly because we've had the wrong people delivering the wrong kind of message," he says. "The usual prevention message for all these years can be interpreted as saying: 'Gee, we're sorry about racism. We're sorry about homophobia in your homes and churches. We're sorry that urban schools are crappy. We're sorry that you can't find a good job. We're sorry about lack of literacy. We're sorry about all these things, but you really need to start using condoms, because if you don't, you could get infected tomorrow, or next year, or some point during the next decade, and if you do get infected, at some point, you could get sick and die.' "
Many AIDS organizations now say that frank, sexy prevention messages that use the masculine imagery of hip-hop culture are the only way to reach men on the DL. In St. Louis, for example, a $64,000 federal grant financed a billboard campaign -- depicting two muscular, shirtless black men embracing -- aimed at raising AIDS awareness. But Mayor Francis Slay called the billboards inappropriate and ordered them taken down. 
"I need a beer," Chi says as we drive through downtown Cleveland on a Saturday night, looking for something to do. It's been three months since I last saw him at the streetthugz.com filming. As we stop at a red light, he turns to get a better look at a young Hispanic woman in the car next to us. "That girl is beautiful," he says. "But she needs to lose the car. What a shame -- a beautiful woman driving a Neon!"
Chi loves women. He also likes men, although, like many guys on the DL, he doesn't verbalize his attraction to them, even when he's with like-minded people. When I ask him about this, he's stumped to explain why. "I don't know," he says. "Maybe it's because being black, you just learn to keep that to yourself." Anyway, he always had a girlfriend. "Guys were there for sex."
Unlike many other DL guys, who never tell anyone about their private lives, Chi opens up with little prompting. He says that he loves his fiancee but that he doesn't consider the sex he has with men to be cheating. "Guys are a totally different thing."
Unbeknown to his fiancee, he has been casually dating his male roommate for several months. "I told her that he's gay and makes passes at me," he says, "but she doesn't know we have sex." On some level, Chi says he feels bad about the deception. Right now, though, he isn't feeling guilty. His fiancee just called to tell him that she's going out tonight -- and that he needs to come over to pick up their feisty 1-year-old son.
"She just wants to go out and shake her groove thing with her friends instead of taking care of him like she said she would," Chi says. "Man, she's selfish sometimes. I love her, but sometimes I hate her, you know what I'm saying?"
We pull up to Chi's apartment, where his fiancee and two of her friends are waiting for him in the driveway. Inside the apartment, the couple argue about whose turn it is to take care of their son while I sit in the dining room and watch him fearlessly attack the four house cats. In the dark living room, Chi's roommate, who is white, lounges on the couch in blue boxers, chain-smoking as he half-watches television. 
Chi's fiancee eventually leaves, after which Chi changes out of his work shirt and mixes a drink for the road. "We've been on shaky ground," Chi tells me, referring to his roommate. "He loves me, but I'm committed to someone else. I think he has problems dealing with that. Like I tell him, 'I care about you, but I can't be that guy you want.' " What Chi means, I think, is that he can't be gay.
Chi puts his son in the back seat of the car, and we drive toward Dominos, a black gay bar where we're supposed to meet Jigga. Chi spends most of the ride complaining about his fiancee. His son finally starts crying and kicks the back of Chi's seat. "Yeah, defend yo mama!" Chi says, laughing.
They wait in the car as I walk into Dominos looking for Jigga. The long, rectangular-shaped bar is packed with regulars tonight, mostly middle-aged black men -- some openly gay, others on the DL -- and a few tough-looking younger guys. Jigga spots me first and waves me over to the bar. He tells me a lot has changed since the first time I met him. He's in law school now and has put aside the sportswriter idea. And while he is still on the DL (his co-workers and most of his straight friends don't know he likes guys), he has a serious boyfriend who is also on the DL.
Four months ago, having a serious boyfriend would have been inconceivable to him. "I think I love this dude," he tells me as we walk to the car. "He's got a lot of attitude, but I kind of like that. We have fistfights all the time, and we don't stop until somebody has blood. Then we have sex." Jigga laughs as he opens the car door. "But I must really love him, because I never got in fistfights with any of my exes."
I'm about to question his definition of love when Chi interjects. "I still need a beer," he says, pointing the way toward a nearby gas station. We pull into a tight parking spot, careful to avoid the young black man with a sideways baseball cap who leans into the car next to us, blocking Chi's passenger-side door. "Move your ass," Chi says, knocking the kid out of the way with the car door. The boy laughs it off, avoiding a possible confrontation.
"I think I hooked up with him," Jigga says, craning his neck from the back seat to get a better look at the kid. "Actually, nah, that's not him. Looks like him, though."
Recently, Jigga told his parents that he's interested in both guys and girls. "I was drunk when I told them," he says. "But I'm glad I did. They've been really cool about it." It takes me a few seconds to process the words. Really cool about it? In six months of talking to young black gay and DL men, I found that Jigga is one of the few who told his parents, and the only one who reported unconditional acceptance. "I'm blessed," he says. "I realize that. Black parents don't accept their gay kids. Black culture doesn't accept gay people. Why do you think so many people are on the DL?"
Jigga is proof that being on the DL isn't necessarily a lifelong identity. He seems considerably more comfortable with his sexuality than he was the first time I met him, and I suspect that soon enough, he may be openly gay in all facets of his life without losing his much-coveted masculinity. I tell him what I'm thinking. "Who knows, man?" he says. "Two years ago, I wouldn't have believed that I'd be having sex with guys." Chi opens the car door, cradling a six-pack of beer. "I love beer," he says, smiling. As we drive away, he checks out a young woman stepping out of a nearby Honda Civic. "Damn, that girl is fine!"

HEADLINE: The Probability That a Real-Estate Agent Is Cheating You (and Other Riddles of Modern Life) 

BYLINE:  By Stephen J. Dubner; Stephen J. Dubner is the author, most recently, of "Confessions of a Hero-Worshiper." He is writing a book about the psychology of money.

 BODY:
The most brilliant young economist in America -- the one so deemed, at least, by a jury of his elders -- brakes to a stop at a traffic light on Chicago's south side. It is a sunny day in mid-June. He drives an aging green Chevy Cavalier with a dusty dashboard and a window that doesn't quite shut, producing a dull roar at highway speeds.
 But the car is quiet for now, as are the noontime streets: gas stations, boundless concrete, brick buildings with plywood windows. 
 An elderly homeless man approaches. It says he is homeless right on his sign, which also asks for money. He wears a torn jacket, too heavy for the warm day, and a grimy red baseball cap. 
The economist doesn't lock his doors or inch the car forward. Nor does he go scrounging for spare change. He just watches, as if through one-way glass. After a while, the homeless man moves along.
"He had nice headphones," says the economist, still watching in the rearview mirror. "Well, nicer than the ones I have. Otherwise, it doesn't look like he has many assets."
Steven Levitt tends to see things differently than the average person. Differently, too, than the average economist. This is either a wonderful trait or a troubling one, depending on how you feel about economists. The average economist is known to wax oracularly about any and all monetary issues. But if you were to ask Levitt his opinion of some standard economic matter, he would probably swipe the hair from his eyes and plead ignorance. "I gave up a long time ago pretending that I knew stuff I didn't know," he says. "I mean, I just -- I just don't know very much about the field of economics. I'm not good at math, I don't know a lot of econometrics, and I also don't know how to do theory. If you ask me about whether the stock market's going to go up or down, if you ask me whether the economy's going to grow or shrink, if you ask me whether deflation's good or bad, if you ask me about taxes -- I mean, it would be total fakery if I said I knew anything about any of those things."
In Levitt's view, economics is a science with excellent tools for gaining answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions. His particular gift is the ability to ask such questions. For instance: If drug dealers make so much money, why do they still live with their mothers? Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What really caused crime rates to plunge during the past decade? Do real-estate agents have their clients' best interests at heart? Why do black parents give their children names that may hurt their career prospects? Do schoolteachers cheat to meet high-stakes testing standards? Is sumo wrestling corrupt?
And how does a homeless man afford $50 headphones? 
Many people -- including a fair number of his peers -- might not recognize Levitt's work as economics at all. But he has merely distilled the so-called dismal science down to its most primal aim: explaining how people get what they want, or need. Unlike most academics, he is unafraid of using personal observations and curiosities (though he does fear calculus). He is an intuitionist. He sifts through a pile of data to find a story that no one else had found. He devises a way to measure an effect that veteran economists had declared unmeasurable. His abiding interests -- though he says he has never trafficked in them himself -- are cheating, corruption and crime. 
His interest in the homeless man's headphones, meanwhile, didn't last long. "Maybe," he said later, "it was just testimony to the fact I'm too disorganized to buy a set of headphones that I myself covet."
Levitt is the first to say that some of his topics border on the trivial. But he has proved to be such an ingenious researcher and clear-eyed thinker that instead of being consigned to the fringe of his field, the opposite has happened: he has shown other economists just how well their tools can make sense of the real world. 
"Levitt is considered a demigod, one of the most creative people in economics and maybe in all social science," says Colin Camerer, an economist at the California Institute of Technology. "He represents something that everyone thinks they will be when they go to grad school in econ, but usually they have the creative spark bored out of them by endless math -- namely, a kind of intellectual detective trying to figure stuff out."
Levitt is a populist in a field that is undergoing a bout of popularization. Undergraduates are swarming the economics departments of elite universities. Economics is seen as the ideal blend of intellectual prestige (it does offer a Nobel, after all) and practical training for a high-flying finance career (unless, like Levitt, you choose to stay in academia). At the same time, economics is ever more visible in the real world, thanks to the continuing fetishization of the stock market and the continuing fixation with Alan Greenspan. 
The greatest change, however, is within the scholarly ranks. Microeconomists are gaining on the macro crowd, empiricists gaining on the theorists. Behavioral economists have called into doubt the very notion of "homo economicus," the supposedly rational decision-maker in each of us. Young economists of every stripe are more inclined to work on real-world subjects and dip into bordering disciplines -- psychology, criminology, sociology, even neurology -- with the intent of rescuing their science from its slavish dependence upon mathematical models.
Levitt fits everywhere and nowhere. He is a noetic butterfly that no one has pinned down -- he was once offered a job on the Clinton economic team, and the Bush campaign approached him about being a crime adviser -- but who is widely appreciated.
"Steve isn't really a behavioral economist, but they'd be happy to have him," says Austan Goolsbee, who teaches economics at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business. "He's not really an old price-theory guy, but these Chicago guys are happy to claim him. He's not really a Cambridge guy" -- although Levitt went to Harvard and then M.I.T. -- "but they'd love him to come back."
He has critics, to be sure. Daniel Hamermesh, a prominent labor economist at the University of Texas, has taught Levitt's paper "The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime" to his undergraduates. "I've gone over this paper in draft, in its printed version, at great length, and for the life of me I can't see anything wrong with it," Hamermesh says. "On the other hand, I don't believe a word of it. And his stuff on sumo wrestlers -- well, this is not exactly fundamental, unless you're Japanese and weigh 500 pounds."
But at 36, Levitt is a full professor in the University of Chicago's economics department, the most legendary program in the country. (He received tenure after only two years.) He is an editor of The Journal of Political Economy, a leading journal in the field. And the American Economic Association recently awarded him its John Bates Clark Medal, given biennially to the country's best economist under 40.
He is a prolific and diverse writer. But his paper linking a rise in abortion to a drop in crime has made more noise than the rest combined. Levitt and his co-author, John Donohue of Stanford Law School, argued that as much as 50 percent of the huge drop in crime since the early 1990's can be traced to Roe v. Wade. Their thinking goes like this: the women most likely to seek an abortion -- poor, single, black or teenage mothers -- were the very women whose children, if born, have been shown most likely to become criminals. But since those children weren't born, crime began to decrease during the years they would have entered their criminal prime. In conversation, Levitt reduces the theory to a tidy syllogism: "Unwantedness leads to high crime; abortion leads to less unwantedness; abortion leads to less crime."
Levitt had already published widely about crime and punishment. One paper he wrote as a graduate student is still regularly cited. His question was disarmingly simple: Do more police translate into less crime? The answer would seem obvious -- yes -- but had never been proved: since the number of police officers tends to rise along with the number of crimes, the effectiveness of the police was tricky to measure.
Levitt needed a mechanism that would unlink the crime rate from police hiring. He found it within politics. He noticed that mayors and governors running for re-election often hire more police officers. By measuring those police increases against crime rates, he was able to determine that additional officers do indeed bring down violent crime. 
That paper was later disputed -- another graduate student found a serious mathematical mistake in it -- but Levitt's ingenuity was obvious. He began to be acknowledged as a master of the simple, clever solution. He was the guy who, in the slapstick scene, sees all theengineers futzing with a broken machine -- and then realizes that no one has thought to plug it in.
Arguing that the police help deter crime didn't make Levitt any enemies. Arguing that abortion deterred crime was another matter. 
In the abortion paper, published in 2001, he and Donohue warned that their findings should not be seen "as either an endorsement of abortion or a call for intervention by the state in the fertility decisions of women." They suggested that crime might just as easily be curbed by "providing better environments for those children at greatest risk for future crime."
Still, the very topic managed to offend nearly everyone. Conservatives were enraged that abortion could be construed as a crime-fighting tool. Liberals were aghast that poor and black women were singled out. Economists grumbled that Levitt's methodology was not sound. A syllogism, after all, can be a magic trick: All cats die; Socrates died; therefore Socrates was a cat.
"I think he's enormously clever in so many areas, focusing very much on the issue of reverse causality," says Ted Joyce, an economist at Baruch College who has written a critical response to the abortion paper. "But in this case I think he ignored it, or didn't tend to it well enough."
As the news media gorged on the abortion-crime story, Levitt came under direct assault. He was called an ideologue (by conservatives and liberals alike), a eugenicist, a racist and downright evil.
In reality, he seems to be very much none of those. He has little taste for politics and less for moralizing. He is genial, low-key and unflappable, confident but not cocky. He is a respected teacher and colleague; he is a sought-after collaborator who, because of the breadth of his curiosities, often works with scholars outside his field -- another rarity for an economist. 
"I hesitate to use these words, but Steve is a con man, in the best sense," says Sudhir Venkatesh, a sociologist at Columbia University. "He's the Shakespearean jester. He'll make you believe his ideas were yours." Venkatesh was Levitt's co-author on "An Economic Analysis of a Drug-Selling Gang's Finances," which found that the average street dealer lives with his mother because the take-home pay is, frankly, terrible. The paper analyzed one crack gang's financial activities as if it were any corporation. (It was Venkatesh who procured the data, from a former gang member.) Such a thing had never been tried. "This lack of focus," Levitt deadpanned in one version of the paper, "is perhaps partly attributable to the fact that few economists have been involved in the study of gangs."
Levitt speaks with a boyish lisp. His appearance is High Nerd: a plaid button-down shirt, nondescript khakis and a braided belt, sensible shoes. His pocket calendar is branded with the National Bureau of Economic Research logo. "I wish he would get more than three haircuts a year," his wife, Jeannette, says, "and that he wasn't still wearing the same glasses he got 15 years ago, which weren't even in fashion then." He was a good golfer in high school but has so physically atrophied that he calls himself "the weakest human being alive" and asks Jeannette to open jars around the house. 
There is nothing in his appearance or manner, in other words, that suggests a flamethrower. He will tell you that all he does is sit at his desk, day and night, wrestling with some strange mountain of data. He will tell you that he would do it free (his salary is reportedly more than $200,000), and you tend to believe him. He may be an accidental provocateur, but he is a provocateur nonetheless.
He takes particular delight in catching wrongdoers. In one paper, he devised a set of algorithms that could identify teachers in the Chicago public-school system who were cheating. "Cheating classrooms will systematically differ from other classrooms along a number of dimensions," he and his co-author, Brian Jacob of the Kennedy School of Government, wrote in "Catching Cheating Teachers." "For instance, students in cheating classrooms are likely to experience unusually large test-score gains in the year of the cheating, followed by unusually small gains or even declines in the following year when the boost attributable to cheating disappears."
Levitt used test-score data from the Chicago schools that had long been available to other researchers. There were a number of ways, he realized, that a teacher could cheat. If she were particularly brazen (and stupid), she might give students the correct answers. Or, after the test, she might actually erase students' wrong answers and fill in correct ones. A sophisticated cheater would be careful to avoid conspicuous blocks of identical answers. But Levitt was more sophisticated. "The first step in analyzing suspicious strings is to estimate the probability each child would give a particular answer on each question," he wrote. "This estimation is done using a multinomial logit framework with past test scores, demographics and socioeconomic characteristics as explanatory variables."
So by measuring any number of factors -- the difficulty of a particular question, the frequency with which students got hard questions right and easy ones wrong, the degree to which certain answers were highly correlated in one classroom -- Levitt identified which teachers he thought were cheating. (Perhaps just as valuable, he was also able to identify the good teachers.) The Chicago school system, rather than disputing Levitt's findings, invited him into the schools for retesting. As a result, the cheaters were fired. 
Then there is his coming "Understanding Why Crime Fell in the 1990's: Four Factors That Explain the Decline and Seven That Do Not." The entire drop in crime, Levitt says, was due to more police officers, more prisoners, the waning crack epidemic and Roe v. Wade. 
One factor that probably didn't make a difference, he argues, was the innovative policing strategy trumpeted in New York by Rudolph Giuliani and William Bratton.
"I think," Levitt says, "I'm pretty much alone in saying that."
He comes from a Minneapolis family of high, if unusual, achievers. His father, a medical researcher, is considered a leading authority on intestinal gas. (He bills himself as "The Man Who Gave Status to Flatus and Class to Gas.") One of Levitt's great uncles, Robert May, wrote "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" -- the book, that is; another great uncle, Johnny Marks, later wrote the song.
At Harvard, Levitt wrote his senior thesis on thoroughbred breeding and graduated summa cum laude. (He is still obsessed with horse racing. He says he believes it is corrupt and has designed a betting system -- the details of which he will not share -- to take advantage of the corruption.) He worked for two years as a management consultant before enrolling at M.I.T. for a doctorate in economics. The M.I.T. program was famous for its mathematical intensity. Levitt had taken exactly one math course as an undergraduate and had forgotten even that. During his first graduate class, he asked the student next to him about a formula on the board: Is there any difference between the derivative sign that's straight up-and-down and the curly one? "You are in so much trouble," he was told.
"People wrote him off," recalls Austan Goolsbee, the Chicago economist who was then a classmate. "They'd say, 'That guy has no future."'
Levitt set his own course. Other grad students stayed up all night working on problem sets, trying to make good grades. He stayed up researching and writing. "My view was that the way you succeed in this profession is you write great papers," he says. "So I just started."
Sometimes he would begin with a question. Sometimes it was a set of data that caught his eye. He spent one entire summer typing into his computer the results of years' worth of Congressional elections. (Today, with so much information so easily available on the Internet, Levitt complains that he can't get his students to input data at all.) All he had was a vague curiosity about why incumbents were so often re-elected. 
Then he happened upon a political-science book whose authors claimed that money wins elections, period. "They were trying to explain election outcomes as a function of campaign expenditures," he recalls, "completely ignoring the fact that contributors will only give money to challengers when they have a realistic chance of winning, and incumbents only spend a lot when they have a chance of losing. They convinced themselves this was the causal story even though it's so obvious in retrospect that it's a spurious effect."
Obvious, at least, to Levitt. Within five minutes, he had a vision of the paper he would write. "It came to me," he says, "in full bloom."
The problem was that his data couldn't tell him who was a good candidate and who wasn't. It was therefore impossible to tease out the effect of the money. As with the police/crime rate puzzle, he had to trick the data.
Because he himself had typed in the data, he had noticed something: often, the same two candidates faced each other multiple times. By analyzing the data from only those elections, Levitt was able to find a true result. His conclusion: campaign money has about one-tenth the impact as was commonly accepted. 
An unknown graduate student, he sent his paper to The Journal of Political Economy -- one professor told him he was crazy for even trying -- where it was published. He completed his Ph.D. in three years, but because of his priorities, he says, he was "invisible" to the faculty, "a real zero." Then he stumbled upon what he now calls the turning point in his career. 
He had an interview for the Society of Fellows, the venerable intellectual Harvard clubhouse that pays young scholars to do their own work, for three years, with no commitments. Levitt felt he didn't stand a chance. For starters, he didn't consider himself an intellectual. He would be interviewed over dinner by the senior fellows, a collection of world-renowned philosophers, scientists and historians. He worried he wouldn't have enough conversation for even the first course.
Instead, he was on fire. Whatever subject came up -- the brain, ants, philosophy -- he just happened to remember something pithy he'd read. His wit crackled as it had never crackled before. When he told them about the two summers he spent betting the horses back in Minnesota, they ate it up! 
Finally -- disquietingly -- one of them said: "I'm having a hard time seeing the unifying theme of your work. Could you explain it?"
Levitt was stymied. He had no idea what his unifying theme was, or if he even had one.
Amartya Sen, the future Nobel-winning economist, jumped in and neatly summarized what he saw as Levitt's theme.
Yes, Levitt said eagerly, that's my theme. 
Another fellow then offered another theme.
You're right, Levitt said, that's my theme.
And so it went, like dogs tugging at a bone, until the philosopher Robert Nozick interrupted. If Levitt could have been said to have an intellectual hero, it would be Nozick.
"How old are you, Steve?" he asked.
"Twenty-six."
Nozick turned to the other fellows: "He's 26 years old. Why does he need to have a unifying theme? Maybe he's going to be one of those people who's so talented he doesn't need one. He'll take a question and he'll just answer it, and it'll be fine."
The University of Chicago's economics department had a famous unifying theme -- the Gospel of Free Markets, with a conservative twist -- and would therefore not have seemed the most likely fit for Levitt. As he sees it, Chicago is about theory, deep thinking and big ideas, while he is about empiricism, clever thinking and "cute but ultimately insubstantial ideas."
But Chicago also had Gary Becker. To Levitt, Becker is the most influential economist of the past 50 years. Long before it was fashionable, Becker brought microeconomic theory to offbeat topics, the family and crime in particular. For years, Becker was demonized -- a single phrase like "the price of children" would set off untold alarms. "I took a lot of heat over my career from people who thought my work was silly or irrelevant or not economics," Becker says. But Chicago supported him; he persevered, winning the Nobel Prize in 1992; and he became Steven Levitt's role model.
Becker told Levitt that Chicago would be a great environment for him. "Not everybody agrees with all your results," he said, "but we agree what you're doing is very interesting work, and we'll support you in that."
Levitt soon found that the support at Chicago went beyond the scholarly. The year after he was hired, his wife gave birth to their first child, Andrew. One day, just after Andrew turned a year old, he came down with a slight fever. The doctor diagnosed an ear infection. When he started vomiting the next morning, his parents took him to the hospital. A few days later he was dead of pneumococcal meningitis.
Amid the shock and grief, Levitt had an undergraduate class that needed teaching. It was Gary Becker -- a Nobel laureate nearing his 70th birthday -- who sat in for him. Another colleague, D. Gale Johnson, sent a condolence card that Levitt still quotes from memory. 
Levitt and Johnson, an agricultural economist in his 80's, began speaking regularly. Levitt learned that Johnson's daughter was one of the first Americans to adopt a daughter from China. Soon the Levitts adopted a daughter of their own, whom they named Amanda. In addition to Amanda, they have since had a daughter, now almost 3, and a son. But Andrew's death has played on, in various ways. They have become close friends with the family of the little girl to whom they donated Andrew's liver. (They also donated his heart, but that baby died.) And not surprisingly for a scholar who pursues real-life subjects, the death also informed Levitt's work. 
He and Jeannette joined a support group for grieving parents. Levitt was struck by how many children had drowned in swimming pools. They were the kinds of deaths that don't make the newspaper -- unlike, for instance, a child who dies while playing with a gun. 
Levitt was curious and went looking for numbers that would tell the story. He wrote up the results as an op-ed article for The Chicago Sun-Times. It featured the sort of plangent counterintuition for which he has become famous: "If you own a gun and have a swimming pool in the yard, the swimming pool is almost 100 times more likely to kill a child than the gun is."
Trying to get his mind off death, Levitt took up a hobby: rehabbing and selling old houses in Oak Park, where he lives. This experience has led to yet another paper, about the real-estate market. It is his most Chicago-style paper yet, a romp in price theory, a sign that the university's influence on him is perhaps as strong as his influence on it. But Levitt being Levitt, it also deals with corruption.
While negotiating to buy old houses, he found that the seller's agent often encouraged him, albeit cagily, to underbid. This seemed odd: didn't the agent represent the seller's best interest? Then he thought more about the agent's role. Like many other "experts" (auto mechanics and stockbrokers come to mind), a real-estate agent is thought to know his field far better than a lay person. A homeowner is encouraged to trust the agent's information. So if the agent brings in a low offer and says it might just be the best the homeowner can expect, the homeowner tends to believe him. But the key, Levitt determined, lay in the fact that agents "receive only a small share of the incremental profit when a house sells for a higher value." Like a stockbroker churning commissions or a bookie grabbing his vig, an agent was simply looking to make a deal, any deal. So he would push homeowners to sell too fast and too cheap.
Now if Levitt could only measure this effect. Once again, he found a clever mechanism. Using data from more than 50,000 home sales in Cook County, Ill., he compared the figures for homes owned by real-estate agents with those for homes for which they acted only as agents. The agents' homes stayed on the market about 10 days longer and sold for 2 percent more.
Late on a summer afternoon, Levitt is in his office, deep inside one of the university's Gothic behemoths. The ceiling is stained, the plaster around the window crumbling. He is just back from sabbatical at Stanford, and his desk is a holy mess: stacks of books and journals, a green sippy cup and a little orange squeeze hippo.
This is his afternoon to meet with students. Levitt drinks a Mountain Dew and talks softly. Some students come for research assignments, some for advice. One has just written her undergraduate thesis: "The Labor Market Consequence of Graduating College in a Bad Economy." For a thesis, Levitt tells her, it's very good. But now she wants to have it published.
"You write like a college student, and that's a problem," he says. "The thing is, you're telling a story. There's foreshadowing going on, all those tricks. You want the reader going down a particular path so when they get the results, they understand them and believe them. But you also want to be honest about your weaknesses. People are much less harsh on weaknesses that are clear than weaknesses that are hidden -- as they should be."
Be honest about your weaknesses. Has there ever been a prize-winning scholar as honest about his weaknesses as Steven Levitt? He doesn't understand economics, he claims, or math. He's a little thinker in a world of big thinkers. He can't even open a jar of spaghetti sauce at home, poor guy.
Friends say that Levitt's self-deprecation is as calculated as it is genuine. Within academia, economists take pride in being the most cutthroat of a cutthroat breed. Anyone who writes papers on "Weakest Link" (contestants discriminate against Latino and elderly peers, Levitt concluded, but not blacks or women) and sumo (to best manage their tournament rankings, wrestlers often conspire to throw matches) had better not also be arrogant.
Or maybe it is not self-deprecation at all. Maybe it is self-flagellation. Maybe what Steven Levitt really wants is to graduate from his "silly" and "trivial" and "shallow" topics.
He thinks he's onto something with a new paper about black names. He wanted to know if someone with a distinctly black name suffers an economic penalty. His answer -- contrary to other recent research -- is no. But now he has a bigger question: Is black culture a cause of racial inequality or is it a consequence? For an economist, even for Levitt, this is new turf -- "quantifying culture," he calls it. As a task, he finds it thorny, messy, perhaps impossible and deeply tantalizing.
Driving home to Oak Park that evening, his Cavalier glumly thrumming along the Eisenhower Expressway, he dutifully addresses his future. Leaving academia for a hedge fund or a government job does not interest him (though he might, on the side, start a company to catch cheating teachers). He is said to be at the top of every economics department's poaching list. But the tree he and Jeannette planted when Andrew died is getting too big to move. You get the feeling he may stay at Chicago awhile. 
There are important problems, he says, that he feels ready to address. 
For instance? "Tax evasion. Money-laundering. I'd like to put together a set of tools that lets us catch terrorists. I mean, that's the goal. I don't necessarily know yet how I'd go about it. But given the right data, I have little doubt that I could figure out the answer."
It might seem absurd for an economist to dream of catching terrorists. Just as it must have seemed absurd if you were a Chicago schoolteacher, called into an office and told that, ahem, the algorithms designed by that skinny man with thick glasses had determined that you are a cheater. And that you are being fired. Steven Levitt may not fully believe in himself, but he does believe in this: teachers and criminals and real-estate agents may lie, and politicians, and even C.I.A. analysts. But numbers don't.

 BODY:
The tangled relationship of art, illusion and the marketplace being what it is -- anongoing melodrama, set to the strains of keening violins -- it so happened that 250 tuxedoed, gowned and bejeweled members of the patronage class showed up for an Italianate palace ball one night this spring at a defunct train station in a Jersey City marsh. Guests were met at the gate by a young man in a pleated skirt, pointy black slippers and a frilly blouse under a gold brocaded vest, who bowed theatrically and said, "Buona notte, signori e signore." The title of the ball was Palazzo di Cremona, and the domed terminal of the Central Railroad of New Jersey was done up for the evening with garlands of citrus leaves and blood oranges. Three former governors of New Jersey were present, along with Paolo Bodini, mayor of Cremona, Italy, a 2,300-year-old town north of Milan. Cremona occupies a status among violin aficionados akin to that of Detroit among car buffs, having been the ground on which such violin-making luminaries as Niccolo Amati, Giuseppe Guarneri and, above all, Antonio Stradivari thrived. Mayor Bodini was a guest of the evening's honorees, an elderly couple named Evelyn and Herbert Axelrod, who had gained vast wealth by addressing themselves to the needs of caretakers of guppies, goldfish, parakeets, lizards, gerbils and the like, and who elicited, throughout the evening, comparison to the beneficent Medicis of Florence. 
 For a price, the Axelrods had lavished on the Newark-based New Jersey Symphony Orchestra a collection of 30 stringed instruments from the 17th and 18th centuries. They claimed to have spurned an offer of $55 million for these same strings from the esteemed Vienna Philharmonic and were said, further, to have rejected entreaties from the New York Philharmonic, the orchestral Goliath in whose shadow the Jersey players languish. Instead, the Axelrods opted to accept an almost symbolic offering of $18 million from New Jersey -- a cut-rate price that nonetheless exceeds the orchestra's entire annual budget. 
 The dinner guests repaired to the train station's south baggage room for a $2,500-a-head inaugural hearing of the new strings. The musicians paraded down the center aisle of the room like members of a wedding party. Zdenek Macal, the 67-year-old Czech-born conductor who has been the orchestra's music director for the past 10 years, mounted the stage, brought down his baton and directed his players to dig into a dance from Respighi's "Ancient Airs and Dances." Bows were drawn across strings. Chords bounced around the walls. It sounded good. The concert continued with three movements of Mozart and wrapped up with a selection from Tchaikovsky's "Serenade for Strings." The players sawed away at their instruments with vigor. The baggage room was awash in rich sonority. Only a moment or two of screechiness intruded. The audience rose to its feet, cheering, before the music ended. The event grossed $700,000.
What did Herbert Axelrod think? "Awesome," he said. "You could see the players were turned on. They were all really vibrating."
The object in question -- the Stradivarius violin, of which some 600 remain on earth -- is, fundamentally, a splendidly carved wooden box. Its proportions are reminiscent of some long-lost ideal of the feminine torso: narrow, gently sloping shoulders, pinched waist and flaring hips. The top of the box is usually Norway spruce; the bottom, Bosnian maple. Some ascribe the object's magical sonic attributes to its varnish, the chemical constituents of which remain indeterminate. Although its design has been imitated for 300 years -- there is, at present, a bustling Chinese trade in making cheap instruments that are faithful to the original -- authentic Stradivarius specimens rarely sell for less than a half-million dollars and occasionally fetch as much as $6 million. 
"The name Strad is so emotive today," remarks Gary Sturm, a curator of musical instruments at the Smithsonian Institution. Stradivari, Sturm explains, was well positioned to achieve marketplace dominance: he was wildly prolific and lived to the age of 93, about twice as long as most of his contemporaries; and he was born, around 1644, shortly after an outbreak of plague had thinned the ranks of competing violin makers. Niccolo Amati, Stradivari's mentor, may have standardized the shape and proportions of the instrument, but over time, Stradivari modified Amati's design in a way that preserved the instrument's sweet sound while providing greater projection. Stradivari's fame, considerable during his lifetime, was further boosted posthumously by the promotional efforts of the great 19th-century virtuoso Niccolo Paganini and later by the market-cornering tactics of instrument dealers like the London firm William E. Hill. "There was a great deal of hype involved," says Norman Pickering, one of the world's leading experts on the acoustics of the violin. "There's no great difference between the quality of Stradivarius violins and those of many of his contemporaries, not to mention those of violin makers before and since. But it's as if no other violin maker ever existed."
Almost all top soloists play fine Italian instruments. For workaday orchestral musicians, like those of the N.J.S.O., who earn a base pay of $43,000, buying even a low-cost Strad is unimaginable. Some orchestras, including those in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, own a few heirloom instruments to bestow on their principal players. New Jersey, however, now owns 13 Strads, more than any orchestra in the world.
"When I was a kid," Herbert Axelrod tells me, "we had two violins in our home. One cost $10. We called it Strad. One cost $12. We called it Amati." Axelrod, 76, is reclining in an Eames chair in the living room of his house in the seaside village of Deal, just down the Jersey coast from Asbury Park. A bust of Paganini stands on a side table, and another table is crowded with glass and stone and pewter hippopotamuses that Evelyn, his wife of 47 years, collects. Among the Walter Mitty-like tidbits that the free-associating, chronologically challenged, sometimes self-contradictory Axelrod lets slip about himself are these: that he is the author of 87 books on subjects ranging from seahorses to Heifetz; that he has more fish named after him (some 400, he guesses, including, for instance, Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi) than anyone else on the planet; that he smoked cigars and played pinochle with Albert Einstein, exchanged letters concerning goldfish with Winston Churchill, spent a week spear-fishing with King Leopold III of Belgium; that he attracted the fond attention of cigarette manufacturers when, in the early 50's, he performed a mathematical study demonstrating that cancer caused smoking, and not the other way around; that, in 1979, he was named Man of the Year by the American Pet Products Manufacturer's Association.
Axelrod was raised during the Depression in the working-class city of Bayonne, south of Jersey City. His father, an immigrant from Russia, taught high-school math and gave violin lessons at his house for a quarter. Each evening, a group of students would gather to play string quartets; if a player failed to appear, Axelrod was called to fill in. Asa result, Axelrod tells me, at an early age he knew by heart the first violin, second violin and viola parts of all the Haydn quartets. "There was no question in my mind I was going to be a professional violinist," he recalls. Around the time he was 13, Axelrod's father took him to Philadelphia to play for Efrem Zimbalist, who ran the violin program at the Curtis Institute. After a two-minute audition, Zimbalist disabused Axelrod of his musical ambitions.
Axelrod enlisted in the Army at 17, then went to New York University on the G.I. Bill. He took a job in a laboratory at the American Museum of Natural History, where genetic research was being performed on tropical fish. His supervisor asked him to write a manual to train other assistants in the proper care of fishes. The manual found its way to a publisher, and before long the 25-year-old Axelrod had earned $100,000 in royalties for his volume, "Tropical Fish as a Hobby." Soon after, Axelrod hired laboratory assistants to write guides for animal care on the model of his tropical-fish book. "I'd pay them $25 or $50. In a few years, I became the biggest publisher of pet books in the world. That was the company that I sold in 1997 for $100 million."
In 1970, Axelrod met an instrument dealer in Philadelphia who allowed him to play a Stradivarius violin that was up for sale. "When I held that Strad," Axelrod explains, "I fell in love." He arranged to borrow the instrument for a few weeks. "I couldn't stop playing. I said to my wife, 'God, it hurts to have to give this back.' So she takes off her diamond ring and says: 'I don't need this. I know you love me. Sell it and get yourself a Strad.' " The instrument cost $90,000. "I started going crazy," he says. "All I did was practice. I wasn't taking care of my business. I went to a psychiatrist and said, 'Do I really sound better, or is it in my head?' He told me to bring my Strad to his office, along with my old violin. I played them both for him. He said, 'Yeah, you sound better on the Strad.' 
"But I knew I had to sell the fiddle," Axelrod continues. "It was destroying a good life. I found some people who wanted to trade up. They gave me $150,000 for the violin -- and they threw in another Strad. My wife says to me: 'Get me my diamond back, take what you have left and play around buying and selling fiddles. You're doing pretty good.' "
Thus began Axelrod's entry into the world of rare instruments. He found that favorable deals could be cut with people who had inherited old violins, only to become aware of the tax liability the inheritance posed. "They need someone with cash, and fast," he tells me. "If someone wanted a hundred thousand, I would offer them 10 or 12. They would come back with 20." Over the years, he amassed nearly two dozen Stradivarius instruments, 10 Guarneri del Gesus and 20 more by other celebrated makers. When, in 1997, he donated a Stradivarius string quartet decorated with elaborate carvings to the Smithsonian, it was announced that the gift, valued at $50 million, was the largest ever received by the museum.
"when I joined the N.J.S.O.," recalls Randy Hicks, the orchestra's principal timpanist since 1971, "people would say to me, 'You've got to be kidding.' We were hopeless." The orchestra performed in as many as 11 different sites across New Jersey, including high-school auditoriums and movie theaters. The riots of 1967 made Newark a symbol of urban decay, and though the orchestra continued to play downtown in Symphony Hall -- where the roof leaked and the heating system, when it functioned, sometimes drownedout the music -- suburban audiences stayed away. The orchestra flirted with bankruptcy. Nonetheless, the abundant supply of hungry, top-flight musicians in New York helped the N.J.S.O. maintain decent musical standards on a shoestring. In 1997, the N.J.S.O. became the resident orchestra of the glitzy Performing Arts Center that opened in downtown Newark and saw its subscription base rise from 9,000 to 25,000.
Then came the recession of 2001. Fund-raising dried up. Ticket sales declined sharply after Sept. 11. A million-dollar deficit was quickly run up. Macal, the charismatic music director, announced he would step down after the 2002 season. It was amid this financial strain that the president of the N.J.S.O., Lawrence Tamburri, was summoned to meet with Herbert and Evelyn Axelrod one night after a concert and was told that $50 million worth of stringed instruments could be his at half-price.
Axelrod had been acquainted with the chairman of the N.J.S.O. board, a cardiovascular surgeon named Victor Parsonnet, since Parsonnet called him in 1989 to solicit a donation. As Parsonnet recalls, "I started to tell him who I was, and he said: 'I know who you are. I'll give you $5,000. Don't bother me again.' " Eventually, though, Axelrod gave much more. In the 90's, he contributed a million dollars to endow a concert series in his and his wife's names. But his offer to make over the orchestra's strings -- a way, Axelrod says, of ensuring that he could drive down the Garden State Parkway and hear his beloved fiddles whenever he pleased -- seemed beyond the reach of the orchestra. "We were in an overwhelmed state," admits Tamburri. "Where would we get the money?"
Axelrod gave the orchestra until June 30 to make up its mind. The deadline passed. Autumn came. Axelrod grew impatient. He told Parsonnet that the Vienna Philharmonic was interested in the instruments, as were the orchestras of New York, Washington and Baltimore. Finally, Parsonnet cobbled together $14 million in loans, personally guaranteed in part by members of the board. Gov. James McGreevey of New Jersey called Axelrod and urged him to keep his collection in the state. Axelrod reduced his asking price to $18 million. Parsonnet pleaded for further extensions. In February, Axelrod told Parsonnet that a representative of the Bank of Austria, which was intent on procuring the instruments on behalf of the Vienna Philharmonic, was en route to New Jersey with a $55 million check. Parsonnet persuaded his board to wrap up the deal. The N.J.S.O. was still $4 million short, but at the last moment Axelrod agreed to pocket the $14 million and extend a loan for the outstanding balance. On Valentine's Day, the orchestra had its strings. "It is miracle," says Maestro Macal.
"Buying the instruments was a risk calculated to enhance our prospects of survival," Tamburri says. The orchestra is betting that the collection will be a magnet for attracting donors, subscribers, tourists, first-rate musicians and, perhaps, even a high-profile music director to replace Macal. Soon after announcing the acquisition of Axelrod's strings, the N.J.S.O. began a $51-million fund-raising campaign. It is also selling the rights to name the collection. For $10 million, the entire collection can be named for you; for $1.5 million, you can have a Strad in your name. 
Although the N.J.S.O. fully expects that the strings will appreciate in value, Axelrod's claim that the collection is worth $50 million has been met with some eye-rolling among instrument dealers. Christopher Reuning, a Boston-based violin dealer who isfamiliar with many of the Axelrod instruments, tells me, "An $18 million sale price seems fair to me." Another violin specialist, who has dealt with Axelrod in the past and who would speak only on the condition that he not be named, confides: "Axelrod is a real operator. No one leaves the table ahead of him. For him to give the impression that walking away with $18 million was an incredible act of generosity is a joke." Even Parsonnet admits that the orchestra's independent appraisals of the instruments produced a figure for the collection that was "somewhere closer to 25 million." 
Moreover, New Jersey's bragging rights -- that it had nabbed a collection that could have gone to New York or Vienna -- may have been an exercise in institutional ego-boosting. Zarin Mehta, executive director of the New York Philharmonic, assures me, "To my knowledge, this was never presented to the New York Philharmonic." Inquiries to Vienna produced an e-mail response from Prof. Wolfgang Schuster, press officer of the Vienna Philharmonic: "Mr. Herbert Axelrod offered the National Bank his collection. After a short consultance the National Bank of Austria has had to refuse the offer, because of the costs." Schuster continues: "It wouldn't have made much sense. . . . It would not improve the quality of the sound if all players would play Strads or Guarneris."
Of course, all ambitious marketing -- be it the self-mythologizing efforts of a self-made man, or the brand-building zeal of an overachieving, financially strapped orchestra, or even the act of transforming a beautiful violin into a singularly priceless commodity -- involves a certain amount of exuberant storytelling. The tall tale, repeated often enough, develops the ring of truth. Perhaps Axelrod is not, as some of his self-published books claim, "the best-known tropical-fish expert in the world." (According to Lawrence Page, president of the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists -- fishes and frogs -- "Axelrod doesn't have standing in the field.") But art and the marketplace regularly trade in imaginary values. It is surely unlikely that any orchestra in the world is currently staffed with more contented string players than those in New Jersey. N.J.S.O.'s concertmaster, Eric Wyrick, sounds dazed as he talks about finding himself playing a Guarneri del Gesu. Ming Yang, a four-year member of the orchestra, describes driving home for the first time with the 1672 violin by Francesco Ruggieri that she chose from the collection: "It was this terrifying and thrilling feeling that there was something more important than me in the car." Jonathan Spitz, the principal cellist who now plays on a rare Strad cello said to have been owned by a czarist prince, says simply, "With this instrument, I have enough."
Norman Pickering tells me that countless studies have determined that listeners cannot distinguish between Strads and instruments that sell for one-tenth as much. "There's a lot of mystique surrounding those instruments," he says, "and the mystique goes along with the dollar sign. When I pick up an instrument that's listed for two and a half million dollars, I can't help being affected by it." That invisible -- or inaudible -- effect is the mystical music the N.J.S.O. has staked its future on. Perhaps it's true that, as the cellist Spitz predicts: "We're going to have a truly world-class string sound. It's going to be the calling card of the orchestra." After all, when you play a million-dollar fiddle, it's hard not to sound like a million bucks.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE AND MONEY; 
The Big Give: Turning Warm And Fuzzy Feelings Into Dollars

BYLINE:  By Laura Randall; Laura Randall is a former business editor at The Hollywood Reporter.

 BODY:
In the window of just a few months, Amy Sachtleben's two alma maters have hit her up for time and money at least a dozen times. Had she responded to all the solicitations, she would have given money to two general funds, one local alumni chapter and an athletic team she had tangential involvement with as a student. She would have helped with recruiting, taken several executive education courses for a fee and gone to three receptions.
 She did sign up for the credit card (free) and a gathering of female business school candidates. She ignored the rest. 
 "The amount of mail I get is insane, especially from business school," says Ms. Sachtleben, 33, a finance manager in Los Angeles and a graduate of Williams College and the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. "Sometimes I want to scream, 'Guys, slow down, I've only been out for three years."'
Faced with state budget cuts and shrinking endowments, colleges are using fund-raising tactics that give new meaning to the words "school spirit" as alumni offices adapt strategies that seem more at home in a boardroom. Universities are hoping warm and fuzzy flashbacks will translate into donations when combined with a take-no-prisoners marketing campaign. 
Even recent graduates like Ms. Sachtleben are expected to contribute to annual budget drives, support scholarship funds, mentor students, buy life insurance, help build a new gym and pay for it all with a university-branded credit card that gives the school a cut of each dollar charged.
Some alumni relations offices have hired consultants; others have brought in hip advertising agencies. Many use research companies or databases to find the alumni best positioned to donate -- gaining access to everything from who subscribes to luxury magazines to who holds executive titles. Free lifetime e-mail accounts may seem an innocuous perk, but they allow universities to keep track of graduates.
There is more at stake than a $25 check.
"It's about a continuum of giving," says John M. Cash, a higher education consultant with the firm Marts & Lundy in Lyndhurst, N.J. "It's the $50 you give when you're 22 and the $500,000 bequest you leave years later." 
It is also about the annual college rankings by U.S. News & World Report. Alumni giving is one of the criteria used in the closely watched report. Development officers are not afraid to trumpet the importance of the rankings when making a case for alumni donations, says Timothy D. Brooks, director of alumni relations at Tufts University in Medford, Mass. "There's no doubt in my mind that any alumnus would be proud to see us break the top 20," he says. "One way to do that is to up our annual rate of giving from its current level." 
Fund-raising fever rose during the economic downturn. While attendance at networking events has jumped over the last year along with the unemployment rate, alumni donations have plummeted. Contributions soared in the late 1990's in tandem with the booming economy, then leveled off in 2001 and dropped nearly $1 billion, or 13.6 percent, in the year ended June 2002, according to the Council for Aid to Education, a subsidiary of the RAND Corporation. Even in a good year, fewer than 20 percent of graduates ever make a donation to their alma mater. The numbers are even lower at public universities, which until recently tended to view their alumni with the same detachment as the taxpaying citizens who already support them. 
"When you land on the Princeton campus as a freshman, you know that you're a Princetonian for life," Dr. Cash says. "When you arrive at, say, the University of Illinois, you don't necessarily have those expectations, because the public university has historically not reached out to its alumni after graduation."
All that is changing. With less than 7 percent of the 158,000 locatable graduates as members, the alumni association at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst is working to raise its profile. In the hope of convincing graduates to part with the annual $35 membership fee, the organization has been running a series of nostalgic ads in newspapers in cities with local chapters. The slogan: "You Were, You Are, UMass." 
Some groups are starting the cultivation process before students even leave campus -- the Missouri University Alumni Association recently enlisted a graduate business class to evaluate its efforts to hook students before they vanish into a postgraduation vortex. "Students hear the word alumni and don't relate," says its executive director, Todd Coleman. "Their impressions of alumni associations are old, white-haired men driving big Cadillacs and having a lot of money."
Switching gears, the association attached a catchy title -- the True Tigers -- to its student alumni division and redirected its marketing efforts toward ads during intramural sporting events and on the campus television network, two outlets identified by the M.B.A. students for their effectiveness in reaching undergraduates.
Ultimately, the hope is that the 20-year-olds on campus today will turn into the wealthy white-haired people who fondly remember their alma mater.
"Anything that keeps people connected is important," Mr. Cash says. "Out of that population, someone may well emerge someday who gives you a lot."

HEADLINE: CAREERS; 
The Undecided

BYLINE:  By Leslie Berger; Leslie Berger is a freelance writer in New York

 BODY:
FEW students today can afford indecision. The way Adam Kleshinski sees it, he could have spared himself a year's worth of work, $10,000 in tuition and lots of aggravation if only he had picked the right major sooner. A 23-year-old junior at the University of Cincinnati, he switched from industrial design to environmental studies last year after realizing that planned obsolescence conflicted with his values.
 This spring, when not trying to patent an energy-saving invention, Mr. Kleshinski helped a freshman named David Meckstroth through the same agonizing process as a volunteer mentor at the university's new Center for Exploratory Studies, which also offers staff counseling, testing to assess interests and visits to classes and job sites. 
 "If I'd been better informed about what industrial design was before I started," Mr. Kleshinski recalls, "I could have completed my major in three years and been doing my master's right now." 
In a newfangled form of career counseling, the University of Cincinnati is just the latest campus adding services to help young students find the right major. Pace, a private university with New York City and suburban campuses, started the office of academic resources in 1997 after realizing that about half its 13,000 undergraduates were switching fields of study. Similarly, Purdue University in Indiana, which admits freshmen into one of 12 specialized schools, added a broader curriculum called undergraduate studies in 1996 to give freshmen a taste of the possibilities.
In fact, undecided students have become more commonplace on American campuses. A record 8.5 percent of entering freshmen were unsure of their career path in 2001, up from 1.7 percent in 1966, according to a survey by the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles. Government figures show that almost 40 percent of students change their major at least once.
THE apparent epidemic of indecision and the trend in exploratory programs -- the new jargon for everything from counseling to curriculum (counselors avoid the more negative "undecided") -- reflects deeper changes in higher education itself.
Most job applicants in today's service-based economy are expected to be college graduates. But the more diverse and disadvantaged students arriving on today's campuses, including minorities, older women and the sons and daughters of recent immigrants, are less prepared to make academic choices and under more pressure to make the right one, since education is their best shot at upward mobility as well as expensive.
"Higher education has been transformed from an institution serving white, property-owning Protestant males from New England to one serving those who are the majority now," says John N. Gardner, a senior fellow at the University of South Carolina who developed the Freshman Year, a program to help freshmen adjust to college. "It's not enough to admit people who were once excluded," he continues. "If you're going to take their hopes, their dreams, their aspirations and their money -- their own money and the government's money -- you have to do something more for them."
At the same time, higher education has become increasingly specialized. The shift began in the 1970's when a sharp decline in college-age youths prompted campuses to offer more courses with a direct application to work, says Anthony P. Carnevale, a labor economist and vice president at the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, N.J. "The American higher education system has become the work force training system," he says. "It doesn't like to see itself that way. It perceives itself as Harvard -- that is, that it provides a liberal education. It doesn't."
By the end of sophomore year, most students today must declare, in effect, their vocation. Interested in engineering? Is that mechanical, electrical, aeronautical, nuclear or structural? Interested in health? Is that nursing, occupational therapy, physical therapy or speech pathology?
The ever-growing menu of courses and majors can be overwhelming. At Cincinnati, a robust state university with more than 25,000 undergraduates, 120 possible bachelor's degrees are available from 10 separate colleges.
"You can understand why students need a place to help them make a decision," says Tara Stopfel, director of the Center for Exploratory Studies, which opened in February. "But I would tell you that a freshman by his very nature is undecided. They'll come in sure they want to study engineering. But they've decided that because they were good at math and science in high school, and maybe dad's an engineer, or someone said, 'Hey, U.C., they have a great engineering school.' But then they realize this isn't what they want to do."
Joe Cuseo, a psychology professor at Marymount College in Palos Verdes, Calif., who has written extensively on majors and their relationship to student retention, says that the chance to mull over one's major has traditionally been a luxury of the privileged. Those institutions most tolerant of exploration, he says, have been the small, liberal arts colleges, which are also the most expensive and admit the most legacies.
"Ironically," he says, "those schools who are really forcing students to make the earliest decision are public community colleges, which tend to enroll the least prepared, the most economically underprivileged, first-generation college students." 
Exploratory programs are becoming more popular, though, as a way to hang on to students and their tuition dollars. As in the 1970's, maintaining enrollment is once again a key concern, although for different reasons. Student mobility is high, for one thing. "One out of five students who started at a four-year college and earned a B.A. got it from a college other than the one they started at," says Clifford Adelman, a senior research analyst with the United States Department of Education. Also, studies show that students who don't feel they have a goal, who cannot see the connection between their courses and what they plan to do, are at the greatest risk of dropping out. 
"The retention rate is of great concern to the University of Cincinnati," says Greg Hand, a spokesman for the university, where 31 percent of freshmen leave after a year. "It is the reason for instituting programs like the Center for Exploratory Studies, directed at helping students progress successfully toward graduation." 
The cost of indecision is also very much on the minds of students at Cincinnati, as elsewhere. Budget cuts are forcing tuition up 10 percent this fall, with students covering a bigger share of their education than the state of Ohio for the first time in the campus's history.
"Tuition just keeps going up and you don't want to feel like you're wasting time," says Jessica Minor, a nursing student at Cincinnati and volunteer mentor. "You don't want to waste your own money, your parents' or loans. It just adds up so quickly."
Ms. Minor met with Umaru Bah, a freshman, this spring to help her choose among majors in nursing, pre-med and business. Ms. Bah says she has already ruled out pharmaceutical studies because of all the chemistry. Reviewing course requirements for different fields with counselors was probably the most helpful in narrowing her interests, she says.
"I just went for something not too hard but at the same time challenging," says Ms. Bah, who is leaning toward a major in nursing with a minor in business. 
Mr. Meckstroth was torn between his artistic and practical sides as he compared industrial design and mechanical engineering. Speaking to Mr. Kleshinski confirmed his concerns that industrial design was too esthetic for his ultimate goal of putting down roots and moving up into management at a large company.
"I also found out that if you're going into industrial design, it's not a life where you can stay in one area and with one company," he says. "You have to change firms a lot. So that wasn't something I found appealing."
As he and Ms. Bah discovered, learning to make an informed choice was just as important as the choice itself -- since declaring a major is just the first of many decisions.
"Education is never over," says Dr. Adelman, a former college dean. "The major is only the beginning of a line of interests that will develop and deepen over the course of people's lives and will be dictated by circumstance, employment, personal predilection. Not all that knowledge is delivered by degree programs." 

PRIME-TIME MAJORS
 WHAT'S hot and what's not in college majors often depends on prime time. 
Forensic pathology is in vogue, thanks to the CBS police drama "C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation."
Other entertainment-spurred fields of study include emergency medicine ("E.R."), law ("L.A. Law"), criminal profiling ("The Silence of the Lambs") and investigative journalism ("All the President's Men"). Current events affect choices, too. After reactor accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, interest in nuclear engineering dropped off precipitously, according to Eric White, who directs Penn State's division of undergraduate studies. Now, he says, with instability in the Mideast and concerns about oil prices, it's starting to come back.
Fads aside, business has been the most popular major for three decades and remains so today, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. (The peak was during the pro-business Reagan era, when, not coincidentally, education majors reached a low.) Other sizable majors are social science (history, political science, economics, urban affairs), health (nursing, rehabilitation services), education and psychology. 
Among losers are engineering and math. The number of degrees conferred in math declined by 22 percent from 1989 to 2000, while engineering and related technologies dropped 12 percent. Some cite an image problem. "We've not done a good job at putting the word out that it's exciting," says David Waugh, past president of the National Society of Professional Engineers, which is working to improve its image with plans for, among other things, a TV show.

WHEN MAJORS MATTER MOST
 MAJORS are crucial if you're heading directly into the workplace after college, says Anthony P. Carnevale, a labor economist and vice president at the Educational Testing Service. 
But most liberal arts students go on to graduate school or professional programs, so their undergraduate majors become less significant over the long haul. That said, some fields of study suit certain pursuits. Plenty of political science and history majors go to law school. Philosophy may seem completely impractical, but a philosophy major can exploit skills in logic and math for business school. "If you know math, that opens a lot of doors," Dr. Carnevale says. And a clever sociology major might parlay knowledge of statistics and behavior into a marketing career.
"Liberal arts majors are the distance runners," Dr. Carnevale says. "They're the investors."
But for the vast majority who start working right away -- 70 percent of college graduates, according to the National Center for Education Statistics -- "it becomes crucial what you choose," he says. For these students, repeated studies have found a clear link between college major and future earnings.
"The findings of this study confirm what has been reported consistently in other studies about earnings," begins a 2001 report for the Department of Education. "College graduates who major in the applied fields of engineering, business, computer science, nursing and other health fields earn higher-than-average full-time salaries. In contrast, education and humanities and arts majors experienced the least favorable outcomes."
According to the study, graduates with degrees in health earned as much as 58 percent more than those whose degree was in the humanities and the arts. 
The same study said that graduates majoring in applied fields like nursing, education and engineering were "very likely to be employed in jobs related to their majors." Communications and journalism majors were the big exception: These students were more likely (33 percent) than graduates in any other field to be working in service jobs like retail or hospitality.
For academic fields, roughly 25 percent of students majoring in biological science, math or physical sciences worked as teachers, and 25 percent in research or technical work. Social science majors were likely to work in business occupations (32 percent), followed by service occupations (18 percent) and protective services (16 percent). 
Clifford Adelman, a United States Department of Education senior researcher, cautions that employers look at a student's breadth of knowledge and skills, so courses outside a major count, too. "Courses taken are just as important as the major in determining what happens in the labor market," he says. "'What's in my valise?' is the phrase I like to use. 'What am I carrying into the labor market?"' LESLIE BERGER

HEADLINE: Cons In Class 

BYLINE:  By Abby Ellin; Abby Ellin writes a column about young people for the Money & Business section of The Times.

DATELINE: Ossining, N.Y. 

 BODY:
IGNORE the razor wire twisted outside the windows, and the school building at the Sing Sing Correctional Facility feels like most other academic institutions. Classrooms are filled with blackboards, freestanding globes, desk-and-chair combinations. Inspirational messages line the walls: If you don't get it, try again! Some people have to learn the hard way! Never settle for less than your best! But here, 30 miles up the Hudson from New York City, students don't linger after class. They are herded back to their cells the minute the clock hits 8:30. 
 On this night, Rosemarie Murray's "Written English and Literary Studies I" class is discussing the plays read over the semester: "Oedipus," "Hamlet," "Othello" and "A Doll's House." Last week they had been asked to answer essay questions, and Dr. Murray hands back their responses. 
 "Some people thought they were writing sentences and I was forced to write 'sentence fragment,"' she says. "You all know what I mean, right?" The men nod. 
Next week's assignment: to write a paper on "marriage through the mirror of drama." The men, most in their 20's and 30's, look at her blankly. She tries again. "What do the plays we've read so far tell us about marriage?" she says. "How about 'A Doll's House'?"
The men raise their hands. It's life, one says. "Woman kills husband, husband kills wife -- everyday life."
"Marriages explode because of economic problems," says another.
"Men and women go into marriage for different reasons," says a third.
"So the relationship between the sexes has not changed very much," Dr. Murray proffers. The conversation strikes a chord, and the men start talking about their own lives. This happens a lot, she says. "The tenor of the class, the openness, those are constants. Once we were talking about the opinions the world has of you versus your own identity. The labels 'black men,' 'prisoner' -- what does this mean to your own sense of self? Literature is about how conflict changes people. Here are real-life people dealing with real-life conflicts."
Educating prisoners is something Dr. Murray believes in strongly. "I've always had sympathies for people who make the wrong choices," she says. A former dean of students at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., she wrote her graduate school dissertation on prison education and recidivism rates. She rarely asks her students what crime they committed, and she has never felt unsafe. "It's a maturity thing," she says. "Nobody's 18. They've been in long enough and they understand that education is the key. Part of their motivation is because most of them are getting out."
She continues: "One of the best responses I've heard for why men and women in prisons should study philosophy was: 'For the same reason people do it at Harvard.' No matter where you are, it's the same. Like what happened to Malcolm X -- he copied the dictionary, he loved words. There's power in being an educated man who can use words."
Inmate number 86A348, Juan Roldan, also loves words. But he didn't know that until he went to prison and started studying. 
Mr. Roldan, 40, has spent 17 years behind bars and has almost eight more to go before he's eligible for parole. His sentence is big -- 25 to life for robbing and murdering a cabdriver in the Bronx. At 6 feet 2 and 230 pounds, Mr. Roldan looks as if he spends a lot of time working out, and he does. The rest of the day he sweeps and mops, for which he gets $5 every two weeks, or studies. He rarely watches television. 
Mr. Roldan grew up on the Lower East Side long before it was fashionable, and then moved in with his father in Camden, N.J. After graduating from high school he considered joining the Marines but stayed behind for a girl. He took menial jobs, ran with a rough crowd and got into drugs. He won't give specifics about his crime. He was locked up at the Greenhaven Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in Stormville, N.Y., for 14 years. There, he participated in a range of therapeutic programs. One day, in transactional analysis, the teacher asked him to make a list of all the pros and cons in his life. 
Here were the pros: He had had money, two cars and an apartment in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. He had a high school diploma. He was assertive, intelligent, strong. Then the cons: "I'm in prison. I used drugs. I've got no car, no wife, no apartment. The only thing left was the high school diploma. Reality smacked me in the face. I cried, 'I ruined my life.' The cons got bigger: I'm overly assertive, overly aggressive. I need to be humble. I'm in prison. That's when I decided to do my best here."
He began by taking classes. Greenhaven offered a degree program through Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., but, after Mr. Roldan had earned 84 credits, President Bill Clinton signed legislation in 1994 making convicted felons ineligible for Pell grants, the federal tuition assistance program for low-income students. At the time, nearly 27,000 inmates were paying for college with the grants, costing the government $35 million annually. Most states, including New York, withdrew financial aid for prison education, and more than 350 programs shut down nationwide. 
Mr. Roldan was devastated. But four years later he got wind of Sing Sing's privately financed program and applied for a transfer. His request was granted and Mercy College, the degree-granting institution, accepted his credits. After this semester, he needs three more courses to graduate; eventually, he says, he wants to be a medical doctor. 
The walls of his 9-by-5-foot cell, which he says affords a teasing view of the Hudson, are plastered with photographs of the ocean, the solar system, K-2. A typewriter, lamp and desk sit on one side. Stacks of books are piled against a wall. He says he knows all about the history of Americans, Jews, Africans, American Indians and the Celts. He's read Plato, Socrates, Greek and Roman mythology. ("Well, they got that from the Greek," he says.) He studies math, his worst subject, daily. 
His passion is English. His favorite is Rudyard Kipling's "If." "That speaks to me," he says, along with Keats and "the woman writer -- Anne Sexton.
"I love her because she writes like me, the emotion of it, the despair. She was in a mental institution and she said her writing was from the depths of her being. Like when Jimi Hendrix was playing his guitar and it unplugged and he kept on playing. Sometimes I feel like prison chokes me, which it's designed to do. I find solace in reading and learning. This experience needs to be more than an individual, Juan Roldan, 86A348, doing 25 years. When I leave prison I want to leave with a college degree, a master's and a Ph.D. -- not covered in tattoos or pierced."
Sentiment against higher education in prison has grown even more acute as states squeeze the budgets of public universities, with officials and the public challenging whether the humanities is appropriate to prepare prisoners for the outside -- and what of those who may never be released, like Juan Roldan?
State Senator Michael F. Nozzolio, a Republican from Seneca Falls, who heads the Crime and Corrections Committee, supports vocational training and test preparation for general education diplomas and is seeking to make them mandatory as a condition of parole. But he says that higher education is unfair "when law-abiding, taxpaying citizens are stretched to the limit trying to pay their college tuitions." 
"Certainly," he says, "if an inmate wishes to pursue a college education or correspondence courses we'll encourage that, but in my district I saw inmates that have no chance of ever getting out of prison becoming philosopher kings at taxpayer expense."
After the Pell grants were ended, the Youthful Offenders Program was created to provide federal funds for postsecondary education to inmates under age 26, but only those eligible for parole or release within five years. States have the latitude to emphasize vocational or academic education; most blend the two. The program, which went into effect in 1998, is considered a positive step, though the Correctional Educational Association, an organization of prison educators, is lobbying to raise the age ceiling to 35.
"There is good support for postsecondary education that has a vocational basis to it, and that means more jobs," says Stephen J. Steurer, executive director of the association. "When we had Pell grants people were getting A.A. degrees and B.A. degrees, but you got this whole public 'I work to put my kids through college and these bums are getting free help.' I understand it. I also understand the other viewpoint about public safety and reduction of crime."
Study after study has shown that education improves the chances that inmates will not return to prison. A 2001 study sponsored by the federal Department of Education reported a 20 percent drop in recidivism rates among more than 3,000 inmates in Maryland, Minnesota and Ohio who had participated in an academic or vocational program. Another study, by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, found that 65 percent of those with some high school went back to jail, compared with 57 percent of high school graduates and 52 percent of those with some college.
"It's the college experience -- and particularly graduation or completion of any diploma, some sense of walking down the aisle and completion -- that significantly decreases recidivism rates," says Michelle Fine, a professor of psychology at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. "The evidence is strong for any educational intervention. Our analyses, however, suggest that with a liberal arts degree students gain the skills that are necessary for work situations -- persistence, social analysis and surviving on the outside, the skills of 'reading' the social situation, knowing how to overcome in the face of daunting obstacles, and how to consider alternatives."
Dr. Fine is an author of a study in 2001 that tracked about 2,300 women for three years after their release from the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester County, which re-established a program in 1997 through a consortium of private New York colleges and universities and with donors like Glenn Close and Paul Newman. Nearly 30 percent of those who hadn't taken classes wound up back in jail, compared with 8 percent of those who had. Dr. Fine says each inmate who returns to prison costs $25,000 a year. "Incarceration of 100 prisoners for four years costs the state $10 million; college in prison for four years costs the state $1 million but recidivism rates drop dramatically, yielding a cost savings of hundreds of millions of dollars." 
Ultimately, it is up to each state to determine whether it will offer a college education. Last year, before Gov. George H. Ryan of Illinois left office, he decided not to abandon in-prison college to help balance the state budget; 23 of its 27 prisons have a program with area community colleges, which absorb some of the expense. In Texas, nearly 10,000 inmates take college-level courses financed by private scholarships and the Youthful Offenders Program. Inmates over 26 pay full tuition either up front or as a condition of parole. About 600 inmates are studying for a degree in Maryland, with the first graduating class in May; in addition, with a $1 million grant from the Department of Education, the state has developed an online curriculum. "It's a national demonstration project to prove we can deliver online courses safely to incarcerated adults," says D. Ray Harbert, coordinator of postsecondary programs for Maryland's education department. 
Only five of New York State's 70 prisons have degree-granting programs, all privately financed. Sing Sing's program was created, at the behest of inmates, by Anne Reissner, a volunteer at the prison who founded the nonprofit Hudson Link for Higher Education. The first classes were held in 2000 and taught by Nyack College. 
A year later, with Nyack facing financial problems, Mercy College took over. Sixty-five prisoners are now enrolled, and degrees in behavioral science will be conferred on the first Mercy graduates next June. "Once they leave prison most get jobs working in human services, like drug counseling or with at-risk youth," Ms. Reissner says. Prisoners must apply just like any other student and contribute about 12 percent, or $30, of their annual earnings. They also get paid $5 every two weeks for attending (school is classified as a job). Mercy charges about $3,000 a class. 
OF course, just because you have a degree doesn't mean it's easy after prison. Inmates don't have to worry about health insurance or finding the next meal or paying rent or, for that matter, what time to wake up and go to sleep. Real-world pressures can overwhelm someone who has spent half his life locked up, as recidivism rates clearly indicate. Education helps.
Sean Pica, 34, was released from Sing Sing in mid-December, having been incarcerated at 17 for killing a classmate's father in Selden, N.Y. (The case was turned into a TV movie, "A Deadly Silence," which he has never seen.) Guards dropped him off at the train station at Ossining, handed him $40, and that was that. "They were very nice," he recalls. "They shook my hand when I left." 
"All you hear about is the recidivism rate, that 60 percent go back to prison. How can that be?" says Mr. Pica. "And then you experience it and you say, 'This system is designed for failure.' You have guys like me that have done years in jail and they say, 'All I want to do is go out. I'll make it work.' Then they get out and they don't have a car. Where are they going to go? They're all by themselves. What are they going to do?"
"Part of me wants to say we're doing fine with private funding, and this way we don't have to deal with people who say, 'Why should my tax money pay for your education?' But you wouldn't have wanted me to stay the way I was. I was a wild, mixed-up, crazy kid. And if I hadn't settled down and gotten educated -- I wasn't a neighbor you would want."
While in jail, Mr. Pica got his high school equivalency diploma, his bachelor's from Nyack College and, last year, his master's in professional studies in a program offered by the New York Theological Seminary. "When I went up there and got the degree I thought, 'This is the first time in my life I earned something,"' he recalls. "A lot of guys aren't career criminals; most are guys like me who got in trouble as kids."
Mr. Pica believes in luck. Shortly after his release he got a job busing tables and doing carpentry at a restaurant. "What's the chances of that happening?" he asks. "I could have picked a million other places and not gotten a response." He just started a job counseling at a nonprofit employment agency in Harlem, making $29,000 a year, and will begin a master's program at Hunter College in September. 
Juan Roldan may never be released. He's up for parole in 2010, but few succeed the first time. Mr. Roldan dreams about it often. A lot has changed in 17 years: Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton have come and gone. A space shuttle blew up, and then another. A millennium flipped by. And two of the largest buildings in the world no longer stand. The Internet and cellphones have become indispensable parts of everyday life -- not that Mr. Roldan has actually used either. "My goal is to take my laptop, plug in my cellphone and touch someone in Denmark," he says. 
Right now, though, he's staying focused on doing the "right thing." That in itself is a victory. "I am a success story," he says. "I have not succumbed to the subculture of prison. Drugs, being a crook -- you can come to prison and do things that aren't positive."
And who knows? Maybe one day he will achieve his goal of being a doctor. "Ironic," he says, "that I'm here for murder."

 CORRECTION:
An article in the special Education Life section on Aug. 3 about college courses in prison misstated the circumstances under which Nyack College, in New York State, suspended its program at the Sing Sing Correctional Facility. The decision reflected plans to shut the medium-security area; the Nyack program served primarily those prisoners. Financial problems were not the reason.

HEADLINE: ENDPAPER; 
A Reluctant Reunion

BYLINE:  By Leslie Kandell; Leslie Kandell, a freelance journalist specializing in the arts, is working on a book about church choirs.

 BODY:
ADDING what I've heard to what I'm sure of, I can now account for the whole front row of my class photo, and a couple of children in the middle and rear. By "my class," I mean one of the fifth grades in Public School 2 on the Lower East Side, where I taught when John F. Kennedy was president.
 I found that old photo after a friend transferred to a CD the decaying reel-to-reel tapes I had made when I lugged my newfangled recorder into the classroom just for fun. The CD, rising from the tapes' ashes, revealed a young teacher talking and singing with students and rehearsing "Lonesome Train," the folk oratorio that was our class play. Getting the children together again, to hear the CD and share memories, sounded like a great idea. With naive enthusiasm, I set out to round them up. 
 New York City schools don't track their graduates, although Caroline Kennedy, in her new role as fund-raiser for the city's Department of Education, says she hopes to form an alumni association of some kind. But for now, the one doing the homework is me. And after a series of dead ends, I'm thinking it's easier to find a witness in a protection program. Class records from before the computer era are unavailable. Colleagues are retired. Everyone I knew in the administration is dead. I don't find my kids on Classmates.com or through directory assistance. Private detectives want the moon -- Social Security numbers and girls' married names.
I wish my former students could reconnect -- with being 10, with what they once learned, with forgotten friends. During my search, someone suggests that I'm the one looking to recapture my youth. It's true: as I grow older, I become a nostalgia-seeker, a retriever of memories. Shared history makes time fall away. The bond forged by knowing someone early in life should endure. 
Perhaps I'm the one learning the lessons.
ONCE, long before P.S. 2 was built, the Lower East Side teemed with immigrants who arrived with nothing, sometimes not even their own names. Their children, among them the Irving Berlins, the Danny Kayes, the Al Jolsons, took advantage of free education and worked their way out of poverty, pointing with pride to the picturesque pushcarts and tenements of their beginnings.
But by the late 60's, the streets had an aura of incipient danger -- "West Side Story" with less charm and more drugs. It wasn't a neighborhood where boys fled the Vietnam draft by going to college or Canada. They left high school and went into the service. Not all came back.
I study the smiling boys in the class photo sitting cross-legged down front. (Notices were sent home, and the children who weren't going to doll up just didn't come that day.) Left to right: Chinese, Italian, Hispanic, Greek. In other rows more of each, and blacks, Poles, a Hawaiian -- the original Rainbow Coalition.
Eddie (front row, far left) joined a gang and Mike (far right) thinks Eddie is long dead (I certainly can't find him). A few are listed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and I find two other death certificate matches. (Someone thinks Gary P. is dead, too, but about 35 years ago he looked me up and visited along with his fiancee. He wanted me to know that after reform school and prison, he had a job paving sidewalks and was taking night courses in algebra so he could be a construction manager. So I believe he's out there somewhere.) Andrew (front row, red jacket) now lives in Minnesota. He had won a merit scholarship to Brown University from Seward Park, where most P.S. 2 graduates go but only 28 percent of entering freshmen graduate. (At Stuyvesant, within walking distance, it's 93 percent.) The number of Seward Park applicants admitted to Brown in the lastdecade is zero.
I call Andrew. "Maybe the best thing you did was show us what's out there," he tells me.
In my day at P.S. 2, teachers were busy scooping batches of students into the next grade and forgetting them, as they forgot us. So when Mike hears my name on the phone, he growls, "Get out of here" with inflections right out of "The Sopranos." He startles me back when I ask, "How old are you now, Mikey?" I am ready to hear 30, but he's 52. (Surely that's older than I am, isn't it?)
When I say I remember him as a perfect child, he shouts to his family, "Hey, the teacher says I was a perfect child!"
I ask Mike if he will get hold of classmates so we can get together. "No," he says, "I want to meet with you alone."
I would have put on a pleasant expression on the way up the subway steps, but Mike is too quick not to guess that, and evidently wishes to see my face when I recognize him. He is down on the platform watching for me. We are both dazed.
We sit in a downtown Greek diner, where he knows the owner, for three and a half hours, during which time we have one cup of coffee that we don't want. I remember Mike as someone I could rely on to get a job done, a stable child. "Nam" was devastating for him. What he saw there, and did, left him with post-traumatic stress disorder, documented in a government file as "permanently unemployable" because of "episodes of unprovoked violence." So he goes to the V.A. hospital and lives on disability he would give up in a heartbeat for a decent job.
I hear about heroin, armed robbery, prisons, diabetes, liver problems and dentures. He says, though, that when he was in prison, he asked for the job of librarian "because the morons and maniacs who can't read won't be in there." It turns out he writes a little, and what I see has none of the common grammatical errors that annoy me. "Wonder where I learned that," he says.
I'm beginning to grasp what courage it took to come out to that diner to meet me. I wonder if the sudden appearance of Teacher, assigning him to compare who he was to who he is, isn't a greater danger to him than he is to me. "We're us," Mike says. "You're them."
But in those direct eyes I see again the reliable co-captain of the P.S. 2 safety squad -- the other co-captain's name is on the Vietnam wall -- and across an abyss of time and class, we remember each other with love. I'm sure of that.
When I find Effie, now an artist, she has a very old bone to pick: "Do you remember when you took us on a trip to the Cloisters?" Sort of. "And you lost your watch?" Oops. "Well, you made us all look for it."
I regret spoiling her trip. I remember that the watch had been a gift from my father. I speak of my worry over the loss, and my fear of disappointing him. Mollified by an unexpected apology, she speaks of her own father's savage temper. She goes on to recall being the narrator in the class play, and mentions my interest in the cello, the first time she noticed that a teacher could have a life beyond school.
We finally meet. She has never had a reunion experience, and is suspicious at first. She listens to the tape, and we talk and talk. "You're not going to make me leave now, are you?" she says after the afternoon is gone. No I'm not. We figure out a few more names on the photo. Later, she makes a date to meet with Mikey.
This isn't turning out like any reunion I have ever gone to. It will be a long time before my fifth graders sit in the same room eating cookies, or whatever I was imagining, and listening to that tape. What I've found is less complete but no less compelling.
I persuade Mike to read his journal to his veterans' group. "It's hard, but not impossible," he tells me after he has tried it. "Just when I thought there was no more road, another half-mile showed up."
And as my search continues, connecting with each of them is like a half-mile showing up for me.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
Modigliani's Recipe: Sex, Drugs and Long, Long Necks

BYLINE:  By PETER PLAGENS; Peter Plagens is a painter and the art critic for Newsweek.

 BODY:
VINCENT VAN GOGH had a 10-year working life that can hardly be called a "career," and yet he's just about the biggest draw ever in museum exhibitions, at least per square inch of canvas covered. When the 1998 "Van Gogh's van Goghs" exhibition entered the home stretch of its run at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, officials had to keep the place open 24 hours a day on the last weekend to accommodate the crowds.
 O.K., that's van Gogh. But since June 26, visitors have been streaming into the same museum at the rate of more than 1,400 a day (which a spokesperson calls "astounding" for them) to see the work of a different painter with an equally brief working life. The attraction, which originated at the Albright-Knox Gallery in Buffalo (where the museum had to turn away visitors during the last two weeks) and then stopped at the Kimbell Museum in Fort Worth, is an exhibition called "Modigliani and the Artists of Montparnasse." (It runs through Sept. 28.) Although the show includes healthy doses of Chagall, Soutine and Rivera (among others), the benighted Amedeo Modigliani (1884-1920) is the real draw. 
 What is it about this artist, who painted deceptively simple, semi-abstracted, sloe-eyed women over and over again, that pleases the public so much? 
It could be at least partly the biography. Modigliani was born an outsider -- his parents were Sephardic Jews in Livorno, Italy -- and grew up sickly and tubercular. He arrived in Paris at 18, wide-eyed and ambitious, and quickly fell into a passionate, bohemian existence of drugs, alcohol and brothels. He really wanted to be a sculptor and daubed mostly because of poverty (the ultracheap medium of assemblage hadn't been invented yet). In addition to Chagall, Soutine and Rivera, his supporting cast of avant-garde arrivistes included Giorgio de Chirico, Juan Gris, Elie Nadelman, Piet Mondrian, Constanin Brancusi, Jacob Epstein, Sonia Delaunay and Jacques Lipchitz.
Oh, yes, and Picasso. 
Modigliani met Picasso in 1909 and was later haunted, enraged, awed and made envious by every artistic move this transplanted Spaniard made. But where the wily Picasso gradually cobbled together a kind of prosperity, Modigliani stayed dirt poor, frequently changing residences only one jump ahead of eviction and constantly trying to settle unpayable debts with drawings. He died Byronically, of meningitis, at 35. A day after his burial in Pere Lachaise cemetery, his distraught mistress, Jeanne Hebuterne -- the mother of his 14-month-old daughter and pregnant again -- committed suicide by defenestration. Modigliani's doomed life is the stuff of which movies are made. Sure enough, a feature film about him, with Andy Garcia in the title role, was announced in April.
But give the public some credit: the art on the wall must have something to do with it, and it does. Modigliani's painting -- although it probably seemed to the haute bourgeoisie of Paris in the teens as incomprehensible as anything produced by the overwrought Fauves and certifiably crazy Cubists -- was never really as far out as that of his peers, especially Picasso. Modigliani liked the attenuated, melancholic figures of Picasso's Blue Period, not the spiky, angry and downright threatening fragmented prostitutes of "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon," and his own painting shows it.
Modigliani also liked Brancusi's aerodynamically modern sculpture, which, if militantly abstract (or at least abstracted), is nothing if not harmonious in the economical extreme. Modigliani's painting shows that, too. We might say -- as some critics have -- that Modigliani looks a little bloodless next to the fevered, meaty angst of Soutine, but we can't deny the ingeniously soothing design (yes, design; it's not a dirty word) in Modigliani's paintings. The public lines up for sage introspection (Rembrandt) and the sunny, leafy outdoors (Monet), but it also likes finely balanced "S" curves. It's almost a kinesthetic thing; try it by drawing a figure 8. That graceful, graphic simplicity, together with his embracingly warm colors, lends Modigliani's painting what the Futurist artist Gino Severini called a "Tuscan elegance." 
Modigliani painted portraits and female nudes almost exclusively. Since most people like to look at images of people, and even straight women like to look at the cleavage on the covers of women's magazines like Cosmopolitan, Modigliani's paintings have a broad and deeply anchored appeal.
Sitters in Modigliani's portraits are invariably elongated, especially in the neck. From El Greco and Parmagianino through today's fashion illustration, elongation is preferred. The portraits' faces resemble masks in a comforting, Hello Kitty! sort of way (as opposed to a terrifying, Jason-from-the-"Halloween"-movies sort of way). Whatever inner turmoil -- or ennui -- the subject is suffering, Modigliani manages to bowdlerize it without entirely obliterating the sitter's engaging humanity. His 1916 portrait of his hyper-expressionist friend Soutine looks a lot like Keanu Reeves.
As for the nudes, they're the modernist version of the socially sanctioned cheesecake -- Cabanel's "Birth of Venus," for example -- that emanated from the late-19th-century French academy. (I can recall arty undergraduate friends pinning up Modigliani repros instead of Playboy centerfolds in their dorm rooms.) Modigliani also pushes the envelope a bit: the viewer looks down at a Modigliani nude, seeing her as if she's waiting for a hovering lover to come to bed, and his paintings were occasionally confiscated for exposing too much pubic hair. People who go to contemporary-art exhibitions in museums these days enjoy that quaint trace of transgressiveness.
If this sounds dismissive, it isn't. It's just a partial inventory of the buttons his work pushes. Were that the sum of Modigliani's painting, he'd be little better than one of those nightclub "elegant" poster artists like Patrick Nagel, whose works decorate hairdressing salons and white-shag-carpet condos from Coral Gables to La Jolla.
But Modigliani doesn't just delineate -- he paints, really paints. There's enough color and surface modulation, beautifully and subtly achieved through a short, staccato brush stroke (which some historians attribute to his carved sculptures), to keep serious viewers coming back for second, even third looks. In Los Angeles, that seems to be joyfully the case.
As for New York, traditionally a tough town, it's nevertheless likely that the public's love affair with the star-crossed painter will resume in full when the Jewish Museum opens its own full-scale Modigliani retrospective in May.

Playing the Horses (and the Horse People, Too)

BYLINE:  By JANE SMILEY; Jane Smiley's novels include "A Thousand Acres," "Moo" and "Horse Heaven." Her most recent is "Good Faith." She owns a racehorse named Darlin' Corey.

DATELINE: ACADIA, Calif. 

 BODY:
I WAS sitting with my horse trainer outside her office at Santa Anita racetrack. It was 101 degrees, and we were waiting. It was still and quiet. Most of the other trainers had already moved their horses to Del Mar for the summer meet. Between her barn and the one next door, a groom was walking a sleek mahogany bay colt. They paused at the water bucket, and the colt took a drink, then turned his narrow, elegant blaze and his large, expressive eyes toward us. "That's the big horse," said Alexis. "That's their horse."
 "AtswhatImtalknbout?" 
 "Yeah." 
He strode on, deliberate in the heat, the racehorse the "Seabiscuit" movie people bought a piece of just before he ran in this year's Kentucky Derby. His head was splendid, his neck curved perfectly, his walk was sinuous, his tail flowed long and silky. He was the picture of thoroughbred class. He didn't have a part in the movie.
What we were waiting for was the party to begin, the fundraising preview last month of "Seabiscuit" the movie, and soon enough, it did, at the restaurant the jockey George Woolf once owned, the Derby. The restaurant was jammed. A big black bus called the Presidential had brought one party up from Del Mar, and a 36-foot black Hummerlimousine had brought in another group. It looked not so much like a vehicle; more like a building. The jockey Chris McCarron, neat as you please in a champagne-colored sportshirt and shorts, greeted us at the door and handed us our favor -- a poster of the movie and a box containing three model horses, Seabiscuit, War Admiral and Pumpkin, the Biscuit's faithful companion. The food was jockey food -- smoked salmon, fruit, no bread or crackers. The crowd was an owners crowd, which means moneyed, but horsey. The men looked vaguely Republican, with a tinge of Vegas -- very smooth creased slacks and bright sportshirts, highly pressed. The women were lean and weathered, no chemical peels in evidence. No one said anything about the movie. What was there to say? It had all been said for them in the racing press, which had been hyping the movie since the spring with ads, articles and come-ons. Even The Daily Racing Form had put out a special flyer. All the hype suddenly seemed a little beneath this crowd, who were, after all, plenty sophisticated and plenty experienced, with a natural demeanor hopeful and skeptical in equal measure.
We went to the movie in buses. Those of us who had paid bottom dollar ($150) sat below the screen and gaped upward, which might have given us a jaded, or at least a dizzied view of the picture. More generous ones (and racing people are wonderfully generous) got reserved seats in the upper tiers. We filled two theaters and were told by the trainer Jenine Sahadi that we had ponied up 50,000 simoleons for laid-up jockeys, exercise riders and equine research. I was impressed.
It took 20 minutes to get to a horse, but when it did, the audience sighed audibly and settled into their seats. It was a mature audience. We remembered that there had been a Great Depression perfectly well and even recognized the picture of F.D.R. that accompanied Professor McCullough's explanation of the New Deal. I began to wonder just whom this "Seabiscuit" was aimed at. For a while it seemed aimed at the Bush administration and tax-cut economics.
The audience was patient. We knew horses were coming, and they did, but it wasn't until the entrance of Gary Stevens, making his acting debut as the jockey George Woolf, that we whooped and hooted and clapped in delight. After the death of the son of the rich Buick dealer Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), the abandonment of the young jockey Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) by his parents and the crash of the stock market, Gary Stevens's vibrant grace and energy livened things up quite a bit. 
We were suckers for the horses. When lazy old Seabiscuit stretched out for a nap in his pasture, we cooed. When Seabiscuit and Pumpkin curled up together with the dog, we chuckled. During the racing scenes, we perked up. The sound was especially good -- the jockeys spoke clearly amid the booming hooves and music was dispensed with. The horses blew and sweated -- you could hear that and almost feel it. A couple of the races lasted as long as real races -- a daring choice on the part of the filmmakers, but exciting and fun. My favorite moment was just before the start of the match race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral, when McCarron and Stevens, mounted on their horses, were on the screen at the same time. They had that look that great jockeys always have -- strong and lithe and intent. My trainer's favorite moment was right at the end, a long-shot from the middle of the track, down the harrowed stretch, past the finish line to the first turn. She said, "I've seen that so many times, hundreds of times galloping horses out there. It brought tears to my eyes."
During the closing credits, there was a lot of applause but even so, reviews were mixed (as they were when the real movie critics weighed in, too). One veterinarian and his family sat around until midnight, exclaiming over the movie. Gary Stevens told The Thoroughbred Times that he cried for two-and-a-half hours after he saw it. One man who was on our bus said that after all the hype, he expected it to be a lot better, and one woman told me: "The racing scenes were great, weren't they? But otherwise not enough drama." She was right. Somehow, the Jeff Bridges/Tobey Maguire/Chris Cooper story just didn't jell.
Perhaps they were too worthy. For one thing, Jeff Bridges as Seabiscuit's owner never does anything robber-baronish or even selfish. In the middle of the Depression, he refuses to lay off his workers. He makes speeches about the common man. He is not Ken Lay, Enron's former C.E.O. Samuel Riddle (played by Eddie Jones), the wealthy East Coast owner of War Admiral and Seabiscuit's enemy, is Ken Lay. I wouldn't have been surprised to hear that in addition to avoiding a race with Seabiscuit and insulting California racing, he is stealing pension plans on the side. But our self-made man, our cowboy trainer, our impoverished, beat-up jockey and our tiny horse gave off just a whiff of deadening Socialist realism. Too much high-mindedness and not enough drama.
THE next morning on the track, the post-mortem was more irreverent. "Can you imagine," said one trainer, "having the owner around all the time like that?" The other trainers shook their heads. "You know what Eddie said," my trainer recalled, referring to the late, great trainer Eddie Gregson. "He said about some guy: 'He's the best kind of owner. He's dead.' "
"We're too picky," said my vet. "So what if Tobey Maguire doctored the wrong leg when he had Seabiscuit out walking in the grass? So what if a vet would never go into a horse's stall alone and never come out and offer to euthanize a horse with a bowed tendon? That's Hollywood. Regular people won't notice. They'll like it. It's the best movie they ever made about racing."
As I said, racing people are generous. One man walked by and said: "Did you hear? The horse that played Seabiscuit, the one they auctioned for charity and got $13,000? He won his race at Ruidoso Downs yesterday." We all smiled.
I wondered about that horse, a little bay, the star of the movie. If it had been my movie, I would have had the camera linger over his face and body as if he were the most beautiful starlet in the world. I would have cut the history lesson to a minimum and shown the horse walking around the ring as if he were the big horse, swinging his head and flicking his ears, lazily switching his tail. I would have shown the light reflecting off his blooming coat and gotten regular people to understand that even before they win, we love them.

Cuba Tour Companies Add New (Last) Trips

BYLINE:  By SUSAN CATTO 

 BODY:
Time is running out for groups offering educational trips to Cuba. Since 1999, when the United States government began licensing companies to take groups on people-to-people educational exchanges, an estimated 50,000 Americans have participated in study trips to Cuba. But in March, the Treasury Department announced that it would no longer grant or renew educational-travel licenses unrelated to academic coursework. Many permits have already expired; the rest will run out by early next year. 
 "The bottom line with this particular license is it was frequently abused for travel that related to little more than tourism," said Taylor Griffin, a spokesman for the Treasury Department. 
 Many tour companies and cultural institutions regret the change of policy. "It's a shame," said Harriet Friedlander, whose company, Academic Arrangements Abroad, has planned Cuban trips for the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Folk Art Museum. "I would think the best thing we could do for the Cuban people would be to have cultured Americans interested in their country there for them to talk to. That whole chain of contacts will be gone with the abolition of these licenses." 
 Groups that still have valid licenses are rushing to add new departures to their schedules. The following are among those programs with space remaining. 
 The Center for Cuban Studies, (212) 242-0559, www.cubaupdate.org, a New York-based research group, offers weeklong Cuba Update trips examining the country's political, economic, religious and artistic institutions. Trips depart from New York City on Sept. 6, Oct. 11 and Nov. 8 and cost $2,500 a person for double rooms and $2,700 for singles. The Center also offers itineraries focusing on performing arts (Sept. 13 to 20; Oct. 18 to 25; Nov. 22 to 29), film (Sept. 20 to 27), architecture (Oct. 18 to 26) and the visual arts (Nov. 1 to 10; Nov. 10 to 20). Rates include air fare and some meals. 
 Elderhostel, (877) 426-8056, www.elderhostel.org, offering trips to travelers 55 and over (and younger companions), has four Cuba programs and more than 15 departures scheduled between October and December. There is a waiting list for double rooms on all trips, but single rooms are still available. The 11-night Cuba: Key to the Americas trip visits Havana, Vinales and Santiago de Cuba; participants study the country's cultural, geographical, agricultural and religious history. Eight departure dates are available between Oct. 20 and Dec. 8; the single-room rate is $3,375. A tour called An Exploration into Cuban Culture and History goes to Santa Clara, Trinidad and Havana and focuses on political, economic and cultural history. Five departures are offered between Nov. 8 and Dec. 6; single rooms are $3,101. Rates include air fare from Cancun and all meals. 
 Insight Cuba, (800) 935-2822, www.insightcuba.org, a program of the international volunteer organization Cross-Cultural Solutions, has more than 20 trips remaining. A one-week Havana-based jazz trip departs Sept. 13, Oct. 11, Nov. 8 and Dec. 13; prices start at $2,299 a person, double occupancy, including air fare from Miami, a Cuban visa and two meals a day; single supplement $175. Perspective, a two-week cultural tour, visits Havana, Pinar del Rio, Santa Clara, Trinidad, Remedios and Santiago de Cuba. Departures are Sept. 20, Oct. 25, Nov. 15, Dec. 6 and Dec. 13; rates start at $2,899, double occupancy, including two meals a day but not air fare or visa; single supplement $490. There is also a one-week Perspective trip departing Sept. 6, Oct. 18, Nov. 22, Dec. 6and Dec. 20; $1,799 a person, including two meals a day but not air fare or visa; single supplement, $245. 
 The National Trust for Historic Preservation, (800) 944-6847, Web site www.nationaltrust.org, offers a study tour called Cuba: Its Culture and Its People from Oct. 10 to 17. Participants explore the architecture of Havana, Trinidad, the Valley of the Sugar Mills and Cienfuegos. Tours depart from Miami and cost $3,975 a person based on double occupancy, with a $380 single supplement; membership in the National Trust costs $20. Rates include most meals but not air fare. 
 SalsaDanceCuba.org, (877) 912-3118, based in Boulder, Colo., will hold a dance and percussion program in Havana from Nov. 22 to 29. Cuban instructors will teach salsa and contemporary Latin dance and percussion techniques; cultural classes, dances and excursions to local nightclubs are also on the itinerary. The tour departs from Miami and costs $1,849 a person, double occupancy, or $2,099 for a single room. Rates include air fare from Miami and all meals. SUSAN CATTO

As Numbers of Screeners Fall, Airport Lines Grow

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
PASSENGER traffic at the airports is rising a bit, because of the season and the end of major combat in Iraq, but the number of security screeners is falling, as the Transportation Security Administration "rightsizes" itself to fit budget mandates. One result is longer lines at the checkpoints.
 The T.S.A. had set a goal of no more than a 10-minute wait before a passenger enters the screening process. Robert Johnson, an agency spokesman, said that the average is around that. But "average" can hide the extremes, and airport officials say that lines can extend for more than an hour. The Atlanta, Denver, Des Moines, Fort Lauderdale, Pittsburgh, Phoenix and Seattle-Tacoma airports, among others, have sometimes seen very long waits, up to an hour and a half at Hartsfield-Atlanta, for example. 
 At Seattle-Tacoma, on two weekends in May the lines were so long that at times, "you'd walk in, in to the ticket counter, then back out to the garage to get on line," said Bob Parker, a spokesman for Sea-Tac. The problem, he said, was caused by a lack of screeners.
 Sea-Tac took matters into its own hands, Mr. Parker said. It hired airport personnel to replace some T.S.A. workers, "the ones who say, 'Good morning, thanks for flying, those look like Rockport shoes, they've all got steel shanks, put them in the X-ray,"' said Mr. Parker. That made the agency workers available to actually screen passengers. The airport also continuously monitors line length, and sometimes recommends to the agency that it shift screeners from a checkpoint with no line to another where a line is building, he said. The cost, $150,000 a month, will come out of airport revenues and will eventually be paid by travelers through airport charges, he said.
 After long lines developed this spring at Denver International Airport, Diana DeGette, who represents that city in Congress, sent a complaint letter to Tom Ridge, the homeland security secretary, calling for temporary assignment of extra screeners there and a delay in scheduled cutbacks. 
"These delays are intolerable and could harm both the regional economy and the airline industry," she said in a statement. "Of even greater concern, the long lines and personnel shortages put unnecessary pressure on screeners and on security." The T.S.A. said that screeners will not be pressured by the length of the line. 
 The agency plans a 19 percent cut of passenger- and baggage-screeners at the Denver airport, part of a nationwide effort to cut 6,000 screeners that began on April 1, when there were 55,600. The cuts are supposed to be completed by Sept. 30. Announcing the cuts, the T.S.A. promised that wait times would "remain low."
 But results are obvious around the country. At Dulles International Airport near Washington on the Sunday afternoon of the Independence Day weekend, lines at the security checkpoints stretched to more than a half hour, but at one checkpoint with three scanning lanes, two of them stood empty because of a lack of personnel.
 In other places, the problem involves equipment. Mr. Johnson said that on Monday mornings the lines at Hartsfield Atlanta Airport sometimes stretched for an hour and a half, although all the lanes were staffed. In Atlanta, as at other airports, it is difficult to add more lanes for screeners. 
 Airline executives, who are reluctant to appear publicly critical of the T.S.A., say that problems have cropped up for a mix of reasons, not all of them the agency's fault. One problem is that in the rush to install baggage screening systems by Dec. 31 of last year, the deadline set by Congress, the agency resorted to screening many bags by having technicians wipe them with pads, and then analyze the pads for signs of explosives. The job could be automated by using scanning machines instead, but installing those giant machines, and the conveyor belts needed to make effective use of them, has lagged, partly for budget reasons.
 The airlines also say that the Transportation Security Administration, as a federal agency, is not as attuned to the peaks and valleys of passenger traffic as the airlines are, and has hired too many full-time workers and not enough part-timers, who could be brought in for peak periods. The agency said it is planning to hire such workers. The airlines, wary of giving up competitive information, do not provide real-time data on their passenger loads to the federal government. But lately they are trying to keep the security agency advised of passenger levels, on an airport-by-airport basis. 
 And the summer may be inherently more difficult, because of "once-a-year travelers, who bring everything but the kitchen sink on the plane," one airline executive said.

Can 'Smart Growth' Cut Parking Needs?

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
"I WANT that parking space -- and I want it now!"'
 Any New Jersey driver who frequents busy downtowns knows the feeling, says Darius Sollohub, an architecture professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, who studies parking issues. 
 "It's Friday night in Montclair, or Newark, or Jersey City, or Princeton," he said, "and all you care about at that moment is that you can't find a place to park. It's very frustrating."
The frustration translates to public pressure put on planners -- who put pressure on developers -- to provide as much new parking as possible whenever development or redevelopment occurs, Mr. Sollohub said. 
But some planners and developers working within the state's current so-called smart growth and transit-friendly policies are asking: Is the demand for parking space being reduced by these policies? If so, should state and local requirements for parkingspace actually be lowered when mass transit is available nearby?
In a city like Hoboken, where the rate of mass-transit users is high and where people mill around downtown on a Friday night rather than hover for parking spaces, Mr. Sollohub said, studies indicate only about one space per housing unit is needed. But state design standards call for nearly two spaces per unit.
In South Orange, where the 200-unit Gaslight Commons apartment complex opened last year with a required 360 parking spaces, the executive who supervised the development for Pennsylvania-based LCOR, Anthony L. Marchetta, said he now thought that was more car space than was needed.
The complex is 300 yards from a railroad station. "We took a census in our building," Mr. Marchetta said, "and found that nearly 65 percent of our residents take the train to work. About 60 percent of residents have one car, and the rest have two cars. Five people have no car."
Mr. Marchetta, who was a city planner for 13 years and who is a former member of the state Planning Commission, said he was aware of several state agencies that were beginning studies of development supported by the state's Transit Village program, which provides grants for the refurbishing of mass-transit stations and development of the areas around them. "I think that as the impact of the Transit Village and 'transit-friendly' programs is studied, it will show that much less parking is needed," he said.
THE amount of parking called for under the Residential Site Improvement Standards, set by the state Department of Community Affairs, varies with the type of apartment building, Mr. Marchetta said. For a low-rise garden apartment complex like Gaslight Commons, 1.8 spaces per one-bedroom unit and 1.9 spaces per two-bedroom unit are required. 
Seventy percent of the apartments at Gaslight Commons have one bedroom and the rest have two. There is one level of underground parking and also surface space for cars at Gaslight's two adjacent buildings. 
"If we had known going in that fewer parking spaces were needed, we could have done more with the outdoors," Mr. Marchetta said. "We would probably have been required to build the underground parking -- which is more expensive -- anyway. But right now, the only amenities out of doors are one swimming pool and one green space. We could have done more with more space."
As a developer, Mr. Marchetta said, he hates to see space wasted on unused parking. "The whole point," he said, "is to maximize use per square foot."
Mr. Marchetta worked as a planner with the city of New Brunswick and with Middlesex County before becoming a developer. He said he had often heard other developers say that parking was the biggest problem when trying to get a housing or commercial project approved in a populous northern Jersey community.
"In most cases, the only allowable solution," he said, is building a parking deck, "or going underground." He added, "There has got to be a better way."
Some new concepts and technology are entering the parking arena, noted Martin E. Robins of the Voorhees Transportation Institute at Rutgers University, who has worked with both New Jersey Transit and the state Department of Transportation in evaluating the impact of transit-related development. He mentioned a robotic parking structure in Hoboken that opened last year and uses computerized technology to park cars.
Extensively used in Europe, according to Mr. Sollohub, the architecture professor, roboticized structures cost roughly a third more to build than structures of similar capacity , but occupy much less land. The seven-story Garden Street Garage built by Robotic Parking System in Hoboken provides 312 spaces on a 100-foot-square lot. Cars are automatically assigned spaces, moved to them on pallets, and retrieved the same way.
In downtown Newark, where parking is always at a premium, two developers have been wondering if historic Washington Park might be dug up and reconstructed with parking underneath. "I was up on a roof one day, looking down at the people driving around looking for a spot," said Christian Benedetto of National Redevelopment, "and it hit me: Why not dig the way they did when they redeveloped Military Park a few blocks away?" 
Mr. Benedetto said he and Steven Greenberg of Heritage Management Company had "kicked the idea around," but not pursued it in earnest, partly because they thought the cost of construction and reconstruction might be prohibitive.
In Montclair, the idea of "shared parking" seems to be working well, in Mr. Sollohub's view. He has written a proposal to study parking around mass transit centers, including the lot adjacent to the Walnut Street railroad station in Montclair, in order to examine how design strategy can reduce the amount of parking needed.
At the Walnut Street station area developed by Steven Plofker -- who has also been named a co-developer of the former Hahne's department store site in downtown Montclair -- a parking lot serving rail commuters during the workday is shared by visitors to the soccer dome Mr. Plofker built next door to the station and by visitors to restaurants and shops along Walnut Street after commuters have gone home.
Walnut Street lies south of Montclair's downtown and is not as congested as the town's main artery, Bloomfield Avenue. In the downtown area, construction of a parking deck is scheduled to begin soon and both underground and surface space will be added when the Hahne's redevelopment project gets under way.
Montclair's township planner, Karen Kadus, said that the parking requirements for the Hahne's site were still being debated and refined, but currently stand at 1.3 spaces per apartment unit and 2.5 spaces per 1,000 square feet of commercial property. "Whatever it is, some people will say it's not enough," she said.
Mr. Sollohub, who lives in neighboring Glen Ridge, predicted continuing parking issues for Montclair and any town that tries to "build its way out of congestion."
"With transportation infrastructure," he said, "we've come to know that the more you provide, the more it becomes saturated. Like with traffic on the highway, if you add more lanes, then traffic increases. Parking is the same."
Mr. Marchetta, the planner and developer, said he was surprised at how few experts in parking theory and design there were in this country. "There is little knowledge concerning how public policies and grants really could reduce parking," he said. "Decisions are made by hundreds and hundreds of local planning boards in New Jersey, many of which have little familiarity with these issues."
"There needs to be more serious research," Mr. Marchetta added, "so we can all get a handle on this."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/New Dorp; 
Convenience Near Staten Island's Shore

BYLINE:  By JANICE FIORAVANTE

 BODY:
"WE spent a year and a half looking for a home, but we kept coming back to New Dorp," in part because of its convenient location, said Kevin Carney, who bought a five-bedroom ranch on Jacques Street in November 2001 for $360,000. 
 Mr. Carney notes that he and his wife, Joan, were drawn to the convenience of the train to the ferry, the express bus to Manhattan and shopping. In addition, it is just 20 minutes from Bay Ridge, where their parents live. In fact, the neighborhood reminds Mr. Carney a bit of Brooklyn, but the houses are not as close together. 
 Indeed, a block from the main commercial thoroughfares, the streets have a very residential character with stately trees, well-kept lawns and comfortable-looking homes. "I like its tree-lined streets and the detached houses -- ours is on a 50-by-100-foot lot," And the local elementary school, Public School 41, is around the corner, when the Carneys' son, 4 and daughter, 2, are ready. 
Twenty-five years ago, Joseph Markowski was drawn by similar considerations when he moved to New Dorp. "We had a two-year-old daughter, and my wife, Marie, was pregnant with our second daughter," he recalled. "We liked the location because it's convenient to stores; the train for public transportation is close by; and over the years, this has helped keep us here -- and the nice people in the community, too."
The midisland setting on the eastern shoreline also has its drawbacks. "The most dangerous intersection on Staten Island for traffic accidents is right in the center of the neighborhood at New Dorp Lane and Hylan Boulevard," said Mr. Markowski, president of the New Dorp Central Civic Association. The group's main concern, he said, is overdevelopment, which translates to more traffic. 
"It's a struggle, and the accelerated pace of building over the past year or two has made it more apparent," he explained. Increasingly, older homes are being purchased to be knocked down and replaced by two, four, even six semidetached homes, he said.
"It means where there may have been one, two or three cars to the one house, now there are that many multiplied by the number of houses," Mr. Markowski continued.
The recent flurry of construction is being attributed to a community zoning change that is expected to be enacted in November or December that would make it impossible to build attached housing. An environmental impact study is still being prepared. The proposed regulation would ultimately allow only one- or two-family detached homes to be built on Staten Island, rather than semidetached or town houses. "There has been a rush to build semidetached homes before the change goes into effect," said Edward Bruno, broker at Wolfe Realty.
Mr. Bruno added that there is considerable uncertainty about how this downzoning will affect home prices, but conventional wisdom is that prices may drop sharply in the short term because single-family homes will no longer be sought by developers aiming to build multiunit projects. "A house that sold for $700,000 would probably sell for only $400,000 to $450,000 next year," Mr. Bruno said. 
City Councilman James Oddo said that while the zoning change would offer less economic incentive for "teardowns," it would still afford the opportunity to build two detached houses on a lot, right up to the property line. This "is the soft underbelly of downzoning," he said. "It means new density problems." He expects the Task Force on Overdevelopment on the Island, which has been appointed by the mayor, to address this.
WHERE new homes have been constructed, prices have been rising, Mr. Bruno said. "There were six town houses built on Winham Avenue a year and a half ago that sold for $300,000," he said. "Today, they're worth $379,000." 
The town houses are in New Dorp Beach, the area closest to the Atlantic Ocean, one of four subdistricts in the community. The others are New Dorp Heights, the northern tip of the neighborhood; the commercial district, which centers on New Dorp Lane, New Dorp Plaza and Hylan Boulevard; and the older tree-lined central area, surrounding the Staten Island Railway station.
New Dorp Beach, with summer bungalows modified to be year-round homes, is next to Miller Field, part of Gateway National Recreation Area, which was an airfield before and during World War II. The park is used today for soccer, baseball, softball and other recreation. "Saturdays, Miller Field is packed with thousands of kids and their parents," Mr. Markowski said.
A representative street in the area is Seafoam Street, so narrow that only one car can navigate it. Tightly packed small bungalows line its sidewalks.
New Dorp Heights is the hilly inland part of the community bounded by the greenery of the Moravian Cemetery, as well as High Rock Park Conservation Area. Colonials, Capes, ranches, high ranches and custom-built detached homes dot the area. Mr. Bruno recently sold a 43-by-100-foot lot on St. Stephens Place to a builder who plans to build a $700,000 30-by-42-foot side-hall colonial with four bedrooms and four baths. 
It sits across from the Gustave Mayer House, a New York City landmark at 2475 Richmond Road. According to "Holden's Staten Island," a new book by the borough historian, Richard Dickenson, it was built in 1855 or 1856 in the Italian villa style, a boxy, massive home with an arcaded porch, deep-bracketed eaves and a square cupola. Mr. Mayer was a confectioner who invented the sugar wafer. The home is still privately owned. 
The Heights are also home to the New Dorp Light House, a privately owned home at 25 Boyle Street. This 1854 clapboard cottage contains a tall square tower. For 90 years, the lighthouse, also known as Moravian Light, served as a beacon for ships. 
The central area is an older part of New Dorp with large trees canopying the streets. Here the homes are 70 to 80 years old and include Tudors, ranches and colonials. Several Tudor homes with four apartments per building are at Clawson Street and Beach Avenue. And Tysen's Park Apartments on Tysen's Lane is the only large-scale apartment development; it is a federally subsidized 1,006-unit complex in eight six-story buildings.
The commercial district, running from Tysens Lane to New Dorp Lane on Hylan Boulevard, includes Hylan Shopping Plaza with a Pathmark supermarket, a Kmart, movie theaters and a Toys "R" Us. The New Dorp Post Office, SportsFest, Bowling on the Green, the Gap and Starbucks are other outlets on a shopping corridor that stretches between Hylan Boulevard and Mill Road.
Along New Dorp Lane are the recently refurbished New Dorp Regional Library; a number of restaurants, including La Strada, Taste of India, King's Chef, the French Tart bakery and cafe, and Sedutto's ice cream parlor; and an array of local stores like the Luggage Shop, and Hidden Cottage Hill of Beans for coffee, teas and gift baskets. A rehabilitation project about five years ago added small, old fashioned street lights and new sidewalks "to give a small-town feel to the Lane," Mr. Markowski said.
Residents express considerable satisfaction with schools in the neighborhood. P.S. 41 on Clawson Street, which had 737 students this past year, offers prekindergarten through Grade 5. In 2003, 74.2 percent of students in the third, fourth and fifth grade were at or above grade level in language arts, while 75 percent of students in the third and fifth grades, and 73.3 percent for Grade 4, met or exceeded math standards. The New York City Council Sports and Arts Summer Camp free program is in full swing through Aug. 7, offering handball, hip hop dancing, aerobics, lacrosse, soccer, double dutch and basketball.
The George L. Egbert Intermediate School 2 on Midland Avenue, with 1,200 students last year, had an unusually large graduating class in June, 408 students. The school has been experiencing rapid growth; in past years graduating classes averaged around 300. The school serves a diverse population of students, with 28 languages spoken, including Uzbek, Urdu and Hindi. A Mid-Island Beacon Program allows students to use the school until 10 p.m., for tutoring, sports and homework assistance. 
Staten Island Technical High School at 485 Clawson Street, with 715 students, is a college prep school that accepts students on the basis of test scores and grades. Almost all of its 2003 graduating class of 170 will be attending college. The school specializes in math, science and engineering; offers Russian as its only foreign language; and runs exchange programs with Russia. The new principal, Vincent Maniscalco, has expanded the performing arts programs with dance studios and band programs. This past spring, students offered "Bat Boy" as their musical production.
New Dorp High School, at 465 New Dorp Lane, with 1,800 students, offers advanced placement courses in biology, calculus and history. It has a Future Teachers Academy, where seniors take education courses at St. John's University and the College of Staten Island; an Institute for the Arts, which includes drama, music and art; an American studies and law program; and an Executive Intern program for students to spend a semester outside the classroom as interns to executive sponsors in business. Of 360 graduating seniors, 85 percent will attend four-year colleges and 10 percent will go to two-year colleges.
Religious schools in the neighborhood are Our Lady Queen of Peace, offering kindergarten through eighth grade, and the Christian Academy, offering prekindergarten to Grade 8.
New Dorp, originally Nieuwe Dorp, which means new town, dates to the 1670's, when Dutch Walloon and French Huguenot farmers moved here looking for more fertile land. It remained in the hands of large landholders until late in the 19th century, when more homes and businesses were established.

The development is named the Rose and Crown after a tavern that stood there from 1665 to 1854. A plaque diagonally across New Dorp Lane from the condos notes that at the tavern, the Declaration of Independence was read to British officers on July 9, 1776. During the Revolutionary War, the British general William Howe is said to have had his headquarters in the area. Some accounts say he was in the Rose and Crown and others place him in the Black Horse Tavern nearby. Map of Staten Island highlighting New Dorp.

HEADLINE: Surge in Mortgage Activity Creates New Work, for Now 

BYLINE:  By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU

 BODY:
AS a salesman for a San Francisco software company that made products for the energy industry, Kevin Krueger was in a career tied to two struggling industries. So it came as no surprise in October when he and the bulk of the company's sales staff received pink slips. With dim job prospects in technology, Mr. Krueger, 32, decided to focus on growth industries. 
 After a trip back to the East Coast to visit his family, Mr. Krueger contacted Champion Mortgage. In December, he became a loan officer in the company's office in Parsippany, N.J. 
 "It was easy for me to transfer my skills in finance and sales to mortgages," said Mr. Krueger, who worked as a broker before jumping into high tech. He said he was on track to exceed the six-figure income he earned when software sales were strong. "Everybody always needs a home," he said.
At a time when many financial firms, particularly those on Wall Street, are cutting back, low interest rates have sparked an explosion in home purchases and refinancing, and companies that provide or process mortgages are expanding rapidly. 
The boom could well be short lived. With interest rates rising sharply, mortgage refinancing activity has slowed in the last few weeks. In mid-July, as rates were climbing, the Mortgage Bankers Association released a study predicting that mortgage lending would reach a record $3.4 trillion this year but drop to $1.9 trillion in 2004 and $1.5 trillion in 2005. Still, the current demand for mortgages is leading many mortgage companies in the greater New York area and throughout the United States to seek workers to keep up with the demand for loans, say economists and others watching the industry. This is particularly true for companies focused on new mortgages rather than refinancing, they said.
Nationwide, mortgage-related jobs jumped nearly 16 percent, to 353,700 in 2002, up from 297,200 jobs in 2001, according to the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. And the industry added 22,800 jobs from January through May, according to preliminary figures from the bureau.
Job postings in the real estate category on Monster.com, the online job listing service, increased 61 percent from June 2002 to this June, and rose 15 percent over the last month of that period, said Kevin Mullins, a spokesman for the company.
"You can thank Alan Greenspan" for the low interest rates, said Michael A. Goldstein, associate professor of finance at Babson College in Babson Park, Mass. "It's been a massive subsidy for themortgage industry and the mortgage people are making a boatload of money."
If rates stay relatively low, Mr. Goldstein said, the mortgage sector will continue to be one of the economy's employment bright spots.
In the New York area, companies seeking new employees are willing to pay anywhere from $25,000 for entry-level data processing jobs to $70,000 and up for underwriters.
The New York Mortgage Company, a privately owned mortgage lender, wants to add 150 workers to its Manhattan offices and another 40 in Melville on Long Island, according to Steve Schnall, president and chief executive. The company recently tripled its office space. 
"For the last several years the mortgage industry has been robust and we've been hiring aggressively, but in the last 24 months, and in particular the last 6 months, things have taken off," Mr. Schnall said. "The biggest challenge is finding qualified staff because there's so much competition among banks and mortgage lenders."
Adding to the staff, he said, has become a full-time effort this year, and for the first time the company has sought the help of recruiters. The competition has also driven up salaries about 10 percent across the board since last year, he said.
Claudette Greenstein, 32, came to New York Mortgage in January and is working at the company's office in Bridgehampton, after time spent in magazine and newspaper advertising sales. "After Sept. 11, the publishing industry went down drastically," she said. This year, she said, she expects to make 25 percent to 30 percent more than she was making in publishing last year.
Marcia Kaufman, the chief operating officer of Preferred Empire Mortgage, which is based in Melville, said the company would like to hire 80 workers to add to a staff of 95. In 2000, Preferred had only 30 employees.
There are a jumble of titles in the mortgage business, and similar jobs sometimes have different names. At some companies, a mortgage broker may handle some of the paperwork involved in the mortgage process, while other companies have a team of processors and closing coordinators to expedite the process.
Michael Mahfouz, northeast divisional manager and senior vice president of G.M.A.C. Mortgage, based in Horsham, Pa., said he liked to promote from the entry-level clerical ranks when seeking mortgage processors and closers. Processors, who can make $40,000 with overtime, are required to have a high school degree but most have finished college, said Mr. Mahfouz, who oversees retail lending and staff in the Northeast. 
Marcell Jones, 24, was a receptionist for an entertainment company for three years and joined New York Mortgage in January as an auditor in the post-closing department. "I knew nothing about mortgages," she said. To learn the ropes, Ms. Jones spent two months working side by side with another auditor in her department. She is now making $16 an hour, compared with the $11 an hour she was making as a receptionist.
The flush times in the mortgage business will not last indefinitely, particularly if interest rates continue their upward climb. Professor Goldstein of Babson College likened the growth in the mortgage industry to the Internet bubble.
"Once the rates go up, and the big volume of refinances stops, the Ferris wheel will stop," he said. Many companies will then begin to lay off workers, he said, as many did in 1999 and 2000 when rates hovered around 8 percent and demand for mortgages was limited. 
But many workers in today's job market have come to expect volatility. "No one can say what you'll be doing for the rest of your career," said Mr. Krueger, the former software sales representative. "Right now," he said about the mortgage business, "it's a great place to be."

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF; 
West Meets East at a Japanese Bank

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
JUST when you thought there was little more to say about Japan's enfeebled banks, along comes "Saving the Sun: A Wall Street Gamble to Rescue Japan From Its Trillion-Dollar Meltdown" (HarperBusiness, $26.95), by Gillian Tett.
 Ms. Tett, the former Tokyo bureau chief of The Financial Times, has pulled together a highly readable account of the collapse of the Long-Term Credit Bank and its subsequent purchase by a group of Western investors. 
 The timing of the book could not be much better. After years of declaring that Japan's banks were healthy and on the road to recovery, the Japanese government in May was forced to engineer a 2 trillion yen ($17 billion) bailout of the nation's fifth-largest lender, Resona Holdings. As the recent events suggest, financial regulators continue to grapple with a banking crisis. 
In her account, told with an eye for detail and the personal drama of the bankers involved, behavior by the Long-Term Credit Bank was typical of banks geared toward rebuilding Japan rather than bolstering profit. By the 1970's, when that job was completed, the banks had to find ways other than traditional lending to make money. That involved disastrous forays into real estate, stocks and other speculative assets.
The party, of course, came to a halt when interest rates rose and stock and property prices crashed in 1990. But Japan is still dealing with a legacy: the inability of bankers and the policy makers who regulated them to grasp the enormity of the economic consequences. This book reminds us of those missteps and how years of inaction and denial are still destroying wealth and the economy.
The retelling of this history takes up about the first half of the book, which may prove too long for some. More relevant is the second half, which concerns the sale of the Long-Term Credit Bank in 1999 and 2000 to a group of foreign investors led by Ripplewood Holdings, a Wall Street investment bank. The firm, virtually unknown in Japan at the time, recruited heavy hitters like Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman. With no Japanese bidders willing to come to the bank's rescue, the government had little choice but to sell to Ripplewood.
Even for readers who follow Japanese business regularly, Ms. Tett sheds new light on dealings involving Ripplewood, the Long-Term Credit Bank and the government, especially the negotiations over how to value the bank's loan book, which turned out to be far worse than advertised. She also draws a compelling picture of the tension between the bank's Japanese staff and the American newcomers.
In one of the book's more vivid scenes, Vernon E. Jordan Jr., an adviser on the deal, and Ripplewood's chief executive, Timothy C. Collins, try unsuccessfully to democratize the bank's cafeteria by breaking with custom and sitting with office ladies and not with male executives. The failure of the well-intentioned but ham-fisted attempt at "Americanizing" a Japanese bank helps illustrate a huge gap in business cultures.
By comparison, the president of the new bank, Masamoto Yashiro, comes off as a hero for his ability to stand firm against the Japanese establishment but also to keep the American bankers from running roughshod. While he was not responsible for many decisions that ultimately turned around Shinsei Bank, the institution's new name, he rightly deserves praise for deftly crossing multiple political and financial minefields.
The book is entertaining reading, but its most noticeable flaw is that Ms. Tett does not offer the reader any lessons from Japan's banking mess and Shinsei's success. Readers are left to wonder whether the American bankers had the keys to solve Japan's huge problems, or whether they were merely opportunists who bought one bank cheaply and happened to turn it around.
In her introduction, Ms. Tett tells readers that she will steer clear of offering prescriptions for Japan's woes. But she also writes that "sooner or later, Japan's government needs to face up to the putrefying mess inside its banks, preferably as part of a broader, coordinated process of policy change." Economists and politicians have made this argument for years, to little effect. So, what next?
She also writes that the American banking model may not be best suited for solving Japan's problems, yet she spends so little time describing any alternative solutions (like those taken by governments in Sweden and elsewhere) that readers might assume that she endorses the American approach.
The title, too, may throw readers off. The book is really about one group of smart bankers trying to make a bundle from a distressed asset in Japan, not any coordinated effort by the Americans or anyone else to "save" Japan. While Mr. Collins and other American investors are careful to describe their objectives as "good for Japan," in the end, their priority is to produce high returns for their investors.
An American investment fund, Cerberus Capital Management, is currently making similar public reassurances as it prepares to buy a majority stake in Aozora Bank, another formerly nationalized lender. The Japanese news media and financial regulators, having learned that American investors are first and foremost after profits, have been less kind to Cerberus than to Ripplewood.
Still, as books about business in Japan go, "Saving the Sun" is among the more accessible and detailed. What it lacks in a road map for the future it more than makes up for with a worthy tale from the past.

HEADLINE: A NIGHT OUT WITH: Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx; 
When Puppets Go to Town

BYLINE:  By LINDA LEE

 BODY:
WHO thought there could be wisdom in a puppet show, much less sentiments like "There's a fine, fine line/Between love and a waste of time" and "Everyone's a little bit racist."
 The men behind these songs and their Broadway show, "Avenue Q," which opened on Thursday, were inspired by "Sesame Street." But their sensibilities are informed by Stephen Sondheim, "South Park" and, perhaps, Internet stories in which Big Bird takes crack and goes on a rampage. 
 The show, by Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx (with a book by Jeff Whitty), explores prejudice, coming out of the closet and post-Internet-boom angst -- with puppets and song. 
During intermission a week before opening, Mr. Lopez and Mr. Marx hovered in the lobby of the Golden Theater. Mr. Marx said, "I can't believe the house is full -- it's not papered anymore." Mr. Lopez said, "Eight hundred seems like so many."
Mr. Marx said, "I go $2, $2, $2, $2, $2." (Actually it's more like $1.70. But Robyn Goodman, a producer of the show, said after the opening, "They won't ever have to worry about money again.") 
They settled in for the second act, in which more wisdom was delivered: "The more you love someone/The more you want to kill 'em." The songs are sung by three humans and 11 puppets with humans visibly attached. Occasionally there were "Sesame Street"-like lessons on televisions teaching words like schadenfreude.
After the show, the humans slipped across the street to Barrymore's to grab a drink. Mr. Marx, the gay member of the songwriting team, ordered a Coke and said, "I'll drink a key lime pie." Mr. Marx, 32 and a graduate of the University of Michigan, introduced a guest as "Jamie Marx, my wife, also my sister -- we're a very close family." Mr. Lopez, 28 and a Yale graduate, introduced his fiancee, Kristen Anderson, a lyricist.
"When she found out he wasn't gay, that was a plus," Mr. Marx said.
"I knew one was straight," she said, "and one was gay, and when he started talking about his lover, I went, 'Yes!' "
She and Mr. Lopez live in Astoria, Queens, drive a 1989 Buick and survive on fast food. They discussed low-rent dining with a passion that could easily turn into a song in the show. "When we drive through and order," she said, "they never get it right. 'We'll take eight Egg McMuffins,' and then you open the bag, it's like, 'What is this?' "
Jordan Gelber, an actor, asked, "Have you tried the mini doughnuts yet?" The group pondered whether the government required milk in a McDonald's McFlurry. Which led to ice cream from the Cold Stone Creamery, on West 42nd Street. "You can order cake-batter taste and strawberries, and they fold it in," John Tartaglia, the star of the show, said. "It is beyond the best."
Ms. Marx said, "It's open until 12!" Mr. Tartaglia said, "But the line is huge."
"Let's see how they do in the winter," Mr. Gelber said, sagely.
Mr. Tartaglia, 25, also a resident of Astoria, is Princeton, the lead yuppie puppet, as well as Rod, the gay-but-he-doesn't-know-it puppet who sings "My Girlfriend, Who Lives in Canada." (A sample lyric: "Her name is Alberta! She lives in Vancouver!") 
Mr. Lopez said: "Have you seen the chat groups? It's all about how hot you are."
In one number, the cast passes a hat in the audience. "One night we got a $20 bill," Mr. Gelber said. During previews, he said, they received two Sudafed capsules, condoms and a piece of paper with a phone number and the words "Call me, Johnny."
There were material advantages to the show's closing Off Broadway: the two 38-inch television sets used on stage that Mr. Marx and Mr. Lopez bought for $300 each. It turned out -- another lesson that cries out for a song -- that there were indeed false economies. They moved the sets themselves. "Bobby's back went out carrying the TV up the stairs," said Ms. Anderson, who is to marry Mr. Lopez on Oct. 12.
Mr. Marx said, "They were 200 pounds each."
He looked fondly at Mr. Lopez and Ms. Anderson. "And," he said, "they don't have cable. So they've got 38 inches of static."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
EconomicsCan't Solve Everything, Can It?

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
RARELY have the limits of economics been more clearly delineated than in last week's reports of a proposed futures market for terrorism.
 The Pentagon has been trying to find ways to know the unknowable. Where are terrorists likely to attack? When, and how? Not surprisingly for an administration with such professed trust in the power of markets, the experts came up with the notion of an open exchange. 
 Anonymous investors would bet on the prospects for various kinds of attacks by buying and selling futures. Correct bidders would receive a payment of $1 a future if an attack actually took place. To the extent that the investors could reasonably appraise rumors and intelligence, the prices to claim those payments would hint at the likelihood of terrorism. 
The Pentagon's researchers did not quite think things through, however. While an investor's objective might be to make money, the objective of a terrorist is for an attack to succeed. Therefore, a terrorist might bet a huge amount of money that a bombing would occur on Wednesday, then explode the bomb on Tuesday. Flummoxing the government and disrupting an otherwise useful market could be worth millions of dollars.
This problem was noted by two senators in a letter to retired Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter, who oversaw the program. But far more senators vented moral outrage at the mere idea of the program, which Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, called "profiting on death." The program, which cost $3 million, was quickly terminated.
The controversy clearly shows that there is a line in society that economics, or economic thinking, must not cross. Yet that line is moving.
Two years ago, a study commissioned by Philip Morris from Arthur D. Little, a consulting firm, suggested that the Czech government might benefit from smokers' premature deaths. With fewer years to live, smokers would require smaller pension benefits, the study reported.
Fury from both sides of the Atlantic followed the release of the finding, which Philip Morris's European spokesman called a "classical economic study." To economists and experts in health policy, the reaction was not new. They had been reviled years earlier for devising measures like the "value of a statistical life year" and "quality-adjusted life years" to assess everything from new vaccines to nuclear disasters.
In recent times, however, economists and political pundits alike have begun to speak earnestly about the dollar value of a human life. Increasingly, they must.
For example, with Medicare facing a deficit of trillions of dollars, hard choices must be made about how much care to extend to the very old and very sick. Should tens of thousands of dollars be spent on prolonging the life of an 80-year-old by a few days, instead of on educating a class of 8-year-olds?
The answer might depend on whether it's your own 80-year-old grandmother or all the 80-year-olds in the nation. The need for an economic viewpoint often arises, and its acceptance often occurs when a decision moves from the level of an individual to that of the collective. It might be intolerable to consider unhooking a relative from life support systems just to save money, but governments might choose -- as several have -- to limit end-of-life care to face up to the challenges of an aging society.
The same logic applies to malpractice lawsuits. A jury might believe that the victim of a botched operation deserves millions of dollars in compensation, but what if every jury acted the same way? Surgeons watching their insurance premiums jump might refuse to operate altogether, as they did last winter in West Virginia. At some point, the costs and benefits must be weighed.
BACK to the market for terrorist attacks. Plainly, it was an idea whose time had not come. But that does not mean all such ideas should be rejected. Markets can reveal information about subjects as diverse as art and politics, and even snippets of information are better than nothing.
One evening in college, a friend would not let me leave the dining hall without admitting that economics was basically a glorified form of weather forecasting. After some weak arguments against his point, I had to concede that much of economics was, indeed, devoted to predicting outcomes that could almost never be known for sure. But then, I asked, wasn't it better to know the chance of rain and bring an umbrella than risk being soaked?
Having some imprecise idea of what might happen, or what something is worth, is usually better than having no clue at all. Heeding that rationale, in what will be my last column for a while, I encourage you to let a little more economics into your life. And don't mind that queasy feeling -- you'll get used to it.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: A. Lanny Thorndike; 
Century Small Cap Select Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
When he evaluates potential investments for the $60 million Century Small Cap Select fund, A. Lanny Thorndike says, he looks as closely at a company's balance sheet as he does at its income statement.
 He seeks companies with steadily growing earnings and solid finances, emphasizing two criteria. These are return on equity (net income divided by shareholders' equity) and book value (assets minus liabilities). Good companies, he said, often deliver both a consistent return on equity of more than 15 percent a year and annual increases of at least 15 percent in book value. 
 "If a company has a big nonrecurring charge or makes a mediocre acquisition, it can sometimes deliver a short-term growth in earnings, but you can't typically improve tangible book value over a short time," Mr. Thorndike said from his office, in Boston. He also tracks a company's leverage by reviewing its ratio of debt to total capitalization over extended periods. By contrast, return on capital -- a measure preferred by many money managers -- reflects current leverage but won't show whether a company has been increasing its debt burden, Mr. Thorndike said.
The fund gained 17.9 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, ranking in the top 1 percent of funds that buy small growth stocks. That category lost 9.2 percent, on average, in the same period, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 10.3 percent, according to Morningstar.
The fund gained 29 percent in the 12 months through Thursday, compared with an 18.9 percent gain for its group and a 10.5 percent loss in the S.& P. 500, according to Morningstar.
Mr. Thorndike, 37, is chief investment officer for Century Capital Management, the fund's investment adviser, which manages about $650 million for individuals and institutions.
He picks the fund's 45 to 65 stocks from among about 3,000 American companies with market capitalizations below $2 billion at the time of purchase. Each month, he screens this universe using 15 criteria that measure profitability, earnings and revenue growth and valuation.
Mr. Thorndike works with three analysts to evaluate the companies that pass the screens. They look especially closely at return on equity, but also review profit margins. "We feel that growing or shrinking profit margins are good leading indicators of stock price performance."
All potential purchases are subjected to what he calls a "stress test." "We want to consider three things that can go wrong at a company for every one thing that can go right," he said, "because it's easy to fall in love with a stock."
He buys positions equal to 3 to 5 percent of the fund's assets for companies that he considers core holdings and plans to own for 3 to 5 years. He takes smaller positions in companies that he considers opportunistic buys or wants to learn more about.
Mr. Thorndike sells shares when a company's profit margins begin to deteriorate or its revenue growth slows.
He began buying shares of the Cato Corporation in May. He paid $19.86, on average. The shares closed Friday at $24. Cato, in Charlotte, N.C., is a retailer of low-priced women's fashions, principally in the Southeast.
"THIS is a 2004 story, with Cato a potential beneficiary of a rebound in the economy," Mr. Thorndike said. He expects that its revenue will grow 7 percent in 2004 because of a mix of store openings and increased sales growth from stores open at least a year. Its return on equity has averaged 18 to 20 percent a year the last three years, and he projects an annual increase of 16 percent in its book value the next two years.
In June, Mr. Thorndike began buying shares of Covance, in Princeton, N.J., a drug development services company for the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries. He paid $18.48, on average, for shares. On Friday, Covance closed at $20.23. It dominates its market, he said, and is benefiting from outsourcing and high barriers to entry. More than half the company's revenues come from repeat customers, he added. Its return on equity has averaged 18 to 20 percent a year the last three years, and he projects a 15 to 17 percent annual increase in its book value over the next two years.
Mr. Thorndike likes Ascential Software in Westborough, Mass., which produces software that helps companies organizesales, customer, financial and other types of data from several sources in a standard format for easy analysis. The company has a strong balance sheet, good cash flow, rapidly growing revenue and expanding profit margins, Mr. Thorndike said. 
It is benefiting from a growing trend among companies to use huge amounts of data, he added. Ascential is expected to become profitable for the first time this year, he said, so it has had no return on equity. He expects its book value to grow 22 percent a year over the next two years.
The fund began buying shares in June, paying $17.56, on average, adjusted for a stock split. On Friday, shares closed at $15.93.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "California Screamin'," by William Safire (column, July 28):
 Mr. Safire claims that Gov. Gray Davis "concealed the looming budget crisis from the voters." 
 No one, including the nonpartisan California Legislative Budget Analyst, was able to forecast the size of the state's budget deficit four months before the new fiscal year began. The anticipated economic recovery predicted by the White House never materialized, leading to a continued decline in state revenues, not just in California, but throughout the nation. 
Perhaps Mr. Safire should focus his criticism on the Bush administration. It recently predicted that the federal deficit for the current fiscal year would be $150 billion more than it estimated five months ago, making it the largest deficit in our nation's history.

HEADLINE: Investing; 
Stock Prices and the Terror Factor

BYLINE:  By JOHN KIMELMAN

 BODY:
IN defense of an ill-fated plan to set up an online futures market on terrorism, the Pentagon paid homage last week to the collective wisdom of the marketplace. 
 "Research indicates that markets are extremely efficient, effective and timely aggregators of dispersed and even hidden information," the Defense Department said in a statement, explaining that it hoped to study futures prices to assess the probability of specific acts of terrorism. 
 The Pentagon bowed to a barrage of criticism and dropped its online market on Tuesday. Hapless though the project may have been, it was based on a widely held assumption that financial markets continuously assess the probability of significant economic and political events, including terrorism. 
Few people on Wall Street appear to believe that the markets can actually predict external events. "The consensus is wrong sometimes," said John Manley, a senior equity strategist with Smith Barney's global private client group. "It doesn't predict the future." But Wall Street strategists have tried to build assessments of terrorism into their stock market forecasts, even though there is some disagreement on whether the possibility of terrorism has been adequately reflected in share prices and in the asset allocations of investors. 
The consensus among strategists is, not surprisingly, that current pricing is appropriate with regard to terrorism risk. In this view, the market has overcome severe shocks caused by terrorism, war and other events in the past, and will do so again. "We all know the horror of terrorism; we all know the risk," said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market market strategist at A. G. Edwards, a St. Louis brokerage firm. "Will terrorism destroy our nation? I just don't buy it." 
He pointed to the historical record. After dropping 12 percent in the first week of trading after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rallied to finish the year 5 percent higher than at the close of business the day before the attacks. (The index is now 10.3 percent lower than its close on Sept. 10, 2001.)
And the markets were up 8.9 percent, on average, six months after 16 major terrorist events going back to 1979, including the 1993 bombing at the World Trade Center, the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and the 9/11 attacks, according to market data compiled by Ned Davis Research, of Venice, Fla.
But others contend that the terrorism risk has not been properly priced. "A lot of people on Wall Street seem to ignore the risk of terrorism, given the recent stock market rally," said Kari Bayer Pinkernell, a senior United States investment strategist with Merrill Lynch. She would not try to predict the likelihood of another attack, but she said that another incident could be more devastating than was generally appreciated. "Imagine a person going into a shopping mall or movie theater with a bomb," she said. "That could paralyze the economy."
To be sure, Merrill's current cautious stance on the stock market is tied primarily to concerns about the economy, not terrorism. But that firm, more than most of its competitors on Wall Street, is willing to factor terrorism, and what it believes to be an era of geopolitical uncertainty, into its predictions, though it cannot quantify the level of risk. 
Ms. Pinkernell said recently that for stock prices the year would probably finish about as it began, when the Dow was trading at 8,341, or slightly below that level. And stocks have only a 45 percent weighting in the firm's model portfolio, 20 percentage points below the Wall Street consensus, Ms. Pinkernell said. "Terrorism is factoring into our general concerns and helping to hold that allocation level down," she added. 
Mr. Manley, of Smith Barney, is more bullish about stocks than is Ms. Pinkernell and less concerned about the threat of terrorism. His firm gives stocks a 55 percent weighting in its model portfolio. 
"What we are moving toward is a form of inoculation from terrorism," he said. "We know that there are risks, but with confidence rising, there is a sense that we are missing too much by not being invested in the market." While conceding that further terrorism could send the stock market spiraling down, he said that the future market bottom caused by such an attack could well exceed current stock market levels.
In support of the view that current prices already reflect much of the risk of future acts of terrorism, Hugh Johnson, the chief investment officer at First Albany, said that investors' concerns appeared to be showing up in consumer confidence surveys, short selling and other investor activities that directly affect stock prices. And Jeremy J. Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said that fear of terrorism had contributed to the length of the bond rally, with many investors "still sticking with bonds" despite low yields.
MR. GOLDMAN, of A. G. Edwards, said that the market's current price-earnings multiple of roughly 28 times earnings was lower than would otherwise be expected with interest rates so low.
"The market would be higher today if we didn't have that terrorism risk," he said, "but there is no way to quantify by how much." Still, virtually all market forecasters, including Mr. Goldman, readily acknowledge that another terrorist attack, or a series of attacks, would send stocks dropping, at least short term.
"The fear contagion," Professor Siegel said, "could have a substantial effect on the markets."
Mr. Manley said he had told clients that if they were truly concerned about terrorism, they should trade in a few percentage points of stock in their portfolios for cash or gold. "But don't stop investing in stocks," he said.
Professor Siegel, author of "Stocks for the Long Run" (Third Edition, McGraw-Hill, 2002), said long-term investors should not alter their asset allocations or specific stock selections one bit. "It's not clear what form future acts of terrorism will take," he said. He said that terrorism aimed at disrupting transportation, for example, could be expected to affect a different set of companies than an act of biological terrorism.
But Milton Ezrati, a senior economic strategist at Lord Abbett, argues that investors can at least reduce their exposure to terrorism by building a stock portfolio tied to value, rather than growth, stocks. 
Speaking of value-oriented stocks, he said: "Terrorism risk only enhances their relative appeal. We are looking for companies in which you aren't paying up for a company's bright prospects. If you are worried about a shock to the system like terrorism, paying up for earnings growth could be a dangerous approach."
Currently, Mr. Ezrati sees value in a number of economically sensitive industries, including chemicals and paper. Conversely, he sees less value in traditional havens like energy and utilities. That is because many investors are not confident that the economy will be recovering strongly in the months ahead, he said.
Many forecasters contend that markets will always be vibrant enough to withstand terrorist acts. "Unless you think that the government is really going to lose control of the fight against terrorism," Mr. Ezrati said, "then every scare becomes a buying opportunity for the long term."

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Treasuries As Predictor And, Maybe, Shocker

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
THERE has been a huge shift in the bond market over the last six weeks. 
 In mid-June, yields on 10-year Treasury notes hovered just above 3 percent. By the time trading wound down on Friday, the yieldwas 4.4 percent. 
Edward Yardeni, chief investment strategist at the Prudential Equity Group, took some time last week to chat about the implications of the rise in interest rates for the economy and the stock market. Following are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. Was there a bubble in the bond market? Have we been watching the bursting of the bubble?

A. Bonds did get dramatically overbought. But much of what has happened in the last few months probably had more to do with derivative transactions related to mortgage-backed securities.
As mortgage rates declined, prepayments increased, reducing the duration of mortgage backs. Mortgage portfolio managers with certain duration requirements then had to go out and buy Treasury bonds, which pushed rates lower. They were the most aggressive buyers in May and June.
In many ways what happened is similar to what happened in the fall of 1987, when the purchase of portfolio insurance exacerbated the slide in stock prices.

Q. What set off the sell-off in bonds that has taken place over the last six weeks?

A. The announcement from the Treasury that they would need to raise $450 billion over the course of the next year started to reverse the process.
With that announcement, the bond market realized they were going to get stuffed with a lot more bonds for the sake of reviving the economy, and more parochially, for the sake of re-electing the president. 
That started to push interest rates up, and all that derivatives-related activity suddenly went into reverse.
The Federal Reserve also played a role. Alan Greenspan testified in Congress last month that some research showed that alternative methods of conducting monetary policy, like buying 10-year Treasuries to bring rates down, wasn't a good idea. That didn't help.

Q. The economy is looking a bit better and inflation is still very low. Are bonds now oversold?

A. There is a very simple way to think about the relationship between 10-year bond yields and the economy.
There is a very close correlation between the year-over-year change in nominal G.D.P. growth and 10-year bond yields. 
In the 1960's and 1970's, bond yields tended to trail growth of nominal G.D.P., because inflation fears were not there. From 1980 to now, the yield has exceeded growth in nominal G.D.P. by 1.90 percentage points. But more recently there has been a tendency for the two to be nearly identical. 
When I look at the 10-year now, I don't have a problem with a yield of 4 or 4.5 percent, because that is what I think the nominal growth rate in the economy is.

Q. Is the rise in interest rates likely to dampen the economic recovery?

A. Rather than seeing it as an imminent threat, I think it is a reflection that the economy is doing better. The risk is that bond yields keep going up, and push rates to levels that do threaten economic growth.
At that point we are looking at a real conundrum: the stimulative effects of deficit-financed tax cuts will be offset by higher long-term interest costs. This fiscal stimulus better work very quickly. If it doesn't, the bond market won't wait for another round of tax cuts financed by another round of deficits.

Q. Have bond yields risen to the point where bonds are more attractive than stocks?

A. With bond yields at between 4 percent and 4.5 percent, stocks still look relatively cheap.
We are not used to looking at the bond market as having a price-to-earnings ratio, but it really does.
At 4.5 percent, 1 divided by 4.5 is 22. Using forward earnings, the P/E ratio on the S.& P.500 right now is about 18. So stocks still look like a relatively better bet. 
It is possible the P-E's of both might converge around 20, which implies that the 10-year yield would get up to around 5 percent.

Q. So far, the stock market hasn't paid much attention to what is happening to interest rates. If rates went up another half a point in the next six weeks, would that create a problem?

A. Equity investors really don't pay enough attention to either the government or the corporate bond market.
At this point, the backup in bond yields confirms that we should expect a better economy. But if rates went up another half a point in the next six weeks, that would be a cause for worry, and might be too much of a shock for the economy and the stock market.

Investors Turn Jittery as Interest Rates Rise

BYLINE:  By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The three main stock market indexes declined last week, as investors worried about rising interest rates and uneven corporate earnings.
 Prices in the bond market plummeted and yields, which move in the opposite direction, soared. 
For July, the yield of the 10-year Treasury note rose by 0.90 percentage point. The yield on Friday was 4.4 percent, up from 4.18 percent a week earlier. In mid-June, it reached a 45-year low of 3.07 percent. 
 The turmoil in the bond market contributed to falling prices for stocks of financial service companies. J. P. Morgan fell 5.95 percent for the week, the worst performance in the Dow Jones industrial average. Citigroup fell 4.99 percent, and American Express dropped 4.78 percent.
 Newell Rubbermaid reduced its earnings forecast for the year, and its stock dropped 20.7 percent for the week, the worst in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Shares of Gateway, the computer maker, gained 20 percent after it said losses were narrowing. 
 For the week, the Dow fell 130.6 points, or 1.4 percent, to 9,153.97. The S.& P. dropped 18.53 points, or 1.9 percent, to 980.15. The Nasdaq composite index fell 15.08 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,715.62. JEFF SOMMER

Sorting Outthe Species of Rich

BYLINE:  By HUBERT B. HERRING

 BODY:
 Yes, yes, the rich are different. No dispute there. But are they different in unison, in some bland, undifferentiated, money-soaked ether? Of course not. 
There are the rich with the loud Beemers, the quiet trust funds, the barking master-of-the-universe voices, the calmly penned charitable checks. 
 But how many of each? That's what a Phoenix/Harris Interactive survey sought to pin down, based on interviews with 1,496 of your friendly neighborhood millionaires. It nudged and cajoled those well-heeled souls into six neat categories, like risk-taking Deal Masters (11 percent of the total), the never-satisfied Status Chasers (18 percent), and the more charitably-minded Altruistic Achievers (17 percent).

Learning to Deal the Way the Pros Do It

BYLINE:  By ERIN CHAN

 BODY:
THE SCENE -- A fifth-floor room in the American Career Center, on Eighth Avenue near 35th Street. With its subdued blue- and white-striped walls, the place looks more like a clinic than the site of a licensed casino training program -- the only one in the state, according to the Department of Education. Yet its five gambling tables -- three for blackjack, two for baccarat -- blend blandness with possibility. 
 The program, which started last year, just got its license in May. Students, almost all of whom are Asian, pay $895 for the eight-week course. Those successfully completing it receive a certificate and can audition for an array of casinos, from Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut to Bally's Atlantic City, where salaries generally range from $20 to $40 an hour, including tips. On a giant bulletin board are photographs of dozens of beaming graduates, certificates in hand. 

THE BUZZ -- The clinking of pai gow tiles from across the room provided a subdued soundtrack for the words of Jing Lu, the chief instructor.
"Don't ever pick up the cards one by one," she told the six beginners clustered around a blackjack table. "That's a bad habit. Look natural. Make the customer very calm, and they will stay here a long time." 
Ms. Lu, who was wearing a pin on the lapel of her black jacket showing a jack and ace of spades, scrawled on the white board behind her: "Take the cards if under 17." That was the blackjack rule, at least for today. 
She then dealt several cards to the novices as deftly as if she were counting money. "Eighteen, 11, 15, Break!" she called out, her mauve-colored nails flitting over the table. "Who's going to come first and try?"
Silence. 
"Mike!" she half-barked.
Mike Yan, who lives in Jackson Heights, Queens, and builds windows and doors, swung around the crescent-shaped table and brushed by her into the dealer space.
"Touch shoulder! Touch shoulder!" Ms. Lu reminded him. Mr. Yan had forgotten that it is polite to tap the previous dealer on the left shoulder; sometimes these small customs take the longest to learn.
Then there's the issue of language. Most casinos will not hire people who cannot speak English, and to several students, the training program doubles as an English language class, at least in casino-speak. 
As Dam Sun, a restaurateur in Flushing, Queens, watched her classmates fumble with the cards, she took a moment to consult her blackjack manual. On the back of one page she had written instructions in shorthand English, followed by the Chinese translation: "Never take money from player's hand. Please drop your money on the table."
Kai Chan of Chinatown, who was unemployed, had donned a white shirt and black bow tie for the afternoon. He had an audition in Atlantic City the next day, and he wanted to feel like a Vegas king. "I'm excited," he said, glancing at his starched sleeves. "Every time I wear this, I'm dizzy."
If he gets the job, "I'm going to bring my wife there," he said. "She can study in Atlantic City and improve her English and become a dealer, too." ERIN CHAN

Betting on Terror: What Markets Can Reveal

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
ANYONE looking for a good bet last week was offered one by an online futures exchange: Would John M. Poindexter, who heads the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a research arm of the Pentagon known as Darpa, be able to keep his job after the furor over the aborted plan to start a market that would trade terrorism futures?
 Within days, the answer appeared to be that he would not, as Defense Department officials said Mr. Poindexter would resign within a few weeks. Assuming he does leave by the end of August, some lucky traders stand to make more than 10 times their investment. 
 If that bet was not to your taste, there were plenty of others available. Would weapons of mass destruction be found in Iraq by the end of September? Would Saddam Hussein be captured? How about Osama bin Laden? Would the terrorism alert level in the United States be raised or lowered? Will Kobe Bryant be convicted?
The existence of such contracts raises perhaps the most overlooked question of the debate on the proposed Defense Department project, the Policy Analysis Market, which would have allowed people to speculate on such issues as whether there would be an increase in terrorism or a collapse of the Jordanian economy. Why was the government needed to get this market going?
The answer is that Uncle Sam had been picked to play the role of designated loser in the gambling.
The existing place to make such bets, www.tradesports.com, is an Irish market that can be traded by anyone with a credit card and an Internet connection. There are no market makers, just traders online around the world. 
Tradesports dreams up contracts based on what it thinks might be interesting, and puts them up for trading. But it does not guarantee that you can find someone to take the other side of your bet.
The Policy Analyst Market was going to do just that. The market maker was to be a computer, financed by the government, that was willing to offer a price for any wager on a subject within its bailiwick. If bettors wanted to wager a lot of money on something, the computer would steadily raise the price. 
One possible wager that was mentioned by Charles Polk, the president of NetExchange, a San Diego company that proposed the idea to the government, was on whether Hamas would join the Palestinian Authority government, a move that he took for granted would indicate it had renounced terrorism. The market-making computer was supposed to be willing not only to take bets on that, but on such related topics as whether the Jordanian economy would boomif that happened.
One risk to the market maker would be insider trading. Somebody within Hamas could make some money by placing bets before the decision was made public.
That would be all to the good, as Mr. Polk saw it. "We welcome insider trading," he said last week, since it would move prices and send a signal to the Defense Department, and anyone else watching the market, that conditions were changing. By being willing to lose money on the market maker, the Defense Department would be able to get information.
One reason some people thought the whole idea stupid was that betting on an increase in terrorism might be a losing bet even if it turned out to be a winner. 
"Isn't that going to guarantee a knock on the door by the Feds?" asked James Chanos of Kynikos Associates, a money manager who specializes in selling stocks short -- that is, betting that a stock price will decline. He recalled the search for evidence -- ultimately unsuccessful -- that terrorists might have shorted stocks before the Sept. 11 attacks.
The people who designed that market thought of that possibility, and proposed that the names of traders be kept secret from the Defense Department. Want to bet whether that secrecy would have been maintained if there was a new terrorist attack?
And anyway, said Robin Hanson, the assistant professor of economics at George Mason University who dreamed up this idea and persuaded NetExchange to propose it to the Defense Department, there were plenty of bets that would not offend the government. 
"The F.B.I. would not knock on my door," he said, "if I bet that if we invade Iraq there will be more terrorist deaths in the United States."
For now, the idea is dead, with the Defense Department having abandoned it quickly once the public ridicule began. But Professor Hanson has not lost hope.
"I think sometime in the next 10 years, this technology will be applied somewhere," he said.
It would not, he said, have to be a public market. Perhaps, Professor Hanson mused, it could be open only to employees of the Central Intelligence Agency, who would place their bets and, in the process, let the government know what consensus there was among intelligence professionals. That, he said, could sometimes be different from what the top of the agency was saying. 
For example, it would be interesting to see how likely the lower-level intelligence analysts think it is that biological, chemical or nuclear weapons will be found in Iraq anytime soon.
FOR now, we can see only what those who bet with Tradesports.com think. They think there is a 27 percent chance of weapons being found by the end of September, but a 65 percent chance that Mr. Hussein will be captured or neutralized (a polite way of saying killed) by the end of the year. Mr. bin Laden, on the other hand, has just a 20 percent chance of being caught this year -- less than the 23 percent probability of Mr. Bryant's being convicted.
As for terrorism, the market figures there is almost a two-thirds chance that the year will end with the alert level at yellow, where it is now. But if there is a change, traders think it is likely to be to a higher level.

If weapons are found, the buyer of that contract will receive $10. If not, the buyer will lose the investment. Graph tracks chances that weapons of mass destruction will be found in Iraq by Sept. 30.

HEADLINE: Vienna's Grandeur Fails To Mask a Sense of Loss 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: VIENNA, July 29 

 BODY:
It was a hot Sunday, and people, wearing shorts, bathing suits or nothing at all, were dotted all along the 17 miles of Danube Island, which the Austrians claim to be the largest park in Europe. They swam, they draped themselves over rocks, and, if they were boys and girls, slid down a 600-foot water slide.
 The image is as close to idyllic as it gets in a Western capital city, even if you could hear the traffic over nearby bridges and some of the place looks like Coney Island. 
 "All people have a good life in Austria," said Alfred Eschenlor, the owner of the water slide and of the Pago soft-drink stand. In front of him, as if to prove his point, the Danube stretched under a hot blue sky. A windsurfer made his way back and forth across the river. The smell of kebab mingled with the smell of pepperoni. 
"The one who doesn't have a good life, he is stupid," he continued. "Here you have work if you want it, and we have a social system that is very, very good."
For the traveler down the Danube, Vienna is the last stop in the fully established, most groomed and affluent part of the river. From here on, the river begins its course through territories more tarnished by the past -- at least by the recent past -- than this model city of palaces, museums, concert halls, opera houses and riverine parks. 
Vienna, like Austria in general, does offer a great deal of affluence. Now that the cold war is over and countries east of here are scheduled to join the European Union, Vienna promises to be the restored capital of middle Europe, that once great multiethnic conglomeration that fared so badly in the last century. 
But the impression that Vienna makes is of spectacular opulence mixed with a sense of something missing, even at its core. Vienna, like Austria, is solidly democratic, well-regulated and safe. Its citizens are among the most protected and catered to in Europe. It is the sort of place that other cities in the former Austro-Hungarian Empire -- like Bratislava, Budapest and Prague -- would love to emulate. 
It is also museumlike, touristy, a bit dull, like an exhibit viewed through a glass case. It inspires the pathos of a place that was once at the center of the world and has been reduced to lesser status. "In Vienna, one gets the impression that people live, and have always lived, in the past, the folds of which conceal and protect even joy," Claudio Magris writes in his book "Danube." 
Indeed, in contrast with such "old" European countries as Germany and France derided by the American defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld, as irrelevant, neutral Austria truly is that when it comes to the European and international political scenes. It reminds one of that line from Somerset Maugham where he is describing why he does not like hiking in a scenic spot: "Beauty is boring," he said. 
You arrive in Vienna from Passau, on the German border, passing by thickly forested hills and vineyards, and villages of masonry houses of light blue, pale pink, weatherbeaten ochre. Flowers spill out of window boxes; elderly men stand on stone embankments, their hands in their pockets, watching the boats go by. 
Linz is the first big city in Austria, and it reeks of tragic history. Hitler, born in Austria not far from the Danube, used to visit his grandparents there, and, after he came to power, had his architect, Albert Speer, draw up plans to turn the town into a model of Nazi monumentalism, the dominant theme being Teutonic divinities. 
The defeat of Germany thwarted most of Hitler's plans, though the large United Austrian Steel Company near the town was built by the Nazis and was once called the Hermann Goring Works. The Jews escaped or were murdered, and the old Jewish quarter that was once squeezed along the Danube's banks was torn down in the 1970's. 
In this sense the Danube is like Vienna, notable not only for what still is there, but also for what is gone. 
When you arrive in Vienna by water, you realize that the city is not, strictly speaking, a Danubian city -- even if Johann Strauss did write the Blue Danube Waltz here. It could not be built too near the river because of the danger of flooding. Vienna also used the Danube to protect itself from the Ottoman Empire. 
About 30 years ago, a giant flood-control system was created, and the giant park along Danube Island was the inadvertent result. 
A few miles away is the famous Ring and the great institutions of Vienna, the State Opera, the palaces (now museums) of the Hapsburg emperors and empresses, the stately villas built by Austria's financial and industrial elite, and the memories of the great figures who made Vienna for half a century the world's greatest center of the arts and sciences -- Freud, Bruckner, Franz Werfel, Mahler, Brahms, Joseph Roth, Arthur Schnitzler, Egon Schiele, Gustave Klimpt and others. 
Vienna is busy now, and ambitious.
It is the capital of a country that has what might well be the largest per capita cultural budget in the world. The three state theaters receive national subsidies of some $200 million a year. The museums get about $90 million. Those are subsidies from the national government. Vienna alone spends about $200 million a year supporting culture and the arts, not counting the money that goes to the city's famous music schools. And, of course, there is Austria's cradle-to-grave social welfare system, a bit tattered and in need of downsizing, but essentially intact. 
"It's both the awareness of the heritage of the monarchy and a feeling of responsibility to invest in education and culture," Andreas Mailath-Pokorny, the city councilor for cultural affairs said, explaining Vienna's priorities. 
But there remains that sense of something missing, of a certain emptiness, and it is not only because the welfare state is a bit unexciting, or because at this season so many people are away enjoying their six weeks of vacation.
The pathos, the sense of an unrecapturable past, that you have in Vienna is due in part simply to the passing of a great empire. A figure like Freud, who, like many of the great figures of his era, arrived in Vienna from the empire's provinces, did not have an easy time in the city, certainly not at the beginning, but he found a vibrant scientific community there and was free to make and publish his findings. 
It is likely that Vienna would have lost some of its position when the Austro-Hungarian Empire dissolved after World War I. In any case, the city's magical qualities were abruptly and sickeningly crushed in 1938 when Hitler annexed Austria to the Thousand Year Reich. The best were destroyed or escaped to London, New York or Los Angeles, and in the immortal words of Mother Goose, you can never put Humpty Dumpty together again. 
"It would be impossible to create again a climate and atmosphere in which these hundreds of poets and scientists could work," Klaus Albrecht Schroder, the director of the Albertina Museum, said. "We just don't have the money for that." 
That might seem an extraordinary concession for the director of one of Vienna's great institutions to make. The Albertina is the former Hapsburg palace that housed the drawings by da Vinci, Michelangelo and Albrecht Durer in the royal collection, and it recently opened again after a meticulous, expensive decade-long restoration. 
But for Mr. Schroder, the question has to do with what needs to happen for a place to be a caldron of activity and greatness, and, as he sees it, you need not just the creative minds alone but the sort of general cultural and economic richness that nurtures them, the material and intellectual plenitude that existed in the Austro-Hungarian Empire but does not exist in well-cared-for little Austria. 
"How many of those great mansions you see here that were built by the wealthy are occupied by government ministries now?" he said. They have never been reclaimed by their original owners, because there are no original owners to reclaim them. 
"We have the stones of our history; we have the architecture of our history, but we know that Vienna will never again have the importance of Paris or London or New York," he said. 
"We have much more than one would expect in a small country like Austria, but less than this wonderful capital had between 1880 and 1938."

HEADLINE: Art Falls Victim to Smash and Grab in Austin 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Aug. 1 

 BODY:
Who's stealing the art?
 That question has gripped many here in recent days after a string of thefts at galleries, Persian-rug dealers and high-end clothing stores culminated in the theft July 27 of two Picasso prints from Austin's most exclusive gallery, the Russell Collection. 
 In each case, the thieves' method has been primitive: smashing a business's glass windows and doors with a large rock, then fleeing with the stolen goods. 
Detectives at the Austin Police Department have estimated losses from each of the eight incidents at $10,000 to more than $120,000. 
"They ain't knocking off Wal-Mart," said Detective Jarrett Crippen. "We're talking places where I could never be able to go in and buy something."
The two Picasso linocut prints, valued at more than $60,000 each, were of the painter's second wife, Jacqueline Roque, and had been placed in an obscure room in the back of the Russell Collection, a gallery tucked away in a shopping mall north of downtown.
"It must have been someone who knew the art market quite well," said Lisa Russell, who opened the gallery last year. "They walked right past the Pissarros, the Chagall, the Rembrandt. They knew exactly what they wanted." 
While the burglaries have many gallery owners here on edge, they have also shed light on an increasingly sophisticated art scene. Long overshadowed in Texas by art markets in Dallas and Houston and by Austin's vibrant music scene, the city's galleries and museums have recently grown more prominent.
More than 30 galleries, for instance, now compete for the attention of collectors, offering a variety of works, including paintings of cowboys on the range, nude photography and contemporary Cuban art. Many galleries have done well, despite the local economy's relative sluggishness after the decline in technology spending that fueled much of Austin's growth in the late 1990's. 
"We're going through a strong period of cultural maturation," said Jonathan Bober, curator of prints, drawings and European paintings at the Blanton Museum of Art at the University of Texas here. "As a participant, it's exciting to witness. But, as someone in the museum business, I'm of course worried about the predatory behavior that accompanies the process."
The taste of the cultural thieves who have focused on Austin varies, with the Picassos at one end of the scale. At Artworks, a large gallery and framing studio, thieves made away with two large bronze sculptures by artists from California and Utah, respectively, as well as a collection of gold jewelry from India.
Insurance policies covered losses from the theft of the sculptures but not all of those from the jewelry, resulting in a small loss for the gallery, said Rene Hurtado, one of the owners of Artworks. The thieves, who hurled a rock through the gallery's front window, ignored money in the cash register, Mr. Hurtado said.
"What kind of thief doesn't care about the cash?" he said. "Someone who cares more about art, I guess. It's pretty bold."
It remains to be seen whether the thieves are working for themselves or on assignment for a collector. Investigators from the Austin police department said they believed as many as eight recent burglaries were related, including two incidents at stores selling Persian rugs. Detective Crippen said the burglaries were "extremely rare for Austin." He said the police were investigating some suspects but conceded they were not on the brink of solving the case.
The thieves' methods are apparently common. Detective Don Hrycyk of the Los Angeles Police Department's art theft detail, one of the only units of its kind in the nation, said the incidents resembled a string of gallery thefts in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills in 1999.
"It's as easy as it gets," Detective Hrycyk said, adding that it could be difficult to find the stolen objects since even the Picassos are not valued at more than $100,000, usually the threshold for attracting attention. "It's still a chunk of money these folks could get, though," he said.
At Ms. Russell's stylish gallery -- the walls lined with works by Renoir, Elizabeth Twining, Matisse, the Pissarro family and even a couple of Picassos the thieves did not take -- the mood was apprehensive on Thursday as she talked with television news crews and police investigators. An empty space on the wall marked the absence of the prints, each from a series done in 1962 called "Le Chapeau a Fleurs."
"They weren't the most significant or even the most expensive works I have," Ms. Russell said. "Maybe someone decided they just had to have a Picasso."

HEADLINE: At Two Rallies, Protesters Accuse Police in Killings 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
As protests go, the groups that gathered in two New Jersey cities yesterday were small, a few dozen people at most. The contrasts between them were stark -- a vociferous crowd in Newark, a somber one in Union City -- but their aims were similar: to accuse the police of brutality and of murdering two young men.
 In Newark, about 40 chanting, placard-waving demonstrators marched under the aegis of the People's Organization for Progress. They carried banners demanding "Justice for Jose Luis Ives Jr." and "Justice for Michael Newkirk," the men slain in recent encounters with police officers, both in disputed circumstances. 
 "Stop police brutality!" Lawrence Hamm, chairman of the organization, said at a downtown rally.
Later the group marched to police headquarters to protest the fatal shooting of Mr. Newkirk, 20, by a Newark officer last Wednesday and the death of Mr. Ives, 17, 10 days ago after an earlier scuffle with an off-duty Weehawken officer in Union City.
"It happens every year," Mr. Hamm said of the deaths of black and Hispanic youths in confrontations with the police. "And it's got to come to an end, because it's gotten real tense out there." Referring to the Newark riots decades ago, he added, "The same conditions that existed in '67 exist in these New Jersey towns now."
As the crowd chanted "No justice, no peace," Zayid Muhammad, a leader of the New Black Panther Party who had joined the marchers, spoke of "black August," when, he said, tempers flare and riots erupt. He also spoke of arming people to resist the police.
The protest in Newark arose in part from the death of Mr. Newkirk, who was shot and killed by Officer Thomas Ruane shortly before 10 p.m. last Wednesday after dozens of officers in 15 police cars responded to reports of a large rowdy crowd and drug activity at a parking-lot cookout in the North Ward. 
The Newark police and the Essex County prosecutor's office said that as officers approached, Mr. Newkirk drew a .45-caliber pistol from his waistband and, ignoring orders to drop the weapon, raised it at them and was shot once in the head by Officer Ruane. The police said they found a pistol beside Mr. Newkirk and three other guns elsewhere in the parking lot.
But some witnesses, including relatives of Mr. Newkirk, said the slain man had been holding a liquor bottle, not a gun, and was shot when he stumbled on a curb as he tried to comply with the officers' demand that everyone in the crowd lie down on the pavement. They accused Officer Ruane, who was placed on paid administrative leave, of being trigger-happy.
In contrast to the angry rally in Newark, the gathering in Union City yesterday was somber. There were no chants or placards, only a white banner bearing the name of a police officer and black letters proclaiming "You murdered a 17-year-old boy."
The gathering took place outside the victim's home, on the sidewalk where Mr. Ives, a Union City high school student, suffered multiple skull fractures in an encounter on July 16 with the off-duty Weehawken police officer, Alejandro Jaramillo, who is in his 20's.
Witnesses, including the victim's 10- and 12-year-old brothers, said the officer, a resident of the neighborhood, with two years on the Weehawken force, had accused the younger boys of setting off car alarms and had threatened them with a broomstick. Later, as the boys were escorted home by their older brother, the officer followed them and shouted his accusations again.When Mr. Ives turned to face him, the officer pounced on him, according to the younger boys. They said the officer repeatedly slammed the youth's head into the pavement.
Mr. Ives died on July 24 after an eight-day coma. Officer Jaramillo was charged with murder and official misconduct. He denied pounding the youth's head on the pavement, saying Mr. Ives had hit his head when he fell to the street. The officer posted a $250,000 bail bond.
Yesterday, on the quiet street of two- and three-family houses, only a block from the approaches to the Lincoln Tunnel, about 30 people -- the family, friends and neighbors of the dead youth -- gathered after his burial in Fairview Cemetery. Many wore T-shirts bearing a picture of his face. They stood at a makeshift memorial of candles, carnations and stuffed animals.
Fernando Mateo, president of Hispanics Across America, a grass-roots group that advocates for economic and social rights, told the gathering that he had asked Gov. James E. McGreevey on behalf of the Ives family last week to establish a six-member independent commission to investigate charges of brutality and other misconduct by police in the state.
"We can't allow police officers to investigate police officers," Mr. Mateo said. 
Jose Luis Ives Sr., who brought his family here from the Dominican Republic, said, "We believe in the American justice system, and we know there will be justice in this case."
Micah Rasmussen, the governor's press secretary, called it "a day of mourning for the family, not a day for policy discussion." He said the state's attorney general, Peter C. Harvey, would meet with community leaders to discuss the idea of a commission to review police conduct. But he noted that the governor had not changed his position on the state's policy, which relies on police departments to investigate allegations of brutality and misconduct.

HEADLINE: Coliseum Is On Its Way Out. But Wait. 

BYLINE:  By C.J. HUGHES

 BODY:
TO its critics, New Haven's Veterans Memorial Coliseum symbolizes all that is wrong with urban renewal and modern design, a hulking, windowless, burnt-red trapezoid at odds with the city's historic, small-scale streetscape.
 To these detractors -- everyone from longtime residents to occasional highway passersby -- the decision by Mayor John DeStefano last summer to tear the building down to save the city money was met with a collective sigh of relief. 
 "The coliseum was one of these 60's redevelopment projects that people thought did a lot of damage because it took out an older neighborhood and replaced it with a concrete-and-steel monolith," said Tony Bialecki, New Haven's deputy director of economic development. "When the building finally comes down, people will be pleasantly surprised."
Well, not everyone. A group of citizens who want to spare the building from the wrecking ball are pressing the mayor to realize the coliseum's ugly-duckling potential and transform it into a thing of beauty. Called the Coalition to Save Our Coliseum, the group has pulled together a vocal and well-connected, if unexpected, 100-member mix of sports buffs, housing advocates, urban historians, and architecture professors, who are fighting to keep the 9,000-seat arena standing. 
"Our point of view is that the city moved too quickly, that the only option was to demolish the coliseum," said Anstress Farwell, president of the New Haven Urban Design League and who backs the coalition's cause. "This will destroy a huge part of the city, and the people who are deciding to do it won't be here in 20 years."
Conceived nine months ago over a table at a fast-food restaurant, the group in June drew about 50 people to a symposium that featured a half-dozen alternate architectural plans for the building and its seven-acre site, where the city proposes to move the Long Wharf Theater and build a hotel, conference center, apartments, stores, and plaza, for $400 million.
While the city solicits bids for the coliseum's demolition, which could start as soon as December, and awaits a $10 million bond from the state to pay for it, the coalition is trying to raise a few thousand collars to put its message on a billboard along I-95. It has also scheduled another symposium for the fall.
Still, the argument will be the same: A development of this size is a foolhardy undertaking in these economic times. Plus, the building, with its tiles that are typically found on farm silos and inventive rooftop parking garage, has come to be loved.
"Some people have called it a brutalism of architecture, but there was almost a family environment inside the coliseum," said Dick Walsh of Clinton, who serves as the coalition's secretary. "Destroying it would be a loss for middle-class people from the city and suburbs. Where else can we go for good inexpensive entertainment?"
For many coalition members, this entertainment was most memorably sports events. Mr. Walsh estimates he has been to the coliseum 500 times, mostly for Nighthawks hockey games. Others had a more involved connection, working for a team or selling T-shirts.
Yet the coliseum's storied history as a music arena--a stop for the likes of Van Halen, the Grateful Dead, the Kinks, and Kiss -- holds similar sway over the building's champions.
When he was growing up in Litchfield, Alan Organschi frequently traveled to the coliseum to see concerts, just one block away from where his architecture firm stands today, in the city's Ninth Square neighborhood. Mr. Organschi argued that the coliseum should not be razed because it is an effective barrier against highway noise and provides 1,700 much-needed parking spaces for the train station and downtown. He's also afraid that the city will run out of funding for the new development and the Ninth Square, after rehabbing itself over the past decade, will be stuck next to a gaping hole.
Mr. Organschi, who teaches at the Yale School of Architecture, also said that, historically, it's been bad policy to rip down structures without considering that tastes, even for super-scale edifices, might someday change.
"We're reliving the same urban paradigms here," Mr. Organschi said. "It's about time we stopped having stylistic fetishes about buildings and started dealing with the potential for urban space."
Under his own proposal, unveiled at the symposium in June, the coliseum would end up with mixed uses the way it was originally intended by the architect Kevin Roche, who went on to design many of the wings of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Mr. Organschi would shrink the existing arena's size while adding a new theater, conference center, gym, and stores, for about $50 million, a fraction of the city's price.
Even those who haven't spent much time inside it said they believed the coliseum should be preserved, such as Robert A.M. Stern, the architect and dean of the Yale School of Architecture. 
Yet in an example of how the issue is polarizing New Haven's academic and political leaders, the mayor's office has chided Mr. Stern for his views, calling him an out-of-towner who doesn't have the city's long-term interests at heart.
"This is a national issue, not a provincial one," Mr. Stern said. "The preservation movement may have grown out of people worried about the destruction of Beaux Arts buildings, but the older generation needs to realize the grounds ofbattle are shifting."
Though the coliseum has always stood out on New Haven's skyline since it opened its doors in 1972, it hasn't always stood on its own. It has never been profitable, which led to the city's decision in 1999 to turn the building over to a private event-management group, Philadelphia's SMG.
Yet despite luring a hockey franchise to the coliseum, the New Haven Knights, SMG still couldn't make the building pay for itself. In the winter of 2002, SMG officials told the mayor's office they would need $1.4 million to cover their operating budget.
Around the same time, a city-commissioned study found that the building required an additional $30 million to bring it up to code, after the $5 million spent over the past eight years to improve scoreboards and locker rooms. In addition, the study claimed nearby sites like the Arena at Harbor Yard in Bridgeport and the casinos were consistently siphoning away big-ticket acts, further jeopardizing the coliseum's ability to cover costs.
Firm in the study's conclusions, Mayor DeStefano announced on July 2, 2002 that the coliseum had no choice but to close, and on Sept. 1, five days after the building hosted its last event, World Wrestling Entertainment, the city locked the coliseum's doors.
Yet in many ways, a different type of show was just beginning, as the coalition started systematically and meticulously attacking the mayor's assertions. 
Citing the mayor's own numbers, the group has stated that in 2001 the coliseum held 113 events, while in 2002, that number rose to 121, signs of improvement.Perhaps the most strongly worded accusation from the group is that the mayor acted unilaterally, showing poor judgment.
Mr. Bialecki, the deputy director of economic development, said that wasn't true. He said the mayor's office has been open to solutions for the coliseum for years, but that nobody -- especially the city's outlying suburbs -- has been willing to help.
The fundamental problem, as Mr. Bialecki sees it, ticket holders were simply driving to the coliseum, watching their game, then heading home without spending any money in the city. A site that appeals to more than just people who attend Arena Football and circuses, he argued, even if initially expensive, will be better off for New Haven in the long run.
"There are many tremendous artifacts in New Haven, and the city has been involved with the restoration of a lot of them where we can," Mr. Bialecki said. "But this just comes down to economic feasibility, and the coalition's numbers don't add up."
Mr. Walsh and his group are unfazed and said momentum is starting to line up behind them, as the state battled over a budget while funds dry up for urban development projects of this magnitude.
"If we keep talking, we think people will ultimately listen to reason," Mr. Walsh said. "This is clearly an injustice, and something needs to be done."

In Nod to Past, Yonkers Seeks Tourist Dollars

BYLINE:  By MARC FERRIS

 BODY:
WHEN the big Westchester city Yonkers started to go downhill, the slide was speeded by a decaying downtown, pockets of poverty and bitter school segregation battles that created a legacy of racial mistrust.
 Now that the city is bouncing back, it is also looking back. With a waterfront renaissance under way, the city and its boosters are finding new ways to promote the city's past and trying to stake a claim to a share of the county's heritage tourist dollars. Trying to attract artists to downtown and yet maintain the character of a fast-growing area, developers are preserving old buildings rather than razing them. Also under way is an effort to celebrate elements of the city's past, including a drive to generate greater recognition of the fact that the first round of golf ever played in the United States occurred in Yonkers. 
 "So many plans have been proposed that never got done," said James E. Flynn Sr., owner of the Flynn Funeral Home, founded by his father in 1919. "Most of the people who were born and raised here were cynical even about this new development, but all of a sudden, it's really happening. Yonkers has the greatest potential in world, but it lost a few steps along the way, so this turnaround is thrilling." 
Other cities are also trying to stimulate tourism. Peekskill offers monthly tours of artists' lofts. Civic and business groups organized a one-time tour of Ossining's distinctive houses of worship. 
In Yonkers this year, Mario Caruso, a city planner, established a side business, MC Plans, which offers six different tours through October. Although it may seem unusual for a city planner to be running a for-profit business related even loosely to his city duties, the business has been cleared with city lawyers, he said. Many of the tours have sold out.
One tour features Yonkers' impact on show business: The city is the setting for "Hello, Dolly!" and famous entertainers from Ella Fitzgerald to the rapper DMX have called the city home. Another jaunt highlights the city's industrial past, including the Otis Elevator complex and the Alexander Smith Carpet Mills; other tours feature the city's grand mansions and Victorian homes.
A dozen people attended a walking tour of downtown last weekend. Mr. Caruso pointed out several successful historic preservation projects, including the newly renovated Philipsburgh Performing Arts Center, built in 1904, which houses 28 artists' lofts and the 1903 Trolley Barn, which will offer 40 artists' lofts.
rand-
The city's ability to promote itself as Golf City, USA, is more problematic. In 1888, the first tee-off occurred at the St. Andrews Golf Club, then situated adjacent to North Broadway and Shonnard Place, but the club moved to Hastings-on-Hudson in 1897. The exact site of the old first hole is in a front lawn at 480 North Broadway, said Mary Hoar, president of the Yonkers Historical Society. 
There are other problems: memorabilia relating to the club's days in Yonkers is scattered in private collections, the club's archives and the United States Golf Association's headquarters and museum in New Jersey. The city does not own a golf course, nor is there any place to build one, said Edward Sheeran, special assistant to the mayor for economic development, who spoken with the Metropolitan Golf Association of Elmsford to establish a potential promotional partnership. 
"Yonkers is the home of the elevator, the FM radio, the world's largest carpet mills, it's the home of golf, and lots of famous people lived here," Mr. Sheeran said. "I've been on recent trips to Gettysburg and Washington, D.C., places that really showcase their history. We could have something similar here in Yonkers."

Are You a Sharpie? A Sportsman?

BYLINE:  By ROBERT STRAUSS

DATELINE: EAST AMWELL 

 BODY:
IT was 1994, just before the great stock market boom, and to Jackson Lears it seemed like a time when people were determined to make good while working hard.
 Mr. Lears, a history professor at Rutgers, was teaching a bit in New York at and on this particular day he needed a subway token to take the No.1 train to the West Village. In front of him at the station he saw two lines -- one awfully long and another particularly short. 
 He remembered that he grimaced, thinking that he would have a frustrating wait to buy his token, but to his delight he found that the token line was the short one; the long line was for lottery tickets. 
 "The Newt Gingrich revolution had occurred and the air was full of the din of talking about taking personal responsibility for the future and the end of welfare as we knew it an all that," Mr. Lears, 55, recalled in a recent interview, his bright eyes opening wide at the historian's most wonderful moment, the dawning of a conundrum in need of a solution. "All these people buying lottery tickets, I thought, may have been hard-working and may have understood the meaning of hard work. But they knew that was not enough for success. To make it big, they supposed, you would have to hit it with luck somewhere else."
 That notion of the need to "hit it" as a theme in American culture is a basis for a new book by Mr. Lears, "Something for Nothing: Luck in America" (Viking, $27.95), a largely academic study of the role of chance from colonial times to the present that has garnered a lot of notice, from The New Yorker ("a narrative so sweeping that there is a fresh example in nearly every paragraph") to The Economist ("this book has a serious, even a moral, purpose"). 
 On the book jacket, Susan Sontag raves, "Nobody is thinking with more spiritedness and subtlety about the roots of American culture and the distinctive American pursuit of happiness than Jackson Lears."
 Luck and fortune would seem an apt subject for study in New Jersey. After all, not too far down the road from Mr. Lears's office in New Brunswick is Atlantic City, a town built on luck and fortune. But few of those on their way to the slot machines and craps tables stop long to ponder the history and psychology of gambling in America.
 Inspired by that long line for the lottery, however, Mr. Lears ended up examining the conflicting roles of what he calls the "culture of control" and the "culture of chance."
 "The mixture of the two goes back centuries," Mr. Lears said. "The early Puritans were moved by the Protestant ethic to work hard and all good would come. But yet they often cast lots in hopes of making the harvest a better one."
 The synthesis of these two seemingly conflicting ideals, Mr. Lears said, is replayed constantly through American history. The Declaration of Independence talks about truths that are self-evident as well as a reliance on faith in God. The expansion of America across the continent was both "manifest destiny" and, by oft-repeated elementary-school textbooks, based on back-breaking work.
 Even the latest war in Iraq, Mr. Lears said, has President Bush talking about providential destiny and at the same time contending that it will take hard work and good fortune to defeat the forces of evil.
 "Bush says, 'We do not claim to know all the ways of Providence, yet we can trust in them,"' Mr. Lears said. "Americans believe in their fate. And then soldiers carry amulets for luck. We feel we can control things, but then we don't want to intimidate circumstance by not having the right lucky charm."
 Mr. Lears acknowledges that he has had a fortunate life. He lives in a house here in the farm country west of New Brunswick. Its earliest wing was constructed in the 18th century, he says, with an expansive fireplace that was built in 1742.
 On many of the walls are works of art by his wife, Karen Parker Lears, most of which are collages in the style of Joseph Cornell or Louise Nevelson. 
 "Her collages are an example of the individuality of found objects, the aesthetic of accident in art," Mr. Lears said. "Her art gives evidence that chance opens up stumbling on lucky finds to produce art."
 He said he loves her work and finds the "luck" involved in making her art emblematic of the role of chance in American culture.
 "I know I'm more fortunate to have the job security that not many people of my age do," Mr. Lears said. Yet he still wants to make sure that his daughters -- one attends graduate school at New York University and the other is a junior at Vassar College -- are secure with their opportunities.
 "My oldest daughter graduated in 1999, just at the height of the stock-market boom," he said. "I graduated the University of Virginia in 1969, just at the height of the perplexity of the counter-culture. Then the emphasis was on experimenting with possibilities. In 1999, it was taken as certain that we would all prosper. It was not a matter of luck, but of destiny."
 Indeed, "Something for Nothing" is filled with anecdotes of both the luck-obsessed and the luck-averse. He especially likes characters who seemed to be gamblers but in reality had more of a love for the game of life. Canada Bill Jones was one of them.
 "Legend has it that he was stranded in a somnolent Louisiana town when he finally found a faro game and began to lose relentlessly," Mr. Lears writes. Jones's friend took him aside and told him that the game was crooked. "Canada Bill answered, 'But it's the only game in town.' The desire to play overcame the certainty of loss."
 "We live with the idea that dying broke is not a good thing, not something of a worthy life of working hard," Mr. Lears said. "But Damon Runyon said, 'All horse players die broke.' And we in American culture love characters like that. Depending on luck is more complex than pathetic and sinful."
 Mr. Lears also likes to talk about the difference between sportsmen and sharpies, two types of colorful characters who populate American lore. The sportsmen, like Canada Bill or the Runyonesque horsemen, believe that luck will come their way and may use some skill to beat you, though never unfairly. Sharpies, on theother hand, fix the game. They are either cheaters, as base and cynical as the three-card monte hustlers, or people like John D. Rockefeller, who monopolize each entryway, so that even if you are a winner, he is a bigger one.
 Though Mr. Lears does not eschew luck -- he will show off charms that his younger daughter made for him long ago that he carries in his pocket -- he is not particularly a fan of casino or lottery wagering. His father, a furniture salesman in rural Maryland, once got a payment-in-kind of a couple slot machines, which he set up in their house. Visitors, even baby sitters, would lose money in the machines, as did the young Mr. Lears. And that cured him later of the desire to gamble.
 "My friend calls the lottery a hope-maintenance tax," Mr. Lears said. "Poor people are probably not deluded that they will win, but they need some hope in the fabric of their everyday life. But I don't think it is good public policy to depend on casinos and lotteries for financing."
 Over the years, Mr. Lears has written about advertising and Victorian culture and is now contemplating a book on language and American culture. Meantime, he continues to write book reviews for the New Republic and is the editor of the Raritan Quarterly Review, a magazine of essays. Teaching, he said, is still a great love, but he worries that his students will not be the chance-takers he loves in his book.
 "9/11, I think, has chastened them," he said. "The young are now aware of the pitfalls of bad luck. They are insecure to have views of good fortune. It would be a real shame, though, for a generation to come up and see the less expansive view the American view fade away."

HEADLINE: In Place of Indian Point 

BYLINE:  By MAREK FUCHS

 BODY:
THE call to close Indian Point is so snug and simple that it fits perfectly onto a bumper sticker. But what is not so simple is the question of where the power-hungry Westchester and New York City regions would look for replacement power for the plant's output in the event it is closed.
 The drive by Indian Point's opponents to close the plant took a heavy blow when the federal government endorsed the controversial emergency evacuation plan for the plant recently. Nevertheless, those opponents have continued to say that Indian Point must be closed for safety reasons, and that the plant's power can be replaced well and even cheaply. Yet at the heart of each power replacement argument is a certain amount of estimating, guesswork and leaps of faith. 
 One thing is undeniable: Apart from natural gas and coal, there are no alternatives immediately available that currently produce electricity on the scale of the two reactors. Yet opponents are carefully seeking alternatives. 
One often-mentioned possibility is a giant extension cord from upstate. Solar power and windmills are often raised, as is increased conservation. Conversion of Indian Point from a nuclear plant to a gas-fired one is another favorite option of plant opponents. The bottom line? There doesn't seem to be one. When it comes to what might come after Indian Point, the point of view depends on the speaker, with no clear answer, no real front-runner and no clear decision-maker.
"For each Ph.D.," said County Executive Andrew J. Spano, speaking on the issue in his White Plains office on a recent afternoon, "you have an equal and opposite Ph.D."
And it's not only the energy production capabilities that must be weighed. There are other variables: If replacement power can be produced, will it be prohibitively expensive? What hurdles will be encountered by, say, proposed windmill farms like those that have encountered staunch local opposition elsewhere? Can any energy project win financing from the private sector in a post-Enron world that has not been kind to energy projects? And, by the way, what would Entergy, the plant's owner, have to say about its investment in Indian Point?
For all these reasons, even though grassroots opposition to Indian Point appears to be strong and growing, even the plant's staunchest opponents agree that one key to building a credible force behind the call to shut it down is to wade through the power replacement options in the hope of forming a viable alternative.
"To expedite the shutdown, you have to have a plan in place," said Alex Matthiessen, the executive director of Riverkeeper, an environmental group that is fighting the plant.
The fear of flickering lights, summer blackouts and plump bills casts a pall on power plant opposition from the sector of the population that can be swayed to either side of the debate. Mr. Spano said, "We have to be able to say, 'Here's the alternative, so now what's the argument?"'
Indian Point generates 2,000 megawatts of power, a huge amount of energy, when the entire complex is up and running. That is enough to power about two million homes. With small exceptions, all power for public buildings and for public uses in Westchester and New York City comes from the plant. This means schools, streetlights, town halls, firehouses, municipal buildings, subways and Metro-North trains all rely on the plant. 
Can this much power ever be replaced? Technological advances mean that "there are a heck of a lot of options, a lot of different pushes into different type of energy generating," said Marshall Adkins, the managing director of energy research for Raymond James, a financial service firm. But for both consumer and investor, there are big financial concerns.
Mr. Adkins said that because nuclear plants have already been built, nuclear power's "ongoing costs are low." By contrast, many potential replacement sources of power require new investments and possibly higher continuing costs. All of this adds up to bigger bills for consumers. 
Plant opponents point to the fact that local, state and federal governments foot much of the bill for securing nuclear plants. By this argument, even if the costs aren't showing up on the bottom lines of the plant's owners, they are being paid by taxpayers.
GETTING down to specifics of replacing the power output of the plant, several opponents, speaking separately, agreed that a combination of measures would be needed. Daniel Rosenblum, senior lawyer for the Pace Law School Energy Project, another plant opponent, said, "The combination of all the energy resources is what's needed to provide a reliable energy supply."
Windmills have already replaced nuclear power in some places in Westchester. The town of New Castle, for example, recently replaced the 29 percent of its municipal power that came from nuclear with wind-generated power. The extra cost is manageable, said Marion S. Sinek, New Castle town supervisor. She put the extra cost at $30,000 annually, out of a total of $450,000. 
Windmills have advanced technologically in the last decade to the point that cost is near that of nonrenewable energy, or at the very least within range. "We felt strongly that if we wanted to close Indian Point, we had to find other ways to get the power," Mrs. Sinek said. 
Since last February, Croton-on-Hudson has also been using wind power for all municipal needs, from firehouses to streetlights. The mayor, Robert W. Elliott, was surprised at how easy it was for the town to hook in. "Like a lot of people," Mr. Elliott said, "we didn't realize that alternative forms of energy are available right now, that we would tap into it this minute."
They, too, pay a premium, $8,000 a year, for electricity that amounts to 10 percent of their city power bill. and Mr. Elliott said that while the public was receptive to this, the big selling point was to explain the plan. "At first the questions were along the lines of, 'so we're going to have windmills on top of our buildings?"' Mr. Elliott said. "I had to explain that the grid is like a reservoir, with a lot of different power coming down the aqueduct and being pooled. Once people got that, they were supportive."
He added: "The subtext is that it is easy to be against something, like nuclear plants. But the opponents have to be for something, like wind power."
Both towns get their wind from Community Energy, a company that has been around since 1999, providing approximately 270 megawatts of energy in a dozen states. The company's New York State director, Ron Kamen, said the company had 37 megawatts of wind power available in the state and currently sells half. "People have to be willing to pay a little bit of green power premium," he said. 
Though Mr. Kamen said that New York had the potential to produce 10,000 megawatts of wind power in the future, scale is a question now. (Wind power now accounts for less than 1 percent of all electricity produced in the United States.) Wind power is only as good as the wind; spots upstate and in eastern New York are generally the windiest and thus the best sites for windmills. That brings up two other problems.
"Wind power has already generated -- no pun intended -- controversy," said Warren P. Reiss, general council at Scenic Hudson Inc., an environmental group. The towers have drawn opposition from both environmentalists and nuclear plant supporters, mostly from people who think they are big and ugly but also from people who worry because they have been known to cut up flying birds. 
Since 1992, Sandra R. Galef, a state assemblywoman, has represented the district that includes Indian Point. "People didn't want cell towers, why would they want a 10-story wind tower?" she asked. "People always want something somewhere, but it's always not in my backyard."
Even if a place can be found to place windmills where there is no local opposition, there is disagreement over whether the state's power grid is adequate for transmitting such power downstate. Ken Klapp, a spokesman for the New York Independent System Operator, a nonprofit organization established and regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said the answer is no. "At peak time, we are dealing with a system that is fully loaded," he said.
Mr. Kamen said, "Transmission is definitely an issue of concern, but it's a relatively manageable concern." Mr. Rosenblum said he also believes there is enough capacity to bring power downstate. 
Solar power, like wind, shows promise, though it is a small-scale solution, and faces similar challenges of whittling costs and transmission. John Moore and his wife, Stephanie Stern, are thinking of installing solar panels on their house in Yorktown, to strike a blow against Indian Point. 
But the initial bids for the planned conversion ran more than $54,000, which would mean it would take several decades for them to see a return on their investment. "Not a winner," Mr. Moore said. Through help from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, a state consumer organization, and elsewhere, however, Mr. Moore has brought the cost down to less than half of the original price. 
ONE of the few energy projects that appears to have fairly solid initial support from officials and environmentalists is essentially a giant extension cord that will take energy from Albany County and bring it 140 miles south to New York City. Though the plan's proponents are not marketing it as an Indian Point replacement, they say that the line could bring 2,000 megawatts of power downstate, a magic number indeed. 
The project is called Empire Connection and a company called Conjunction LLC has been marketing it. The company wants the cord (there will be two, actually) to carry DC power, not normally used in the United States. Steve Mitnick, the chief executive officer of Conjunction, said that DC lines are more efficient and safer, but its presence means he has to persuade Consolidated Edison to put DC converters on substations at either end of the cord. That is not the only hurdle; Mr. Mitnick has to persuade a number of railroads to allow him to lay the line under the tracks. Also, various applications have to be submitted, including a big one to the New York Public Service Commission. "It's an endless list," Mr. Mitnick said.
There is also the matter of financing. The project will be done on $200 million in equity and $500 million in debt, Mr. Mitnick said, adding that financing is being sought on Wall Street. 
And then, the discussion of replacing Indian Point's energy usually turns to conservation, which is the big hope or hoax of the Indian Point alternative movement, depending on who you talk to. 
A report prepared for Riverkeeper and the Pace Law School Project by Charles Komanoff, an independent energy consultant in Manhattan, said that Indian Point could be closed without adversely effecting energy supply by replicating what was done in California during its energy crisis in the summer of 2001. Mr. Komanoff is a proponent of peak period premiums, rebates for energy reduction and day-to-day conservation, from turning off the lights to not letting the hot tub run.
The range of savings, Mr. Komanoff said, could rise to the level of a 57 percent surplus, with the downside a 40 percent deficit. A shortfall could be made up by importing electricity from places like New England. 
In April 2002, however, Entergy released a study that it had commissioned from two research groups, General Electric Power Systems Energy Consulting and National Economic Research Associates. The study said that if the two operating plants, Indian Point 2 and 3, were permanently closed, consumers would be out $3 billion over three years. At the same time, the study said, energy reliability would decrease by a factor of five, with reserve margins cut almost in half. The report said that if Indian Point is closed, the next step might be the closure of 23 other nuclear power units, in which case energy costs would increase by $10 billion in the same three-year period. 
Even those who say they support conservation question whether it is any reliable replacement for Indian Point. Conservation, over the long haul, has never been shown to be much of a success in New York, or much of anywhere else for that matter.
Assemblywoman Galef said: "People are really good at conservation when there is a big crunch. In the 1970's we saw the long gas lines and cut back. But then we built big cars and guzzled gas." 
One area of advancement that has conservation supporters encouraged is the marrying of technology and conservation. Smart appliances that can be programmed to run in the middle of the night can help, for example, as can a pilot program, started by the county in conjunction with several energy groups, that provides consumers with an advanced electronic meter that lets them know how much energy they use at different times of the day and when electricity is cheapest. No one expects advances like this to make up 2,000 megawatts; rather, most conservation supporters say that a systemic effort can be a good part of other Indian Point alternatives. 
ANOTHER big hope of Indian Point opponents for replacing the nuclear output of the plant is a proposal to convert the nuclear power plant into a gas-fired plant. Echoing an attempt by the county made a quarter century ago to take over Consolidated Edison's transmission lines, Mr. Spano has even proposed buying or condemning the plant to convert it.
Through up to $500,000 in requests for proposals and studies, the county is looking at just how to go about this. Few will argue that a gas-fired plant can't produce energy, but there are other concerns: whether the county can be involved in any way in a construction project that will cost more than its annual budget, what to do with spent fuel rods, whether Entergy will ever sell and whether, if the county condemned the property, it would have the competency to proceed. Entergy has gone on the record as saying that it will listen to the county's proposals, but that it has no particular desire to sell the plant. 
"It borders on the ridiculous," Jim Steets, a spokesman for Entergy, said of suchproposals. "First of all, you'd have to buy because we're certainly not going to convert. If you even assume Entergy wants to sell, the plant could not be taken for less than $2 billion or $3 billion, maybe $4 billion. Then you have to decommission, do destruction and construction. And you have to do without the 2,000 megawatts for years, while all this goes on. You can't run one while you build another and then say, 'one, two, three, switch!"' 
Mr. Klapp, a spokesman for the Independent System Operator, said that a conversion of the site would address an issue that many are overlooking. "Any type of replacement has to be physically located in the same spot in order to give voltage support to the transmission network," he said. "That's what's needed to keep power moving long distances." 
But as in every other concern regarding Indian Point, this claim gets a quick rejoinder. "The plant has been down quite a number of times for repairs," said Mr. Rosenblum, adding that the sanctity of the lines has never been an issue. "They've worked fine."
As the discussion over potential replacements continues, experts note that history offers little in the way of guidance. The Shoreham Nuclear Power Station on Long Island was shuttered under public pressure. But the messy battle ended before the plant reached full power.
"An alternative plan wasn't a big issue," said Richard M. Kessel, who worked to shut the plant and is chairman of the Long Island Power Authority. "It wasn't producing anything so we didn't have to have the answers. We weren't losing anything. That problem was in the future."
And the stakes grow higher as time goes on. Despite all the security concerns, public energy needs are growing, not diminishing. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg recently formed a task force to figure out how New York City can meet its rising needs for energy. He was reacting to estimates that the region will need to increase its energy capacity by 3,000 megawatts in the next five years, presuming Indian Point continues to run.
If nothing else, the entire debate over shutdown has transformed the landscape of local politics. "I used to focus on things like how fast the Playland roller coasters could run after rain," said Michael B. Kaplowitz, a county legislator who now spends a good portion of his time thinking about the disposal of spent fuel rods, the capacity of transmission lines and trying to pinpoint what could possibly come next. 
Mr. Spano also spends a large portion of time on Indian Point. "It's just a major chess game," he said, "three steps forward and two steps back."

Basic Fare in a Welcoming Atmosphere

BYLINE:  By RICHARD JAY SCHOLEM; E-mail: licarte@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IF it's your first time, you'll be back, and if you've been here before, you know what I'm talking about." That unsolicited endorsement came from an elderly couple loaded down with doggy bags as they were leaving Mary's Backyard in Bethpage. The comment is often typical of those applied to friendly little neighborhood spots with easy-to-swallow prices, pleasant waitresses and traditional dishes. 
 Mary's Backyard, which replaced Kenny's Cafe at 729 South Oyster Bay Road (516-433-3338) less than a year ago, will earn no raves from Zagat or high ratings from gushing restaurant reviewers, yet it, and places like it, satisfies the needs of large numbers of diners. It's a home-owned alternative to midpriced chains and franchises, a convenient, laid-back place to take the whole family and not worry about the bill, a "no surprise" spot that emphasizes economy and familiar food. 
 Ostrich, yucca, jicama, quinoa, tilapia or tiramisu are not found on the menu. That is not what its patrons want. They are after basic, understandable fare like steak, chicken wings, shrimp cocktails, corned beef and cabbage, hamburgers, pasta and pizza -- and that's what they get. 
After nibbling at the Irish soda bread, made in house, and cottony commercial bakery rolls, patrons can try the argain-priced shrimp cocktail with five fresh jumbos ($7.50) or a small cup of excellent Irish beef barley soup ($3.50) thick with ground beef and minced vegetables. It is better than the thin onion soup ($3.50) with a formidable rubbery cap of cheese or the slightly salty and spare pasta fagioli ($3.50).
There was more clam than filler in the tasty stuffed baked clams ($6.50), but excessive grittiness made the spinach salad ($9) a chore to eat. A substantial half-portion of ziti, $6.50 as a starter, was respectable when its slightly watery red sauce was brought to life with a bit of cheese and salt. Sizable salads included in the price of entrees made appetizers more a frill than a necessity.
Although Mary's Backyard has an unmistakable Irish tilt, as did its predecessor, there are more Italian dishes on the menu than Irish. Among them is a recommended chicken Parmesan ($13). The hamburger deluxe platter ($8.50) was terrific. Its lightly salted French fries, lettuce, tomato, onions and nice balance of meat to roll were a good idea, but Mary's Special Ribs ($13 half rack, $20 full rack) weren't. Their tough, unyielding meat and uninspired tomato sauce were far from the tender, slow-cooked, fall-from-the-bone treats they should have been. 
Both of the menu's Irish main courses will satisfy most diners, but they won't wow them. The corned beef and cabbage ($13.50) offered strips of meat over clumps of cabbage on a base of spinach with carrots. The rustic shepherd's pie ($13) yielded finely chopped, nicely seasoned meat, onions and carrots under a load of sturdy, rather than creamy, mashed potatoes. I would pass on the stringy-dry roast loin of pork ($14), which comes with good sauerkraut. Better was a tangle of sliced steak, mushrooms and onions ($14). This special, ordered medium rare, yielded a combination of always juicy, medium-rare, medium and well-done strips of beef.
Desserts ($5) ranged from a warm, homey house-made peach cake and a gooey, intensely chocolate fudge cake to a strong-tasting Key lime cake.
Mary's, in a spiffy white cottage, has a darkish dining room with a fake fireplace and a bright, light porch with skylights wraparound windows and pots of violets on each of its tables.
Not a single dish on the menu will make any top or bottom 10 lists. But Mary is a delight. The down-to-earth, who-gets-what waitresses are hospitable, and Jose Cortez, the chef, churns out some dishes well worth eating at prices that are always right. 

Openings
The Mill Pond Inn, a landmark restaurant in a 100-year-old building at 437 East Main Street on Centerport Harbor (631-261-7663), has been purchased by Dean Philippis and Thomas Abraham. Mr. Philippis, who owns the Piccolo Restaurant in Huntington, will operate what will be called the Mill Pond House, and Mr. Abraham, the president of Little Neck Development, will supervise its renovation. 
The 90-seat spot, scheduled to open in September, will feature steaks, fish, grilled dishes and an extensive raw bar with lobsters, oysters, clams, shrimp and caviar. An outdoor deck will be available for drinks and appetizers. Entree prices, similar to those at Piccolo, will be in the $17-to-$32 range. 
Barefoot Charlie's, an old-fashioned pub with some modern culinary influences, opened on May 15 at 85 North Ferry Road on Shelter Island (631-749-1900). Michael Goodison, the Italian-trained chef and owner of the 96-seat restaurant, was the original chef of the Barefoot Contessa in East Hampton and worked in Little Italy for 15 years. His wife, Susan; his brother, Jim; and his sister, Linda, are all active in the operation of Barefoot Charlie's, which offers steaks, chops, seafood and pasta at modest prices.

HEADLINE: COMMUNITIES; 
In Revitalizing, Towns Aim to Lure Artists as Trailblazers

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO

DATELINE: PEEKSKILL 

 BODY:
WHEN Chris Carnabuci first struck out on his own as a furniture designer and maker a decade ago in Manhattan, he longed for a large studio. Instead, Mr. Carnabuci, then 29, did his hammering and sawing in a one-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side. 
 But now Mr. Carnabuci has found his dream space in Peekskill, a once gritty town that has now attracted more than 100 artists -- many from New York City -- to set up homes and studios. 
 Peekskill is not the only Westchester city or town trying to lure New York City artists in diaspora. With lower real estate prices than Manhattan, friendly welcomes from neighborhoods and an increasingly diverse population with eclectic tastes, New Rochelle, Port Chester and White Plains have each drawn at least dozens of artists from New York City. And both the mayors of New Rochelle and Peekskill have made the coming of artist studios and galleries a factor in their plans for revitalizing their downtowns. 
"We heard so much about artists moving up to Peekskill and the renaissance of the town," Mr. Carnabuci, owner of an art gallery and two workshops, who was a stockbroker on Wall Street before turning to furniture design. "And the best thing we realized was that we could actually buy a building here. It was affordable."
Artists are not just trickling out of New York City. Rising real estate prices have forced sculptors, painters and photographers out of Manhattan -- and now Brooklyn as well -- in increasing numbers, said New York City arts organizations.
"The rents in New York City are not as affordable as they need to be," said Theodore Berger, the executive director of New York Foundation for the Arts, a statewide organization based in Manhattan, "and the economic situation of artists doesn't seem to be getting better. People are increasingly leaving the city, even Williamsburg and Red Hook in Brooklyn."
Peekskill was the first city or town in Westchester to transform itself into an arts center. The idea originated in the early 1990's when the town's government wanted to turn deserted warehouses -- with high ceilings and exposed brick walls -- into useful spaces. Low interest rates offered by the city and the state helped a group of painters and sculptors buy and renovate the buildings.
"When we first started," said Barney Molloy, the president of Hudson Valley Gateway Chamber of Commerce based in Peekskill, "We put ads in SoHo neighborhood papers and art journals. After a number of people came up here to live and work, they talk to other artists and brought their friends here."
Three years ago, the city hired a developer to build 28 art lofts on a vacant city-owned lot, and more than 100 artists signed up to buy them, Mr. Molloy said. The units, selling for less than $250,000 each, were quickly sold out. Now Peekskill is planning to build a second batch of artist lofts. Each buyer needs to demonstrate that he or she makes a living as an artist by showing, for example, a tax return. 
The arrival of the artists has helped bring a dozen coffee shops, restaurants and boutiques to downtown Peekskill and, more than a year ago, Mark and Livia Strauss as well. The Strausses, two of the best known collectors of contemporary art in the New York region, have started construction on a museum named the Hudson Valley Center for Contemporary Art that is to open in the city later this year. 
Mr. Carnabuci and his wife, Paula, bought a four-story commercial building on South Street in Peekskill in 2000 for less than $300,000. They have turned its first floor into a gallery to display his furniture and other artists' works. They have remodeled its second floor into a yoga and dance studio, where Paula Carnabuci, an exercise physiologist, teaches. The couple also own two workshops for making and finishing furniture, respectively.
Mr. Carnabuci, who had lost money in his initial years as a furniture designer, said he has cultivated a stable and sizable clientele from both Manhattan and Westchester to make his business profitable.
"Thereis this buzz, this energy here," said Mr. Carnabuci, whose gallery Casola, has a special show around a certain theme each month. "We love the camaraderie here among the artists and the residents."
Ivar Hyden, an oil painter who has worked in Manhattan and trotted much of Europe, chose to open his gallery in New Rochelle. The city, turning buildings that have been vacant for years into art lofts and studios, has drawn at least 60 artists, most of whom are from New York City, according to the New Rochelle Council on the Arts. "I enjoy the influx of immigrants here," said Mr. Hyden, 59, "It's not homogenous, and it's very conducive to creating art."
He said he had also chosen the city to be closer to the artistic spirits of Frederick Remington and Norman Rockwell, the famous illustrators of the early 20th century who worked in New Rochelle. 
To city planners and developers, attracting artists like Mr. Hyden and the Carnabucis not only makes cultural sense but also business sense. 
"To bring 24-hour-a-day life into downtown, we need people to help populate downtown," said Ralph DiBart, the director of New Rochelle Business Improvement District, a business organization with government support. "Historically, artists have always been very attracted to urban centers with high-quality spaces. They are the urban, and in some cases, suburban trail blazers."
Martin Ginsburg, owner of Ginsburg Development, is proposing to develop a stretch of downtown Hastings-on-Hudson, and he also sees the value in attracting artists. While his original proposal to build more than 100 apartments on eight acres of land along Route 9A was rejected by the village's planning board, his new plan to include 20 art studios was much better received by town officials. 
"To make a certain place exciting, you need to have certain elements," Mr. Ginsburg said. "And art will help make this place a destination for Westchester residents."
As New York City's artists are finding their homes in Westchester, however, Mr. Berger, the arts foundation director, has lingering worries.
"Unless the rents can stabilize for the long term," he said, pointing out the rising real estate prices in both SoHo and Williamsburg, "the artists might need to move again. Often, developers like artists in the neighborhoods. Then, other people come. And the artists can no longer afford it."

It's Raining Sitters In the Pet Business

BYLINE:  By DEBRA NUSSBAUM

 BODY:
AFTER her fourth layoff in the Manhattan advertising business, Mary Dettloff decided about a year ago that it was time for a new career. She wanted to build her own clientele, to make her own hours, to have some job security and to be with creatures she loved.
 Recently, Ms. Dettloff, of Hoboken, has been too busy to take a vacation. But she is happily supporting herself with Au Pairs for Pets, a service that provides care for dogs, cats, rabbits, birds and even the occasional turtle, when owners are out of town or too busy to do that midday dog walk or administer Fluffy's medications. 
 Ms. Detloff joins a new breed of pet sitters who are increasing in number, predominantly women, and taking the profession as more than a part-time job or something they do for friends on the side. They say that today's very protective pet owners are happy to fork over $15 to $25 a visit to keep their animals well tended. 
 In the last four years, membership in the National Association of Professional Pet Sitters, which is based in Mount Laurel, has jumped to 1,500 from 850, according to Lorraine Zdeb of Somerville, who finished a two-year term as president of the association last year. Another group, Pet Sitters International, based in King, N.C., has 5,500 members, up from 3,000 in November 1999, said Ellen Price, a spokeswoman for the nine-year-old organization, which will have its annual convention this year in Philadelphia, in September. In both organizations, about 80 percent of the members are women.
 Ms. Zdeb (pronounced zeb) has taken care of pets for 15 years. In September she plans to start showing others how to do so, opening the northeast branch of Pet's World Academy, a training center. For about $1,500, potential pet watchers can take a five-day course in both the business and caretaking aspects of pet-sitting.
 Though the state Department of Labor does not keep statistics on entrepreneurial ventures like pet-sitting, a cruise through Web sites shows that New Jersey is loaded with pet-sitting services: Diamond in the Ruff, in Pine Brook; the Critter Guardians, Old Bridge; Paws N' Tails, Fairview; the Catnip Gypsy, Verona; and Kitty Amour Inc., Aberdeen.
 "People love their pets, so this is a good business," said Ms. Dettloff, who plans to hire some part-time employees this year. "Even when money is tight, people have concern for their pets and will accommodate that. They just want their cats to have companionship. We tailor our visits to what the client's needs are."
 Cynthia McCoy, who started Pet's World Academy in Loomis, Calif., calls this "the dog.com era." 
 "It's the opposite of the dot.com era." she said. "Pet sitters can create a quality of life and they won't be laid off."
 Besides, there is a huge customer base, with an estimated 124 million pets in the United States, according to the National Association of Professional Pet Sitters.
 "People today are more interested in the welfare of their animals," Ms. McCoy said. "People love their animals and want to take care of them the right way. The animals are their children. They treat them like children."
 Pet sitters seem to share a passion for animals, and they often start in other careers before entering the pet-sitting business. Many have gained experience by working in pet stores, animal shelters or veterinary offices.
 Michele Lowe of Aberdeen, for example, had worked in passenger service for several airlines and had volunteered at an animal shelter. She started pet-sitting part-time in 1996 and opened Kitty Amour as a full-time business a year ago. She watches cats only, mostly from Monmouth and Middlesex counties, and now has about 50 clients.
 "Like my clients, I view cats as members of my family," Ms. Lowe said. She has worked 35-day stretches with no days off and has done visits from 5 a.m. until 10 p.m., she said.
 She charges $20 for a 45-minute cat visit. Like most serious sitters, she conducts an interview in the home before accepting any job. She and the cat need to "feel each other out," she said, to assure their compatibility. 
 Sitters also see themselves as agents of home security. 
 Ms. Zdeb said that on one of her first jobs, about 13 years ago, she was watching two terriers when her clients were vacationing in Mexico. Neighbors called to tell her that the security system was going off. As it turned out, a mouse had chewed through a wire. Ms. Zdeb stayed overnight at the home until the system was fixed.
 But that wasn't considered a bad day. She said would save that description for the day a dog shredded the contents of a diaper pail all over someone's home and she had to clean it up.
 Pet sitters often leave owners detailed notes of what Rover has been up to in their absence. 
 Thaler Pekar, a communications consultant who frequently hires Ms. Dettloff when she travels on business, says the sitter gives her extensive writings on what goes on in the life of her cat, Marzipan, while she is away.
 "She leaves these full page letters of everything she's done with the cat," Ms. Pekar said. "They're poetry. She'll say how she was approached by the cat and that Marzipan purred quietly or loudly."
 Ellen Johnson of Belle Mead has used Love Your Pet, Ms. Zdeb's company, for two years to take care of her three cats and says she doesn't worry when she has to be away.
 "There's a real trust you have with her," she said. "For people with pets, they are our children."
 A lot of pet sitters start businesses after trying the work out part-time and then forging ahead when the critter clientele grows.
 Ms. McCoy started full-time three years ago after retiring from elementary school teaching. She charges $15 to $20 a visit and has watched everything from dogs and cats to cows, sheep and horses as well as birds, iguanas and rabbits. She defines her clients as "anything non-human." In 2001, she started Pet's World Academy because she wanted to elevate the profession and teach people animal care and business sense. There are no regulations or certifications for pet sitting, so this was a way to give people training and some professional status.
 "It's disappointing that anyone can call themselves a pet sitter," she said. "We needed to have some standards."
 The economy and record high unemployment seem to be fueling the pet-sitter market. Laurie Boreisha of Bloomfield started her business, Critter Care, about four years ago after being laid off by a computer company.
 "My career was computers, but I always loved animals," she said.
 She had been an animal keeper at the Turtle Back Zoo in West Orange and had managed a pet store. She was able to start her business through word of mouth, a small Web site and an ad in a coupon magazine. She specializes in exotic pets and has watched parrots, ferrets, rabbits, a rat and a skunk. After four years, she has more than 300 clients.
 "I love the exposure to the animals," she said. "I can't get enough of them."

HEADLINE: Marriage for the Impoverished 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Government spending for marriage programs is a topic worthy of debate, but Michael Tanner (Op-Ed, July 29) makes some mischaracterizations about marriage. 
Many fathers are indeed living with or involved with the mother of their child when the child is born. Cohabiting couples have a higher breakup rate than married couples, so if those couples who wish to get married were encouraged to do so, their child will likely benefit from increased economic stability. 
 While teenage marriages are a bad idea, the common perception that delaying marriage indefinitely is the key to a stable marriage is not true either. In fact, self-reported marital happiness peaks for women whose first marriage was in their early to mid-20's.
Marriage is not "the" solution to poverty, but it is one important arena that public policy should be willing to address.

ECONOMY: A MYSTERY

BYLINE:  By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
Nothing illustrates the opposing tugs on the American economy more vividly than the data released last week by the federal government.
 The good news, the upward tug, came on Thursday. 
The Commerce Department announced that the economy had grown at a much faster pace in the second quarter than in the previous six months: at an annual rate of 2.4 percent versus 1.4 percent. Forecasters hailed the report as evidence that the economy is at long last on its way up after many months of sluggish growth. 
 There is enough short-term juice in the system -- military spending, tax rebates, mortgage refinancing, spectacularly low interest rates -- to strengthen the economy for a quarter or two. But what kicks in to sustain healthy growth once the temporary supports give out?
The answer from experts is job creation. More jobs mean more spending and steady growth. But Friday, the Labor Department announced another month of job destruction -- 44,000 in July. And the 30,000 jobs that everyone thought had been lost in June was really, on closer inspection, 72,000.
Unless the Labor Department has better news next month, the surge in growth is in danger of dissipating. Louis Uchitelle

How the Mayor Ended Up Driving a Stolen Car

BYLINE:  By Robert Strauss

 BODY:
Gwendolyn A. Faison wasn't looking for anything particularly fancy in a new car. After all, Camden is in a financial crisis and ostentation would be unseemly. 
 Still, Ms. Faison, who happens to be the mayor, felt she needed a new official car when her old one had racked up 75,000 miles. 
 The police found her what they thought was a proper vehicle: a 1998 Lincoln Town Car impounded after it had been found stolen. The police tried to find the owner but could not make contact.
 Yet as the mayor started using the car late last month, a reporter from The Courier-Post discovered that it had been owned by a Pennsauken man, Robert Vinis. It seems that Mr. Vinis had apparently not been notified by the Camden police that they had recovered his car. In the meantime, he had filed an insurance claim and been reimbursed for his loss.
 The police said the mayor was technically in the clear about using the car. And neither Mr. Vinis nor the mayor would comment, though a spokeswoman said Ms. Faison intended to keep using the car. Robert Strauss

 UNDER THE BANNER
OF HEAVEN
A Story of Violent Faith.
By Jon Krakauer.
372 pp. New York:
Doubleday. $26.
 SINCE Sept. 11, 2001, Americans have talked a lot about the dark side of religion, but for the most part it isn't religion in America they've had in mind. Jon Krakauer wants to broaden their perspective. In "Under the Banner of Heaven," he enters the obscure world of Mormon fundamentalism to tell a story of, as he puts it, "faith-based violence."
In July 1984, in a Utah town called American Fork, Dan Lafferty entered the home of his brother Allen, who was at work, and killed Allen's wife and 15-month-old daughter. Dan, now serving a life sentence, has no remorse about the murders and no trouble explaining them. His older brother, Ron, who assisted in the crime and is now on death row, had received a revelation from God mandating that Brenda and Erica Lafferty be "removed" so that, as God put it, "my work might go forward." Brenda Lafferty, a spunky 24-year-old, had been bad-mouthing polygamy and in other ways impeding the fundamentalist mission that had seized Ron and Dan.
Parallels between the Lafferty brothers and Islamic terrorists aren't obvious, and Krakauer doesn't explore them very explicitly. The author of "Into Thin Air," the best-selling account of death on Mount Everest, he is essentially a narrative writer. He mentions Osama bin Laden near the beginning and end of the book and leaves it for readers to draw their own conclusions, with some help from the book jacket's reference to "Taliban-like theocracies in the American heartland."
Still, by setting Mormon fundamentalism in its historical and scriptural context, and by powerfully illuminating Dan Lafferty's mind, Krakauer provides enough raw material for a seminar on post-9/11 questions. What drives people toward fundamentalism, and then toward violence? Where is the line between religious fanaticism and insanity? How heavy is the influence of religious history, in particular scripture, as opposed to the material conditions of modern life? 
Mormon fundamentalists aren't Mormons in the common sense of the word. They don't belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which abandoned the doctrine of "plural marriage" in 1890. Many live in small towns (the "Taliban-like theocracies") where men evade anti-bigamy laws by having one lawful wife and additional "spiritual" wives. Others -- especially "independents," who belong to no particular fundamentalist sect -- just blend into the landscape. The street preacher who allegedly kidnapped 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart last year and forced her to "marry" him was an independent.
Dan and Ron Lafferty weren't born into this world. They were raised as severely pious but mainstream Mormons, and both were married before they flirted with fundamentalism.
Dan went first. It might seem that a man's attraction to a polygamous sub-culture needs little explaining, especially if he comes from a religion that discourages nonmarital sex with inordinate vigor. But Dan's conversion was about more than wanderlust. After his mom-and-pop sandwich business was shut down for lack of a license, leaving his family in a financial bind, he grew ardently averse to government regulation and found backing for this sentiment in the Book of Mormon. It was in this libertarian spirit that he came to reject the Mormon Church's jettisoning of polygamy; church leaders had caved in to an invasive federal government. 
Ron, like Dan, turned toward fundamentalism while under economic pressure. The bank was about to foreclose on his home -- he would sometimes break into tears over his family's plight -when Dan convinced him that God wanted him to forsake material goals and become a fundamentalist missionary. Dan also drew his four other brothers into the fold, but there was one problem: Brenda, the wife of his brother Allen. As the Lafferty boys started espousing polygamy and other strange things, Brenda urged the other wives to resist. And Ron's wife took Brenda's advice in spades. She divorced Ron and took the children to Florida. So when Ron's divine revelation about Brenda's "removal" arrived, he was in a receptive frame of mind. 
Though organized around the Lafferty brothers' crime, "Under the Banner of Heaven" recounts the always interesting history of Mormonism, starting with the day in 1823 when the New York visionary and suspected charlatan Joseph Smith met an angel named Moroni. Krakauer wants to show how the Lafferty murder is rooted in the Mormon past. He emphasizes, for example, the doctrine of "blood atonement," stressed by Smith but later dropped by the church.
It's true that Dan Lafferty, while delving into church history, encountered this idea. But it's also true that by then he already harbored volatile grievances and that he had come from a violent background; his father killed the family dog with a baseball bat as family members looked on. Most religions, and certainly the monotheistic ones, have odes to violence in their scriptural past. (See, for example, Deuteronomy.) The question is what makes some people more inclined than others to latch onto these passages. 
However valid Krakauer's linkage of past and present, it steepens an already formidable storytelling challenge. The contemporary parts of the book -skipping from the Lafferty case to sketches of two fundamentalist towns to a late-breaking chapter on Elizabeth Smart -- can themselves disorient the reader with disparate detail. (From a strictly literary standpoint, polygamy's main downside is its creation of lots of characters with the same last name.) With long historical sections mixed in, the momentum dissipates further. Almost every section of the book is fascinating in its own right, and together the chapters make a rich picture, but there is little narrative synergy among them.
The book ends near the desert town of Colorado City, Ariz., a bastion of fundamentalism, with DeLoy Bateman, a resident, reflecting on his conversion to atheism. He grants that believers are happy but says happiness isn't as important as being free to think for yourself. He's referring partly to the totalitarian undercurrent of Mormon fundamentalism. (The town's leading prophet tells his flock to avoid television, magazines and newspapers -- and sometimes tells teenage girls whom they should marry.) Still, this, the book's closing note, will be taken by some as a verdict on religion writ large -- especially since, at the moment Bateman notes religion's conduciveness to happiness, he happens to look out over "a quivering sheen of mirage."
Certainly the picture of religion presented in the book is unflattering. Linking the Laffertys to Mormon history means stressing its violent and authoritarian aspects. And of course neither of these is an invention of Krakauer's. (Polygamous societies in general tend toward authoritarianism, as the anthropologist Laura Betzig has shown. She attributes this to the need of powerful men to control not just women but the understandably unsettled lower-status males who, through the grim mathematics of polygamy, go mateless.) Still, it would have been nice to see some of religion's upside. Something must explain the vibrancy of mainstream Mormonism, and I doubt it's just the dark energy of residual authoritarianism. Religion, like patriotism, can nurture virtue within the group even while directing hostility beyond it. 
Courtroom arguments over Ron Lafferty's sanity impinge on the question of religion from another angle, by questioning the line between religious fervor and pathological delusion. Though believers may find this question offensive, in a way it acquits religion of some charges against it. If there isn't much difference between the talking dog that gave David Berkowitz his marching orders and the "God" that visited Ron Lafferty, then for all we know Lafferty, had he not been religious, would have gotten his guidance from another voice. 
THE human mind is great at justifying its goals, and it does so by whatever medium is handy, including -- if neither god nor dog seems plausible -- simple moralizing. Dan Lafferty, asked to distinguish himself from Osama bin Laden, says, "I believe I'm a good person." An unfortunately common sentiment. Krakauer writes that "as a means of motivating people to be cruel or inhumane . . . there may be no more potent force than religion." But sheer instinctive self-righteousness may ultimately be a bigger part of the problem. It is a common denominator of crimes committed in the name of religion, nationalism, racism -- even, sometimes, nihilism.
And it isn't the only element of the Lafferty story with this kind of versatility. Dan and Ron Lafferty saw their quest for security and stature frustrated and then found someone to blame -- a description that, in one sense or another, applies to Mohamed Atta, Timothy McVeigh and the Columbine killers. "Under the Banner of Heaven" is an arresting portrait of depravity that may have broader relevance than the author intended.

The Tug of Paternalism

BYLINE:  By James Traub; James Traub is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
When Liberian citizens late last month deposited the corpses of their friends and loved ones, killed by rebel shells, at the gate of the American Embassy compound in the capital of Monrovia, they were not only issuing a desperate plea for salvation but also making a statement of responsibility: it is you, the United States, who must answer our prayers. But why? Because freed American slaves settled in Liberia 180 years ago? Do these ties of history impose a special obligation? Can the dim colonial past exert a tug even on the hardheaded policy makers in the Bush administration?
 This administration came into office vowing to avoid what one of its officials described to me at the time as "profligate intervention." We would intervene to protect our interests, not to save woebegone people in far-off lands. During the presidential campaign, George Bush took this position to its logical conclusion when he said that he would not have intervened in Rwanda in 1994 had he been president, even though close to a million people died in the ensuing genocide. If anything, the war against terrorism provides an ever-more-powerful rationale for preserving the U.S. military for serious wars against people who want to do us harm. 
 And yet the Bush administration is planning to station troops off the coast of Liberia. (Whether those troops will come ashore remains unclear at this writing.) Why Liberia if not Rwanda, an infinitely more desperate situation? Perhaps President Bush needs to prove that his promises of engagement on his recent trip to Africa were not empty ones. But it is also true that Rwanda wasn't ours; only common humanity bade us act, and common humanity, for George Bush (or Bill Clinton, for that matter), was not enough. History has made Liberia ours. Paternalism, if not colonialism, remains a real force, especially in Africa. 
Look at the example of Sierra Leone and Great Britain, its former colonial master. The British have no meaningful "interests" to protect in Sierra Leone. The expatriate community is long gone, and the country is almost irrelevant commercially. The only thing that remains is ephemeral -- a historic relationship. But for the British, that was enough. In the spring of 2000, when a precarious peace entrusted to a U.N. force collapsed, Prime Minister Tony Blair sent troops into Sierra Leone. A contingent of 800 soldiers deterred an attack on Freetown, the capital, and most of them quickly returned home, demonstrating that such interventions can achieve a great deal with minimal effort.
Liberia was never an official American colony, and yet since 1821, when the American Colonization Society bought land there from local chiefs to resettle slaves, it has been deeply entangled with the United States. Its capital was named after President James Monroe. Liberia calls its currency the dollar; it has a constitution, a flag and a government modeled on ours; and it is still largely controlled by the descendants of the original settlers, known as Americo-Liberians. 
Liberia once did matter to the United States. There was rubber. Later there were C.I.A. posts and satellite-tracking installations. But all that came to an abrupt end with the conclusion of the cold war. When the country's strongman, Samuel Doe, was about to be toppled from power in 1990, the U.S. sent warships with more than 2,000 marines -- to evacuate Americans. Doe, our former client, we left to be butchered. Over the next decade, as warlords fought to dominate the clandestine trade in diamonds and timber, Liberia descended into a state of terrifying chaos. It now has nothing but trouble to offer a potential savior.
And yet it was to our embassy gate that those bodies were dragged, because it is as natural for Liberians to look to us for protection as it is for Leoneans to look to Great Britain and Ivoirians to France (which sent troops to the Ivory Coast to quell an uprising there last fall). We may object that Liberia is not our problem. But whose is it, then? Only the terminally naive still expect U.N. peacekeeping to work in situations of rampant violence. The U.N. peacekeeping force sent to Sierra Leone in 1999 inspired so little respect, much less fear, that about 500 of them were taken hostage by rebels -- an act that provoked the British intervention. A West African force known as Ecomog, which entered Liberia in 1990, did ultimately provide a measure of stability; and troops from Nigeria are now preparing to return. But a local army will not have the deterrent value of a well-armed and well-trained Western one. 
For all the talk of global integration, the fate of the very poorest countries has become, if anything, a matter of even greater indifference to the rich ones than it used to be. Virtually the entirety of West Africa, and for that matter the equally beleaguered nations of central Africa, like Burundi, offer little strategic and only potential economic value to the West and do not really figure in the war on terrorism. And the fate of Rwanda proves all too clearly that, in the absence of self-interest, appeals to common humanity will not bring rescue. 
And so these countries are left with no claims save the utterly unexpected one: paternalism. What could be more archaic in this globalized age? And isn't there something here of the former servant throwing himself on the mercy of his master? Well, yes. And that is a terrible affirmation of failure. But is paternalism so very bad? It's an acknowledgment of obligations incurred by shared history. It's an expression of kinship. After all, Liberia looks to the United States because the United States is in its blood. It is not simply pro-American but, in some odd but meaningful way, American. Would it be better for us to renounce paternalism and its obligations -- and abandon Liberia to its dismal fate?

HEADLINE: A Landlord's Lot Is Sometimes Not an Easy One 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT F. MOSS

 BODY:
IT was a blistering Saturday afternoon in late August, and while the rest of Manhattan was relaxing at a beach somewhere, I was mopping up water as it spurted from a hole in the second-floor ceiling of a small apartment building in Murray Hill. The tenants were away, and by the time I had gotten there the water had had plenty of time to ruin a lovely parquet floor, while also taking down part of the ceiling. Moreover, every emergency plumbing service was booked.
 As you can probably tell, I am a real estate tycoon. Or at least that is how I would be loosely categorized in the trench warfare between landlord and tenant advocates over the state's rent control law, the latest round of which was recently concluded in Albany. Known officially as the Rent Regulation Reform Act of 1997, the statute was renewed on June 20 for eight years, but only after the pro-landlord Senate had outmaneuvered the pro-tenant Assembly to strengthen the law. 
 So virulently polarized are the two camps that landlords are routinely portrayed as fat cats, with unlimited tracts of income property. But Roberta Bernstein, president of the Small Property Owners of New York, estimates that more than three out of five New York landlords own only one building, and around half of all buildings have 15 or fewer tenants. This part of the city's housing market has received little attention, and what follows is a modest effort to fill the void.
As a journalist and former English professor, I had few qualifications for running an apartment building, unless you count the one-bedroom condominium my family and I bought as a rental unit in 1993 in a Midtown building. We had a small but flourishing real estate business in California, and in 1997, with my guileless encouragement, we decided to buy a whole apartment building in Manhattan. 
A broker found us a converted Victorian town house in Murray Hill. It had four stabilized apartments and two floors delivered vacant, and the owners accepted our offer of $885,000.
A New York closing cannot be very traumatic for the likes of a Donald Trump or Harry Macklowe, but for us, it was as brutal as a visit from Tony Soprano. Actually, I cannot think of any TV show or movie that resembles what happened on May 2, 1997 in a law office on Broadway, although "The Night of the Living Dead" comes close. 
Lawyers, bankers and a title company representative sat around a large conference table eyeing us carnivorously and uncapping mental ketchup bottles. Although we had borrowed an extra $40,000 to cover our closing costs, our actual tab came to $60,000. We had to make up the difference with personal checks and then, demeaningly, scramble to cover them with cash advances on credit cards.
When my shellshocked family returned to California the next day, my mother's last comforting words were: "We got you a piece of the rock. Now try not to squander our investment."
Behind her tough language, I knew, was a desire that I should cultivate more practical aptitudes than the ability to scan English verse or explain the Romantic Fallacy. For me, it had to be: Goodbye, Keats and Shelley; hello, Pratt & Lambert.
So ignorant was I of New York real estate that I was barely aware of the Great Landlord-Tenant War of 1997, which was then raging. The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, had pledged to end rent regulation and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, in alliance with various tenant advocacy organizations, had sworn to preserve it. 
The present law began as rent control during World War II and was amended many times. The biggest change came in 1969, when rent stabilization was introduced, eventually supplanting most of the rent-control system. In the spring of 2002, 1.07 million apartments enjoyed rent-regulated status, according to the census bureau, and most tenants regard this protection as a birthright the Founding Fathers unaccountably omitted from the Constitution.
My own situation was unusual. While I now co-owned a rent-stabilized building, I lived in a stabilized apartment in Greenwich Village. I still do. Thus, I both won and lost when the rent guidelines were renewed in the session of the State Legislature that ended in June.

Starting Out
Little in Common With Industry Moguls
In my rookie season as a landlord, I quickly discovered I had little kinship with the barons of the industry, who had management companies to supervise their buildings, with an on-site superintendent and several porters for each address. Even small buildings need a super, and while big-league landlords can afford a factotum, someone exceptionally handy who saves them money on repairs, their small-time counterparts cannot.
In my case, I hired a cheerful, obliging native of the Balkans who was already in charge of several buildings on the block and who had a solution for every problem: leaks ("You need plumber."), shorts ("Better get electrician.") and faulty deadbolts ("You call locksmith.").
With no underlings to serve as a buffer, I was soon the recipient of frequent calls and messages about clogged drains, broken light switches, loose bathroom tile and roach infestation. This was my real moment of truth. I had joined the Temple of Moloch, but did I have the makings of a New York landlord? 
For inspiration, I looked to men like a well-known landlord who at the time was allegedly making life miserable for his unwanted rent-regulated tenants in a Park Avenue building. Then I looked inside myself. Big mistake. Where I hoped to find measureless caverns of self-interest, I found instead a soft, squishy belief that all tenants, stabilized or not, deserved the services and repairs mandated in their leases.
I had no choice but to be a hands-on owner, and a whole new breed of workers -- painters, roofers, carpenters -- burst into my life. These were men with dilapidated trucks or vans and plentiful excuses for why they were always late. ("Never seen the tunnel so backed up." "Truck broke down two blocks from the Queensboro, no kidding." "Can't believe I forgot my RotoHammer.") 
Like all landlords, large and small, I soon found that in any apartment house, plumbing is by far the biggest source of grief. A handyman can replace a rotted out washer or install a new shower head, but if a pipe ruptures in a wall or ceiling, you have to swallow hard and send for . . . a licensed plumber.
Not that anyone of this description will ever actually show up: expect a "plumber's assistant" instead. However small the job, this surrogate is guaranteed to hand you a bill that will buckle your knees. But you must remember that you are paying not only for the work he did but for the boss's overhead -- his insurance, payroll tax, office supplies, coffee, bagels, etc.
All plumbing breakdowns are potentially serious, but a landlord's most perilous dramas occur in the boiler room. Our boiler, though brand new, was so erratic I nicknamed it the White Devil. As if in response, it inflicted its own brand of Jacobean tragedy, shutting down more than once in the dead of winter.
People who see all landlords as creatures of insatiable greed do not understand that for thousands of small-building owners obscene profits are not in the cards. We are more vulnerable to a sudden jump in oil prices or the turbulent effects of utility deregulation than the industry goliaths. 
Meanwhile, the growth of rent on stabilized units is in no way commensurate with expenses. During my tenure as a landlord, rent renewal increases -- on average, 4 percent for a two-year lease, 2 percent for one year -- have remained minuscule and effectively evaporate when the newly adjusted real estate tax bill arrives. 
In June, the Rent Guidelines Board, the city agency that sets the increases, lifted them to 7.5 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively. But a year that began with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg confiscating an additional 18.5 percent in real estate taxes is not likely to end with significantly more profits in landlords' pockets. 
For the small-building owner, a further barrier against prodigal wealth is debt service. Your larger brethren will, of course, face monthly mortgage payments that dwarf your own, but, then, so do their assets. Moreover, banks cut their biggest customers the best deals. 
If you are out-of-town rubes like us, however, with newly hired and inadequate counsel, you may soon find yourself locked into a penal loan agreement. Our lender, a major player in New York real estate, feigned generosity by requesting only a 10 percent down payment, then hedged its bets by requiring liens on two of our other properties. The interest rate, 9.25 percent, was so high that it might as well have been called "the vig."
Every clause in our agreement was a windowless cell, and any request to be released from one was met with the same response: "You signed an agreement . . . you signed an agreement." One of the clauses compelled us to turn the first and second floors of the building into a duplex and get at least $4,000 in rent for the new space. (Small apartment buildings, I learned, are more valuable if, by virtue of at least one luxurious unit, they have the potential to be owner-occupied.)
I wrote a polite letter to the bank president suggesting that it made moresense to rent two floor-throughs at $2,000 to $2,500 apiece than to try to squeeze double that amount from one duplex. When the answer eventually arrived from Mount Olympus, it read, "You signed an agreement."
The renovation went forward, took several months and eventually cost more than $100,000. We even added a sunroom. While Fontainebleau-on-37th-Street was under construction, we lost the income on two floors, and I had to make up the difference between $4,134 in rental income and a mortgage payment just under $10,000. 
When our creation was finally completed, we were fortunate to find a high-end couple who liked the results and could afford the rent. Augmented by rent renewal increases, the monthly rent roll climbed to $10,106, which was divided as follows: the bank (approximately $9,650), the super's salary ($300), fuel and utilities ($326), repairs ($442) and general maintenance ($205). Everything else was mine to keep. Everything.
My personal woes notwithstanding, residential real estate in New York is a lucrative investment. Appreciation, equity build-up and copious tax deductions are major economic blessings for a landlord. In six years, our $885,000 building has about doubled in value to $1.75 million, while permitting an annual depreciation expense of roughly $34,000.
Although stabilized tenants cling to their apartments, when one of them is vacated state rent laws entitle landlords to raise rents in three primary ways: a vacancy increase of 20 percent for a new tenant's two-year lease (a bit less for a one-year lease); one-fortieth per month of the cost of any improvements, and a "longevity bonus" for longtime residents (calculated at six-tenths of 1 percent times the tenant's last legal rent multiplied by the number of years of residency beyond eight).
Only once did I have a tenant vacate a stabilized apartment, but I was then able to raise the rent on his fifth-floor walkup studio from $784 to $1,277. While this space, like many apartments, might never command $2,000 a month, more desirable units can be lifted to the deregulation level with comparative ease. (Apartments renting for $2,000 a month are automatically deregulated if they are vacant. Occupied apartments whose rent reaches that figure can be deregulated if the income of the tenants has been $175,000 or more for two years.) 
The consequence is a shrinkage of what Michael McKee, associate director of New York Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, calls "affordable housing for ordinary people." The retention of the $2,000 threshold in the new law, rather than scrapping what is called high rent vacancy decontrol entirely as urged by Mr. McKee and Mr. Silver, was seen as a victory for landlords.
Without repeal of vacancy decontrol, Mr. McKee believes, rent regulation is doomed, a view disputed by others. Personally, I favor retention of rent regulation if only because I believe its abolition would drive New York's mostly penurious intellectual and artistic community, so vital to our municipal character, out of town. Hearing these views, a fellow landlord once called me a "traitor to my class." 
Landlord advocates like Ms. Bernstein prefer to focus on one issue, operating expenses, particularly unexpected lurches in the cost of insurance and fuel. But a report by the city's Rent Guidelines Board, the "2003 Income and Expense Study," covering 2001 (the most recent year for which figures are available), concludes that net operating income -- gross rental income minus expenses but exclusive of debt service -- was 44 percent.
"What other industry" Mr. McKee asks asrhetorically as possible, "could even begin to think about a return of 44 cents on the dollar?" Although the board report excludes buildings with 10 units or fewer, there is little reason to think their arithmetic would be any different.

A Way Out
With Rates Falling, Refinancing Beckons
For me, as the months and years ground on without change, it became clear that deliverance could take only one form: refinancing. By 1999, interest rates had come down, and my prepayment penalty had dropped from outrageous to merely unreasonable. Surely, I thought, some nice little savings and loan would rescue me from the financial boulder I was pinned underneath.
Hence, I set about shopping our $800,000 mortgage to every imaginable lender. Some did not do deals under a million; others did not finance buildings with more than four apartments. My next lesson in real estate was that even banks that had a "product" intended for you would offer only a 70 to 75 percent loan-to-value package, then mercilessly under-appraise the property. Simultaneously, many of them will shake you down for every preliminary fee they can, with not a penny refunded if the loan is aborted. 
I began my tale in media res, so perhaps it is time to dissolve back to that sweltering August afternoon, now evening, as I stood in the heartbreaking, disfigured beauty of the parlor room. It was around 10:50 when a hulking young man arrived, with the standard after-hours plumber's greeting: "Hi, I'm Frank, and I have to charge you the emergency rate."

As the Meter Runs
Plumber Sinks Budget For Months to Come
I had no choice but to assent, and Frank began sawing out a foot or two of badly corroded galvanized pipe, while raving about "Rush Hour II," the movie he had just seen when his dispatcher beeped him. For the next hour, Frank critiqued numerous other summer flicks as he fitted a brand new section of cast-iron pipe into place and attached a metal band. 
The meter in my head told me we were probably up around $700 by now. But when Frank checked the line, it was still not clear. Uh-oh. The going rate for clearing a stoppage before sundown on a weekday was $100 to $120, so on a Saturday night, it could cost . . . mmm, maybe it was better not to know.
A little after midnight, I waited in my vestibule while Frank wrote up my invoice, including $300 for the snaking. Well, I thought, it took him almost 15 minutes. The final tab was $1,028, which capsized my budget for months to come.
I trudged home, knowing the crisis of the parlor room was far from over. Looking back, I wonder if it could be a narrative series, like the Patrick O'Brien sea novels. You know, "the adventure continues": how my insurance company dispatched Karl, the ninja claims adjuster, who -- Pow! Thwack! Crunch! -- annihilated my compensation request; how I found a Russian contractor in a discount-coupon packet who was willing to work on Labor Day weekend; how his hearty crew, smoking like chimneys and cursing in their native tongue, rebuilt the parlor as meticulously as if it were the Winter Palace; and so forth.
I might have continued to be the poorest real estate tycoon in town forever, but one day, in a surly, kick-the-cat mood, I flipped open the classified directory and picked a bank at random, intent on administering a nasty browbeating to someone, anyone. My victim was Eastbank, a small Chinese-American lender, or more specifically, the pleasant-sounding Asian woman who took my call.
By now our loan was down to $770,000, and I practically snarled, "I don't suppose you can give us that much."
"Yes, we can," she replied imperturbably.
I pummeled her again: "But, of course, you don't do multifamily dwellings, do you?"
"No, we do," she answered. 
Her courtesy was so unrelenting it took a real effort to remain snide. "Yeah, but what kind of terms?"
Her response: "We can offer you a five-year balloon, fixed, at 7.5 percent, with an option to renew, or an adjustable-rate loan."
When she told me the current adjustable rate, 5.75 percent, my rancor dissipated instantly, and I clung tightly to the sofa, afraid I might levitate. A new loan at this rate would take my payments down to an ecstatically low level. The closing costs she subsequently itemized -- no application fee; $1,500 for an appraisal; one point, meaning 1 percent of the loan for the bank -- only intensified my euphoria. In my feverish gratitude, I made immediate plans to visit China, learn the language and, if possible, marry the loan officer. My next closing promised to be pure bliss. It was.
A healthy bank account certainly does a lot to relieve a landlord's travails. Today, repairs and upkeep on the building are occasionally still costly, but no longer traumatic. I am now able to pay my mortgage by automatic deduction rather than my previous method -- sprinting desperately into the bank 20 minutes before the deadline with my check outstretched. Also, it no longer matters that at least three of my four stabilized tenants will apparently not be leaving until they have to be assisted to the door by paramedics.
I know I will never be a genuine tycoon, my perspective on the city defined by the smoked glass of a limousine. Frankly, I prefer the view from the vestibule anyway.

HEADLINE: Business; 
A Movie Theater Revival, Aided by Teenagers

BYLINE:  By ALEX MARKELS

 BODY:
SARA FANNING, who is 14 and lives near Denver, went to the movies with a group of friends recently. Her parents dropped her off at the theater, which was great, she said, "because they're not, like, watching over you."
 For theaters, there may be no group of moviegoers more popular than teenagers, who buy more popcorn and candy than their parents do. Marketers also value the buying power of teenagers and are devising an array of new promotions and advertising to pitch to them before the main feature starts. 
 "There's an old saying in the movie business that as long as parents want to get away from kids, and as long as kids want to get away from parents, the business will thrive," said Kurt C. Hall, co-chief executive of the Regal Entertainment Group, the nation's largest theater chain. 
Regal, which is based in Englewood, Colo., owns 6,119 theaters around the country, or about 20 percent of the industry total, including the Denver West theater chain that drew Sara and her friends. 
Although recent attendance numbers have retreated somewhat from last year's record-setting 1.6 billion seats filled, teenagers like Sara are still going to the movies in droves. 
"They're the ones supercharging the profitability of the industry," said Howard S. Marks, chairman of Oak Tree Capital Management in Los Angeles, which owns an 11 percent stake in Regal. "It's a cash cow."
Regal is so flush with cash these days that last month it handed out what it called an "extraordinary" cash dividend of $5.05 a share. At the stock's recent price in the $18 range, that represents a payout of nearly 30 percent.
It also represents a huge turnaround from a few years ago, when Regal, along with a dozen other movie chains, filed for bankruptcy court protection. The cause was a megaplex construction boom that increased the number of American movie screens by nearly 35 percent from 1995 to 2000, nearly three times the rise in ticket sales in the same period, according to figures from the Motion Picture Association of America.
The plush stadium seating and huge screens of the megaplexes became a big hit with movie fans, who started avoiding the older theaters. Companies like Regal Cinemas, United Artists Theaters and Loews Cineplex, unable to escape long-term leases, found themselves drowning in debt as average revenue per screen plummeted at the end of the 1990's.
At about that time, Oak Tree and the Denver billionaire Philip F. Anschutz began buying up bonds of the troubled companies for as little as 60 cents on the dollar. Mr. Anschutz bet more than $500 million on Regal, United Artists and Edwards Cinemas, swapping debt for equity in the three struggling companies.
A year ago, Mr. Anschutz combined them into a single public entity, and he now controls more than half the shares. A spokesman for Mr. Anschutz said he declined to comment for this article.
The reorganized company took advantage of federal bankruptcy protection to renegotiate leases on hundreds of theaters, closing unprofitable ones and slashing its debt in the process. Other industry players pursued similar strategies. Together they cut the number of theaters by 1,500 from 1999 to 2002, nearly a 20 percent decline, while increasing the average number of screens per site from five to six. 
"The industry is still overscreened, but they've come a long way in cleaning up their act," said Kavir Dhar, an analyst with Jefferies & Company in New York. He has "buy" ratings on Regal and a competitor, AMC Entertainment, the nation's third-largest chain. 
Regal's revenue for the second quarter ended June 26 increased to $648.1 million , a 6.7 percent rise from the period a year earlier. Earnings, meanwhile, grew to $47.1 million from $10.5 million.
Investors like Mr. Marks are optimistic about Regal's prospects. The company's recent one-time dividend "sends a signal to the market that we're not going make the same mistakes that the industry did 10 years ago and use every bit of cash to expand through new buildings and overpriced acquisitions," said Mr. Marks, whose company collected more than $78 million from the payout. "The best use of the money was to return it to shareholders."
That isn't to say that Regal has avoided buying opportunities. Mr. Hall, the co-chief executive, noted that the company's acquisition in March of 52 theaters from Hoyts Cinemas, in which it paid approximately $182 million in cash and stock for 60 percent of Hoyts's screens, allowed Regal to "cherry-pick the theaters we wanted."
YET he and Mike Campbell, his co-chief executive, acknowledge that such opportunities were rare these days, in part because smaller family-owned chain owners who survived the downturn are less inclined to sell at fire-sale prices.
"We believe there are opportunities, but we aren't willing to stretch the multiple we're willing to pay," Mr. Campbell said in a recent conference call with analysts.
And while acquisitions may help improve economies of scale and increase bargaining power with suppliers, they have yet to give theater owners leverage in negotiating distribution agreements with movie studios, which represent about 55 percent of the theaters' costs. 
"As big as it's become, even Regal hasn't been able to improve the terms of the split between it and the movie distributors," said Dennis B. McAlpine, founder of McAlpine Associates, a media research firm. "So there isn't much to be gained by expanding aggressively."
Instead, Mr. Hall has worked to increase profit by improving revenue at existing theaters. To that end, the company's new Cinemedia division has invested $70 million to replace old-fashioned slide presentations displayed before films. New satellite-fed digital projection systems are now being installed in 5,000 Regal theaters. 
Cinemedia now beams everything from live rock concerts of groups like Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers to corporate "cinemeetings" for Microsoft and other companies. Such videoconferencing has become the division's fastest-growing business area.
Mr. Hall sees even greater potential in using the Cinemedia system to exploit the undivided attention his screens enjoy once moviegoers take their seats. "You don't have a channel changer in your hand, and you can't push the mute button or go to the refrigerator for a beer," he said of the advantages of Regal's recently introduced 2wenty, an advertising and promotional program that began last February.
The 20-minute stream of music videos, television clips and advertisements is shown in four versions, for audiences watching films rated G, PG, PG-13 and R. It precedes trailers and the feature film.
When the Cinemedia installation is completed later this year, it will reach up to 250 million of Regal's patrons annually. Because the digital format can be modified and distributed to individual theaters almost instantaneously, "advertisers can target exactly who they want to reach," Mr. Hall said. "There's no other advertising medium that can do that as well."
Similar movie advertising already garners about $250 million in annual revenue and is expected to grow by 30 percent annually, according to the Cinema Advertising Council, a trade group. Digital display is expected to further entice advertisers to sign up. "It's on a 40-foot screen with surround sound, so it has a fantastic impact," Matthew Kearney, president of the group, said. Some moviegoers have reacted negatively to the advertising onslaught. After sitting through a similar promotional barrage at a Loews Cineplex theater in Chicago, Miriam Fisch, a resident of nearby Evanston, became so incensed that she filed a class-action suit against the company.
"Movie theaters dupe people into coming early so they can force ads on them and take advantage of their status as a captive audience," said Mark Weinberg, a Chicago attorney who represents Ms. Fisch. "They say the movie will start at 7:45 p.m., when in fact they start the commercials at 7:45 p.m. People expect previews, but this new phenomenon of showing commercials is neither accepted nor appreciated."
A Loews spokeswoman declined to comment on the lawsuit, but in a statement, the company called it "frivolous and completely without merit." It believes that pre-feature advertisements "on the whole enhance" audience members' experience.
For their part, the teenage girls attending "Pirates of the Caribbean" with Sara Fanning were unimpressed with Regal's 2wenty showing. "It was pretty irritating," said Nina Simons, a 14-year-old from Denver who tried not to pay attention to the ads while chatting in her seat with friends.
The group was even less appreciative of the free mini-CD's, featuring the singer Rachel Farris, that were attached to soda lids. Most of the girls put the CD's in their microwaves, Nina said. "They come out kind of crackled and melty. It's pretty nifty."

Penney Hires Its Own Martha

BYLINE:  By BROOK S. MASON

 BODY:
THE J. C. Penney Company is trying to create the new Martha.
 Ever since Martha Stewart's indictment for obstruction of justice in the ImClone Systems securities fraud scandal, mass-market retailers have seen the moment as an opportunity to usurp her role as the goddess of goods. Ms. Stewart's towels, sheets and housewares have given the Kmart Corporation a profitable, signature style. 
 This week, Penney recruited designer Chris Madden, the author of 15 books as well as a column syndicated to 400 newspapers, to be the company's Home Collection spokeswoman and design expert. Mrs. Madden will develop products that will be rolled out next year. 
Penney, with some 1,000 stores and $1.4 billion in sales a year, is hoping to reach at least $2 billion in sales with the help of Mrs. Madden, according to Charles Chinni, executive vice president for Penney's home, fine jewelry and family footwear divisions. She will create a new brand for the store called Celebrating Life/Creating Style.
"She represents everything we believe in: trust and value," said Mr. Chinni. "Bringing her on will enhance our already more than century old brand." He cites her creative direction and soothing inspirational message as significant strengths.
"Now, I'm their $500 million baby," said Mrs. Madden, whose office is just steps away from the train station in Rye, N.Y., a Manhattan suburb.
Selecting Mrs. Madden was no simple task. Penney looked at some 20 candidates. The negotiations included five trips by Mrs. Madden to the company's Plano, Tex., headquarters, more than a dozen face-to-face meetings and more than 200 telephone calls. Mr. Chinni even met her two college-age sons. Her husband, Kevin Madden, a former Conde Nast publisher, serves as president of Madden Inc.
Mrs. Madden already boasts some retail success. She has branded some 200 products with various companies, ranging from a $2,500 hand-painted bookcase for Bassett Furniture to a $29.95 chenille throw for Mohawk. 
Even so, she differs markedly from Ms. Stewart. She touts a decorating theme based on the spiritual strengths of renewal and celebration, as well as simplicity.
Mrs. Madden emphasizes accessible, durable and maintenance-free products mixed with consumers' own curbside finds. "I love the perfection of imperfection," she said.
Her philosophy apparently resonates with some consumers. It has propelled her book, "A Room of Her Own: Women's Personal Spaces," into its 11th printing. Sales of her home furnishings line for Bassett, the company has said, have reached $100 million in less than two years. Her line of rugs, throws and pillows for Mohawk has sold about $10 million, according to Mrs. Madden.
Penney offers furniture, but it only has a small fraction of the total furniture market in the United States. It is much stronger in sales of curtains, bedding and towels. 
While Penney has high hopes for its new face, and while the one-person, one-brand formula personified by Ms. Stewart has frequently been cited in Harvard Business School case studies, its usefulness is now being questioned. "Investors today see having one human being represent one entire brand as a pronounced liability," said Laura Richardson, a retail analyst with Adams, Harkness & Hill in Boston.
Mr. Chinni believes there is no big risk for Penney in signing with Mrs. Madden. But banking on her helping the company race ahead of Kmart may be overly optimistic with the sputteringeconomy and high unemployment. For one thing, the price points of the two retail companies are far apart. A comforter at Penney's retails for up to $299 in contrast to $99 at Kmart.
Products aside, branding experts say a major portion of the success of Martha Stewart was due to her initial roll out of extensive editorial promotions in her magazine, Martha Stewart Living, long before the introduction of her home furnishings.
While Mr. Chinni said he has no plans for a magazine in collaboration with Mrs. Madden, she has had a magazine in the works for close to two years. Both the American Express Company and the Hearst Corporation have studied the mock-up of what she would like to be a bimonthly, Haven. Now, a group of private investors is looking at her magazine dummy, she said.

HEADLINE: Warming Trends 

 BODY:
Ever since George Bush renounced the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on global warming two years ago, the industrialized world has been waiting patiently for signs that Americans are ready to focus on the pressing issue of climate change. Lately some American politicians have begun to take the matter more seriously, even if Mr. Bush has not. 
 Last week Senators John McCain and Joseph Lieberman extracted a pledge from their colleagues to hold a floor vote later this year on a promising and, by Senate standards, adventurous proposal for mandatory controls on industrial emissions of carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas. Meanwhile, 10 Northeastern governors agreed to devise a regional strategy to reduce these same emissions, regardless of what Washington does. 
 Perhaps the era of policy paralysis on global warming is giving way to a period of serious debate and, perhaps, action. That is certainly our hope, although there is no cause for celebration yet. Mr. Bush remains in denial, stubbornly positioned at the rear of a parade he ought to be leading, begging for voluntary steps from industries that have no incentives to take them. When all else fails, he asks -- as he did two weeks ago -- for new research into issues that have long been settled. 
Congress is similarly unwilling to lead. On Thursday, in a desperate and almost vaudevillian effort to do something before the August recess, the Senate junked a dreadful energy bill it was working on in favor of another measure it approved last year. The replacement bill is only slightly less offensive, its useful provisions buried under an avalanche of subsidies for the traditional producers of the very fossil fuels that contribute most heavily to global warming: oil, gas and coal.
Sadder still is the fact that neither this bill nor a companion measure in the House offers anything in the way of imaginative ideas to slow the warming trend, limit our dependence on foreign oil and generally propel the country into a more enlightened energy future. The bills do not require meaningful increases in fuel economy standards for automobiles or S.U.V.'s. Nor do they put any serious money behind new technologies that could clean up the fuels we already have. Mr. Bush's Energy Department, for example, is engaged in an experimental effort to builda new generation of power plants that will continue to run on coal -- the world's cheapest, most abundant fuel -- but emit no global warming gases. Congress seems completely uninterested in giving this (or any other breakthrough idea) the money it needs.
The best that can be said of the Senate's pathetic effort is that it included the promised vote on the McCain-Lieberman bill. This bill, a modest and inexpensive version of the Kyoto framework, would require industry to stabilize and then reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It would also set up innovative market mechanisms to ease the costs of compliance. This is essentially the same model approved by the Northeastern governors, who hope to have a detailed plan in place in a year. 
McCain-Lieberman is not likely to pass, absent an unexpected conversion on the issue by Mr. Bush and senior Republicans. But every senator will now be required to take a stand one way or the other on an issue of great public concern, an issue on which the world has spoken clearly but Congress has remained irresponsibly silent for too long.

HEADLINE: Hispanics Back Big Government And Bush, Too 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JANET ELDER

 BODY:
Hispanics view the Democratic Party as better able than the Republican Party to manage the economy, create jobs and improve the nation's public school system, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll. But they admire President Bush and have embraced positions -- from supporting tax cuts to opposing abortion and some gay rights -- that have typically been identified with Republicans.
 The poll, an unusually extensive effort to measure the political and social attitudes of those who call themselves Hispanic, revealed a complex challenge facing both parties as they battle to command the support of a segment of the electorate that is on the verge of rivaling African-Americans in numbers. 
 Although the White House and the Democratic Party have approached Hispanics as if they were an ethnic group with common experiences that predictably inform voting behavior -- the poll suggests the extent to which Hispanics are less than monolithic in their background, culture and political beliefs.
In many ways, the Hispanic respondents questioned over the course of two weeks mirrored traditional Democratic ethnic constituencies. They were twice as likely to call themselves Democrats as Republicans, viewed the Democratic Party more favorably than the Republican Party and, by a margin of 49 percent to 21 percent, said the Democratic Party was more likely to care about the needs of Hispanics. 
A majority said they supported a bigger government providing more services, backed affirmative action and questioned whether the war in Iraq was worth the cost. By a 2-to-1 ratio, Hispanics said the Democratic Party was more likely to ensure a strong economy than Republicans, and 50 percent said Democrats were more likely to create jobs, compared with 20 percent who said the same about Republicans.
But the respondents identified with Republicans on a host of issues the party has emphasized over the past two years. They applauded tax cuts, calling them better economic policy than reducing deficits, and embraced the use of school vouchers. They were less likely than the population at large to support the legalization of homosexual relations between consenting adults. And 44 percent of Hispanics said abortion should not be legal, compared with 22 percent of non-Hispanics.
The Times/CBS News poll also found that among the general electorate, President Bush's job approval rating has dropped to 54 percent, a 13-point fall, since May, reflecting growing concerns about the economy and doubts about the war in Iraq. The last time Mr. Bush's job approval rating was at 54 percent was in February, before the war.
The poll was conducted by telephone from July 13 to 27, with 3,092 adults nationwide, 1,074 of whom described themselves as Hispanic. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for the entire poll and plus or minus four percentage points for Hispanics. Sample sizes for most Hispanic nationalities, like Cubans or Dominicans, were too small to break out the results separately.
The poll signaled that the competition to court Hispanic voters -- whom White House aides have identified as one of the critical groups of swing voters in next year's election -- is wide open, notwithstanding the efforts by each party in recent years to strengthen its support among these voters in anticipation of the 2004 contest.
That impression was underlined by follow-up interviews with some of the respondents.
"The Republicans are closer to my value system," said Abigail Hansen, 45, an independent voter from West Valley City, Utah, who was born in Uruguay. "The Democrats are pro abortion and pro homosexual marriage, and those are things my value system does not agree with."
But another independent voter, Shane Garcia, 31, a retail manager from Lincoln , Neb., whose family is from Mexico, said: "Since George W. Bush came into office, I have not seen things improve. Everything has gotten worse, including the economy, the budget, and the lack of jobs.
"I have a favorable view of the Democratic Party, because they do more to support the majority of Americans," Mr. Garcia continued. "They look out for the middle and working class."
Mr. Bush won the support of 35 percent of Hispanic voters in 2000; in this poll, 21 percent of Hispanics who say they are registered to vote said they would vote for his re-election.
Matthew Dowd, a pollster and senior adviser to Mr. Bush's re-election campaign, wrote a memorandum last year saying the president needed to win at least 40 percent of the support of Hispanic voters next year.
Still, Mr. Bush would appear to be in a fairly strong position with many of these voters; there are indications that his standing is stronger with Hispanics than his party's is.
Hispanics approved of Mr. Bush's job performance 52 to 38 percent, while 54 percent said that he "cares about the needs and problem of people like yourself." By contrast, just 40 percent of Hispanics said they had a favorable view of the Republican Party, while 60 percent said they had a favorable view of Democrats.
And one-third of Hispanics said they would be more likely to vote for a candidate for public office who spoke Spanish. Mr. Bush does, if perhaps not fluently. 
The political portrait of Hispanics provided by this poll, if in many ways ambiguous, would suggest opportunities for both parties. In short, Hispanics have at once an expansive view of government, which reflects what many of the Democratic presidential candidates are saying, while holding decidedly conservative views on social issues, which reflect the positions of Mr. Bush.
Significantly, respondents had a more benevolent view of government than the nation at large.
The poll found that 75 percent of Hispanics said they wanted a larger government providing more services, as opposed to the smaller one with a limited role that has been advanced by Mr. Bush. By contrast, 40 percent of the general sample said they preferred a larger government. And 46 percent of Hispanic respondents said they trusted the government in Washington to do what was right always or most of the time; 36 percent of the total sample offered the same view.
The view of an aggressive government came from people who tended to be much more anxious about the future of the economy than the nation at large. Among Hispanics, 72 percent said they feared that they or someone in their household would be out of work within the next year. Among respondents at large, just 46 percent expressed such concerns.
"Here where I live they have closed four warehouses and stores -- I see a major need for jobs," said Vickie Johnson, 27, a Californian of Mexican descent who is a Democrat.
Hispanics also reported lower household incomes: 47 percent reported incomes of under $30,000 a year, compared with 27 percent for non-Hispanics. 
There is also a sharp divergence of views on Iraq: 49 percent of Hispanics said removing Saddam Hussein from power was not worth the potential loss of American life and other costs of attacking Iraq, compared with 39 percent of all respondents.
On other issues, like abortion and gay rights, the responses clearly broke away from the Democratic model. Hispanics were evenly divided on the question of whether homosexual relations between consenting adults should be legal; among the general public, this position is supported by 54 percent to 39 percent.

How the Poll Was Conducted
This New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted from July 13 to July 27 with 3,092 adults throughout the United States. Of those, 1,074 identified themselves as of Hispanic origin or descent. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish.
The national Hispanic sample was drawn in three ways. First, based on all Times/CBS News polls since January 2001, every phone number that resulted in a self-identified Hispanic interview was called back for the new study. Second, every phone number that yielded a Spanish-speaking person from those same polls was also called back, even though in the original polls only English speakers were interviewed, as is standard practice among pollsters. Third, to supplement the sample, new phone numbers composed of random digits were called in exchanges around the country that contain 35 percent or more Hispanic residents, based on census data. 
Nationally, the non-Hispanic portion of the sample was composed of callbacks to phone numbers in all Times/CBS News polls since January 2001 where respondents had originally identified themselves as non-Hispanic.
The New York City samplewas constructed following comparable steps, based on local polls by The Times and CBS News in 2002 and 2003. An exception was that in the city non-Hispanic respondents resulted from random digit dialing rather than from callbacks.
The disproportionately large samples of Hispanic respondents were weighted down to their proper proportion of the population in the United States and New York City, respectively.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age, education and native versus foreign born.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than two or three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the margin of sampling error is larger: three points for non-Hispanic respondents nationally, four points for Hispanic respondents nationally, and five points for either non-Hispanic or Hispanic respondents in New York City.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in English versus Spanish wording of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

Chip Designer Bucks a Trend and Turns a Profit

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH

 BODY:
THE global slump in electronics continues to stretch out, but apparently no one has told the Standard Microsystems Corporation in Hauppauge. 
 Last month, Standard, a semiconductor company that designs specialized chips and components allowing computers to interact more efficiently, completed a fiscal first quarter that would have been impressive during the late-90's high-tech boom, let alone in the midst of the current inertia. The company's revenues rose 26 percent to $42.7 million, compared with $34 million for same quarter last year. Standard (Nasdaq: SMSC) paid a dividend of 11 cents a share, nearly three times what Wall Street had predicted. 
 Standard also did something few other high-tech companies are doing: it posted a profit for the quarter. The company's net income for the period ended June 16 was $1.7 million, up from $352,000 for the same quarter last year.
And the future looks bright. Steven J. Bilodeau, the company's chairman, president and chief executive, said he expected revenues would increase 15 percent for the second quarter, to about $45 million, compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2003. 
The announcement sweetened the somewhat sour memories of the most recent fiscal year, which ended Feb. 28. Standard posted a pretax loss of $13.4 million, reversing a profit of $10.7 the previous year. The net loss last year was $7.5 million. Mr. Bilodeau attributed the loss to the $16 million write-down on investments in SMC Networks of Irvine, Calif., and Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd. of Singapore. 
Mr. Bilodeau said that before the write-down, the company showed a profit of just over $1 million for the fiscal year.
The company's recent success "does seem counterintuitive," said Jon Peddie, who owns a high-tech market research company in Tiburon, Calif., that works for Standard occasionally.
"This company has managed, rather cleverly I think, to be in the right place at the right time," Mr. Peddie said. "They've gotten really smart about what they do. Maybe they're also just a little bit lucky."
Perhaps because Standard finished in the red last year, or perhaps because analysts have just gotten more cautious, Standard's first-quarter results seem to have caught some people by surprise, especially because Wall Street had predicted the company would pay 4 cents a share. 
"The upside in earnings during the quarter was largely due to a favorable product mix shift toward its embedded systems products, which represented roughly 35 percent of sales, up from 27 percent during the prior quarter," Blaine R. Carroll, an analyst at Adams Harkness & Hill, an investment bank in Boston, wrote in a report published June 16. The term "embedded systems" refers to chips customized to work in the operating systems of specific computer manufacturers.
While it is difficult to pinpoint a single reason for Standard's recent success, the company has been at the forefront of a movement that is restoring analog capability to silicon chips, giving them greater functionality without sacrificing their digital speed or efficiency.
Robert Brill, a venture capitalist in Plainview who is a director of Standard and who was an original investor 32 years ago, said that the company's current strength stems in part from its acquisition of a small company called Gain Technology just over a year ago. That acquisition, a $30 million deal, helped make Standard a leader in the digital-analog movement, or what is called mixed-signal technology.
"The transaction brought over a number of engineers with mixed-signal expertise," said Mr. Brill, a general managing partner in New Light Associates, which controls a venture-capital fund that made the primary investment in Standard in 1971. "That kind of engineer is hard to find. It's very hard to get analog talent."
"A few years ago," he continued, "Standard had virtually no analog capability. Now it is among the leaders" in designing mixed-signal chips, one of the fastest-growing segments of computing. Today, nearly 40 percent of the company's unit sales come from mixed-signal products. 
"We live in an analog world," Mr. Brill said. "When you are building chips for connectivity, you need both analog and digital. Until now, that's been very difficult to do."
Customers for Standard's customized chips include I.B.M., Dell and Sony, as well as chip giants like Intel and Motorola. Standard's chips, designed and manufactured in close consultation with each client, allow the computers that ultimately house them to connect more efficiently with other computers, everything from laptops to devices like automated teller machines and cash registers. 
One major product is Standard's flash drive storage device, which is about the size and weight of a ballpoint pen. It is capable of containing as much information as a personal computer did two or three years ago.
The device "allows you take most of the contents of your desktop computer, put it in your pocket, and then plug it into your laptop when you're on the road," said Mr. Bilodeau, Standard's chairman.
Known in industry jargon as a fabless manufacturer, Standard does not build the chips it designs but contracts production out to Chartered Semiconductor in Singapore and to another company in Taiwan. The chips are shipped back for testing in Hauppauge, where about 350 employees, mainly in quality-control and administrative roles, are based. The company's global work force totals about 500.
Because Standard has managed to avoid becoming a manufacturer and because its chips facilitate the computer-to-computer activity that is so important to today's users, Standard saw its sales on products used in desktop computing rise by about 17 percent, despite the fact that industrywide sales of PC's were flat.
The company is also positioned well to benefit from the expansion of the Ethernet, because a growing number of its products serve that market specifically. In general, Mr. Bilodeau said, the company is moving away from an emphasis on desktop computer products and more toward mobile computing and the Ethernet.
The company has also outpaced the rest of the industry in mobile computing products and for its connectivity products known as USB that allow computers to communicate with multiple devices at once.
Despite Standard's successful quarter, none of the four analysts who track the company upgraded their recommendations, citing the industry's overall slump and the company's vulnerability to diminished demand for computing products in general.
"In today's economic environment, it is tough for research analysts to justify upgrades of technology stocks to their highest level of recommendation," said Andrew M. Caggia, the company's chief financial officer. "However, two analysts maintained 'buy' recommendations."

HEADLINE: A Magazine's Radical Plan: Making a Profit 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR 

 BODY:
For most of his career, David Bradley, the owner of The Atlantic Monthly, helped businesses innovate around seemingly intractable problems. Before buying The Atlantic in 1999, he built a successful consulting firm, the Advisory Board, that eventually went public. But after switching from consulting to owning, he realized that he had never come across something as dysfunctional as the economics of publishing magazines.
 Despite significant circulation and advertising gains and a passel of journalism awards since he acquired the magazine from Mortimer Zuckerman, The Atlantic continues to lose millions of dollars a year. So Mr. Bradley, the consultant, advised Mr. Bradley, the magazine owner, to take several steps that are both radical and simple, at least in the publishing industry: charge readers more while shunning the cult of big circulation. 
 In 2004, The Atlantic Monthly will cut its rate base, the number of copies promised to advertisers, to 325,000 from 450,000 (the magazine's actual average circulation exceeded 500,000 last year). And readers will be asked to pay almost twice as much to subscribe -- about $30 instead of an average of about $16. The changes come after the magazine decreased its frequency to 10 times a year from 12, so the per-copy price is even higher. 
"In my 20 years of strategy consulting, I don't know that I came across a more complex proposition than magazine profitability, or at least, ours," Mr. Bradley writes in a letter that will be sent to advertisers today. "The Atlantic is hardly Enron, but neither is it (any time soon) my third I.P.O."
In the letter, Mr. Bradley writes that he will lower ad rates as the number of subscribers declines and suggests that the magazine will be delivering truly engaged readers, not junk subscriptions from third-party sources.
For years, particularly since the Internet bubble burst, the publishing industry has been promising to charge consumers more and has proceeded to do exactly the opposite. According to Capell's Circulation Report, a magazine industry newsletter, the average price of a standard subscription has dropped 17 percent in the five years ending in 2002. 
Common sense would suggest that during the biggest advertising downturn in more than a decade, publishers would ask consumers to pay a bigger share. But in 2002, the first year in which the Audit Bureau of Circulations has kept track of average annual subscription prices, the average price per copy rose one cent, according to Capell's June 2003 issue. Magazines like Harper's Bazaar, GQ and Vogue are charging less. 
There are exceptions. The Economist has increased its subscription price over the years and now charges an average of $102 a year for its customers in the United States. Its closest rival in the United States on price is Time Inc.'s People, which charges $99.04, up from $96.76 a year ago. But a lush, beautifully produced magazine like Vanity Fair can still be had for an average of $16.21, and much lower if a consumer shops around, particularly on the Internet.
"The magazine industry has trained the American public to undervalue its product," the president of The Atlantic Monthly, John Fox Sullivan, said. "We are raising prices in a way that to our knowledge has never been done, and there are many people who are telling us that we are moving too quickly and we will regret it. But we instinctively believe that there is a core of readers who will pay a good price for this magazine."
The Atlantic Monthly is working from a position of manifest strengths and profound weaknesses. In the last three years, its newsstand sales have increased 94 percent while the average subscription renewal price has risen 35 percent. Its advertising pages were up 31 percent in the last two, very punishing years, and it has won five national magazine awards in the last two years. 
But the reason Mr. Bradley and Mr. Sullivan are considering such a high-risk strategy is that the investment that drove those improvements has doubled losses at the magazine, to $8 million a year from $4 million, a company official said. 
"There has been a 50-year tradition at the magazine of older male businessmen like myself managing The Atlantic as a philanthropy," Mr. Bradley said. "It was largely subsidized and dependent on finding the next Mort Zuckerman. I think it's possible I may be the last member of that generation, and we have to find a way to make this wonderful magazine support itself."
Dan Capell of Capell's Circulation Report said that The Atlantic had the right idea, although he did not expect many other magazines to follow suit.
"With the current advertising climate, I keep thinking you are going to see more people raising their subscription prices," he said. But "I doubt that it will have much of an influence on other people because they are too worried about their ad revenues"
David Carey, the publisher of The New Yorker, said of The Atlantic's plan: "Historically, this is really a 'bet the franchise' move, and the people who have tried it before have lost. For better or worse, the modern-day publishing model is ad leveraged, not circulation leveraged, despite the efforts of some smart people to change that." Mr. Carey has successfully raised The New Yorker's subscription prices in recent years.
Despite advertisers' rhetoric that they prize the quality of circulation more than the quantity, the Hall of Fame for pioneers in circulation is small and littered with corpses. In the summer of 1995, D. Claeys Bahrenburg, then the chief executive of Hearst Magazines, announced that his company would lower the rate bases for 13 of its 15 magazines while raising advertising rates at the same time. Advertisers, none too pleased to be paying more for less, revolted, and Mr. Bahrenburg was out of a job before the end of that year. 
But some advertisers are beginning to ask tougher questions about the nature and quality of circulation. With the implosion of sweepstakes magazine marketing (like Publishers Clearing House and American Family Publishers), publishers have turned to third-party suppliers, who often increase circulation through high-pressure telemarketing or door-to-door sales. The resulting subscribers renew at very low rates and may cause advertisers to wonder how much the magazine was wanted in the first place.
"We spend a lot of time looking at the audit statement," said Linda Thomas Brooks, executive vice president and managing director at GM Mediaworks, a media buying firm for General Motors. "The term that we use is 'wantedness,' and I think The Atlantic's plan sounds like it will be a demonstration of that."
The Atlantic is not alone in its efforts. Jack Kliger, the chief executive of Hachette Filipacchi Media, has spoken about the need to charge the consumer more, and has acted on his beliefs. In February, for example, the company raised the basic subscription offer for Premiere, the movie magazine, to $12 a year from $10, while dropping the frequency to 10 times a year from monthly. The moves, which coincided with a rate-base cut to 500,000 from 600,000, effectively raised subscription rates by 45 percent.
"For an enthusiast magazine like Premiere, consumers are willing to pay more for quality editorial," said David J. Fishman, senior vice president and group publisher of Premiere. Mr. Fishman said that readers see value in the magazine's additional editorial pages and larger format.
According to the company, newsstand revenues -- the single copy price rose to $3.99 from $3.50 -- have increased 18.5 percent. Mr. Fishman said that renewals and for the magazine had increased as well.
Mr. Bradley holds The Economist out as a model, and he admires National Public Radio's ability to increase its listenership. He is experimenting with a membership concept that would try to pull more revenues out of readers, with news briefings, branded research and advice on topics like restaurants and wine. It is a difficult proposition, because The Economist offers analysis that many people need to compete, while The Atlantic has long narratives that are seen as good to know, but not essential.
How the advertising community will respond to The Atlantic's bold stroke will be revealed next year, when the lower rate base takes effect. "We don't need every 28-year-old ad buyer to think this is a wonderful idea," Mr. Bradley said. "We just need a certain number of people in the advertising community to see the reasonableness of what we are doing."

Accusations against MCI open a debate on long-distance access charges, a relic from Ma Bell days.

BYLINE:  By Barnaby J. Feder 

 BODY:
NOW that investigators are scrutinizing MCI over its reported tactics for avoiding paying network access fees to local telephone companies, some analysts and executives are suggesting that it is also time to look more closely at the access charges themselves.
 MCI is accused of disguising long-distance calls as local calls to avoid paying these charges to local phone companies. It is also accused of shunting calls destined for areas with high access costs to some small Canadian phone companies, which then passed them to MCI's biggest rival, AT&T, making it pay the access charges. 
 What is striking is that industry executives, including some at the companies accusing MCI of wrongdoing, generally agree that the rules the company is said to have abused can seem like relics of another era. 
MCI pays about $1 billion a month in access charges to other phone companies for its conventional long-distance calls. But such calls represent a declining share of the communications universe, as more and more people use cellphones, cable television networks or broadband computer connections to make long-distance voice calls, rather than the traditional telephone.
At the same time, millions of Americans have cut back on making voice calls in favor of e-mail and instant messaging. The newer forms of communication incur lower access charges, or none at all, for using the same switches in local phone company offices and wires into the home that the old-fashioned long-distance call uses.
"The access charge system is a tax on the old wayof doing things," said Joel Lubin, vice president for government affairs at AT&T. "It distorts the marketplace."
There is little agreement, though, on how or whether to update the rules. The Federal Communications Commission announced in 2001 that it would look at ways to update and rationalize access charges and the bewildering array of other regulated or partly regulated payments between communications companies. 
The agency envisioned an overarching system that would not unfairly subsidize, or penalize, a particular group of users or communications technology. But experts say they see little evidence of progress.
"My sense is that they've come to the view that it's just too complicated to try to fix it comprehensively," said Philip L. Verveer, a lawyer in Washington who specializes in antitrust and regulatory issues.
Once upon a time, the long-distance access charges made more sense. The heavily regulated monopoly known as Ma Bell was happy to go along with the public policy of forcing long-distance rates to subsidize the cost of local telephone service. It seemed a relatively simple way to tap businesses and wealthy customers -- the ones most likely to make long-distance calls -- in support of the goal of providing affordable phone service across the country.
The strategy helped pay the cost of wiring rural areas and putting a phone into virtually every home in the nation. It also provided the basis for negotiating payments to the hundreds of small local non-Bell companies for completing long-distance calls into their territory. The payments helped them survive and smoothed AT&T's relations with state regulators, who wielded considerable control over Ma Bell's take-home pay.
Within the Bell family and in relations with the smaller companies, managers rarely disputed anyone's reporting when it came time to account for long-distance traffic and apportion the payments. "When everyone had their own local monopoly, it was much easier to be a gentleman," said Leon Kestenbaum, a former deputy chief of the Common Carrier Bureau at the F.C.C., who later was vice president for regulatory affairs at Sprint, before retiring in 2001.
But that world began to change in the 1970's, as MCI helped lead the drive to deregulate the industry. It ended for good with the breakup of AT&T in 1984, when the F.C.C. first began applying the term "access charges" to the payments that long-distance companies like AT&T, MCI and Sprint made to the Bells and other local phone companies.
Modernizing the access charge system might be relatively straightforward if the F.C.C. were the only regulatory body involved. But state regulators control long-distance rates for intrastate calls, and phone companies must negotiate with them to set the terms under which local service is provided. Congress has also inserted itself by exempting from access charges any communications that travel in digital form over the Internet.
Because access charges are such a big component of long-distance costs, industry analysts and executives assume that efforts to find legal means of avoiding them, including the use of network management plans, may become a major activity at long-distance companies for some time to come. And MCI is not the only company accused of going too far.
Others, when they send traffic breakdowns to the regional Bell companies that complete their calls, have illegally exaggerated how much originated out of state. That reduces the intrastate access bill, which reflect rates set by state regulators and are on average nearly quadruple the interstate charges. Most such cases have been settled privately but they sometimes end up in court.
Who loses when long-distance companies dodge access charges, whether legally or illegally?
The obvious loser is the local phone company when it completes a long-distance call disguised as a local one. The local company also suffers if companies underreport the proportion of intrastate long-distance calls they send the local company.
In theory, local customers might also suffer in the long run. If the local phone company's financial condition deteriorates in part because of lost access charges, it might get permission from state regulators to raise rates. In reality, though, competition frequently curbs a company's appetite for seeking rate increases.
Some phone company executives say the real problem with hanging on to the old access charges is that they hold back the economy by distorting investment incentives.
"If you want a strong economic engine called telecom," Mr. Lubin said, "then you cannot have a set of rules born in a monopoly era."
Still, with no new rules on the horizon, the old ones might outlive their critics.

HEADLINE: Downtown's Architectural Promise 

 BODY:
Not that long ago, it looked as though the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site might be slipping into the mundane track of ordinary commercial construction. The selection of Daniel Libeskind's dramatic plan was all well and good, but the real question was whether the economic and political realities of Lower Manhattan would allow the design to survive in any recognizable form, and whether it would inspire other architects of equal renown. For a while, all the moving parts in the reconstruction of ground zero seemed to be going in different directions toward what might have been, at best, architectural and civic banality and, at worst, incoherence. That risk is still present, but it has been greatly reduced by a number of significant decisions, agreements and compromises over the past few weeks. 
 Perhaps the most important of these is the bold choice of Santiago Calatrava, the Spanish architect, to design a new PATH terminal on the site of the World Trade Center. Mr. Calatrava is a master of transportation architecture, and his selection provides just the kind of commitment to serious architecture that this page has often hoped for. His open, organic structures are startlingly beautiful, often evoking the kind of uplifting spirituality that this site will need. The fact that Mr. Calatrava was chosen by the Port Authority suggests that even the most matter-of-fact participants in rebuilding ground zero can see the wonder of its possibilities. 
 That good news comes hand in hand with an effort by the Port Authority to expand the redevelopment of ground zero onto adjacent private property, perhaps including the Deutsche Bank building, which must be taken down as a result of 9/11 damage. This offers an opportunity to shift some commercial space off the trade center site, and to make it easier to treat part of ground zero as sacred space. These sound like small increments in the overall plan for Lower Manhattan, but they offer signs of a planning flexibility -- and a meeting of many minds -- that bodes well. 
Any number of critical moments still await us, including the memorial design competition and the trial that will settle the question of how much insurance money is available for rebuilding. The political and economic machinery of redevelopment could hardly be more intricate than it is in Lower Manhattan, and it will take the goodwill of all concerned, as well as the vigilant supervision of Gov. George Pataki, to keep all the parts working together and moving forward. Even now, with the site dominated by building equipment and construction workers, thousands of visitors come each day to pay tribute, to imagine what happened on Sept. 11 and to think about what should replace that vast open pit. The possibilities are now more exciting than they have ever been.

HEADLINE: Clues Start Emerging About the Losses Since the 90's Boom 

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
If the boom of the late 1990's was the best thing to happen to New York City in recent memory and the recession that has followed has been among the worst, it seems logical to wonder, 30 months into the city's lingering economic downturn, how much of the gains of the 1990's have now been lost.
 It could take years to answer that question definitively, economists say, but some clues have begun to emerge. The losses have been big but not all-consuming. Some of the people hit hardest were among those who had benefited most from the boom. But others who have been hurt had gained relatively little. 
 Consider the job count, the simplest measure of gains and losses. The number of jobs in the city was 3.53 million in May, down from nearly 3.76 million at the peak of the boom. But the May figure is still a quarter million more than the job count in November 1992, during the previous recession, and similar to the count in mid-1998. 
The job losses have not been distributed evenly. Mark Levitan, a senior policy analyst with the Community Service Society, a nonprofit group that serves the poor, has found that women in New York City made larger percentage gains in job-holding in the 1990's than did men, and that women have suffered smaller percentage losses since.
By contrast, black men made the smallest gains in job-holding during the 1990's but have experienced the biggest percentage drop after 2000, Mr. Levitan found. By 2002, the rate at which black men in the city were working had dropped sharply, returning to where it stood in the mid-1990's.
Industries, too, have been unevenly affected. The hardest hit have included some of the highest paying, like the securities industry and computer systems design. Some fields that have been spared, like education and health services, are ones with much lower average pay.
"It took a very unusual expansion in the late 1990's to bring a lot of moderate- and low-income people back to where they were at the previous peak of the business cycle in the late 1980's," said James Parrott, chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute, a labor-oriented research group.
"The recession has eroded their wages and income," he said. "That means they're worse off than they were before the expansion started in the early to mid-1990's. But they are not as far back as they were at the end of the last recession."
One reason it is difficult to measure how much of the gains of the 1990's have been lost is that data are not yet available, economists say. While New York State reports job numbers and unemployment rates monthly, Internal Revenue Service data on income and wages tend to lag months and even years.
The most recent I.R.S. income data are preliminary national figures from 2001 personal income tax filings, said Tom Marks, an economist with the New York State comptroller's office. Preliminary data on wages in New York State from that year are not yet available.
Nor has anyone calculated the net effect of tax cuts and increases.
"I don't think anybody has run all the numbers to say how much has been taken back," said George Sweeting, deputy director of the Independent Budget Office in New York City. As for who has lost the most, he said, "Probably five years from now, people will figure some of that out."
But the numbers that are available offer some inklings.
Using federal and state employment data, Mr. Marks calculated the number of jobs added in the city between the previous recession and the peak of the boom at the end of 2000. After subtracting the number of jobs lost since January 2001, he concluded that 45.7 percent of the job gains in the city had been eroded, compared with 31.3 percent statewide and 10.2 percent nationally.
Looking at high- and low-wage industries in the state, he found that from 1992 to 2000 there had been a gain of 35,200 jobs for securities and commodities brokers, whose average salary in 2001 was $147,867. That jump was followed by a decline of 25,400 jobs from 2000 to 2002.
"We're still ahead, but not by much," Mr. Marks said.
Advertising is another relatively high-paying field in which recent job losses wiped out much of the gains made during the 1990's, Mr. Marks found. By contrast, the number of jobs in accommodation and food services grew by 78,200 from 1992 to 2000 and shrank by just 1,500 from 2000 to 2002. But the average annual wage in that industry in 2001 was just $13,674, his data show.
"There are a lot of high-income jobs that have been lost in the current recession," said Michael Brisson, chief analyst for the state comptroller's office. "You're adding jobs at the low end of the wage scale. At the high end of the wage scale, you're losing Wall Street, professional business services, accountants, lawyers. And you've lost a lot of computer people."
Mr. Levitan of the Community Service Society has been tracking the so-called employment-population ratio, the percentage of the working-age population that is employed. From 1992 to 2000, that job-holding rate for women rose by 8.1 percentage points, to 58.4 percent. The jump for Hispanic women, 14.5 points, was the biggest, followed by the increase for black women, a 9.1 point gain.
In the two years after that, the job-holding rate for women as a whole dropped by just 1.6 percentage points, Mr. Levitan found. It dropped by 2.9 points for Hispanic women, ending up at 48.9 percent, and by 1.1 point for black women, ending up at 57.8 percent. The rate for white women in 2002 barely moved, ending up at 63.5 percent.
The gains for men in the 1990's were smaller than for women. The percentage of men holding jobs dropped in the first half of the decade and rose in the second half, ending up at 72.9 percent, roughly where it had started, in 2000. Then it dropped by 5.1 percentage points by 2002.
Black men experienced small gains and the biggest losses; the percentage of black men who were employed rose by 3.5 points in the 1990's, then dropped by 6.1 points from 2000 to 2002, ending up at 58.1.
The percentage gains of white women and men were smaller than those of other groups, but so were their losses. Throughout the expansion and the recession, whites enjoyed the highest job-holding rates of any group -- 63.5 percent for women in 2002 and 73.6 percent for men.
"I would think that one reason why the increases for men were relatively modest was because there were more women looking for work," Mr. Levitan said. "When you look at the number of people coming into the city from abroad and the declines in welfare rolls and the number of people leaving the schools every year in the 1990's, we're talking about hundreds of thousands of job seekers. Well, we weren't creating hundreds of thousands of jobs."
Another measure of the magnitude of losses since 2000 is capital gains from the stock market, which accounted for a big chunk of the growth in personal income among more affluent New Yorkers in the 1990's. The plunge in capital gains in 2001 and 2002 is thought by some economists to have nearly equaled the increases of the previous five years.
An analysis of state data on capital gains done this year by the Fiscal Policy Institute shows that capital gains grew enormously during the second half of the 1990's and jumped by $15 billion in 2000 alone. Relying on state projections for 2001 and 2002, the analysis found that capital gains then dropped by $46 billion, almost equaling the total increase from the late 1990's.
"You still have almost $15 billion in capital gains in 2003," Mr. Parrott said, using the state's projection. "So, effectively, the 2003 level is back to the 1995 level."
Mr. Sweeting of the Independent Budget Office said he was unaware of anyone who had yet calculated the net effect of the tax cutting done by the city and state during the 1990's and the tax increases that have taken place since. "You can look at it impressionistically," he said. "The tax increases, at least to a certain extent, are offsetting tax reductions that occurred a few years ago. But they may be falling on different people. So the story gets kind of confusing in terms of what's being taken back from whom."
As for the recent increase in the city income tax rate for New York City's wealthiest residents, he said: "Higher income people had the largest gains in the 1990's in terms of income. But this increase in no way is equivalent to all the gains in income that the high end had."

HEADLINE: A Changed Climate in Turkey 

 BODY:
The votes by Turkey's Parliament last week to curb the political power of the military and increase freedom of expression are a significant step away from army domination of Turkish politics. The challenge now for the government, dominated by moderate Islamists of the Justice and Development Party, is to ensure that the new measures are carried out. Not long ago, Turkey's military would have responded to such initiatives by seizing power -- the armed forces removed four governments in the last four decades. That is less likely today because of broad support in Turkey for democratic rule, but these reforms present a test of just how much the climate has changed. The military should step back and let the nation continue unhindered along the path to a fuller democracy and the coveted prize of European Union membership. 
 The votes took aim at the core of the military's political influence, the National Security Council, which is composed of military leaders and senior politicians. The council's executive powers will be abolished, reducing it to an advisory role, and its secretary general, whose power in the past has rivaled that of the prime minister, need no longer be a four-star general. The secret military budget will now be exposed to parliamentary review. Some legislation restricting freedom of expression and assembly will be repealed. The Parliament also agreed to offer an amnesty to some members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, or P.K.K. The amnesty builds on a reform package passed in June. 
 The reforms are intended to prove that Turkey is ready to begin negotiations on joining the E.U. The talks will start at the end of next year if Turkey makes the grade. Despite overwhelming public support for E.U. entry, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his party will still need courage to put the new measures into effect in the face of the entrenched interests of the military and other conservative forces in Turkish society. 
For taking such a bold step Mr. Erdogan deserves all the support he can get from Europe, which stands to benefit from the partnership of a truly democratic Turkey. The United States should put aside any lingering spite over Turkey's refusal to accept American forces during the Iraq war, and back Mr. Erdogan's efforts. Washington, facing an uphill struggle in Iraq, has much to gain from showing that it trusts moderate Islamists with the task of embracing democratic reforms.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Big and Fancy, More Pickups Displace Cars" (front page, July 31): Many of my students at the Rochester Institute of Technology have chosen big pickups as personal transportation. 
In spite of the social and environmental devastation these vehicles wreak, there is a bright side. 
 Now that engineering, technical and managerial jobs are being globalized (sent to India and other low-wage countries), these huge vehicles will make it easier for all the unemployed college graduates to get into alternative careers like lawn maintenance and light hauling.

Like a Cloud, Economic Woes Follow Bus Tour

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex. 

 BODY:
President Bush slipped speedily into vacation mode this past weekend at his furnace of a ranch in Central Texas, where he spent Sunday fishing, clearing cedar and going for a walk with the first lady and his national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice. But before the president ducked out of public sight, he made sure to address one of the biggest re-election anxieties of Karl Rove, his chief political adviser: the nation's continuing loss of jobs and the uncertainty about the economy.
 "This week, three members of my cabinet -- Treasury Secretary John Snow, Commerce Secretary Don Evans and Labor Secretary Elaine Chao -- visited business owners and their workers in the Midwest," Mr. Bush said in his weekly radio address on Saturday. "They received reports that the economy is picking up." 
 Well, yes and no.
Anyoneon the trip, which was a very un-Air Force One-like, two-day, six-city bus journey across Wisconsin and Minnesota (Ms. Chao dined on Tuesday night at Burger King), could see that the cabinet members charged with promoting the president's tax cuts also heard a lot of anger from workers about foreign competition and laid-off relatives and friends.
"Right now I am very disillusioned with the Republicans' policies," said Michael Retzer, a Republican and a consultant to a supplier for Harley-Davidson. Mr. Retzer told Mr. Snow at a Harley plant near Milwaukee that he did not see how the tax cuts would stimulate the economy when so many consumers would spend the extra money on goods made overseas.
Later, in the kind of confrontation with a disgruntled citizen almost never seen on the president's trips, Mr. Snow tangled with an unemployed software programmer at the drive-through at Culver's Frozen Custard and ButterBurgers in Wausau, Wis.
"He said, 'But your tax cuts haven't done anything for me,' " Mr. Snow recounted the next day to reporters, as the bus traveled through Minnesota. "And I said, 'Well, now, let's just take a second and talk about that.' "
Here in McLennan County, Tex. -- which includes the nearby city of Waco, the one-stoplight town of Crawford and the president's 1,600-acre ranch -- the number of people unable to find work jumped to more than 6,000 in June 2003 from more than 4,000 in June 2000, according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"That's pretty much a general slowdown that mirrors the rest of the country," said Cheryl Abbot, an economist at the agency's Southwest Regional Office in Dallas.
Although the McLennan County unemployment rate jumped from 4 percent in June 2000 to 5.7 percent in June 2003, it was still lower than the national unemployment rate in June of 6.4 percent. But the jobless rate for Texas that month was 7.5 percent, and more than 800,000 people in the state could not find work, up from 527,000 people in June 2000.
An unscientific series of interviews with Crawford businesspeople and churchgoers Sunday revealed plenty of support for Mr. Bush, whose presidency has brought a surge of tourists to the once-shuttered main street but uneasiness about the economy and nervousness about his policies.
"You look at the tax breaks he's cut for everybody and I wonder how he's able to do that," said John Dutschmann, 32, a sales manager for a concrete products company who had just attended services at Crawford's First Baptist Church. Mr. Dutschmann, a Democrat who supported Mr. Bush in 2000, said he was still behind the president, although he had trepidations about the economy. "We just put our trust in him, and we hope he knows what he's doing," he said.
Paul Stripling, 67, a Republican and executive director emeritus of the Waco Baptist Association, who had also attended services at the First Baptist Church, said that Waco had not felt the economic crunch as much as other parts of Texas and that Mr. Bush "is doing the best he can with a very precarious situation."
Brent Duncan, 40, a hotel owner who was talking with other parishioners after services at Crawford's United Methodist Church, said that his business was doing well -- he is building a hotel in the nearby town of McGregor -- and that he would probably vote for Mr. Bush in 2004. But Mr. Duncan, who described himself as a conservative Democrat, said that his support was not guaranteed. 
"Let's see who the Democrats put out," he said. 
Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Mr. Bush has little on his public schedule this week, although Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld is to make an appearance Friday.
But next week, as part of a monthlong campaign to try to convince voters that sunnier economic days are just around the corner, Mr. Bush will meet at the ranch with his economic team, then take his economic message around the country in day trips from Crawford. His tone will be upbeat, which was evidently the tenor of the report he heard from his cabinet secretaries after the Midwest bus trip last week.
As Mr. Snow put it, "I'm going to go back and tell the president, 'Mr. President, I ran into a lot of people who asked me personally to express my gratitude to you for worrying and thinking about us.' "
Mr. Snow did not say if he would mention the man in the drive-through at Culver's.

HEADLINE: Anger at Bush Smolders on Democratic Turf 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: DES MOINES, July 31 

 BODY:
While Democratic leaders in Washington debate strategy and demographics for the 2004 election -- the wisdom of campaigning from the left, right or center -- something far more visceral is at work in the first caucus state, and in other Democratic redoubts.
 There is a powerful disdain for the Bush administration, stoked by the aftermath of the war in Iraq and the continuing lag in the economy. There is also a conviction that President Bush is eminently beatable and a hunger to hear their party's leaders and candidates make the case against him -- straight up, from the heart rather than the polling data. 
 It is not simply a lurch to the left, many Democrats say; it could, in fact, lead caucus voters to more centrist candidates, if they seem most likely to defeat Mr. Bush in the general election. 
Tom Rusk, a state welfare worker who turned out this week to see Senator John Kerry in Fort Dodge, Iowa, describes himself as "pretty liberal." He says he likes what he hears from former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont and from Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, but he worries that both candidates could be "Dukakisized" in the general election.
What Mr. Rusk is looking for, he said, alluding to the infamous image that doomed that past Democratic nominee, is "someone who will look impressive enough at the helm of an M-1 tank."
Gordon Fischer, chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, said this week that he saw "an incredible amount of antipathy toward the Bush administration" in the party, much more than the Democratic hostility toward the first President Bush.
Geoff Garin, a pollster who is working for Senator Bob Graham of Florida, who is seeking the Democratic nomination, said the Democratic anger toward Mr. Bush was "as strong as anything I've experienced in 25 years now of polling," and perhaps comes closest to the way many Democrats felt about President Richard M. Nixon.
Some compare it to the hostility conservatives long harbored toward President Bill Clinton. For the past two and a half years, after all, a fairly consistent 38 percent of respondents in The New York Times/CBS News Poll have said that Mr. Bush was not legitimately elected president.
But Mr. Fischer and others say this animosity is not entirely personal, more about the agenda than the man.
Stan Greenberg, a longtime Democratic pollster, argues, "It's more about how conservative this administration is, how it's taken the country in this direction without a mandate, and a frustration with Democratic leaders for not articulating it."
That frustration was apparent during the war with Iraq, and obviously helped fuel the rise of Dr. Dean, one of the few national Democrats speaking flatly and without apology against the war. But the anger is broader now, on issues of civil liberties, health care, Social Security and domestic security, and the candidates are increasingly responding to it, Democratic strategists say.
One way to measure it is by what generates applause on the campaign trail these days. On a recent steamy night in Fort Dodge, more than 100 Democrats crowded a local state representative's home to cheer on Mr. Kerry of Massachusetts, who made a scathing case against the Bush record.
They burst into applause when Mr. Kerry described Mr. Bush's tax cuts and soaring deficits as "stealing from America's children to give a tax cut to the wealthiest people in America." They grimly nodded when he denounced the quality of intelligence used to justify the war against Iraq. They burst into applause again when he described Mr. Bush's management of the economy as "the worst record on jobs since the Great Depression," and added that the only jobs Mr. Bush had created were the nine candidacies for the Democratic presidential nomination.
It was the reddest of meat for this issue-oriented crowd, and Iowa Democrats came back for more in their questions. Can Mr. Kerry take a punch, and "give as good as he gets?" one Democrat asked. Mr. Kerry replied, "I'm in a fighting mood," a theme he referred to again and again.
Lois Dencklau, retired from the accounting business, watched Mr. Kerry with an appraising eye. She, too, said she was looking "for someone who can beat Bush" and thought Mr. Kerry was that person. She had her own indictment of the Bush administration, and a conviction that the country was moving her way.
"People are going to wake up and see what's happening," she said. "People are losing their jobs, the economy's really bad."
The next day, at the union hall of the Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 33, another crowd turned out to hear Dr. Dean take on the Bush administration. Sandy Opstvedt, an electrical worker and president of the Iowa State Conference of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was in the audience. She said of Mr. Bush: "I've never felt comfortable with him. He almost seems to have a mission to attack working people."
When Dr. Dean entered the room, sleeves rolled up, looking as if he was ready to fight, he was greeted like a rock star. "It's time we stood up to this president and stopped being intimidated by the Rush Limbaughs on the radio," he said. "We can do better than that."
His speech was laced with scorn for "too many people in Washington" who are "too afraid to lose" to stand up for Democratic values. By the time Dr. Dean closed with his trademark line -- "You have the power to take this country back" -- Don Chamberlain, a retired steamfitter, seemed well satisfied. "It's time somebody stood up for the Democrats," Mr. Chamberlain said.
When asked if Mr. Bush could be beaten, Mr. Chamberlain replied with the edge of moral clarity, "Absolutely."
There was no abstract battle for the soul of the Democratic Party here, just an abiding anger at what Mr. Bush has done, and a conviction that a majority of Americans will eventually share it.
Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said, "It's George Bush who will serve as the biggest unifying force for our party."

HEADLINE: An Overcrowded Vision 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Trade Center Arguments Fade, and a Single Vision Is Emerging" (front page, Aug. 1): 
 Although I am sure that the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation planners can sleep better at night knowing that a "single vision" for the World Trade Center site is emerging, as one who lost my fiance in the terrorist attack, I cannot. 
To insist on crowding the site with 10 million square feet of office space, almost a million square feet of retail space, half a million square feet of hotel space and a transportation hub is to declare to the world that while we say, "We will never forget," we mean, "We will never forget, unless it's more profitable." 
I understand that the revitalization of downtown Manhattan demands that we replace a certain amount of office and retail space. But I fear for the families who will have loved ones in the 1,776-foot tower.

HEADLINE: Korean Steel Maker Finds Strength in Flexibility 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: POHANG, South Korea 

 BODY:
With a metallic roar, a new strip of orange steel heated to 1,200 degrees shot angrily through a hot rolling mill, a cavernous shed that stretched farther than the eye could see.
 "Every 110 seconds, we can produce a 25-ton coil of steel," Min Kyung Zoon, the superintendent of the mill, shouted during a recent tour. As a wall of heat rose to hit visitors on a catwalk, he added: "We can produce 640 tons of stainless steel an hour -- that's better than Europe, better than Japan." 
 Down below, the heavily automated line ran around the clock in an inferno of gyrating temperatures, but only a handful of workers tended the building, a hall the size of several football fields. 
While American steel producers struggle to cut losses, Posco, one of the world's most profitable steel makers, is a model of efficiency. Ships carrying iron ore from Australia dock at one end of the horseshoe-shaped mill. At the other end, different ships, often built with Posco steel, load finished steel. China, the world's biggest consumer and biggest importer of steel, is one day away by ship from these docks.
It is this kind of efficiency that has made South Korea, sandwiched between the industrial giants of China and Japan, the world's biggest per capita steel producer -- almost one ton for each of South Korea's 48 million people. About 60 percent of that steel comes from Posco, as the Pohang Iron and Steel Company is known, the world's third-largest steel maker, after Europe's Arcelor and Japan's Nippon Steel Company.
Elsewhere, in Europe and the United States, steel production is often synonymous with expensive union labor, looming pension costs, government subsidies and tariff barriers.
In contrast, Posco, a nonunion company that has not had a strike in its 30 years of steel production, saw its net profits hit $850 million in the first half of this year, nearly triple the level of the same period last year. Less than three years after Posco's privatization was completed, it is the darling of private investors, with foreigners owning 64 percent of shares in a company with a market capitalization of $10.7 billion.
This year, World Steel Dynamics, a steel information service, studied the world's 17 largest steel makers. It ranked Posco as the most competitive.
"No one doubts the competitiveness of Posco," Hwang Tae Hyun, Posco's vice president for finance, said in an interview at the company's steel-trimmed headquarters in Seoul. "Even two years ago, when steel prices were at 25-year lows, and investors elsewhere got burned, Posco had double-digit profits. Posco is one of the most transparent companies in Korea today."
Posco has to be agile because it operates in a virtually wide open market, one with essentially no import barriers. In contrast, the United States imposed steel tariffs of up to 30 percent in March 2002.
With a far more open market, South Korea was a net importer of steel products this year, importing a net $83 million. South Korea's net exports of $1 billion in steel to China were canceled out by its net imports of $1.5 billion in steel from Japan.
In June, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan promised to start talks at an early date with South Korea on a free-trade pact, a move that could increase Korean steel exports to Japan. But Posco is not holding its breath. Instead, this steel mastodon has learned to dance.
After investing heavily in computerization and better customer service, Posco has over the last two years cut average inventories of finished steel by two-thirds, to 360,000 tons; has cut in half delivery lead time to 14 days; and has sharpened on-time deliveries to 97 percent.
The big jump in profits comes largely from China's rapid growth, which this nation generally embraces as a challenge, rather than a threat.
Posco's average sales price is up 18.7 percent from a year earlier, while sales volume is up only 3.7 percent, to 13.8 million tons. 
China is the world's largest steel producer, making 100 million tons last year. But a shortfall between supply and demand has nearly doubled prices in two years, pushing them to levels not seen in nearly a decade.
Steel prices have been maintained by the huge growth in China's demand for steel, said Mr. Hwang, predicting that Posco's strong numbers would be maintained through this year.
Rolled steel from plants like these is used to make cars in China, which is expanding car production by 60 percent a year. 
By crossing the Yellow Sea, Posco is joining a flotilla that has made South Korea the sixth-largest foreign investor in China.
"At present, we have 14 strategic joint ventures in China and $780 million invested in China," Cho Soung Sik, Posco's vice president for strategic planning, said in Seoul. "A decade ago, our investment in China was zero."
Despite the importance of China as a market, about three quarters of Posco's steel is sold domestically. In the first half of this year, South Korea suffered its first recession in five years, with the economy contracting slightly.
But industrial output in June was up 7.8 percent over the same period a year ago, and economists are forecasting that a rebound will bring growth to 3 percent for the year, about half of last year's rate.
During the first six months, South Korean shipyards received orders for 233 ships, or $10.6 billion worth, slightly more than the 230 orders recorded all of last year.
The South Korean economy, however, is sluggish, Andy Xie, Morgan Stanley's Asia economist, wrote recently. Noting that South Korea's exports to China jumped by nearly a quarter in the first six months, he added: "The only growth engine is exports to China."
Despite this sunny season for steel, three clouds float on the horizon, and are problems that may also apply to South Korea's economy as a whole: the possibility of conflict with North Korea; the rise of China as a low-cost labor competitor; and the migration of steel-intensive industries out of South Korea because of rising wages.
Few South Koreans seem to think there will be an armed conflict with the North. 
Indeed, if North Korea's Communist government collapses one day, there will be a massive demand for steel for railroads, construction and vehicles to make up for half a century of foregone development.
But if China, with its lower wages, sharply expands its steel production, South Korea will have to fight harder for export markets.
"There is a high possibility that the home appliance factories will move, in which case we have to increase steel exports to those countries," said Ryoo Kyeong Ryul, Posco's executive vice president for process innovation. 
"Last year, I visited South Korean factories in Vietnam," he said. "I saw young people working very hard."
Another possibility would be for South Korea's steel-consuming industries to migrate to North Korea, which has low wages. Ground was broken six weeks ago on a South Korean-run industrial park just north of the demilitarized zone.

HEADLINE: Factory Index Rise of 1.7% Stirs Optimism 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4 

 BODY:
Demand for manufactured goods rose at the sharpest rate in three months in June, the government said today in a report that offered the latest sign that the struggling industrial sector is on the mend.
 Factory orders rose 1.7 percent in June, to a seasonally adjusted $326 billion, after increasing just 0.3 percent a month earlier, the Commerce Department said. It was the biggest gain since March and beat expectations of a 1.5 percent increase. 
 Orders for costly durable goods -- items intended to last three years or more -- rose 2.6 percent, their biggest increase since last July and an upward revision from the 2.1 percent gain reported a little more than a week ago. Demand for other goods rose a much more modest 0.7 percent.
The June increase in factory orders is among a number of recent signs that activity is stirring in the long-suffering manufacturing sector. The Institute for Supply Management said on Friday that its manufacturing index pushed up to 51.8 in July from 49.8 in June.
"Manufacturing has hit the bottom and is in the process of rebounding," said Sung Won Sohn, the chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in Minneapolis.
While aircraft and autos contributed importantly to the solid gain in demand for durable goods in June, orders were up 1.2 percent, even excluding transportation goods.
Capital goods orders rose 4.8 percent in June -- an upward revision from the originally reported 3.5 percent increase.
In addition, orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft, which economists view as a proxy for business investment, gained 1.7 percent, an improvement over the 0.6 percent rise reported previously.
Manufacturing inventories fell for a fourth month in June. The inventory-to-shipments ratio, a measure of how long it would take to deplete stocks at the current sales pace, slipped to 1.33 months in June from 1.34 in May.
The Commerce Department issued a rare correction today to its published economic data, saying construction spending rose 0.3 percent in June instead of the previously reported flat reading.
"A processing error was discovered that affected the June 2003 new single-family home estimates," the department said in a note atop the revised figures. "The estimates have been corrected. The error affects data for April, May and June because current-month estimates affect estimates for prior months." 
The department said June construction outlays were about $8.17 billion higher than in the data published Friday, at a seasonally adjusted $872.48 billion annual rate. May outlays were also revised to a 0.2 percent decline in construction spending, instead of the 0.5 percent drop previously reported.
Wall Street analysts had been mildly disappointed by the original report, having projected a 0.3 percent gain. The revisions could lift second-quarter estimates of growth, which had already come in stronger than anticipated, at a 2.4 percent annual rate.

PERSON: Peter Schwed 

HEADLINE: Peter Schwed, 92, an Executive At Simon & Schuster and Author 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Peter Schwed, a former editorial chairman and trade books publisher at Simon & Schuster and an author in his own right, died last Thursday at Beth Israel North Hospital in Manhattan. He was 92 and lived in Manhattan.
 Mr. Schwed began his career at Simon & Schuster in 1945 as an editor. He was named executive editor and a vice president in 1957, was the publisher of the trade books division from 1966 to 1972 and retired as chairman emeritus of the editorial board in 1984. 
 Known as a working editor, he shepherded books to publication for well-known authors, some of whom became friends. He dealt with P. G. Wodehouse and Irving Wallace, David McCullough and Cornelius Ryan.
An avid tennis player, he also earned a reputation as an editor of books by well-known sports figures and their ghost writers. Among them were Jack Nicklaus, Rod Laver, Bill Tilden, Chris Evert, Bjorn Borg, Roger Angell and Ted Williams.
He wrote or contributed to more than a dozen books, and was co-author, for example, of the autobiography of Nancy Lopez, "The Education of a Woman Golfer" (Simon & Schuster, 1979).
He was a frequent contributor to sports publications, especially those devoted to tennis, and his book "How to Talk Tennis" (Galahad, 1996) remains in print.
Peter Schwed, a native New Yorker, graduated from the Lawrenceville School. He left Princeton as a junior to go to work at a bank and help support his family through the Depression. 
In World War II he served in the Army and saw combat in Europe, earning a Bronze Star. He was discharged as a captain in 1945, when he began his career at Simon & Schuster.
Mr. Schwed is survived by his wife of 56 years, Antonia Holding Schwed; two daughters, Katharine H. Wood of Princeton and Laura S. Schwed of Manhattan; two sons, P. Gregory and Roger E., both of Manhattan; and six grandchildren.
After dropping out of Princeton, Mr. Schwed worked for 10 years at the Provident Loan Society of New York, rising to assistant vice president. The company, which makes loans on jewelry and other values, was established in 1894 by wealthy New Yorkers to help those hurt by the financial panic of 1892.
Mr. Schwed told of that chapter in his life in a critically well received book, bursting with anecdotes of old New York, "God Bless Pawnbrokers" (Dodd, Mead, 1975).

HEADLINE: MetLife Profit Rose 58% in 2nd Quarter 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
MetLife Inc. reported a 58 percent increase in second-quarter profit yesterday with help from narrower investment losses.
 The company reported net income of $611 million, or 84 cents a share, compared with $387 million, or 53 cents a share in the quarter last year. 
 Net income included after-tax net investment losses of $40 million, compared with after-tax net investment losses of $117 million in the second quarter of 2002.
Operating earnings came to $651 million, or 89 cents a share, compared with $504 million, or 69 cents a share, during the period last year. MetLife, the New York-based provider of financial services and insurance services, beat the expectations of analysts for 70 cents a share.
Total revenue rose to $8.9 billion from $8.2 billion.
"In a still uncertain economy, earnings improved this quarter, assets under management grew, investment losses declined and underwriting results were favorable," said Robert H. Benmosche, chairman of the board and chief executive.
MetLife shares rose 1 cent, to $27.36, before the company reported its results. They gained 64 cents in extended trading.
Earnings for the second quarter were also lifted by a $64 million after-tax benefit from a reduction of a previous settlement of a racial discrimination lawsuit.
Total premiums and fees for the quarter rose 9 percent, to $5.69 billion from a year earlier. Total assets under management increased 16 percent, to $331.8 billion, compared with $286.9 billion a year ago.

HEADLINE: Profit Climbs 68% at Principal Financial 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Principal Financial Group Inc., the biggest seller of 401(k) retirement plans in the United States, said yesterday that second-quarter profit rose 68 percent as pension deposits increased and the company sold more mortgages.
 Net income climbed to $202.2 million, or 62 cents a share, from $120.2 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said in a statement. 
Profit excluding investment gains and losses was $217.9 million, or 67 cents a share, compared with the 61-cent average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson First Financial. 
 The chief executive, J. Barry Griswell, focused on employers with fewer than 1,000 workers to help make his company less vulnerable to the job cuts that have hit Fortune 500 companies the hardest. The company has also benefited as the lowest mortgage rates in four decades spurred homeowners to refinance their home loans.
Shares of Principal rose 12 cents, to $32.60, on the New York Stock Exchange before the earnings were released.

HEADLINE: North Korea Moves to Win Some Friends Before Nuclear Talks 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 4 

 BODY:
The tinny loudspeakers fell silent along the 148-mile demilitarized zone this past weekend as North Korea shut down a cross-border propaganda barrage by radio and megaphone that it started in 1970. 
 Seeking to make friends and influence countries before six-party talks over its nuclear bomb program, North Korea is easing tensions with the South, making clumsy overtures to Japan and even trying to temper its trademark anti-American vitriol. 
 "Ultimately the North Korean game is to split South Korea and other countries away from the United States," Marcus Noland, a Korea expert at the Institute for International Economics, said from Washington. "Ultimately the North Koreans want their charm campaign to soften up South Korea and other countries and make them less likely to back the United States in any kind of coercive diplomacy." 
North Korea still engages in a nasty tit-for-tat with the United States but even so tries to limit the damage.
On Sunday, a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman called a top Bush administration official a "scum and human bloodsucker." But in the next breath, the diplomat emphasized in an interview with North Korea's news agency that there was "no change" in North Korea's intent to join the nuclear talks with the United States, which are expected to be held in Beijing early next month. 
North Korea was responding to a speech delivered here on Thursday by John R. Bolton, an under secretary of state, in which he lambasted the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, by name 41 times.
"While he lives like royalty in Pyongyang, he keeps hundreds of thousands of his people locked in prison camps with millions more mired in abject poverty, scrounging the ground for food," Mr. Bolton said. 
In response, the North Korean spokesman said, "On the basis of a serious analysis of Bolton's outcries, in the light of his political vulgarity and psychopathological condition, as they are quite different from the recent remarks of the U.S. president, we have decided not to consider him as an official of the U.S. administration any longer nor to deal with him." 
Today in Texas, the White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said Mr. Bolton was "speaking for the administration," and added, "His remarks last week reiterated things that we have said in the past." 
The North Koreans plan a kind of Ping-Pong diplomacy for the American public later this month when North Korea's top gymnasts fly to Anaheim, Calif., to compete in a qualifying championship for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. 
Turning to Japanese public opinion, North Korea is focusing on the 10-month drama of seven children who have been unable to follow their parents to Japan. The parents are Japanese who were kidnapped by North Korea many years ago and then finally allowed to return to Japan. On Sunday, the parents received the first letters and photos from their children in North Korea.
While the parents were happy to see photographs of the children, they said they doubted the spontaneity of the letters, which contained appeals to return to live in North Korea.
"I got the impression she was told by the North Koreans to write this way," Kaoru Hasuike said Sunday of the letter from his 21-year-old daughter. Hitomi Soga told reporters that the smile on the face of her 20-year-old daughter looked forced.
Yomiuri Shimbun, a conservative Japanese newspaper, said today, "North Korea is trying to break the nation's will by taking advantage of the returned abductees' natural affection for their children."
The North Koreans may have better success easing tensions with South Korea.
In the last six weeks, North and South Korea formally relinked their cross-border railroads, and a South Korean company inaugurated what could be a $5 billion industrial park in an area of North Korea about 40 miles north of here. The two countries closed the ceremonies to foreign reporters, fearing that publicity over those steps toward inter-Korean integration would irritate the United States in a time of nuclear tension.
"Ultimately this comes down to a fight for the hearts and minds of Seoul," Mr. Noland said of the charm offensive before the six-party talks. "If the U.S. is not firmly, actively and enthusiastically supported by South Korea, it cannot do any coercive diplomacy toward the North, economically, militarily or whatever."

HEADLINE: Nascar's Swinging Voters 

 BODY:
If you've got to have a gimmick in politics, Senator Bob Graham may have found the next big thing. Mr. Graham, one of a slew of Democrats running for president this year, has spent as much as $500,000 to help underwrite a souped-up Jack Roush pickup truck that has been screaming around some of Nascar's racetracks. 
After the Bob Graham Ford won a race in Kansas City, his campaign got thousands of dollars in free publicity as TV cameras followed the machine for a full victory lap.
 Politicians nowadays are setting their sights on "Nascar dads," as opposed to the oh-so-yesterday "soccer moms." Political consultants have no end of ways to slice and dice the always desirable uncommitted voter. Last time, she was a waitress. This year, he's rooting for Jeff Gordon. 
 While the emergence of the "Nascar dad" might suggest that women have given up their position as queens of the gender gap, in fact the enormous Nascar audience itself has grown more female in recent years, as well as more middle class and less rural. The fans have a reputation for being fiercely independent, and there is nothing presidential candidates yearn for more fiercely than genuinely independent American voters -- ready to swing one way or the other at the drop of an argument, or perhaps a well-timed political pitch. Democrats are speculating that stock car aficionados are the very people whose jobs are in jeopardy in the sluggish Bush economy and whose families have been placed at risk by the administration's military pursuits overseas.
So far, Mr. Graham has been working the Nascar crowd harder than other politicians. Right now, he's doing better at the speedway than in the polls.

Buyout Firms Pull Millions in Cash From Holdings

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
Investors in leveraged buyout firms are taking tens of millions of dollars in profits from companies they own.
 The buyout firms are receiving cash through special dividends, mostly financed by junk bonds and loans. This profit-taking could ultimately help the firms raise new capital and make new acquisitions. 
 "There's a window of opportunity for the buyout firms," said Mark Gold, who manages $4 billion in bank loan portfolios in New York for the Trust Company of the West. 
Junk bonds and loans to highly leveraged companies are popular with investors now because they tend to have higher yields than other forms of corporate debt. That makes these securities appealing, despite their higher risk, at a time when interest rates are low. Investors have poured a record $22 billion into junk bond funds this year through July, according to AMG Data. 
Typically, buyout firms look to sell companies they acquire after a few years of ownership. That has been difficult in recent years: the stock market slump has caused mergers and acquisitions to dry up and has hurt demand for new stock offerings.
"The traditional exits have not been as readily available," said Alan K. Jones, a managing director at Morgan Stanley.
Among the companies that have paid one-time dividends to investors in recent weeks are the Regal Entertainment Group and Domino's, the pizza company. Buyout firms reaped around $2 billion in such payouts in the first seven months of this year, nearly four times what they raised in the same period last year, said Standard & Poor's LCD, which tracks bank loans.
A handful of others are raising money by selling stock in their companies, as the market for initial public offerings shows signs of revival.
Only a few months ago, people would have been reluctant to buy junk bonds or make loans that were used to pay special dividends, said Christopher Donnelly, a director with S.& P. LCD.
"Dividend financings were really frowned upon," he said. Once the buyout firms take profits, the concern has been, they may be less focused on managing these companies, Mr. Donnelly said.
Buyout firms are reaping profits through special dividends at a time when they are having a rough time raising money for new deals. They are on track this year to raise the smallest amount of new capital from pension funds and other institutional investors in a decade, according to Thomson Venture Economics. Those investors have found buyout firms slow to return profits on old investments and slow to make new ones. Now the institutions are getting some of their money back through the dividends. 
In some cases, buyout firms are using special dividends to take profits on acquisitions made a few years ago. In June, Bain Capital and other investors in Domino's, a company that Bain acquired in 1998, received a $200 million dividend after the company raised money in the loan and junk bond markets.
"This gave us a chance to realize some return on our investment," said Mark Nunnelly, a managing director at Bain. Bain still controls 65 percent of Domino's, he said.
In other cases, buyout firms are taking cash out of companies they have owned for far shorter periods.
Regal Entertainment, which operates movie theaters, paid a $715 million dividend to its shareholders last month, financed with convertible bonds and bank debt. Most of that went to the financier Philip F. Anschutz of Denver and to Oaktree Capital Management, an investment firm in Los Angeles. They gained control of Regal by buying the debt of predecessor companies at distressed prices in 2000 and 2001.
Two other buyout firms, TA Associates in Boston and Friedman, Fleischer & Lowe in San Francisco, are said to be looking to take profits on an acquisition made just months ago. The two firms acquired Tempur World, a mattress maker, in November, and now hope to pay themselves a $160 million dividend by raising bank and high-yield debt, a newsletter published by S.& P. LCD said.
A TA Associates spokeswoman declined to comment. A Friedman, Fleischer partner did not return calls.
With rates on junk bonds low by historic standards, the additional debt is manageable for most companies, bankers said. The overall ratio of debt to cash flow is equivalent to other financings by highly leveraged companies, according to S.& P. LCD.
With interest rates climbing and demand for stock offerings reviving, some buyout firms will try to take their holdings public in the coming weeks, Mr. Jones of Morgan Stanley said. But with rates on bonds still relatively low, the debt market is still appealing to many, he said.
"These are the sorts of deals you see in an exuberant market," said Mr. Gold of Trust Company of the West, who says he has been selective about investing in such transactions. "But investors are feeling good and have lots of cash to invest."

Living the Life of the Sea From a 5th-Floor Walk-Up

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
AVAST there, me hearties, and shake the hand of the grizzled, bearded captain himself, Peter Neill, way up in his crow's-nest on historic Front Street. He is, as usual, anticipating sunny skies while cannily keeping a weather eye for icebergs. 
 No, matey, you're not on the bridge of the seagoing Black Pearl of "Pirates of the Caribbean," but rather in the wheelhouse of the earthbound administration building of the South Street Seaport Museum. There, Mr. Neill's fifth-floor walk-up office is something of a conning-tower, atop 41 steps that are fitted out with shipshape white-metal railings and seaworthy gray-painted landings. 
 "It's like climbing up from the engine room to the bridge," Mr. Neill said to a visitor, "which, of course, is where the captain sits in all majesty and ignorance saying, 'How could there be any icebergs in the middle of the ocean?' " 
Not this captain, who has single-mindedly steered the museum past many a shoal and a berg or two since he took the helm in 1985. "Everyone said it was a terrible career move," said Mr. Neill, 62, whose title is actually president, not captain. "The place was notorious for sinking ships, not saving them."
Eighteen years later, Mr. Neill is aiming the museum directly into a squall of autumn events, a series of coming openings. Most notable is the October opening of a $21 million museum gallery space in the 1811 brick commercial buildings of Schermerhorn Row on Fulton Street. It is the first major new cultural facility to be opened downtown since Sept. 11, 2001. 
Mr. Neill is looking forward to extending the presence of the museum, which currently offers exhibitions in three small galleries on Water Street in addition to its classic restored ships. (The first special exhibition in the new space will be "Africans in the New World: from Captive Passage to Cultural Transcendence.")
But in September, before the other galas, the museum will help open a new Brooklyn public high school in Bushwick, the Harbor School, which will expose its 125 freshmen not only to traditional academics but also to marine-related studies. The museum has helped design the curriculum and will hold classes in its buildings and aboard its historic sailing ships as well. 
BEYOND this, Mr. Neill says the museum is well on its way toward the next goal: raising an additional $20 million to build a six-story extension to the Schermerhorn Row space.
Mr. Neill would like his institution, unlike other maritime museums, "to transcend ships in bottles, boxes and frames and show the interrelationships between the world's oceans and the social, economic, political and cultural life of the city."
Aye aye, but exactly how did Mr. Neill become the old man of the sea while growing up in St. Louis? He smiled and acknowledged that he'd never even seen the ocean until the age of 19 when "it made an impression." 
His father, a lawyer, sent him to St. Paul's School in Concord, N.H.; then, at Stanford University, Mr. Neill majored in English.
Inexplicably spurning both the Navy and the swashing of buckles, Mr. Neill rose to sergeant after enlisting in the Vietnam-era Army in 1963; afterward he landed at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop (classmates: John Irving and Gail Godwin.) He wrote three published novels, "A Time Piece" (1970), "Mock Turtle Soup" (1972) and "Acoma" (1978). 
Eventually he put aside fiction-writing for the imperative of earning a living, and became executive director of Schooner Inc., a New Haven program patterned after the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater Inc. 
In 1984, he was tapped to head up the maritime preservation program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation in Washington, D.C. before he got that call from the Seaport Museum that shivered his timbers.
Initially Mr. Neill set about re-establishing the museum's relationship with donors (who now support a $5.9 million budget and a staff of 39). He also built the maritime collections and transformed the museum's membership publication into a quarterly history magazine. Along the way, Mr. Neill rescued a small fleet of classic ships from their fate in Davy Jones's locker. 
In that regard, it should be said that Mr. Neill is the captain of something: his own 24-foot sloop, Wing. He confesses that his second wife, the painter Mary Barnes, is a better sailor. "I am her humble crew," he said. The sloop lives in Nova Scotia, where Mr. Neill vacations with his wife and their three children.
The museum's administrative building is formerly the home of a 19-century black-powder warehouse, and Mr. Neill's discourse can, at times, be explosive. He has vocally criticized the funding process by which much wealthier museums receive large grants from New York (the Seaport Museum's city budget line is currently zero) and he has deplored other perceived slights to Lower Manhattan institutions. 
"He's very passionate about the museum and Lower Manhattan," said Madelyn Wils, chairwoman of Community Board 1, who remembers first seeing him expostulate before the board years ago. "I thought, Who is this guy?" she remembered. 
She laughed. "Neither one of us," she said, "is afraid to speak our minds."

HEADLINE: Breaking Habits, Europeans Turn To Japan's Cars 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: VALENCIENNES, France 

 BODY:
When the 5,000-ton presses at Toyota's big new plant outside this northern French industrial city slam down, the concrete floor under Toshiharu Takasu's feet trembles.
 For decades, varying national tastes, trade barriers and the inclination of many European automakers toward creative design made most of Europe inhospitable terrain for Japanese cars in contrast to the United States. But now, the pounding presses at the Toyota plant are a kind of metaphor for a recent Japanese automotive assault on the Continent. 
 To the delight of managers like Mr. Takasu, the plant manager here, but to the dismay of French, German and Italian auto executives struggling with moribund sales, more European buyers are deserting their Fiats and Volkswagens in favor of Toyotas, Nissans and Hondas. 
Many of the hot-selling Japanese models have been designed and engineered specifically for Europe, and fall in the small and midsize segments that account for the bulk of European sales. But buyers are also attracted to larger Japanese models. 
Sales of Japanese cars in Europe jumped almost 7 percent last year, to 1.64 million vehicles, while the overall car market contracted 3 percent. In the first half of 2003, as the market shrank 2.6 percent further, Japanese car sales climbed by an additional 6 percent.
Still, only about one new car in eight sold in Europe is a Japanese model, up modestly from the one-in-nine share that held steady for a decade. In the United States, the Japanese manufacturers have 28 percent of the market.
Fresh models are behind the recent Japanese growth, most of this in the compact category, the largest in Europe: the Honda Jazz, the Mazda 2, the updated Nissan Micra and the redesigned Toyota Yaris -- known in Japan as the Vitz and built here in Valenciennes, near the Belgian border. With more new models in preparation and new factories planned or under construction in several countries, Europeans' flirtation with Japanese cars is expected to continue. 
The sprawling Toyota plant here illustrates the promise. It was built for $570 million and opened in January 2001, with plans for an annual output of 150,000 cars. But by last year, the demand for the Yaris was so strong that production was ratcheted up to 184,000 annually. A further $100 million in investment will step up capacity to 240,000 cars next year.
"This is really quite good," said Mr. Takasu as he gazed at charts tracing the rising output and the swelling bonuses that his employees will receive for surpassing targets. 
What made the difference in Europe for the Japanese auto industry was a benign combination of lowered barriers to Asian imports, evolving European habits in car purchasing, and the automakers' decisions to start replacing imported models with new ones designed locally.
Now, in markets like France and Italy that long resisted Japanese cars, "people are realizing they're not turkeys," said Karl E. Ludvigsen, a former Ford executive who is an independent consultant in Britain. It is beginning, he said, "to be socially acceptable to have one in the driveway."
For decades, European drivers saw Japanese cars as reliable and robust perhaps, yet bland and lacking in personality. The Japanese companies are starting to overcome that reputation by tailoring their new models to European tastes. The Micra, for instance, came out of Nissan's new design center in London; Toyota's latest incarnations were created at a design center it opened in Provence, in southern France, in 2000. 
The European Union still levies a 10 percent duty on cars imported from Japan, four times the duty that Washington assesses. So all the big manufacturers now build cars in European Union countries. Honda has factories in Britain; Nissan, there and in Spain. It said recently that it would spend 400 million euros -- $454 million at current exchange rates -- to expand the production of sport utility vehicles at a factory in Madrid and diesel engines in Barcelona, in hopes of selling 20 percent more vehicles in Europe over the next two years. 
Toyota and Peugeot broke ground recently on a $1.5 billion joint factory in the Czech Republic to build very small cars for city use, and Toyota is adding a transmission factory and an engine plant in southern Poland. All three installations are to come online in 2005, and the locations were chosen with more in mind: wages are low in Eastern Europe, both countries will be joining the European Union soon, and Toyota sees the potential for new markets all the way to Russia.
"Suzuki has a long history in Hungary, and Isuzu builds engines in Poland," said Shinji Kanno, who represents the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association in Brussels. "It's totally up to the market to see how much we can expand our business in Eastern Europe. The more positive it is, the more our investment will increase in that region." 
Consumer attitudes are also shifting Japanese makers' way. For generations, Europeans, more than many Americans, remained strong brand and national loyalists. French drivers liked to stick with Renault, Germans with Volkswagen, Italians with Fiat. But with growing affluence and the financial means to change cars more often, brand loyalty is breaking down. Moreover, all manufacturers are developing cars meant for a Europewide market to capture economies of scale.
"In France, you kept your car 20 years, and brand loyalty reigned strong, especially among Citroen owners," said Jerome Chastel, commercial director at Christophe Briard Automobiles, a big Toyota dealership in Paris. "Now the market is more volatile. It has to be a coup de coeur" -- a love affair. 
Jacob Cohen is one who fell in love. Mr. Cohen, 48, who sells children's clothing, has been driving a Volkswagen Golf lately, but he has admired Japanese quality since he bought a Nissan van a few years ago for his business. Now, with three growing children, he wants to replace the Golf with a larger vehicle, and on a recent afternoon he examined a steel-gray Toyota Avensis Verso at Mr. Chastel's showroom. "I saw one in the street and liked its looks," he said. And at 27,850 euros ($31,615), it is cheaper than a comparable Volkswagen model, the Touran. 
European automakers, of course, are gearing up to meet the challenge. Some are forging alliances. Peugeot, which prides itself on internal growth and so sat out the round of mergers and acquisitions that swept the industry a few years ago, chose Toyota as a partner to share the cost of developing and building its new small car. Peugeot's rival Renault went a step further a few years ago by buying a controlling stake in Nissan. 
Now, Renault counts on Nissan for profits and expertise. At the big Renault plant in Douai, half an hour's drive from Valenciennes, the use of Nissan production tools and assembly methods have helped cut the cost of building a four-door Renault Megane by 13 percent and speed up the assembly time to 14 hours, from nearly 26 hours in 1995.
Pierre-Alain De Smedt, Renault's production chief, calculated recently that Nissan was responsible for about two-thirds of the plant's design. About half its 6,000 workers attended courses taught by Japanese instructors on how to increase productivity. 
Mr. Ludvigsen, the consultant, said that perhaps the toughest challenge facing the Japanese in Europe is not cost-cutting, but distribution: assembling an effective network of dealers.
European Union regulations traditionally gave car manufacturers strong control over their dealers, which in many countries were virtual monopolies that blocked the entry of new competitors. But recent regulatory changes meant to loosen the system are likely to ease the way for the Japanese manufacturers, who need more dealers if they are to realize their growth plans, Mr. Ludvigsen said. 
Even under the new rules, Mr. Kanno of the Japanese manufacturers' association said, "It won't be easy; it's a tough market."

HEADLINE: PANEL URGES U.S. TO BROADEN ROLE IN VACCINATIONS 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4 

 BODY:
The federal government should require all health insurance policies to pay for vaccines, should reimburse insurers for the costs and should subsidize vaccines for uninsured people, an expert panel from the National Academy of Sciences said today.
 The proposals for a sweeping overhaul of vaccine policy are a response to recent shortages in the supply of some vaccines and a steady decline in the number of companies producing vaccines. 
 A major purpose of the recommendations is to guarantee that everyone has access to the growing number of new and expensive but effective vaccines.
"Immunization is too important to the nation for anyone to be left uncovered," said Frank A. Sloan, a health economist at Duke University who was chairman of the 11-member panel. 
At the same time, the panel said it wanted to stimulate and sustain investment in new vaccines, by assuring that manufacturers could achieve an adequate return on their investments. 
The proposal for an "insurance mandate" and subsidies would increase federal spending on vaccines, by an unspecified amount, and is subject to approval by Congress. Lawmakers expressed concern about severe shortages of some vaccines in 2001 and 2002. The problem has not been high on the Congressional agenda, but today's report may prompt action on Capitol Hill.
"This report must be given serious attention by Congress and the federal government," said Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, who has investigated the vaccine shortages.
Dr. Donald A. Young, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, a lobbying group, said he was wary of a new federal mandate, even if the government promised to pay for it.
"At first blush," Dr. Young said, "this seems to be a complicated approach to encouraging consumers to get the shots they need." In addition, he said, "We are concerned that federal money for the subsidy might evaporate over time, leaving behind the residue of another insurance mandate, which will drive up premiums and cause some consumers to lose their current coverage."
The recommendations, from the academy's Institute of Medicine, are meant to ensure access to vaccines that might be developed in the future. Researchers have been working on vaccines to combat multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, certain types of cancer, including cervical cancer, and H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.
The federal government buys about 55 percent of the nation's childhood vaccines and therefore has significant power over vaccine prices. The panel said it wanted to reduce "the role of government in directly purchasing and distributing vaccine products."
Rather than buying vaccines, it said, the government should provide "a fixed subsidy" that would pay for each vaccine and the cost of administering it.
In its report, commissioned in 2001 by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the panel said Congress should require all public and private health plans to cover immunizations recommended by the government.
The mandate would provide coverage for all insured children, for adults 65 and older and for certain people 18 to 64 with a high risk of developing diseases that can be prevented by vaccines.
The subsidy would be based on "the societal benefits" of each vaccine, including its ability to enhance the length and quality of life, to reduce future medical costs and to increase the productivity of workers by keeping them healthy.
The subsidies would also reflect that "immunization protects not just the individual, but also others in society, from contagious diseases," the report said.
To people without insurance, the government would offer vouchers that could be used to obtain vaccinations from any doctor or clinic.
Dr. Walter A. Orenstein, director of the national immunization program at the Centers for Disease Control, said the report provided many useful suggestions and recommendations.
Coverage for vaccines is uneven, the panel said. Some insurers cover vaccines. Some include vaccine benefits with high co-payments or deductibles. Some insurers cover major medical expenses but not vaccines. 
The panel said that "one in four children under age 2 is not up to date on recommended vaccines" and that immunization rates were lower for adults, including those with chronic illnesses who are particularly vulnerable. 
More than 25 companies produced the recommended vaccines for the United States market 30 years ago, but only 5 remain, it said.
Federal officials negotiate significant discounts on the large amounts of vaccine they buy. But the panel said it would be a serious mistake for the government to purchase all vaccine.
"Arbitrary government pricing would be devastating to vaccine research and development," the report said.
Professor Sloan said a vaccine subsidy had two advantages over prices negotiated by the government. First, he said, it would probably increase prices for future vaccines, creating strong incentives for companies to discover and develop new products. "Second," he said, "it would induce companies to focus their attention on vaccines that would benefit society the most."
The federal government spends $1 billion a year on the Vaccines for Children program and $300 million to buy vaccines for state governments. The proposals would shift vaccine costs for children and high-risk adults to the federal government, while reducing the amount spent by private health plans, the panel said.
The cost of immunizing children has increased in recent years, with the approval of new vaccines, including one to protect children against pneumococcal bacteria that can cause life-threatening meningitis and blood infections. Moreover, the panel said, "significant price increases can be expected in the future."
The cost of immunizing a child with the recommended doses of vaccine, at discounted government prices, has risen to $435 from $200 in 1997, and the cost to private purchasers is approaching $700.
But, said Mark V. Pauly, a panel member and professor at the University of Pennsylvania, "the benefits of these vaccines are so substantial that worrying about the last penny of spending seems to be a foolish economy."

HEADLINE: HARVESTING POVERTY; 
The Long Reach of King Cotton

 BODY:
If it weren't killing them, people in Burkina Faso might get a good laugh at America's unprofitable cotton-growing fetish. Burkinabe, after all, are known for their sense of humor. And what could be more absurd than the sight of the world's richest nation -- a fiery preacher of free-trade and free-market values at that -- spending $3 billion or $4 billion a year in taxpayer money to grow cotton worth less than that and selling its mounting surpluses at an ever greater loss?
 But those American subsidies are killing the Burkinabe farmers, so the inclination to laugh hardens to sorrow and resentment. As in neighboring Mali and Benin, cotton has long been the sole bright spot in this country's ever-dismal economic prospects. White gold, they still call it, though now there's a hint of sarcasm to the expression. Subsidized American cotton farmers now dump so much product on the market that it has driven down world prices. So much so that it currently costs Burkina Faso's cotton industry, traditionally one of the lowest-cost producers, about a dime more than the prevailing global price to get a kilo of cotton to international markets. 
 American farm subsidies, like those in Europe and Japan, are intended to support a traditional way of life and save farmland from either development or abandonment. If city-dwelling Americans think of the subsidies at all, it is to complain about their cost, or to express a vague sense of satisfaction that we are protecting what seems like a wholesome part of Americana. The idea that we might be inadvertently ruining the chances of small African farmers never occurs to us. But it certainly occurs to the people in the cotton districts of Burkina Faso.
The odds have always been stacked against Burkina Faso, a small landlocked country in the West African Sahel, the region between the Sahara and the Atlantic. This predominantly Muslim nation, where life expectancy has yet to hit the half-century mark, ranks third from the bottom in global rankings of living standards. 
Americans send some of their finest young people to places like Burkina Faso, where there are almost 80 Peace Corps volunteers and plans to double that number. The United States also backs debt-forgiveness programs for Burkina Faso and other types of economic assistance. But Americans would be horrified to learn that all the good accomplished by dedicated volunteers and millions of dollars in aid is overwhelmed by the havoc wreaked by Washington's bloated cotton subsidies. By cutting generous checks to 25,000 American cotton farmers whose average net worth is nearly $1 million, Washington underwrites massive overproduction. This results in depressed global prices and a harvest of poverty for Burkina Faso's two million cottonfarmers.
"America wants us to comprehend the evil posed by violent anti-Western terrorism, and we do," said President Blaise Compaore in an interview in the capital city of Ouagadougou. "But we want you to equally concern yourself with the terror posed here by hunger and poverty, a form of terrorism your subsidies are aiding and abetting. If we cannot sell our cotton we will die."
"King Cotton," the evocative old shorthand for the supremacy of cotton in Southern culture, still ranks high among the hierarchy of Washington's power lobbies. No other crop is subsidized to such an outrageous degree, enriching so few at a cost so high to millions elsewhere. America's cotton subsidies, mind you, exceed the gross domestic product of Burkina Faso. Because the federal welfare program for cotton growers is so generous and unlimited, guaranteeing farmers an inflated price for every additional pound of cotton they produce, America's share of the world market has been increasing at a time when global prices have been crashing. More than half of all cotton grown in this country is now exported, only because taxpayers subsidize its sale at below production costs. 
All the good will engendered by American aid and the sterling efforts of Peace Corps volunteers is washed away by the outrage ordinary Burkinabe cotton farmers feel about the $180 billion farm bill that Congress approved in 2002. In the small western village of Koumbia, where on a recent sweltering day women stooped over, rhythmically wielding simple hoes, to weed cotton plantings, people make a direct connection between their own impoverishment and that 10-year subsidy authorization passed on the other side of the planet. The way the people of Koumbia see it, their never-completed schoolhouse might as well have been pictured on the legislation's title page.
If the United States terminated its cotton subsidies, commodity prices would rebound to more realistic levels, allowing third-world cotton farmers to compete and earn a profit on their crops. And by terminating trade-distorting farming subsidies, Washington would defuse a potent source of feverish anti-Americanism. 
It's hard for most Americans, who don't think about farm subsidies at all, to take this problem seriously. It's also hard for farm states, which think of federal aid simply as a way to help hard-working local farmers, to appreciate how intensely, and bitterly, the Africans feel. But most of the developing world believes in the superpower's omniscience. No one in Burkina Faso imagines the impact on their cotton growers was anything but deliberate. 
"If the United States can go to the moon, which is rather complicated, one would think it could figure out a way, if it wanted, to help its cotton producers, without hurting us farmers in Africa," said Francois Traore, president of Burkina Faso's National Cotton Producers Union. Many Burkinabe farmers erroneously believe that President Bush himself pockets sizable cotton-growing subsidies.
Burkina Faso's hand-picked cotton is the cash crop that permits smallholder farmers to buy fertilizers and invest in the other crops that get rotated on the land. "If cotton doesn't sell at a decent price, it affects everything else," Mr. Traore said. That includes Koumbia's little schoolhouse, whose third classroom remains unfinished.

To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert's portrayal of one man's journey from Montenegro to an American jail is telling ("Jailing Immigrants," column, Aug. 4). 
As the disparity between rich and poor countries increases, so, too, will political instability and the risk that people will be forced to move for purely economic reasons. 
 Therefore, distinguishing between growing numbers of unauthorized economic migrants and bona fide asylum seekers will pose an even greater challenge to immigration authorities. It appears as though Vaso Nikpreljevic found this out firsthand.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Rich Get Richer and Poor Are Undecided

BYLINE:  By BILL PENNINGTON

 BODY:
Nearly a year after Major League Baseball adopted a new, expanded system of revenue sharing, and in the aftermath of another eventful countdown to the trading deadline last week, it is clear that baseball is far from operating under an entirely new economic order. The rich teams are still richer and the poor teams, in comparison, are still poorer.
 But there is evidence suggesting that the new financial model is having some impact. Other than the Yankees, teams are striving to keep their payrolls under the new $117 million threshold that sets off baseball's luxury tax. A year ago, Major League Baseball was projecting that six to eight teams would be unable to resist a midseason splurge and would face the tax. Instead, even prosperous teams -- the Yankees notwithstanding -- are at least examining their salary costs with a thrifty eye. 
 That has led to a second outcome: more than ever, almost every trade between teams revolves around money. A player's potential impact on the field is a part of the equation, of course, but in most cases the redistribution of salaries -- simple debit/credit trades -- was a major factor during the flurry of trades completed before the deadline last Thursday. 
And finally, there are decidedly mixed signals on whether the new system of revenue sharing and luxury taxes is creating more competitive balance on the field. Certainly it has not been a panacea to small-market teams everywhere.
In places like Cincinnati and Pittsburgh, where losing teams unloaded a number of well-paid, accomplished players last week, the perspective is that there has been no change in either finances or frustrating on-field performance. But in Kansas City, Minnesota and Florida, where the dumping of high-salaried players has almost been an annual rite of midsummer, there was near rejoicing. The Royals, the Twins and the Marlins are contending for the playoffs, and somewhat surprisingly, they kept their stars and even acquired additional players for playoff runs. Even the Montreal Expos, a small-market anomaly now owned by M.L.B. and destined to be moved fairly soon, did not trade their star, Vladimir Guerrero, before the deadline. Instead, the Expos remain in contention for the National League wild-card spot. It may be that winning on the field, not the promise of future shared revenue, is what loosened the purse strings in these smaller markets. Which could lead the analysis of baseball's new financial model to a familiar, chicken-and-egg debate.
"Incremental revenue sharing, even as it was distributed last off-season, has allowed some small-market teams to husband their resources and keep their teams together," said Rob Manfred, M.L.B.'s executive vice president for labor relations and human resources. "That has helped them put together more competitive teams. The new agreement has not been around long enough to see a full-blown effect, but there are good signs it can bring about the intended change in the long term."
Others are far from convinced.
"You don't have to be a genius to see that when the Yankees can get Aaron Boone -- when they are able to buy whoever they want -- things have not changed," the former commissioner Fay Vincent said in a telephone interview yesterday. "The incentive to change is not significant. If the idea was to hold down the Yankees' spending or slow down the power of the big-market clubs, I don't see that going on."
J.P. Ricciardi, general manager of the Toronto Blue Jays, told The Associated Press last week, "It sounds like a repeat of the 50's, where the Yankees used to go to the Kansas City A's and take their players and give them money so they could survive."
Under the collective bargaining agreement reached last August, baseball's richest teams are expected to share with their less wealthy brethren much more than ever before. After the season, the total will be about $260 million, with the Yankees' payout alone coming to nearly $60 million. 
There is widespread suspicion, however, that this enhanced revenue sharing -- intended to right the competitive imbalance between big-market and small-market teams -- will have limited effect on the field, because owners of some smaller-market teams may simply pocket that money rather than spend it on better players. Teams do not publicly release financial documents on how they spend the shared revenue.
"I believe the new system will work because I expect lower salaries and fewer lengthy big-time contracts," said Richard G. Sheehan, an economist at Notre Dame who studies sports business. "But over all, I believe there is roughly the same amount of inequality across the board in baseball. Some poorer teams totally eschew the off-season free-agent market. They do pocket the money."
Baseball has had a form of revenue sharing for several seasons, and with it had come unsubstantiated speculation of owners of smaller-market teams spending the extra revenue on everything from Christmas bonuses for front-office employees to expansion projects for unrelated businesses operated by the teams' owners.
But Manfred, who helped negotiatethe new collective bargaining agreement last summer, said that it mandates, for the first time, that teams receiving shared revenue be audited to examine specifically how they have used the money. By April 1, 2004, each of the teams must submit a detailed accounting of how the revenue was spent and how these expenditures were intended to improve on-field performance. Manfred said Commissioner Bud Selig had the power to impose penalties on any team that did not submit the report or violated the expressed intent of baseball's revenue sharing.
When it was suggested to Manfred that some baseball fans might not trust the accounting methods of some owners, he responded: "It's hard to hide that money. Remember, the club owners don't trust each other, either."
Executives of some smaller-market teams, notably in Milwaukee and Pittsburgh, have said in the past that they were spending their shared revenue on improving their scouting and minor league systems. This is a time-honored way for teams to improve -- through the amateur draft and by nurturing young players -- but these days even that approach is not likely to level the playing field between baseball's haves and have-nots. 
Baseball's amateur draft, weighted to give the poorest performing major league teams the chance to catch up, covers only young American players. But scores of highly rated players raised outside North America are being recruited by major league teams now, and finding the best foreign-born players in Asia or Latin America not only takes a bigger scouting budget, it takes more money to outbid competitors with outsized signing bonuses. 
Also, some owners of smaller-market teams have privately accused their richer brethren of shielding millions in earnings to prevent the revenue from being shared. Since many bigger-market clubs also control the cable company that televises their games -- a lucrative relationship that is at the core of baseball's financial inequities -- the contention is that some cable entities pay fees at below market rates to the teams.
"The big-market/small-market problem is the most intractable problem in baseball," Vincent said. "I don't see that changing. And without some level of competitive balance the game will be hurt. I love baseball, but I watch a lot of games and I see a large number of empty seats. I do believe the owners are acting more rationally, but often that means cutting costs by getting rid of players and that's just devastating to the fans of that club.
"I've been saying it for years, the only answer is for the owners to let the players become partners in the game."
The collective bargaining agreement, which runs through 2006, calls for no such alliance.
"Let's see how this system plays out," Manfred said. "It is early. It can bear fruit."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Mexican Group Is Latest To Seek to Draw the Expos

BYLINE:  By STEVE POPPER

 BODY:
The Montreal Expos sit four and a half games out of a wild-card berth in the National League playoff race. But where the team will actually reside when this race is over and next season arrives remains a mystery.
 An accommodation over the last two seasons has put the Expos under the ownership of Major League Baseball and the 29 other franchises. This season's experiment to keep the team in Montreal for 59 home games and in San Juan, P.R., for another 22 "home" games is unlikely to continue for another year. 
 So the question of just where home will be grows more urgent as the calendar flips closer to the 2004 season. Northern Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Portland, Ore., along with San Juan, have all submitted proposals. And this week, Major League Baseball received a proposal from a group led by Carlos Bremer, a Mexican businessman, to take the itinerant franchise to Monterrey.
Bob Dupuy, the president and chief operating officer of Major League Baseball, is intent on finding a permanent home for the 34-year-old Expos beyond next season, and that is something the Mexican option does not yet present.
"Our first goal is to find a permanent solution for the Expos franchise, which includes a permanent location and an independent ownership group," Dupuy said. "All efforts are being made to find that. Until we resolve that issue, we have to look at temporary solutions. This year the split schedule was a temporary solution."
Each of the proposals has had stumbling blocks involving stadium issues and the sort of package a new group of owners can present to Major League Baseball. Bremer and his group have stepped in with a proposal that he believes can satisfy the immediate needs of baseball for a stadium and financing.
The Expos have struggled once more in Montreal, averaging 11,216 fans over their first 35 dates at Olympic Stadium despite having a team in postseason contention. In Puerto Rico, the attendance has not been much better, an average of 14,248 in 50-year-old Hiram Bithorn Stadium, which holds about 20,000. Major League Baseball expects the numbers in Puerto Rico to rise with series remaining against the Florida Marlins and Chicago Cubs.
Monterrey, 1,800 feet above sea level, is the third-largest city in Mexico with about 3.8 million residents in the metropolitan area, including more than one million in the city proper. It also has Monterrey Stadium, which meets the needs of Major League Baseball: built in 1991, it seats 27,000 and includes 60 luxury suites. It will be expanded to 30,000 seats if the Expos arrive.
"It looks, feels and plays like a major league park," Bremer said. "We think that puts us in a unique position, financially and logistically, among the contenders for the Expos. We have the best stadium in Latin America. That helps. We thought that with the Expos trying to move either permanently or temporarily, this is the right moment to bring major league baseball to 100 million people in Mexico.
"We made two proposals, one for 22 games and another for 81 games, but we really want to bring the Expos to Mexico for 81 games. This is a team that has a lot of Latinos on the roster, and we have a sense that we can try to bring the team here in a first step temporarily, but if it works, we can make this permanent. I think we can get a group of Mexicans and Americans to buy the team."
Monterrey is the most affluent city in Mexico, producing about 10 percent of the gross domestic product with only 4 percent of the population. 
Bremer is the chief executive of Value Grupo Financiero, the largest financial services firm in the city. He, Mayor Felipe Cantu, and Eric A. Stern, an American consultant, began communicating with baseball officials shortly before the All-Star Game last month. They met with the Major League Baseball vice presidents Tom Ostertag and John McHale Jr. in New York on July 20.
 Jose Maiz Garcia, the owner of the stadium and the Sultanes, a Class AAA-level Mexican League team that plays there, is a partner in the deal. The Sultanes would have to modify their schedule to accommodate the Expos. 
The Mets and the San Diego Padres played a three-game regular-season series in Monterrey in 1996, and the Colorado Rockies and the Padres opened the 1999 season there.
 The Major Indoor Soccer League is the only professional sport in the United States to expand into Mexico, with a franchise that starts operating in Monterrey this fall.

Shares Are Mostly Higher, Led by Telecommunications

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks advanced yesterday, led by telecommunications shares. Qwest Communications International said that it was talking to several potential bidders for its mobile-telephone network, encouraging investors that phone shares would rally.
 Verizon Communications climbed as it resumed talks with unions representing 78,000 employees after making "significant progress" in contract negotiations. 
 Benchmark stock indexes erased losses at midday in a rally that some traders said was caused by purchases of stock index futures.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.67 points, or 0.3 percent, to 982.82, after falling as much as 1.4 percent. Telephone shares contributed a fifth of the advance. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 32.07 points, or 0.4 percent, to 9,186.04, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 1.56 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,714.06.
Qwest added 34 cents, to $4.13. Its chief executive, Richard C. Notebaert, said in an interview that several bidders were interested in its wireless network. He declined to elaborate.
Verizon advanced $1.46, to $35.84. 
SBC Communications, a local telephone company, rose 45 cents, to $23.85.
Shares of HSBC Holdings trading in the United States gained $1.62, to $62.98 on a 25 percent increase in first-half net income. 
SangStat Medical increased $6.76, to $22.23. The biotechnology company agreed to be bought by Genzyme for $600 million in cash. Genzyme, a maker of treatments for rare hereditary diseases, fell $1.66, to $47.62.
Monster Worldwide, the online job site, fell $3.59, to $22.51. AOL Time Warner reached a four-year, $115 million agreement with CareerBuilder.com, replacing an existing contract with Monster.com to provide job listings to America Online customers.
Monsanto, the developer of genetically engineered crops, dropped 47 cents, to $21.68. Kevin McCarthy, an analyst for Banc of America Securities, lowered his rating to neutral from buy, as Monsanto faces increased risk of legal costs stemming from lawsuits against Solutia, a chemical company that Monsanto spun off in 1997.
CV Therapeutics plunged $7.31, to $27.87. The company, a drug developer, agreed with federal regulators to cancel a review of its Ranexa drug for heart-related problems because of a lack of time to complete tests.

Treasury Prices Rise
By Reuters
 Treasury bond prices rose yesterday even as equity markets seesawed, but the gains looked tentative for bonds after a brutal two-month free fall.
The day's serving of economic news might have ordinarily hurt bonds, had the market not fallen so precipitously in recent weeks.
Instead, traders shrugged off a 1.7 percent rise in durable goods orders for June and dipped back into government debt, albeit with extreme caution.
"The selling has definitely slowed down, but we're not seeing a lot of buying," said Vincent Verterano, the head government bond trader at Nomura Securities.
By late in the day, the 10-year note gained 26/32, to a price of 94 24/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.28 percent from 4.40 percent.
And the 30-year bond rose 28/32, to 101 25/32. Its yield dropped to 5.25 percent from 5.31 percent.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	99.761	99.482	High Rate	0.945	1.025	Investment Rate	0.964	1.047	Low Rate	0.92%	0.99%	Median Rate	0.94%	1.01%	Total applied for	$41,586,182	$34,492,984	Accepted	$20,953,912	$22,936,922	Noncompetitive	$1,551,144	$975,389	

Both issues are dated Aug. 7. The three-month bills mature on Nov. 6, and the six-month bills on Feb. 5, 2004.

HEADLINE: Everything Is Political 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The agency's analysts find that they are no longer helping to formulate policy; instead, their job is to rationalize decisions that have already been made. And more and more, they find that they are expected to play up evidence, however weak, that seems to support the administration's case, while suppressing evidence that doesn't. 
 Am I describing the C.I.A.? The E.P.A.? The National Institutes of Health? Actually, I'm talking about the Treasury Department, but the ambiguity is no coincidence. Across the board, the Bush administration has politicized policy analysis. Whether the subject is stem cells or global warming, budget deficits or weapons of mass destruction, government agencies are under intense pressure to say what the White House wants to hear. And the long-term consequences are likely to be dire. 
 Traditionally the Treasury, like the C.I.A., stands somewhat above the political fray. Externally, it is supposed to provide objective data that Congress and the public can use to evaluate administration proposals. Internally, long-serving Treasury analysts traditionally ride herd on political appointees, warning them when their proposals are ill conceived or irresponsible.
But under the Bush administration the Treasury takes its marching orders from White House political operatives. As The New Republic points out, when John Snow meets with Karl Rove, the meetings take place in Mr. Rove's office.
To the general public, the most obvious consequence of this subservience has been Treasury's meek acquiescence in an economic policy that hasn't produced any jobs, but has produced a $450 billion deficit. Insiders, however, are if anything even more dismayed by the erosion of Treasury's intellectual integrity -- an erosion exemplified by its denial and deception on the subject of tax cuts.
Here's the story: Treasury has an elaborate computer model designed to evaluate who benefits and who loses from any proposed change in tax laws. For example, the model can be used to estimate how much families in the middle of the income distribution will gain from a tax cut, or the share of that tax cut that goes to the top 1 percent of families. In the 1990's the results of such analyses were routinely made public.
But since George W. Bush came into power, the department has suppressed most of that information, releasing only partial, misleading tables. The purpose of this suppression, of course, is to conceal the extent to which Mr. Bush's tax cuts concentrate their bounty on families with very high incomes. In a stinging recent article in Tax Notes, the veteran tax analyst Martin Sullivan writes of the debate over the 2001 cut that "Treasury's analysis was so embarrassingly poor and so biased, we thought we had seen the last of its kind." But worse was to come.
For his June 22 interview with Howard Dean, Tim Russert asked the Treasury Department to prepare examples showing how repealing the Bush tax cuts would affect ordinary families. Presumably Mr. Russert thought Treasury would provide a representative selection -- that is, like many in the media, he doesn't yet understand the extent to which Treasury has become an arm of the White House political machine.
In any case, the examples Treasury provided to Mr. Russert and others in the media were wildly unrepresentative. To give you a sense: the Treasury's example of a "lower income" elderly household was one receiving $2,000 a year in dividend income. In fact, only about one elderly household in four receives any dividend income, and only one in eight receives as much as $2,000. Not surprisingly, the "Russert families" gained far more from the Bush tax cuts than a representative sample. As Mr. Sullivan put it, "If this continues, the Treasury's Office of Tax Policy may have to change its name to the Office of Tax Propaganda."
As I've said, this is only one example of a broad pattern. Still, why does politicized analysis matter? One answer is that it undermines democracy: how can Congress or the public make informed votes if both are fed distorted information?
And even if you aren't bothered by an administration that systematically misleads the public, you ought to be worried about the decisionsof an administration that systematically misleads itself. A leader who is told only what he wants to hear is all too likely to make bad decisions about the economy, the environment and beyond.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: MEDIA; 
Iraqis Get the News but Often Don't Believe It

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Aug. 4 

 BODY:
The Iraqi economy is flat on its back. But here on Karada Out, the bustling boulevard just across the Tigris River from Saddam Hussein's palaces, business is booming. 
 Specifically, the information business. In a two-mile stretch of this thoroughfare, 53 shops are selling satellite television receivers. Close to 100 stores have television sets on display on the sidewalks, where multicolored boxes from Korean manufacturers are stacked high. 
 At one store, Abdullah Salama, a 35-year-old manager, watched on a recent day as eight workers unloaded 3,000 satellite dishes from an orange tractor-trailer. The load should take only a few weeks to sell, Mr. Salama said. "Some people want to see entertainment programming," he said, "but basically they want to see the news." 
The boom is taking place despite the on-again-off-again electricity situation in many places. Iraqis say they are mainly watching the Arabic language networks like Al Jazeera, though they have mixed opinions about whether they like what they see. 
More than 100 newspapers are being published. By early afternoon it is impossible to find a copy of what by many accounts is the most credible daily paper in Baghdad: Azzaman, circulation 75,000, published by a former Saddam Hussein aide who escaped in 1992. Internet cafes also dot the street. Baghdadis now freely surf the Internet and send e-mail without a government official pacing behind them.
Abbas Darwish, 63, a shop owner who sells newspapers, said, "Iraqis are very thirsty to learn what is happening outside of Iraq." 
The nascent Iraqi media offers evidence that a free market can thrive here. Yet it has also left Iraqis in Baghdad and in other cities overwhelmed by the choices and struggling to figure out which news sources are believable. 
One outlet that does not appear to have won over most Iraqis is the occupying powers' own Iraqi Media Network, a $5 million-a-month effort.
Many Iraqis complain that the network's televised programming is dull and repetitive. The network, which is managed by a Pentagon contractor, has been criticized by some of its own officials, who contend that its credibility has been hurt by meddling by occupation officials and a bare-bones budget.
Its television director, Ahmad al-Rikaby, said he quit in protest last week over the network's limited resources. "You cannot make television if you do not spend money," he said an interview from London.
Don North, a television producer who has just returned to the United States after serving as an adviser to the network, said he grew frustrated by orders to run programs that in his view were not sound journalism, as well as a slim budget. 
"Its role was envisioned to be an information conduit, and not just rubber-stamp flacking for the C.P.A.," Mr. North said, referring to the civilian authority. 
In response, a senior Iraqi Media Network official said that the network had been spending lots of money on new equipment to ease a shortage that he said was partly due to difficulties getting the staff to agree on what was needed. The official also acknowledged that new programming was needed, saying the network was working to develop some new shows quickly.
Officials say that some form of propaganda was always part of the plan. "I would not deny that they are in many ways a mouthpiece for what the coalition has done," including the broadcasting of public service announcements, said Charles Heatley, a spokesman for the civilian authority here. He said the reach of the network was demonstrated two weeks ago when Baghdad erupted in celebratory gunfire after the network broadcast reports that Uday and Qusay Hussein had been killed by American forces. 
Iraqis are known as voracious readers, but for 35 years they had little access to news -- except for Saddam Hussein's version. As a result, Iraqis tend to be highly skeptical of newspapers and official pronouncements.
"I usually don't buy -- I just like to read the headlines," said Bilal Rashid, 36, as he surveyed a street corner newsstand. Like many Baghdadis, he prefers to spend 20 or 30 minutes scanning the front pages instead of shelling out money to buy a newspaper. 
Mr. Rashid noted that many journalists now working for independent papers used to work for those sanctioned by the government. "Some of them are liars," he said. "They used to work for Saddam." 
The skepticism extends to the slick Arab satellite television networks, notably Qatar-based Al Jazeera. A common complaint from Iraqis is that Al Jazeera is too sympathetic to Mr. Hussein and too eager to inflame Arab conflicts with the United States.
"They put benzene on the fire," said Abdul Hussain, owner of an electronics store on Karada Out.
The media free-for-all has created some tense moments for the civilian authority, including the publication, and subsequent retraction, of an article in one Baghdad paper alleging that American soldiers had raped two Iraqi women.
Iraqi journalists are also still grappling with an American edict against publishing material that incites violence against the occupying forces, with violators facing imprisonment. One paper has been shut down -- Al Mustaqila, which advocated "Death to all spies and those who cooperate with the U.S."
Hassan Fattah, a Berkeley- and Columbia-educated journalist who is editor of Iraq Today, a weekly English-language paper, expressed concern, though. "You risk self-censorship, which basically defeats the whole purpose of a free press," he said. 
Some of the media skepticism is also clearly a product of the many newspapers published by political parties and religious groups with little effort at Western-style detachment. Some include bizarre diatribes. Al Thaqalain, a Shiite publication, recently maintained on its front page that there had been an influx of AIDS-bearing Jewish prostitutes.
Mr. Fattah's newspaper has had a rough-and-tumble entry into the Iraqi media. The day before the first edition was published, the offices were robbed by bandits armed with Kalashnikov rifles. Last week, two days were lost because the power generator conked out.
But the business is growing. The latest edition brought in $9,000 in advertising revenue. It includes articles about drug abuse, an American military raid in a wealthy Baghdad neighborhood and a tale about a bachelor who stole Saddam Hussein's bed and used it to persuade his girlfriend to accept his marriage proposal. 
Its reporters have been forced to learn quickly, especially about how to discern credible sources of information.
"You've got to take the word from the mouth of the horse," said Zaid Fahmi, a reporter who studied physics in college but this week had a front-page article about residents in a Baghdad district banding together to protect their local bank branch from looters.
Another skill Mr. Fahmi said he has been refining is how to elicit the right information. "If you ask a small question," he said, "you get a small answer."

HEADLINE: Surge in Rates May Hurt Pillar Of the Economy 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4 

 BODY:
If cheap mortgages have kept the economy afloat, the economy may have just sprung a leak.
 A little more than a month after the Federal Reserve reduced its overnight lending rate to just 1 percent, mortgage rates have shot up as investors have soured on the bond market -- in part because of confusion about the Fed's intentions in managing the economy. 
 This has abruptly stalled plans by thousands of homeowners to refinance their houses at even lower rates than they already enjoy. The pace of home loan refinancing has fallen by half the last several weeks, according to bankers and analysts.
If the higher rates persist, they will make it more expensive for people to buy houses or to borrow money against their houses to pay for renovations, furniture and even cars. That would damp a principal source of consumer demand over the last two years, a period when consumer spending has been one of the few sources of economic growth. 
Higher rates could also lead to more expensive loans for automobiles; robust car sales have been another pillar of the economy the last few years.
Businesses, meanwhile, still gun shy about spending money on new factories and equipment, may have to contend with higher borrowing costs as well. So will the federal government itself, just as tax cuts and spending increases are forcing it to borrow huge sums to cover the largest deficits in history.
It remains to be seen whether last week's surge in longer-term interest rates is just a blip or the start of a trend. Either way, however, it is remarkable as a demonstration of the limits of the Fed and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, to force the hand of the nation's financial markets.
The Fed may have lowered its federal funds rate, the rate it charges on overnight loans, but investors have ignored the move and pushed up interest rates on longer-term Treasury bonds.
Analysts say a big reason investors are marching in the opposite direction is that they have new doubts about both the Fed's ability and willingness to take drastic stepsif the United States slips into the kind of price deflation that plagues Japan.
"It looks to some people now as if the emperor has no clothes," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo, referring to Mr. Greenspan. "The Fed doesn't have much ammunition left, and if they use it, the markets will just demand more."
The astonishing divergence of Fed policy and the reaction of financial markets poses a challenge to Mr. Greenspan, who has until now enjoyed a nearly mythic reputation for his power to make the enormous American economy move to his tune.
Analysts say the Fed's sudden loss of influence stems from several factors. The first is a sudden reappraisal of the Fed's intention; after having fretted for months about the dangers of deflation, suggesting that it would use highly unconventional techniques to flood the markets with money to fight it, Mr. Greenspan backtracked last month to the disappointment of many bond investors.
The Fed also disappointed many investors by cutting the overnight federal funds rate by only a quarter- point on June 25.
On a more positive note, investors are also reacting to new data suggesting the economy may be strengthening after all. If that proves to be true, the Fed would be expected to raise rates at some point in the not too distant future.
Higher interest rates would make bonds, with their fixed interest rates, less appealing to investors. Bond prices would fall to compensate for the decline in demand.
But analysts say there is also an important new technical issue at play, one that may have caught Fed officials by surprise. That issue has to do with the nation's mortgage lenders, who are responsible for more than $5 trillion in home loans.
To protect themselves from borrowers' paying back their loans early, mortgage lenders hedge their loan portfolios in part by buying up Treasury bonds. But as interest rates began to creep up, the nation's biggest players abruptly adjusted their strategy and started selling bonds or derivative securities tied to them. Lower prices for Treasury bonds translate directly to higher interest rates earned on those bonds.
Since mid-June, yields on 10-year Treasury notes, which move in the opposite direction from the prices, have climbed from about 3.3 percent to 4.28 percent today. That affects the rates financial institutions charge for countless other kinds of long-term loans, from mortgages to car loans. Rates on mortgages have shot up more than one percentage point the last two weeks, from slightly over 5 percent to about 6 percent.
Rising interest rates also affect the Federal government's growing budget deficit, which the Bush administration expects to reach $455 billion this year.
Though many economists contend that big government deficits eventually lead to higher interest rates as the government begins to crowd the markets with its huge borrowing needs, most analysts say the recent surge in interest rates is not a result of the newest news on deficits.
Analysts say the increase in this year's expected deficit is tiny compared with the total credit market, and they note that investors were already expecting this year's deficit to exceed $300 billion.
John Makin, a senior economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said the most important reasons for the startling run-up in interest rates lies with the Federal Reserve.
Mr. Makin noted that Mr. Greenspan and other top Fed officials had put heavy emphasis on their worries about deflation, an across-the-board decline in prices. Beyond letting it be known they would reduce the overnight federal funds rate, Fed officials also began suggesting they would use "unconventional" methods to flood the markets with money if the federal funds rate declined to nearly zero.
As outlined by Mr. Greenspan and other Fed governors, notably Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed was prepared, if necessary, to move beyond setting rates for overnight lending and to start buying back longer-term Treasury securities, which would have directly lowered longer-term interest rates.
Expectations about lower long-term rates peaked in mid-June, not long before the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Markets Committee was scheduled to meet to decide on further reductions in interest rates.
As it happened, the Fed disappointed many investors by reducing interest rates by a quarter-point, and it continued to surprise them afterwards by backing away from talk about "unconventional" methods of fighting deflation.
The credit markets soured far more on July 15, when Mr. Greenspan testified before Congress. In that testimony, he was surprisingly optimistic about the economic outlook and led many analysts to believe that the Fed might actually raise interest rates by early next year.
Equally important, according to many analysts, Mr. Greenspan said it was "extremely unlikely" that deflation would pose a big enough risk to require pushing down longer-term interest rates with unorthodox tactics.
"My view is that the Fed has less confidence in the effectiveness of those operations," said Laurence H. Meyer, a economist and former Fed governor. But, he added, investors felt the Fed's conflicting signals had whipsawed them.
Most analysts are convinced last week's rise in interest rates was aggravated by an unusual new technical factor. That factor was the hedging activity of the nation's huge market in mortgages, a market worth more than $5 trillion that is substantially bigger than the market for Treasury bonds.
Mortgage lenders offset the risk that borrowers would repay their loans early by buying up Treasury bonds that guarantee interest rates over 10 years. But as rates began to creep up last month, mortgage lenders expected a big drop in mortgage refinancing activity and began to sell off Treasury bonds. That helped push interest rates higher, creating what amounted to a vicious cycle of rising rates.
Technical issues aside, some analysts say the process might not have started if the Fed had been clearer about its plans. "People were happy to take risks when the Fed was very accommodative," Mr. Makin of the American Enterprise Institute said. "I think they should have left the throttles on full."

HEADLINE: Profit Falls By 9.7% At Toyota 

BYLINE:  ByKEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 5 

 BODY:
The Toyota Motor Corporation, Japan's largest automaker, said today that a stronger yen and the adoption of new accounting rules pushed its profit lower by 9.7 percent in the latest quarter.
 The decline, however, was smaller than expected and did little to dim the view that Toyota remains one of the world's strongest car manufacturers. Toyota's sales are growing in most major markets and its balance sheet remains rock solid. Last week, the company's credit rating was raised to the top rank, Aaa, by Moody's Investors Service. 
 Toyota also had a record 11.1 percent share of the American car market, the world's largest, despite lukewarm sales over all. Since Toyota gets as much as 80 percent of its profits in North America, increasing sales there is crucial. Its success in America is a big reason Toyota recently increased its 2003 global sales target by 6 percent, or 60,000 cars.
In the short term, though, Toyota is battling swings in the foreign exchange market. The yen gained almost 7 percent in the April-June period this year compared with the quarter in 2002. A stronger Japanese currency reduces the value of profits earned in dollars and makes Japanese cars more expensive to shoppers overseas.
The earnings were also affected by a new accounting method that makes it harder to incorporate subsidiaries on consolidated earnings reports. By adopting standard United States accounting practices, Toyota must value its pension plans and marketable securities more strictly.
Factoring in these changes, Toyota earned 222.6 billion yen ($1.9 billion) from April to June, the first quarter of Japan's fiscal year. Operating profits, which more clearly reflect the core businesses, fell 13.2 percent compared with the period last year, to 341 billion yen ($2.8 billion). Global sales grew 5.6 percent to 4.1 trillion yen ($34.2 billion).
Toyota said it lost 30 billion yen ($250 million) to currency market fluctuations.
Toyota also had to pay $83 million to shift production between factories in North America, a one-time cost.
"We expect U.S. profits to begin growing again once our new models are reallocated," said Takeshi Suzuki, a Toyota managing officer.
With economies in Japan and the United States showing more signs of life, Toyota now expects to sell 6.41 million cars and trucks this year, 2.4 percent more than forecast in May. The stronger figures are part of Toyota's long-term strategy of capturing 15 percent of the global auto market, from about 10 percent now. 
Toyota, which has a market capitalization one-third larger than America's Big Three automakers combined, raised its earnings targets for the first half of Japan's fiscal year, but left its full-year forecasts unchanged. Though the company still expects to notch record profit for the fourth straight year, analysts are more skeptical, given the yen's continued strength.
"Compounded with the changes in the currency, it will be hard to repeat last year's performance," said Steve Usher, an auto analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities in Tokyo. "But Toyota is doing a reasonable and balanced job with growth in Japan, the U.S. and Europe."
In addition to selling more cars overseas, Toyota has increased the proportion of automobiles it produces outside Japan. This reduces some of the risks associated with moves in the foreign exchange market and lowers the cost of making and transporting vehicles. Moody's said this geographic diversity was one reason it raised Toyota's long-term credit rating to Aaa.
Also favoring its credit standing: cash. Toyota is sitting on more than 5 trillion yen, or $42 billion, in cash and securities, earning it the moniker "Toyota Bank." The capital allows the company more freedom to invest in new factories, fuel cell cars and other areas.
Toyota also has an increasingly diverse lineup of cars. Its Sienna minivan and Corolla compact car have sold well in the United States, where sales of those models rose 35 percent in the quarter to June. Toyota's sport utility vehicles, including the Highlander and 4Runner, have also sold well.
Toyota set a sales record for July, selling 169,600 cars in North America, a 4.5 percent increase.
Toyota, however, spent $970 a car on incentives in the United States to lure buyers during the quarter, Mr. Suzuki said, citing reports compiled by Autodata. While the incentives cost almost double the amount spent previously, they cost far less than what General Motors and other American makers spent.
The biggest danger for Toyota, as well as for Japan's other automakers, is a slowdown in the United States market and a rapid decline in the dollar. Both risks appear remote at the moment, according to analysts. Nissan and Mazda are introducing more new models, they say, but Toyota will continue to perform well because it does the best job of reducing costs in every part of its business.
"Are they growing as fast as some of their competitors? No," said Kurt Sanger, an analyst at ING Securities in Tokyo. "But Toyota is the most consistently managed auto company in Japan. They may be plain vanilla, but each corner of their business is bulletproof."

HEADLINE: Off the Fast Track, the Simple Joys of a Summer Job 

BYLINE:  By SARA RIMER

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
For Jessica Phillips-Patrick, the summer internship grind began after she graduated from high school in Bethesda, Md., when she landed a position with a biotechnology company working on the human genome project. She had the same internship the next summer, after her freshman year at Stanford University. The following year, having decided she liked economics more than biology, she got an internship at the Federal Reserve Board.
 This summer the logical internship might have been with an investment banking firm, where many of her fellow juniors are putting in 12-hour days in hopes of being rewarded with a job upon graduation. 
Ms. Phillips-Patrick decided, however, to take a break from all that. Instead of a high-powered internship this summer, she is mixing strawberry daiquiris and pina coladas behind the bar at Fire and Ice in Harvard Square. She says she is doing something she has not had enough of in recent summers: having fun. And the money is not bad. A recent four-day stretch brought in $350 in tips. 
After spending their summers accumulating the experiences deemed necessary for admission to the right college or graduate school or for an early jump on a career, Ms. Phillips-Patrick and some of her peers are mounting a rebellion. They are getting off the resume-building track this summer.
To Ms. Phillips-Patrick, who made flash cards to help her memorize the drink recipes, bartending is downright exotic. "Instead of sitting at a desk, you get to talk to different people and mix drinks and make a huge vat of strawberry puree in the back and organize a walk-in closet with all the beers," she said as she soaked up the sun in Harvard Yard on an afternoon off.
She and her Stanford roommate, Julie Fitzgerald, a veteran of internships with the United Nations and a refugee resettlement house, both decided to be waitresses this summer.
"We're tired of doing things for the resume or doing things that aren't fun because we're supposed to," Ms. Fitzgerald said. For her the pattern began in high school, she said, when she felt she had to belong to the right clubs and take up the right sports to get into the right college.
These are the organization kids, as David Brooks, the author of "Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There," calls them, describing their sleep-deprived, goal-oriented, resume-building lives. College, he says, is just one step on the continual stairway of advancement.
"These kids take these high-powered internships in part because they know all spring their fellow students are going to ask them: 'What are you doing this summer?' and they're terrified of saying, 'I'm going to be a camp counselor,' " said Mr. Brooks, who will begin writing a column for the Op-Ed page of The New York Times in September. "It's a sign you're not a success." (Mr. Brooks, 41, was a camp counselor during his undergraduate years at the University of Chicago.)
Ms. Phillips-Patrick's mother, Martha, an independent college counselor, said she knew of a senior at a Midwestern college who felt compelled to ask her uncle, a psychologist, whether it was all right for her to be a camp counselor this summer. The young woman feared that she should be lining up a more impressive-sounding internship.
"He told her, 'Do what makes you happy,' " Martha Phillips-Patrick said. So the young woman went boldly off to camp.
Michael Newton, a senior at Dartmouth, has also decided to do what makes him happy. Instead of taking an internship at, say, Goldman Sachs in Manhattan, he is in Seattle, working at a nonprofit organization that runs a needle exchange for heroin users and spending his free time hiking and mountain biking.
"The internship game has, in essence, become so competitive and unrewarding that many people are just not playing anymore," Mr. Newton, 21, wrote in an e-mail message.
While many internships offer valuable enrichment and opportunities for a close-up look at professions students may be considering, others sound more exciting on paper than they are in reality.
"I went into all these jobs thinking I'd be doing incredible stuff, going to meetings with legislators, participating in lobbying visits," said JesseEvans, a recent Stanford graduate who has spent the last three summers as an intern working on environmental and gay and lesbian causes. "Instead I color-coded files."
This summer, Mr. Evans, 22, who plans to return to Stanford for a master's degree in cultural and social anthropology, is working as a waiter at an Italian restaurant in Silver Spring, Md. He is learning a lot, he says. "You don't just need to learn to hobnob with political elites in Washington and the pretentious people in the organizations," he said. "You need to deal with regular old people."
He can also use the $10 to $15 an hour he is earning. Mr. Evans, whose mother manages a health food store in Arizona, said he had to take out extra loans to afford his internships, which were either unpaid or offered minimal pay.
While the conventional wisdom among Mr. Evans's peers is that a summer job as a waiter, a bartender or a camp counselor is not something to put on a resume, William R. Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions at Harvard, takes the opposite view.
"I actually think there are employers out there and graduate school admissions people who would appreciate the candor and the honesty and, frankly, the imagination that one would demonstrate by doing these kinds of things," said Mr. Fitzsimmons, 59, who spent his own summers as a Harvard undergraduate working in his father's convenience store and gas station, and as a recreational counselor. "I can't tell you how many very good college essays I've read from students who said they've worked during the summers at a fast-food place, and have had quite insightful things to say about the experience, and the range of people they've met."
Determined to get off the traditional summer internship grid, Patrick Thronson, a Harvard senior, is earning $6.50 an hour at the Hole in the Wall bookstore at Wall Drugs, the sprawling roadside stop in Wall, S.D. He pays $20 a week for a room in a house with five other young men. With 150 other college students working at Wall Drugs, he said, "it's kind of like being a freshman at a small rural college in a really small town."
"I guess I thought I have the rest of my life to work on my resume," said Mr. Thronson, 21, a philosophy major from Salt Lake City. "I won't necessarily have the chance to do this again."
Elizabeth Ferlic, who just graduated from Duke University in pre-med studies, spent the last two summers working at a hospital in her hometown, Omaha. She relished the work. But last summer, when she took an organic chemistry course at a local university, was exhausting.
As an antidote, she is spending this summer teaching windsurfing in Newport, R.I. "I was happy the minute I crossed the bridge into Newport," Ms. Ferlic said. "I bike 25 minutes to the beach every morning, teach windsurfing for eight hours, bike home, shower, nap and do the night life. I fall into bed at 2 or 3, get up at 8, and do it all over again."
In Manhattan, Katie Crawford, a Dartmouth senior, says she longs for a week at the beach. She says she loves her internship at the United Nations. But with two nights reserved for Law School Admissions Test classes, and other nights taken up with studying for the test, she does not have a lot of free time.
"I feel that sort of sensation -- it's the summer, I can't waste it, I have to do something with it," Ms. Crawford said. "Summer, where you're taking a break, doesn't really exist anymore. That was in middle school."

HEADLINE: What North Korea Wants 

BYLINE:  By David Kang; David Kang, professor of business and government at Dartmouth, is co-author of the forthcoming "Nuclear North Korea: A Debate on Engagement Strategies."

DATELINE: HANOVER, N.H. 

 BODY:
The news that North Korea has agreed to multilateral talks has been greeted with relief and hope from Moscow to Beijing to Washington. The United States has consistently insisted on multilateral talks with the North, while North Korea had been calling for talks only between the United States and North Korea. Now that North Korea has agreed to talks that will include Japan, China, Russia and South Korea, the Bush administration is focusing on the need to dismantle the North's nuclear-weapons program.
 However, the issue of multilateral versus bilateral talks is only peripheral to the nuclear crisis, and the prospect for resolving the yearlong standoff between the United States and North Korea remains dim. If the United States offers nothing but a demand that North Korea abandon its nuclear program, the meetings will be useless. If there is nothing to discuss, why even meet? 
 For almost a year, American policy has been to offer minimal concessions to the North and continue to demand the scrapping of its nuclear program. This policy has only increased the tension -- and continuing it is unlikely to reduce tension regardless of how many other countries there are at the meetings.
Furthermore, it does not matter how many countries are at the negotiating table, because the conflict is primarily between the United States and North Korea. What matters are the policies of these two countries, and whether they are willing to negotiate. If the United States and North Korea do not resolve their differences, the presence of China -- or Russia, South Korea or Japan -- will not lead to a different outcome.
In recent weeks there have been indications from the administration that it may be willing to make some kind of offer. In a small but encouraging sign, one administration official said the United States was "prepared to look at a process that addresses North Korea's concerns."
North Korea clearly does not wish to go nuclear: if it wanted to, it would have done so long ago. North Korea has consistently maintained that its foremost desire in return for scrapping its nuclear program is a security guarantee from the United States.
This is the key issue: whether North Korea has genuine security concerns. If it does not, and is using the nuclear issue only as a form of blackmail or extortion, then it will be relatively easy to call its bluff. The United States can simply agree not to attack North Korea if it will agree to dismantle its nuclear-weapons program. 
If North Korea actually means what it says, then a resolution of the crisis is fairly straightforward. Countries and leaders respond to the incentives and penalties. In the case of North Korea, being ordered to disarm creates the incentive not to disarm. If North Korea's leaders give in to pressure in this instance, who's to say they won't be pressured again?
For its part, the United States must decide on a coherent policy. Its current policy appears to be one of waiting and hoping that North Korea will either collapse or reform. Getting locked in a confrontation with an unpopular foreign leader may be emotionally satisfying and play well domestically, but it is a risky strategy to follow in international politics. American pressure almost guarantees that North Korea will respond with pressure of its own.
A policy of nonnegotiation is also risky in a strategic sense. First, it makes the United States essentially reactive in nature. Second, to not negotiate is to abjure incremental steps in favor of raising the stakes and hoping for the big win -- or loss.
The most likely outcomes of this strategy are all negative. It could result in a war that could cost millions of lives, many of them American, and place the United States and China against each other on the peninsula, as they were in 1950. 
Even if war does not occur and North Korea collapses, it will likely be chaotic, costly and violent. The major powers will most likely be drawn into more involvement on the peninsula. The least likely outcome from this policy is gradual North Korean economic and political reform and a reduction of tension.
 The North Korean regime is brutal and abhorrent, and everyone would like to see it disappear or at least modify its ways. The question is how best to achieve that goal. Current United States policy is essentially an absence of policy.
If the United States goes to the talks without anything to discuss, it will not matter whether they are multilateral or bilateral. More important than the structure of the talks is the substance of the negotiations.

HEADLINE: Piers as Parks Downtown 

 BODY:
Lower Manhattan's residents face a long period of reconstruction before the promise of a redesigned World Trade Center site becomes reality. In the meantime, there is something that can be done quickly and relatively inexpensively to reassure people who remain committed to the area, and that is to proceed expeditiously with the next downtown segment of the Hudson River Park.
 The park is a city-state project that will eventually stretch from the Battery to 59th Street, giving New Yorkers long-denied access to the waterfront. Recently completed sections near Greenwich Village offer an inviting mix of open space and gardens. Much the same can now be accomplished farther south in TriBeCa, where the plan calls for converting two ramshackle piers into splendid little parks that extend 1,000 feet into the river. Standing on the already rebuilt Greenwich Village piers is a bracing experience, much like being on the bow of a boat. The TriBeCa additions would provide yet more space for a growing crowd of pier lovers who come for sports or picnics, a place to read or simply sit and breathe. 
 The cost of redoing these piers would be about $70 million, a modest fraction of the $1.2 billion provided earlier by Washington to help revive the city. There are, of course, other claimants to that money, which the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation must figure out how to spend fairly and wisely. The city wants a chunk for the East River waterfront. There are cultural and transportation needs as well. There's a new wish list every week.
The decision may fall to Gov. George Pataki, who has considerable control over the corporation. That is a good sign for the future of the park; Mr. Pataki helped get it off the ground in the first place. It can now use another $70 million worth of his help in a neighborhood that richly deserves it.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
Leasing ofRetail Space Shows Signs of Softening

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
As the office and industrial markets have struggled with rising vacancies during the economic downturn, retail real estate has remained surprisingly stable. Vacancies in shopping centers increased after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, but only modestly.
 Lately, however, there have been indications that the retail leasing market is softening, despite some encouraging signs that an economic recovery may be under way, according to research managers at two national companies. 
 In a survey of 38 markets, Marcus & Millichap, which specializes in real estate investments, found that the vacancy rate for retail properties of 10,000 square feet or more edged up from 10.5 percent last year to 10.7 percent in the first half of this year. 
Zeroing in on one retail category, Reis Inc., a real estate research company in New York, said that at shopping malls with department-store anchors vacancies rose from 5.5 percent in the first quarter of this year to 5.7 percent in the second quarter.
The Reis data shows that the second-quarter vacancy rate at the malls actually represented an improvement over the period from the fourth quarter of 2001 through last year. But Tom Dwyer, Reis's manager of retail solutions, said that in the aftermath of Sept. 11, widespread fears that shopping malls might be targets for terrorists discouraged retail tenants from taking space. 
Mr. Dwyer said the recent trend was disquieting because it can probably no longer be attributed to anxiety over terrorism. "It's definitely something to watch," he said, "because retail has very much held together while the other major sectors have not had an easy time."
He said an adjustment was inevitable, given the rise in unemployment, the increase in consumer debt and the drop in consumer confidence. "I wouldn't be surprised if the vacancy rate continues to climb," he said.
The vacancies are occurring in smaller, older regional malls of about 400,000 to 800,000 square feet, which have been losing tenants to larger malls with a minimum of three anchor tenants, Mr. Dwyer said. The larger malls occupy 800,000 square feet or more and are intended to draw customers from a radius of up to 25 miles. "They seem to be doing just fine," he said.
Looking at shopping centers over all, Hessam Nadji, the managing director in charge of research at Marcus & Millichap, which has its headquarters in Encino, Calif., said he expected the retail vacancy rate to keep going up through the end of the year. "But then a correction should ensue," he said. "A lot of retailers have put their expansion plans on hold. They're waiting to see if the economic recovery is real."
The slight increase in vacancies has not affected rents, which are still increasing, although at a slower rate than that of a few years ago, both researchers said. 
Nor has it slowed the feverish investment market. Sales of retail properties are continuing to outpace other forms of real estate investment, said Robert White Jr., the president of Real Capital Analytics, a research company that tracks sizable real estate transactions.
"The retail market never experienced the same run-up in prices that offices did during the tech boom," Mr. White said. "Retail was shunned." He said many institutional investors found themselves with a disproportionate amount of office property in their portfolios.
Of the retail categories surveyed by Marcus & Millichap, the hardest hit were the power centers, with 250,000 to 600,000 square feet of space and three or more so-called big-box stores. Mr. Nadji said that during the last decade, this category was overbuilt. Vacancy rates are about 10 percent, an improvement over the late 1990's, he said.
At the same time, smaller shopping centers have lost tenants as supermarkets were unable to withstand competition from lower-price retailers, especially Wal-Mart, which now has free-standing supermarkets. Other space has emptied as chains like Kmart filed for bankruptcy protection and closed underperforming stores. But if the shopping center is up to date and well located, new tenants can usually be found, the researchers said.
Surveying strip malls, Reis found that the average vacancy rate during the second quarter was 6.8 percent, the lowest level since the last quarter of 2001. Retailers have continued to lease space, the report said, "while lenders and developers have exercised prudence in not flooding the market." So far this year, no new space has been added in 13 of the top 48 markets, the report said.
One landlord, Doron Valero, the president of Equity One, a publicly traded company based in North Miami Beach, Fla., that owns 180 neighborhood shopping centers in 12 Southeastern states, said his company had been able to replace about half a dozen supermarkets and two Kmart stores by dividing the space and leasing it to discount chains like Big Lots and Dollar Tree. The spaces remained empty for as long as a year, but Mr. Valero said he was able to charge his new tenants 50 cents to $1 more a square foot.
Some of these shopping center trends have influenced the investment market, said Richard W. Latella, a managing director at Cushman & Wakefield. He said that prices for strip malls with supermarkets had begun to moderate, while the value of prime malls and power centers in good locations was going up.
As developers continue to come up with new concepts and configurations for shopping centers, many people around the country are signaling a preference for shopping near their homes or offices. Mr. Nadji said that retail outlets in central business districts throughout the nation had suffered during the economic downturn but that downtown shopping areas can be expected to prosper in cities that have turned these neighborhoods into 24-hour communities.
One such city is Seattle, where, despite an unemployment rate of 7.2 percent, one of the highest in the country, retail vacancies in the central business district at the end of the second quarter stood at 3.7 percent, representing a 2.76 percentage point decline in vacancies since the second half of 2002. Asking rents in the first half of the year declined slightly, said Constance Wilde, a broker with CB Richard Ellis.
In downtown Minneapolis, by contrast, the retail vacancy rate in January was 13.4 percent, 2.4 percentage points greater than the previous January, said Kathleen Nye-Reiling, a managing principal of Colliers Towle Turley Martin Tucker, a real estate company based in St. Louis.
John J. Johannson, a senior vice president of the Welsh Companies, a real state company in the Twin Cities, said the Minneapolis central business district was not convenient and had stores like Saks that might be considered too expensive. He said the area was "an 8-to-5 workplace," adding, "While there's growing population downtown, it's not enough to support retail."

HEADLINE: Services Index Records a Broad Expansionin July 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Service industries, the largest part of the American economy, staged the broadest expansion in six years last month and orders surged, an industry report showed yesterday.
 The Institute for Supply Management said that its index for retailing, financial services and other nonmanufacturing companies unexpectedly rose to 65.1 in July, the highest since the survey began in July 1997. In June, the index jumped to 60.6. Readings above 50 indicate expansion. 
 Fourteen of 17 industries expanded in July, led by construction, farming, finance and banking, and retail. The surge in new orders and the second consecutive expansion in an employment measure suggests that hiring may be about to pick up, further helping growth. A report last week showed second-quarter gross domestic product grew at a 2.4 percent annual rate.
"It's a really good hint that by September or October employment will be taking off, because at some point these companies can't expand without more people," said Russell Sheldon, a senior economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns in Toronto.
For now, job cuts continue. Employers in July announced plans to cut 85,117 jobs, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., a Chicago-based placement firm.That ended a two-month run of declines in planned reductions.
Analysts expected the institute's index to decline to 58 last month.
"The service side of the economy is going gangbusters," said Brian Wesbury, chief economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson in Chicago. 
Some economists said the reading might overstate the strength of the recovery and cautioned that the report could be volatile and had only a six-year record.
When annual economic growth last exceeded 4 percent in 1999, the services index rose above 60 four times. Since the inception of the index, the index has averaged 56.1.
Since the end of the recession in November 2001, the services gauge has signaled expansion in 18 of the last 20 months. The services index is based on a survey of more than 370 nonmanufacturing companies.
New orders for nonmanufacturing companies rose to a record 66.9 from 57.5. The highest rates of order growth were reported in agriculture, communications, finance and banking, construction and utilities. No industries reported falling orders. Order backlogs rose to 54.5 from 51.5.
The employment index rose to 50.7 from 50.3. It was the first time jobs grew in consecutive months since before the recession began in March 2001.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
SBC to Offer Wi-Fi Accessat 6,000 Spots

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

 BODY:
SBC Communications is expected to announce today plans to provide wireless Internet access at 6,000 hotels, airports, convention centers, restaurants and other public locations. The initiative draws SBC into an intensifying competition with start-ups and other telecommunications giants looking to deploy wireless Internet "hot spots."
 SBC, which is based in San Antonio, says it will deploy its network over the next three years at locations mostly in its 13-state territory, which includes Texas, California, and Connecticut. Some service will be available by the end of the year, the company said, but SBC has not disclosed how much it will charge users for network access. 
 The entrance of SBC comes as little surprise to industry analysts, given the number of companies interested in deploying wireless access based on Wi-Fi, a radio-signal technology. In May, Verizon, the telecommunications company based in New York, announced that it would provide Wi-Fi access from phone booths around Manhattan.
Wireless access is also available in a growing number of restaurants, including Starbucks and McDonald's. The earliest entrants in the wireless access market have been smaller technology companies, like Wayport Inc. of Austin, Tex., which provides Internet access at airports.
As part of its announcement today, SBC said it had entered a partnership to offer access to Wayport-operated Wi-Fi areas in hotels and airports.
Charles Golvin, an analyst with Forrester Research, a market research firm, said SBC "is stepping in where others have done the same thing." He noted that Verizon had already made that move and that he expected BellSouth to follow suit. 
But Lydia Leong, an analyst with the Gartner Group, characterized the proposed SBC deployment as "a significant plan" because of its potentially broad scope in the SBC operating territory. "It's a relatively aggressive move," she said.
Brooks McCorcle, a vice president involved in Wi-Fi at SBC, said the company planned to deploy 20,000 Internet access areas in 6,000 locations, meaning some larger locations will have more than one connection point. Generally that is necessary because the Wi-Fi radio signal is not particularly strong; most users must be within 300 feet of a Wi-Fi area to connect to the Internet.
Ms. McCorcle declined to say how much of an investment SBC would be making in the network. She said the investment would be modest compared with technology investments the company usually makes.
She also declined to say how much the service would cost consumers, but said there should be a subscription service available by the end of the year.
Ms. McCorcle said the company intended to market the service first to business customers, who might want to check e-mail or browse the Internet while traveling or at conventions. She said SBC also hoped to persuade its broadband customers to spend a little more each month for access to the Wi-Fi network. 
Ms. Leong said that she did not expect the wireless network to be "a gigantic revenue driver in the near term." She said that SBC was laying the foundation to take advantage of the longer-term growth potential of that technology.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Fall Steeply in Reaction to Rising Interest Rates

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Investors, their enthusiasm damped by a turnaround in interest rates, sent stocks sharply lower yesterday, propelling the Dow Jones industrials down nearly 150 points in their worst day in two and a half months.
 Downbeat outlooks from Gillette and Costco Wholesale added to the market's gloom, but analysts said much of the selling was motivated by a growing realization that interest rates were again climbing. 
 "Portfolio managers have decided to back away; they have lost their nerve," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany. "They are asking: Will the rise in interest rates impact consumer spending and business spending? It may very well." 
Analysts also attributed the losses to the car bomb explosion outside the Marriott hotel in downtown Jakarta, Indonesia. The explosion, an apparent suicide attack, killed 13 people and wounded 149 -- including 2 Americans.
The Dow closed down 149.72 points, or 1.6 percent, at 9,036.32. It was the biggest one-day point loss since May 19, when the blue chips shed 185.58 points.
The broader market also had steep losses. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 40.56 points, or 2.4 percent, to 1,673.50. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 17.36 points, or 1.8 percent, to 965.46.
"It really has to do with the fear that a lot of people have that the rise in interest rates is going to be a detriment to economic momentum," said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
In economic news, the Institute for Supply Management reported that its nonmanufacturing index for July rose to 65.1 from 60.6 in June. Economists' forecast called for a reading of 56.0. A reading above 50 indicates growth in economic activity.
Costco dropped $6.90, or 18.7 percent, to $30.06, after cutting its earnings estimates for the rest of the year. The warning also hurt BJ's Wholesale Club, which fell $1.95, to $17.24.
Gillette declined 16 cents, to $30.21, after it said it was losing market share in the razor blade business to Schick and that could cut into 2003 and 2004 earnings. That news eclipsed second-quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations.
Cisco Systems declined 40 cents, to $18.86, ahead of fiscal fourth-quarter results. After the market closed, the company reported profits of 14 cents a share, missing Wall Street's forecast by a penny. Cisco fell 73 cents in the extended-hours trading session.

Cisco's Profit Climbs a Bit, But Sales Slowed in Quarter
Cisco Systems reported a higher profit but slightly lower revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter as it continued to weather the downturn in corporate technology spending.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
More Losers in Funds Seek Equity in Court

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
When Thomas P. Gallagher sold his shares in a sinking investment fund in January 2002, he thought that he was just cutting his losses in a fund punished by a broadly declining market. But when he saw a notice describing a class-action lawsuit against the fund's manager, he decided that something sinister might have taken place.
 Mr. Gallagher, 72, is now one of the lead plaintiffs in a suit against a closed-end fund -- whose shares can be sold only to the investment company at certain times, according to court documents -- and administered by Van Kampen Funds, an Illinois company. 
 The suit contends that the company did not use available market prices to determine the value of fund assets. By using its own estimates of the assets' worth, according to the suit, the company inflated the fund's value. This caused new customers to overpay for shares and inflicted losses on existing investors when the fund's managers eventually adjusted the value of investments downward, according to the suit. 
"Possibly, some investments just go sour," Mr. Gallagher said, recalling his thoughts when he sold his shares. From the lawyers filing the suit, though, he said, "I learned about the problems that Van Kampen was not making its customers aware of."
Lawsuits against investment funds, including mutual funds, have become more frequent, in part because so many people bought shares, and the decline in the stock market has as a result hurt many people, lawyers say. And of course, the quest by plaintiffs' lawyers for deep pockets continues. 
In 2002, investors sued 13 funds, up from 5 in 2001 and 2 the year before, according to NERA Economic Consulting. But those figures understate the total number of lawsuits, because some companies, like Merrill Lynch, have been the target of several complaints.
"There's a most unusual if not unique convergence of many, many more people in the market, seeing the market blow up in their faces," said Marianne K. Smythe, a partner at Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering in Washington and a former government regulator of the fund industry. "You're likely to get more lawsuits."
A spokeswoman for Van Kampen declined to comment on the suit against the company, which is based in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., outside Chicago. But in its court filings, Van Kampen argued that its valuation methods were fully disclosed to investors and that the market quotes for the senior bank loans its fund invested in were not readily available or reliable. The decline in the value of the fund was a result of the deterioration of the market over all, the company maintained.
Lawsuits against fund administrators like Van Kampen are moving through the courts even as Congress is considering changes to how funds are regulated. Critics of the fund industry worry that sellers of funds do not disclose enough information to potential investors to ensure that the purchasers do not buy funds with undesired -- and misunderstood -- characteristics.
Still, the companies that run mutual funds are not often sued; the 13 companies sued last year are a small fraction of the roughly 400 companies that manage funds. Yet this represents an increase from previous years and may portend more litigation in the future.
The small overall number of lawsuits is evidence, Ms. Smythe said, that the mutual fund industry is relatively well organized and well run.
"The mutual fund industry is very clean but it is inevitable that it is going to be sued more," she said, because so many people own shares. In the years after a market drop, she added, it is not surprising that there are more lawsuits; lawsuits against fund companies also proliferated in 1994, after the bottom of the recession of the early 90's.
What is surprising is that there are not more lawsuits, said Paul S. Stevens, a partner in the Washington office of Dechert, another law firm. One reason, he said, is that funds provide investors with some insulation from market volatility.
"If these statistics are representative, then it represents, all things considered, surprisingly little litigation," Mr. Stevens said. "It may be that people have actually fared better in the grinding bear market that we've had" by investing in funds rather than in the stock market directly, he added.
There are a few types of lawsuits that have been filed over the last couple of years. Some, like the Van Kampen suit, involve how fund investments are valued. Others contend that the brokers who sold funds to investors did not take into account the goals or the sophistication of these customers, who as a result bought funds that were riskier than they wanted.
Claims against brokers often must be submitted to arbitration, but those against fund companies often do not, lawyers said.
A third type of suit contends that fund companies had conflicts of interest in their investment choices: plaintiffs say that an investment bank's fund bought shares of companies that were praised by the same bank's research analysts, who in turn were promoting stocks to build investment banking business. These arguments suffered a serious setback last month when a federal judge in Manhattan threw out a lawsuit that tried to use them against Merrill Lynch. 
The class-action suit against Van Kampen, filed in federal court in Illinois nearly two years ago, has survived a motion seeking dismissal, and each side is gathering evidence. In a telephone interview, Mr. Gallagher said that he invested $35,000 in the Van Kampen Prime Rate Income Trust fund late in 1998 "because it was advertised as safe."
When the fund's value started to decline, he held on for a few years but eventually sold early in 2002, after losing about $6,000, or 17 percent, of his initial investment. 
"I wasn't going to ride it to the bottom," said Mr. Gallagher, who has lived in Bella Vista, Ark., since he retired from a job in Lincoln, Neb., in 1991. "As time goes on, my funds can only last so long."
Mr. Gallagher's claim rests on the assertion that managers of the Van Kampen fund did not use available market prices to determine the values of the bank loans in which the fund invested. Instead, the fund company calculated the assets' "fair market value," an estimate of what a sale of the assets might bring.
"They ignored market data," said Paul J. Geller, a lawyer at Cauley Geller Bowman & Rudman, one of the lead law firms representing plaintiffs in the suit against Van Kampen. Instead, Mr. Geller said, the fund managers valued the loans at close to their face value -- even when the borrowers were companies on the verge of bankruptcy. 
"The reason they did this, we allege, is because their management fees were based upon the value" of the assets held by the fund, he said. But as the market deteriorated, and after regulators voiced concerns about valuation methods used by funds, the fund administrators decided to adjust the value of the fund's assets downward, but gradually -- inflicting losses on investors who had already purchased shares in the fund and still resulting in overpayments by new investors, Mr. Geller said.
"They had a problem on their hands and they knew they had to revalue all their loans," he said.

HEADLINE: One Curriculum, Many Skeptics 

BYLINE:  By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
Exhaling a long, smoky sigh during a cigarette break in his weeklong training for the city's new school literacy curriculum, David Strahl did not seem particularly "invested."
 For starters, Mr. Strahl, an assistant principal at Franklin K. Lane High School in Brooklyn, learned only a few weeks earlier that his training would interrupt a long-planned vacation. 
 Then, on his first day, he was sent to the wrong address.
As an administrator, it also fell to him to press teachers from his school to attend the classes. Of the five teachers he needs to begin using the curriculum for ninth graders in the fall, he succeeded in getting only two or three to commit to the training sessions, where some participants have been openly skeptical of the ambitious new approach. 
"I think the concern is, does the supposed success of this elsewhere mean it's going to work here?" Mr. Strahl said recently.
Key to the success of any educational overhaul is convincing educators of its value -- an intangible hurdle that the trainers refer to as investing, or "buying in." 
But as the city pushes ahead with plans to roll out new curriculums this fall, union opposition, bureaucratic mix-ups and New York irascibility -- some teachers ascribe an earnest naivete to the trainers, some of whom come from places like Rhode Island, Kentucky and Lackawanna, N.Y. -- have conspired to place the hearts and minds of some city educators out of reach.
Interviews over the last few weeks with more than two dozen teachers and administrators taking part in training sessions for the Ramp Up to Literacy program, which seeks to improve the reading abilities of sixth and ninth graders whose skills are at least two years behind, found that roughly half had doubts about its likelihood of success. The skeptics tended to be older, veteran educators, while younger and newer teachers were more likely to welcome the new curriculum.
To some newcomers, the grumbling from their more senior colleagues was disconcerting.
"Some older teachers were constantly raising their hands," said one newly hired English teacher, "arguing about policies of the Department of Education, attacking the trainers." 
The Ramp Up program is one aspect of a teaching model known as America's Choice that has become popular among advocates of school reform. A common concern is that the literacy program has yet to be tested in a school system as sprawling and troubled as New York's, although a few individual city schools have experimented with the overall teaching model.
"Some people have doubts," said Nina Pitton, a special-education literacy teacher at Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn. "They're worrying about how it's going to be implemented." She said she found the training excellent and believed that the program would succeed.
Darlene Morris, an English teacher at Walton High School in the Bronx, said she worried that teachers were not being given enough time to learn the curriculum and use it effectively. Each Ramp Up training session this summer lasts five days, as opposed to the 10 to 12 days that America's Choice contracts normally call for.
"We need more weeks of training," Ms. Morris said. "It's a lot to process, and I don't know if I'm going to be able to do it." 
The Ramp Up training is just one part of a broad array of curriculum changes, collectively called Children First, adopted by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein. Teacher training is also under way for the city's new standard curriculums in reading and math, as well as other programs.
But much is riding on the Ramp Up component, because an inability to read textbooks and classroom instructions is a key reason that many high school students drop out. To that extent, New York City's $4.5 million Ramp Up initiative is considered critical to the success of much of the rest of the new curriculum.
Ann Borthwick, who is overseeing the America's Choice program in New York, said she had seen no evidence of widespread discontent in the training sessions, which are expected to involve 1,400 teachers and administrators and continue until late August. She said daily session ratings given by participants were "very high," averaging above four on a scale of one to five.
She said that a few people had complained or raised concerns, and that some dissension was to be expected. "We've had a couple of groups where that has been an issue for a day or so," Ms. Borthwick said, "and we've gone in and tried to take care of that." 
The importance of teacher acceptance to the success of the school system overhaul, and the difficulties that school districts sometimes face in winning that acceptance, are well documented.
University of Pennsylvania researchers published a study last year that found that fewer than half of the teachers in a random sample fully applied what they had learned in America's Choice literacy workshops. Important elements of the curriculum were missing in 45 percent of the classrooms observed in the study. Another study by the same researchers linked student achievement directly to their teachers' adherence to the curriculum.
Neither study involved teachers in New York City, where America's Choice has encountered some major hurdles. 
The president of the teachers' union, Randi Weingarten, has come out against Ramp Up, and the city's preparations for the summer training sessions got off the ground late -- one high school administrator said he received a fax "at 5:39 p.m. on the last day of school" urging him to round up teachers to take part.
"The school system bit off much more than it could chew this year," Ms. Weingarten said, "and now they have a big problem trying to figure out how to get this implemented. 
"America's Choice gets spun positively by its promoters who sell it, and by some of the supervisors who bought it, but I've been to countless school meetings where teachers have complained that it's not useful to children."
The America's Choice model was created by the National Center on Education and the Economy, a Washington-based nonprofit organization that advocates standardizing teaching methods and measures of student performance. It has been adopted by more than 600 schools across the country.
In New York, teachers said they were being paid about $34 an hour to attend training sessions. But they complained that they learned of the training too late to change vacation plans, and that the whole exercise had a hurried feel.
Judy Codding, a co-founder of America's Choice, conceded, "The timing of the decision to implement the Ramp Up curriculum this fall was not the best for everyone.
"Certainly, the earlier you make the decision, the easier it is to pull it off," she said. "But we felt it was better to try to help kids now rather than put it off for another year."
Ms. Codding said she was perplexed by Ms. Weingarten's objections, and she defended the program as having a proven record.
"If we can get the teachers to open up enough, to initiate the program in their classrooms, they will be thrilled to see kids who haven't been succeeding succeed," she said.
The Ramp Up training sessions, whose instructors are mostly teachers from other school systems that use America's Choice, are intensive and involve lectures, role-playing and even homework. Charles Pincus, an English teacher at Intermediate School 72 on Staten Island, called it "the most in-depth program I have ever seen."
"I have bought into it," he said. "The program is outstanding. I do think that a lot of my colleagues are still stuck on the old paradigm of what a language arts teacher is. I can tell from their comments. This is much different from what many people are used to."
Reading a paperback during one of the breaks, an administrator from a Brooklyn high school who said he had been an educator for 32 years praised the program as "over all, very good," but raised concerns about the instructors. Like most other critics, he asked that his name not be used because he feared retribution.
"These instructors seem to be from Rhode Island, and there are some things they don't understand about New York City realities," he said. "We've raised questions, for instance, about the role of Regents exam preparations in the program, since the nuts and bolts of preparing for the Regents begin in the ninth grade. Well, there are no Regents in Rhode Island, so they really don't have much to say about that. That's a serious concern."
One instructor, Zinovia Canale, an English teacher in Newport, R.I., admitted that she knew little about the New York City schools. Nevertheless, she expressed confidence that the Ramp Up program would work in New York. "I know very little about the structure here," Ms. Canale said. "But I do believe that the kids are the same. There are just more of them here than in Rhode Island."

HEADLINE: In Most of the U.S., A House Is a Home ButNot a Bonanza 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

DATELINE: FORT WAYNE, Ind. 

 BODY:
On a tree-filled boulevard known as Doctors' Row, the four- and five-bedroom brick Tudor homes that are the jewels of this city's housing stock were selling for about $150,000 two decades ago. At the time, some homes in the nation's most desirable suburbs, like Brookline, Mass.; Sausalito, Calif.; and Great Neck, N.Y., cost the same.
 Over the last 20 years, however, the nation's housing market has been cleaved in two, and the break has helped create two very different economies in one country. 
 Homes in the areas that were already the most expensive -- California and the Boston-to-Washington corridor -- have often doubled or tripled in value, even after adjusting for inflation. The increases have created nest eggs for longtime owners and allowed them to borrow billions of dollars against their equity, financing new kitchens and college educations and keeping the current economic malaise from being far worse than it might have been. 
But while the boom has become the subject of daily conversations among the middle class and affluent in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, people in much of the country have little housing bounty to tap for home improvements, retirement or other needs. From Fort Wayne to Rochester to Salt Lake City, the prices of typical homes across most of the country's vast middle have risen just ahead of inflation -- and more slowly than incomes. The cost of homes in the most expensive cities is now about six times that in the least expensive, up from a ratio of three to one two decades ago. 
Here in Fort Wayne, the homes with elegant porticoes and broad lawns on Doctors' Row sell for about $300,000 today, roughly the same as they did in the early 80's, after being adjusted for inflation. 
Not a single house in Fort Wayne -- a small, manufacturing-heavy city halfway between Chicago and Detroit, with a jobless rate below the nation's -- has sold this year formore than $800,000, according to real estate industry data. That is roughly the average price of a two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan. 
"The real housing boom is fairly concentrated," said Mark M. Zandi, the chief economist of Economy .com, a research firm. "And at the moment, it is clearly keeping the economy afloat in those areas."
There is no such cushion throughout much of the nation's interior. Some economists argue that the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate cuts might have been more effective at ending the economic slowdown if the gains in house prices -- and the potential they create for consumer spending -- had been more broadly shared. 
Last year, Tom and Judy Auer sold the four-bedroom Fort Wayne house where they raised their three children for $107,900, or slightly less than the $34,000 they bought it for in 1974, after adjusting for inflation. Without a bonanza from the sale, the couple now live in a smaller house in Fort Wayne, relying on the pension from Mr. Auer's job as a hardware salesman at Sears, Roebuck and Social Security, which they began drawing early.
Marva and Bill Herx, on the other hand, left Fort Wayne in 1998 to move to the Philadelphia suburbs for his job. When they returned last year, they had made enough profit selling their Pennsylvania house -- for about 40 percent more than the purchase price -- that they were able to move into a house in Fort Wayne noticeably bigger than the one they had left.
"The home costs in Fort Wayne have stayed pretty much the same," said Ms. Herx, who is in her 50's. "In Philadelphia, we made a good profit in just four years."
The dynamic is reversed for younger adults, who are struggling to afford houses on the coasts while their counterparts elsewhere in the country are taking advantage of low mortgage rates to buy bigger, better homes than in the past.
"All my friends in Fort Wayne have houses. I think the biggest thing in the world I own is a cellphone," said Michael Korte, a 28-year-old Fort Wayne native who works for the City Council in New York and rents a two-bedroom apartment along with his sister, brother-in-law and nephew on the Lower East Side. "It blows my mind."
For $102,000, Brady Gerding, a high school classmate of Mr. Korte, recently bought 27 acres of land outside of the city where he and his wife will build a house. It will be the second house owned by Mr. Gerding, who, unlike Mr. Korte, did not graduate from college.
"You can still live like a king in Fort Wayne for $200,000," said Linda Duesler, who has been selling houses here since 1977. "And you can live pretty well for $100,000." 
Beyond determining many families' wealth and standard of living, the two-tier housing market has begun to create difficult questions for government officials trying to create policies that apply to the entire nation. For example, when designing pensions, it becomes very difficult to judge the ability of people to retire because their finances might be in much better shape than their income suggests.
Some top universities, meanwhile, recently announced that they would no longer consider the entire value of many homes when determining financial-aid awards. University officials had become concerned that the values exaggerated some households' abilities to pay tuition.
If the price boom in some cities is a result of a bubble, as some economists warn, many of the people who borrowed against their homes might come to regret it. If mortgage rates were to continue rising and prices on the coasts were to drop, many people could end up with loans they could not repay by selling their houses.
So far, however, the housing boom has been an important economic salve for the regional economies of the Northeast and California. 
In the San Jose, Calif., area, home to the slumping Silicon Valley, households have raised about $10,000 on average since the start of 2002 simply by taking additional equity out of their homes when refinancing a mortgage, according to Economy .com. In Boston and Washington, they have taken out about $4,000. In much of the Midwest, they have taken out less than $2,000.
In fact, households in the middle of the country that fall behind on mortgage bills cannot rescue themselves by dipping into their rising home equity and making up for a series of missed payments in one swoop. The states where home foreclosures have spiked most sharply since 2000 -- including Indiana, which tops the list -- are in the Midwest or Southeast. 
"The only reason that mortgage delinquencies aren't soaring in the entire country is that house prices are still rising," Mr. Zandi said.
The housing gulf stems in part from the relative open space and lack of building regulations away from the coasts that allow builders in Fort Wayne and elsewhere to put up new homes as soon as there is demand for them, and sometimes even before. Prices in Austin, Tex., and Las Vegas, two fast-growing areas, have risen only moderately, for example, as high-ceilinged houses with room-size closets have sprung up over the last decade.
The gulf is also a byproduct of trends that have drawn educated, highly skilled people to the coasts. The surge of global trade and the growth of finance, health care and other white-collar industries have led the Northeast's and West Coast's share of the nation's economy to grow to almost 45 percent, from 39 percent in 1980, according to Economy.com. High-earning workers have followed the jobs, and not even an economic downturn that has hit Wall Street and Silicon Valley particularly hard has reversed the trend.
"We are seeing a migration pattern of talented, creative people that we may never have seen before," said Richard Florida, a professor of economic development at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. "More and more people are demanding what's found in New York and Boston and San Francisco, and there's not enough space to accommodate them."
The executives at the Lincoln Financial Group, a money-management and insurance company, moved the company headquarters to Philadelphia after almost a century in Fort Wayne, in part to have an easy time recruiting talented employees, the executives said. But the workers who moved with the company were so vexed by the gap in housing prices that they began having dinner together, along with their spouses, to talk about strategies for buying in the Northeast. In the end, their main strategy consisted of making a lot of sacrifices, they said.
"I now have half the house and twice the mortgage," said Priscilla Brown, a vice president at Lincoln. "We just weren't quite prepared for the sticker shock."
Over the long term, house values tend to increase at roughly the same rate as incomes in any region, economists say. Because prices have outgained incomes on the coasts the last two decades, many analysts expect the housing gap to narrow eventually -- but they were saying the same a decade ago. 
"It takes generations for people to react to economic realities," said Patrick Lawler, chief economist at Office of Federal Housing Oversight, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage companies. "But it's remarkable that prices could have moved so differently over an extended period of time without more correction occurring."
It will begin to occur, real estate agents say, only when people decide that a mansion in Fort Wayne is more appealing than a small apartment in New York or San Francisco.

HEADLINE: In New York City, a Tourism Glass Half Full 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Lt. Jeff Chilton of the Coast Guard was wearing a midsummer tourist's uniform yesterday -- a sun visor and sunglasses. Never mind that every forecast said something about rain: he was 294 miles from home and on vacation in Times Square with his wife and 8-month-old daughter.
 Travel researchers say New York is benefiting from people like Lieutenant Chilton, who is based in Portsmouth, Va., who have headed to the city for the summer after putting aside concerns about airline safety, the economy and the weather. Statistics indicate that hotels are a bit fuller than they were last summer, but that they are charging lower rates for their rooms. 
 "This is great if you're coming to the city to stay in a hotel, not so great if you own the hotel," said Keith Yazmir, a spokesman for NYC & Company, the city's convention and visitors office.
Nationally, the summer of 2003 appears to be a rerun of last year, tourism specialists said. "The rest of the country is having at best a mediocre year, with things looking very much like they did last year," said Mark Lomanno, president of Smith Travel Research in Nashville. "New York has gone in fits and starts as well."
In June, the city's 69,000 hotel rooms were 79.8 percent occupied, compared with 77.3 percent in June 2002, according to figures compiled for NYC & Company. The June 2003 figures show that hotel occupancy is slightly higher than it was in the summer of 2001, before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks: the figure for June 2001 was 79 percent.
But 2001 was an off year even before the World Trade Center was destroyed and airline travel was halted for nearly two weeks. In June 2000 and again in September of that year, the city's hotels were 88.8 percent full.
Some hotel operators now refer to 2000 as "the good old days," 12 months that included the Year 2000 celebration and a Fourth of July weekend that featured Operation Sail, with its parade of tall ships. Hotels in New York reveled in an occupancy rate of 84.6 percent for the full year.
As for this year, June was the first month of 2003 in which the occupancy figures exceeded the comparable month of 2001 or 2002.
But the room rates hotels charged have been lower in month-to-month comparisons all year. In June, the average daily rate for a hotel was $182, down from $196 in June 2002 and $218 in June 2001.
"I think June and July were stronger than anybody thought," said Ira Drukier, an owner of the Mercer and Chambers Hotels downtown and the Elysee Hotel on the East Side.
NYC & Company does not yet have July hotel occupancy rate figures.
The drop in Manhattan's hotel business since 2000 has several causes: concern about terrorism, worries about the economy, and, at the beginning of 2003, uncertainty about the war in Iraq. Now, Mr. Yazmir said, "I think what we're seeing is pent-up demand being released and a little more optimism in terms of the economy."
Sean Hennessey, the director of the PricewaterhouseCoopers unit that follows the hotel industry, said the picture was complicated by changes in travelers' habits since the Sept. 11 attacks. Tourists are now making reservations closer to the time they arrive, he said.
Mr. Drukier said his bookings reflected that trend. "People make them a week in advance where they used to make them a month in advance," he said. "Everybody's very jittery. People wait to see if anything is going on. It can be a terrorist warning, it can be weather, it can be somebody getting mugged in the street. People are just jittery, so there's no strength in the commitment to come here." 
As would-be travelers shop for discounts, hotel owners fret about what consumers are paying for a room. "I'm down $20 from the good times in 2000," said John Fitzpatrick, the chief executive of a hotel chain with holdings in New York and Chicago. He added that the average daily rate at his hotels in New York was $175 in June.
Also affecting the hotel-occupancy picture is who is traveling. Businesses have sharply cut back expense-account travel in the last few years, a trend that analysts like Mr. Hennessey noted before the Sept. 11 attacks.
"The major cities like New York have the most expensive hotels," he said, "and right now the thing that's selling is cheap hotels, not expensive ones."
Cristyne L. Nicholas, the chief executive of NYC & Company, spoke of a 20 percent increase in family travel to New York in the last five years, in part because a number of moderate-price hotels have opened.
And there are more beds than ever because hotels that were planned during the boom of the late 1990's are nearing completion. Ms. Nicholas's agency expects nine hotels with about 1,750 rooms to open in 2003.
"Last year, the first three months of '02, New York benefited from a large amount of sympathy business," Mr. Hennessey said. "There was a one-time diversion of major meeting events to the New York market." But few conventions that switched to New York after the Sept. 11 attacks returned in 2003.

HEADLINE: The Jakarta Bombing 

 BODY:
Indonesia, hit yesterday by its second high- profile terrorist bombing in less than a year, is acquiring a reputation as a soft target for international terrorism. The country's oil, large Muslim population and strategic location are all contributing factors. But as important as anything are the cumulative effects of chronic misgovernment. 
 It isn't yet clear who is responsible for yesterday's car bombing of the Jakarta Marriott Hotel, which killed 10 to 15 people and injured about 150. Early indications, including the choice of an American-owned target, suggest that Al Qaeda or one of its local affiliates may be involved. Perhaps not coincidentally, two men from one of those affiliates, Jemaah Islamiyah, are now being tried for last year's bombings in Bali, which left more than 200 people dead, many of them Western tourists. 
 There is nothing inevitable about Indonesia, the country with the world's largest Muslim population, becoming a haven for terrorists. The characteristic forms of Islam in Indonesia are moderate and tolerant. The main motor of instability there is not religion but repression. 
President Megawati Sukarnoputri enjoys far more democratic legitimacy than her predecessors. Sadly, she has not so far used her authority to press for needed reforms. She is not doing nearly enough to subordinate the country's harsh and corrupt military to civilian control and promote the rule of law. Without this, victory over terrorism will be hard to achieve. The Bush administration is right to offer Jakarta help in the common struggle against terrorism. It must also insist, however, that civil liberties and democratic accountability not become the first victims of the Megawati government's enhanced antiterror campaign. 
Helping fight terror in Indonesia should not mean handing unchecked power to its already unaccountable army, which remains repressive more than five years after the fall of the Suharto dictatorship. Mrs. Megawati has wrongly indulged the military. She has allowed it to retain excessive influence over economic and political life, let high-ranking officers escape accountability for massacres in East Timor and unleashed a ruthless new campaign against separatists in the province of Aceh. Fighting terror effectively requires winning the cooperation of ordinary Indonesians, not further alienating them through military highhandedness.
Mrs. Megawati's failures do not excuse these or any acts of terrorism. Al Qaeda fanatics are fighting their own international jihad, which has little to do with democracy or Indonesian politics. But misgovernment has helped make Indonesia a soft target. Jakarta can best fight back by speeding its transformation into a more democratic society.

HEADLINE: Census Finds More Americans Flee Than Find California Dream 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5 

 BODY:
Though immigrants kept California's population rising in the latter half of the 1990's, for the first time more people left the state than moved in from other states, the Census Bureau says.
 Four reports being released on Wednesday offered the most comprehensive look so far at domestic migration in 2000. 
 Only New York, which lost 874,000 more residents to other states than it took in, had a bigger net decline than California, which lost 755,000. Illinois, New Jersey and Pennsylvania also lost more than they gained. 
The figures count only gains and losses between states. California had a big gain when foreign immigrants were counted.
The longtime retirement destination of Florida had the biggest net increase, with 607,000 more people coming in than leaving. Warm-weather states with fast-growing economies in the late 1990's rounded out the top five: Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada.
William Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution in Washington, said the California exodus could be a sign that residents were fed up with high housing prices and sprawl.
Analysts also noted that although the San Francisco Bay area's economy boomed in the late 1990's, Southern California's economy slumped.
The biggest destination for Californians was neighboring Nevada, where 199,000 settled.
"People are leaving urbanism and wanting to move where there is more space or more affordable housing," Mr. Frey said.
Over all, California drew about 1.4 million residents from other states from 1995 to 2000 but lost 2.2 million of its residents.
Spurred by immigration, however, the state population still rose 14 percent, or 4.1 million people, from 1990 to 2000 to nearly 33.9 million. Its foreign-born population rose by more than one-third to almost 8.9 million.
The state lost more residents than it gained for the first time since the government started keeping track of domestic migration statistics in 1940, a Census Bureau analyst, Jason Schachter said.
The trend may be in large part because of immigrants using California as a springboard to find work in other parts of the country, said Dowell Myers, a demographer at the University of Southern California.
The 2000 census showed Hispanic population growth in large cities as well as small towns and rural areas across the country, especially in the Midwest and South.
"California has been the recipient of much of the nation's immigration," Mr. Myers said. "The only way you can balance that is by exporting people out of state. These numbers should in no way be attributed as a setback to California."
The report was based on people's responses to the 2000 census long-form question, which asked if the respondent had lived in the same address five years earlier. Those who responded "no" were then asked to say from where they had moved.
Over all, of the 262 million people 5 and older in 2000, 120 million, or 45.9 percent, had moved in the previous five years. That is down slightly from the 46.7 percent of people in the 1990 census who moved.
Mr. Schachter said people in their 20's and early 30's are the most apt to move. Rates decline until retirement age, then increase especially after age 85, when many people either are moved to nursing homes or closer to family members.

HEADLINE: HISPANICS IN U.S. REPORT OPTIMISM 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO and JANET ELDER 

 BODY:
A new survey of the nation's Hispanics finds they are far more optimistic about life in the United States and their children's prospects than are non-Latinos, despite the fact that many are much poorer and many do not intend to gain the full benefits of citizenship.
 The New York Times/CBS News poll found that nearly 70 percent of foreign-born Hispanics say they identify more with the United States than with their country of origin. Still, many continue to send money to family members even though they rarely visit their home countries. 
 Sixty-four percent of Latinos said there was no specific instance when they felt discriminated against because of their ethnicity. Those who said they had had such an experience said it involved employment or a general sense of exclusion. 
The finding was in sharp contrast to that of the poll's non-Hispanic blacks. Seventy-three percent of them said they had experienced discrimination, while 25 percent said they had not.
Much of the optimism expressed by Latinos appears to be related to the fact that most, 57 percent, said they were immigrants. Just 39 percent said they were born in the United States, making it clear that the expectation of better economic circumstances for themselves and their children was inherent in their decision to uproot their lives and come to the United States.
Follow-up interviews with some respondents revealed the extent to which economic opportunities had fueled their decision to immigrate. Sixty-six percent of foreign-born Hispanics said they moved north looking for jobs and other opportunities, while only 9 percent said freedoms were an incentive and 6 percent said a search for a different culture or lifestyle encouraged them to come to the United States.
"In Mexico one can study and study but there's no good work when you finish school," said Sylvia Gonzalez, 39, a custodian in Denver who moved to Colorado from the Mexican state of Morelos. "Here we do the jobs that no one wants to do because we know the value of work. Here we understand that the person without a job is the person who does not have the will to work." 
Only 9 percent of Latinos said they thought immigrants coming to the United States took jobs away from American citizens, compared with 33 percent of non-Hispanics and 34 percent of non-Hispanic blacks. Eighty-two percent of Hispanics said immigrants took jobs Americans did not want. 
The Times and CBS News nationwide telephone poll of 3,082 adults included 1,074 Hispanics and was taken over a two-week period, July 13-27. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points overall and four percentage points for Hispanics. 
The poll was offered to respondents in Spanish and English. About half of the Latino respondents chose to have the poll conducted in Spanish. About a third of those who responded in Spanish said they did not speak any English.
People of Mexican origin account for about two-thirds of the nation's Hispanics, making immigration flows from Mexico and Mexico's economic situation strong factors in the fast-evolving Hispanic population, which has become the nation's largest minority group.
Smaller Latino communities link their backgrounds to Puerto Rico or El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Cuba and other countries.
Throughout the poll there were signs that Hispanics who were not born in the United States were even more optimistic than those who were born here. For instance, when asked if life for the next generation would be better or worse than life today, 64 percent of Hispanics born in the United States said it would be better, but 83 percent of foreign-born Hispanics said so.
"Part of the assimilation process is feeling stable enough to criticize the system," said Gregory Rodriguez, a Los Angeles-based senior fellow at the New America Foundation. "There is a sense of ascendancy in places with large numbers of Latinos, like Los Angeles, that is especially palpable among recent arrivals. Whether that's transformed into something real or not remains to be seen." 
Only 39 percent of non-Hispanics said they expected a better life for the next generation. In a question about the opportunities for Hispanics to get ahead versus those for other ethnic groups, majorities of Latinos -- both those born in the United States and those born elsewhere -- said the opportunities were largely the same.
But 29 percent of Latinos born here and 36 percent of those who are foreign-born said the opportunities for advancement were better for Hispanics than for other groups. A majority of Latinos, 60 percent, said it was still possible to start out poor in this country, work hard, and become rich, compared with 72 percent of non-Hispanics.
"Right now I think Hispanics are getting more attention than before, there are more Hispanics getting hired," said Gloria Guzman, 62, a retired cafeteria clerk in Monahans, Tex. "My daughter doesn't think there is prejudice and I think there is. My daughter married a white guy. She has not gone through a lot of those things, that's why my daughter doesn't think there's prejudice." 
Differences in responses about discrimination were also pronounced in respondents' dealings with the police. When dealing with the police on traffic violations or other minor offenses, 58 percent of Latinos said they thought they would most likely be treated the same as everyone else, 28 percent said they would be given a harder time than others and 7 percent said they would be treated better than most other people.
But for non-Hispanic blacks, encounters with law enforcement are far more negative. Forty-two percent said they would be treated the same as others, 55 percent said they would be treated worse and 2 percent said they would be treated better than most.
Hispanics said they believed the portrayal of the Hispanic experience by the media and in television shows was mostly accurate, but non-Hispanics disagreed. A majority, 64 percent, of Hispanics said the national media did an accurate job of reporting news about Hispanic issues. Non-Hispanics disagreed, with a plurality, 42 percent, saying the media were not reporting these issues accurately.
Language was important, however, in how Latinos said their experience was portrayed in the media.
Hispanics who mainly watch Spanish-language television and listen to Spanish language radio are more likely to say the news media do an accurate job of reporting Hispanic-related issues than those who get their news from English-speaking programming. 
Eight out of 10 Latinos who rely on Spanish programming said the news media were accurate in their reporting of Hispanic issues. Only 12 percent said the Spanish-language news media were not accurate. That was in sharp contrast to Latinos who rely on English-language programming, with almost half saying the news media were not accurate is discussing Hispanic issues.
Thirty-three percent of Latinos said they followed news and events in Latin America very closely and 26 percent said they followed Latin American affairs somewhat closely, higher figures than for non-Hispanics. 
"It's undercovered," Frank Termini, 57, a school psychologist in Ossining, N.Y., and one of the respondents, said in a follow-up interview. "And that applies to the countries of origin as well as to Hispanics here."
About half of Hispanics said most of what they watched on television or listened to on the radio was in English as were most of the books, magazines and newspapers they to read.
Latinos tend to be younger than non-Latinos and also poorer, the poll showed. Thirty-six percent of Hispanics said they were ages 18 to 29, compared with 20 percent of non-Hispanics and 27 percent of non-Hispanic blacks. Nearly half of Latinos had total family incomes of $30,000 a year or less, with 19 percent of Hispanics subsisting on less than $15,000 a year. Fewer than 1 in 10 Latinos had total household incomes of more than $75,000.
One of the most striking differences between Latinos and non-Latinos is related to citizenship ambitions. Only 23 percent of foreign-born Hispanics are Americans citizens, compared with 69 percent of foreign-born non-Hispanics. Thirty-six percent of Latinos said they had no plans to apply for citizenship, while just 7 percent of non-Hispanics said they would never attempt to become a citizen.
Those figures may have more to do with ability than aspiration, immigration experts said, since many Hispanics illegally in the country are not able to begin the naturalization process. 
Poll interviewers did not ask respondents whether they were in the country illegally. While estimates vary considerably, about 35 to 45 percent of foreign-born Hispanic adults in the United States are thought to be here illegally, or about 5 million people, said Roberto Suro, director of the Pew Hispanic Center in Washington.

How the Poll Was Conducted
This New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted from July 13 to July 27 with 3,082 adults throughout the United States. Of those, 1,074 identified themselves as of Hispanic origin or descent. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish.
The national Hispanic sample was drawn in three ways. First, based on all Times/CBS News polls since January 2001, every phone number that yielded a self-identified Hispanic respondent was called back for the new study. Second, every phone number that yielded a Spanish-speaking person from those same polls was also called back, even though in the original polls only English speakers were interviewed, as is standard practice among pollsters. Third, to supplement the sample, new phone numbers composed of random digits were called in exchanges around the country that contain 35 percent or more Hispanic residents, based on census data. 
Nationally, the non-Hispanic portion of the sample was composed of callbacks to phone numbers in all Times/CBS News polls since January 2001 where respondents had originally identified themselves as non-Hispanic.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age, education and native versus foreign born.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than two or three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For subgroups the margin of sampling error is larger: three points for non-Hispanic respondents and four points for Hispanic respondents. 
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in English versus Spanish wording of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 Sales made over the Internet will more than double to $229.9 billion and account for 10 percent of domestic retail sales in 2008 as more people use the Web for purchases, according to Forrester Research. About five million American households will make their first online purchases each year for the next five years, said Forrester, which is based in Cambridge, Mass. 
In 2008, 63 million American homes will be shopping on the Internet, it said. Companies like Amazon.com and eBay forecast continued growth as more people become comfortable with Internet shopping. Web sales will rise as more people buy groceries from companies like Safeway and the Peapod unit of Royal Ahold, and other fast-growing categories will include sporting goods and home goods, Forrester said. Domestic shoppers will spend almost $96 billion on Internet purchases this year, it said.

HEADLINE: Shaking Up the Neighbors 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan 

 BODY:
Shortly after the 25-member Governing Council was appointed in Iraq, the head of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, questioned the U.S.-appointed Council's legitimacy. "If this Council was elected," complained Mr. Moussa, "it would have gained much power and credibility."
 I love that quote. I love it, first of all, for its bold, gutsy, shameless, world-class hypocrisy. Mr. Moussa presides over an Arab League in which not one of the 22 member states has a leader elected in a free and fair election. On top of it, before the war, Mr. Moussa did all he could to shield Saddam Hussein from attack, although Saddam had never held a real election in his life. Yet, there was Mr. Moussa questioning the new U.S.-appointed Iraqi Council, which, even in its infant form, is already the most representative government Iraq has ever had. 
 But I also love Mr. Moussa's comment for its unintended revolutionary message: "power and credibility" come from governments that are freely "elected." If only that were the motto of the Arab League. Alas, it is not, but it might be one day, and that brings me to the core question of this column: What has been the Arab reaction to Iraq?
The short answer is: Shock, denial, fear and some stirrings of change. The shock comes from how easily the U.S.-British force smashed Saddam's regime. The denial is manifest in the absence of virtually any public discussion among Arab elites as to why Baghdad fell so easily and why such a terrible regime was indulged by the Arab world for so long.
"The most striking thing," one Arab diplomat remarked to me, "is that there are no debates going on in the Arab world. There is no W.M.D. debate. There is no debate about the atrocities and the mass graves. Even inside Iraq there doesn't seem to be much soul-searching, like there was in Germany after World War II. That is worrisome to me. People have to learn from the mistakes that were made, and there is no attempt at doing that."
The denial is closely related to the fears. Many Arab leaders and intellectuals seem to be torn between two fears about Iraq: fear that the U.S. will succeed in transforming Iraq into a constitutional, democratizing society, which would put pressure on every other Arab regime to change, and fear that the U.S. will fail and Iraq will collapse into ethnic violence that will suck in all the neighbors and look like Lebanon's civil war on steroids.
For now, though, a few governments are getting ahead of the curve, while most are still hiding behind it. Jordan's King Abdullah has been the most pro-active, pushing his conservative population down the path of economic reform, and is likely to begin experimenting soon with political reform as well.
Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah recently convened an unusual dialogue between Sunni and Shiite clerics in Saudi Arabia to head off tensions that could flow from Iraq's being ruled by its Shiite majority for the first time in its history. Fears that a democratically elected Shiite-led government in Iraq could stir downtrodden Shiite minorities around the Arab world to demand more power are rife among the dominant Sunni Muslims. Many Sunni Muslims look down on the Shiites as inferior. Think how Southern whites would feel if a black had been elected governor of Mississippi in 1920, and you'll have a taste of how uneasy the Sunnis are about a Shiite-led government in Iraq.
While Saudi Arabia is introducing more reforms at home than generally thought, too often it is one step forward, one step back. Just the other day another moderate Saudi columnist, Hussein Shobokshi, was sacked under government pressure. According to The A.P., Mr. Shobokshi had recently written a column imagining a Saudi Arabia where his daughter could drive and he could vote. Egypt remains totally gridlocked on reform, while the Syrian regime is going totally the wrong way, tightening its grip at home and pushing out all the freethinkers in Lebanon's cabinet.
As long as it is not clear how Iraq is going to come out, Arab regimes can practice denial. But if there is a decent government elected in Baghdad in two years, it will be as easy to ignore as a 10.0 earthquake. I think Abdul Rahman al-Rashid, the editor of London's Asharq al-Awsat newspaper, got it right when he remarked to me of the U.S. invasion of Iraq: "It is a mix between Napoleon's invasion of Egypt and the 1967 war. There is the shock of defeat like '67 and the introduction of new thinking in the region like Napoleon. I can't predict how it will all come out, but for some reason I think it will be positive."

HEADLINE: Rescue Its Economy 

BYLINE:  By Michael O'Hanlon and Mike Mochizuki; Michael O'Hanlon and Mike Mochizuki are authors of "Crisis on the Korean Peninsula: How to Deal with a Nuclear North Korea."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Now that the United States and North Korea have finally agreed to talk, the issue is what to talk about. A priority of the Bush administration, as well as its predecessors, has long been the dismantling of the North's nuclear-weapons program. This goal is realistic, but only if the United States is prepared to engage North Korea on a wide range of issues -- especially its failed economy.
 The structure of the talks -- scheduled for next month, they will include China, Russia, South Korea and Japan -- ensures that the major regional players will be able to emphasize to Pyongyang that its nuclear weapons program must first be frozen and then dismantled entirely. Unfortunately, North Korea probably won't listen to a proposal that requires it to make all the initial concessions. It already had something close to the deal Mr. Bush is now proposing under President Bill Clinton -- but then Pyongyang willfully ignored it and began a secret nuclear program in the late 1990's. 
 If anything, North Korea now thinks it needs nuclear weapons even more than before to ensure its own security, given President Bush's overthrow of Saddam Hussein, his doctrine of military pre-emption and his statement that North Korea is part of an "axis of evil." And Washington's vague promises to eventually discuss better diplomatic and economic ties are unlikely to sway North Korean leaders.
Mr. Bush is right that appeasement doesn't pay, and that the United States should not bribe North Korea to return to a nuclear deal they already violated. Unfortunately, that probably leaves the situation at a standoff, since North Korea won't accept the administration's terms.
What to do under these circumstances? As Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld says, if you have an unsolvable problem, enlarge it. The United States should demand much more of North Korea -- and offer more as well.
The key is to recognize that a core cause of the crisis is the North's economy, which has shrunk by half in the past 15 years. Only a plan that begins to repair that economy can resolve this nuclear crisis and prevent future ones.
This approach would not mean giving in to blackmail. The United States, South Korea, Japan, China and Russia would force North Korea to reshape its economy and modify its oppressive form of governance as a condition for assistance. It would amount to regime change -- but regime change without war.
The cornerstone of this plan would be deep cuts in North Korean conventional military forces together with major economic reforms. Conventional forces don't get the headlines, but they gobble up most of North Korea's military budget and perhaps 20 percent of its total gross domestic product. A treaty mandating 50 percent cuts in heavy weaponry for both Koreas would be relatively straightforward to negotiate and verify. It would also be perfectly consistent with American and South Korean security interests.
Just as inVietnam and China, the economic reforms would begin in certain special economic zones. In these areas, entrepreneurial activity would be encouraged, foreign investment facilitated, infrastructure improved and most existing Communist laws lifted. North Korea has tried to establish such zones, but the tensions on the peninsula have discouraged any serious outside investment.
Each country involved in the talks would play an important role. China would provide advice on how to promote entrepreneurial activity within a command economy. The United States would relax trade sanctions, promising to lift them formally if North Korea kept to its commitments over several years. Japan, South Korea, China, America and any other interested parties would help to build the needed infrastructure; aid totaling about $2 billion a year could be needed, above and beyond assistance provided in the form of food and energy. To avoid misuse, most of the aid would not be in the form of cash, and it would be provided year by year only to the extent that North Korea verifiably upheld its end of the bargain.
The plan would then expand geographically and broaden its scope to include agricultural, public health and education programs. A decade or more could be needed to make this work. But if pursued seriously, it could reap major rewards -- possibly doubling G.D.P., according to the Institute for International Economics.
Other demands would be placed on North Korea as well. It would have to eliminate chemical and biological weapons, stop producing and selling missiles, let all Japanese kidnapping victims and their families leave North Korea for good, stop counterfeiting and drug-running, and begin a human rights dialogue with the outside world akin to what China has accepted in recent years. The United States would also promise not to attack North Korea and to establish diplomatic ties.
All these elements would not need to be in an initial agreement with North Korea. But they should all be on the table immediately. By offering the North's leaders a vision for an alternative future, the United States and its allies may be able to dissuade them from their self-destructive path. And a broader agenda for diplomacy has the best chance of getting North Korea to consider what it has so far refused to do: giving up its nuclear weapons capacity.
North Korea may very well say no to this kind of proposal. But in that event, having given diplomacy a serious try, the United States will be in a better position to argue to South Korea, Japan, China and Russia that much sterner measures are needed -- including economic sanctions and perhaps even military force. And if North Korea confronts a unified coalition making firm demands while also offering concrete inducements to reform, it will probably recognize it has no real choice but to say yes.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
As Mayor Misspeaks, City Runs To the Bank

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
For a Republican mayor looking to restore his credentials as a fiscal conservative, it was a politically perfect thought: Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced last week that he was "reasonably confident" he would be able to repeal three of the major tax increases imposed on city residents this year.
 But in his effort to address the suffering of tax-weary New Yorkers, Mr. Bloomberg has ignited a round of speculation about forthcoming city tax cuts that even his own top aides now acknowledge will most likely never happen. 
 "There is no talk of repeal," William T. Cunningham, Mr. Bloomberg's communications director, said yesterday of the possibility of rolling back the entire 18.5 percent increase in the city's property tax, which is worth $1.7 billion annually. "It can't be done. It would devastate the city's budget." 
This whole affair is either a lesson in how an imprecise remark by a mayor can take on a life of its own, or an expression of how Mr. Bloomberg is now so eager to make a rebound in the polls that he is willing to engage in the kind of political bluster that has been largely absent so far in his administration.
The matter started last Thursday when Mr. Bloomberg, speaking before a state board that monitors city finances, declared that after 18 months of work by his administration and the City Council, New York now appears to be emerging from its worst fiscal crisis in at least a decade. The city will still have to combat future budget deficits, but not nearly as large as the one it just closed.
Given this progress, the mayor said that his administration hoped it could honor a pre-existing plan to roll back taxes that had just been raised. "We have increased the city's revenue by more than $2.7 billion, through a mixture of what I hope will be, and am reasonably confident will be, temporary increases in property, sales and personal income taxes," were the mayor's words.
But to anyone who has closely followed the budget process this year, that statement included a startling addition to the list of tax increases that he was calling temporary.
The sales tax increase on clothing items worth $110 or less is already set to expire by next June. And the increase in the income tax paid by the city's more affluent residents is also supposed to lapse quickly, starting next year. Those two tax increases were adopted with the legal requirement that they be phased out fully by 2007, saving city taxpayers about $600 million in 2006 alone. The rollbacks have been factored into budget projections for the next four years.
By adding the property tax to this list, however, Mr. Bloomberg suddenly turned a major tax repeal into a monumental one, as the property tax increase was the biggest piece of the formula that allowed the city to balance its budget this year.
For fiscal conservatives, this was just the kind of news they had been waiting to hear from Mr. Bloomberg, who promised during his election campaign not to increase taxes. 
"That is the platform the mayor ran on, that he wasn't going to raise taxes," Anthony P. Coles, who served as a deputy mayor during the Giuliani administration, said yesterday. "Better late than never."
But Forrest R. Taylor, chief of staff to City Council Speaker Gifford Miller, was one of many in and around City Hall who were left wondering just how Mr. Bloomberg could deliver on this offer. 
"Certainly no one enjoys raising taxes," Mr. Taylor said. "There may be a tangible political benefit by saying you want to reduce them. But ultimately the city's books have to balance."
Mr. Bloomberg and his spokesmen did not immediately stop the speculation about a possible property tax repeal. Its benefit was obvious: it would most likely help the mayor counter the wide perception, as recorded in polls, that he has been insensitive to the financial pain that the package of tax increases has given to families and struggling singles. That issue could become critical to the mayor's chance for re-election in 2005.
But promising what he would be hard-pressed to deliver could have political consequences, too. 
Mr. Cunningham finally said yesterday, when pressed, that the administration had put out the wrong message.
What the mayor should have said, Mr. Cunningham said, was that the administration would like to see the city's economy grow to the point where the property tax increase could be scaled back, and the overall tax burden on city residents reduced.
Mr. Cunningham added that the mayor should not have implied that the city intends to repeal the property tax increase entirely in the near future.
"It was the fault of those of us working on the statement," Mr. Cunningham said, adding in jest, "Print what we meant, not what we wrote." 
For the mayor, the script has already been modified. When he talks now about his tax cutting plans, he no longer refers to repealing the property tax increase. "Brighter economic days are just around the corner," Mr. Bloomberg said on Sunday, during his weekly radio address. "And hopefully, we will soon be able to start work on reducing people's tax burden."
Whether opponents will chalk the episode up to a verbal flub or an unfulfilled promise remains to be seen. "This is an August issue," Mr. Cunningham said, implying it will pass like the long, warm summer days.

HEADLINE: Democrats Largely Endorse Labor's Views 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 5 

 BODY:
All but one of the nine Democratic presidential candidates made extravagant bids for support from organized labor here tonight, calling for expanded health care coverage and some restrictions on free trade policies and denouncing the Bush administration for cutting funds to state governments.
 The candidates squabbled over how ambitious health care programs should be and how restricted trade policies should be. But for the most part, they largely endorsed the views held by organized labor as they appeared at a 90-minute forum sponsored by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. 
 Their appearance came as one of them, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, struggled to win the support necessary to gain the organization's endorsement, a critical aspect of his nomination strategy. Union leaders said today that his hope of achieving that continued to be distant, since it required him to win the support of locals representing two-thirds of the federation's 13.5 million members. 
Still, Mr. Gephardt, the former House minority leader, received a warm ovation as he reminded A.F.L.-C.I.O. leaders of his support of their positions in Congress and roared his denunciation of President Bush -- so loudly that Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, standing on Mr. Gephardt's right, visibly recoiled.
"This administration has declared war on the middle class in this country; 83,000 jobs have been lost a month," Mr. Gephardt said, adding, "He's got the worst record since Herbert Hoover. He has got to go so we can get jobs back."
The event tonight, before 2,000 people in a hall on the Navy Pier, which juts into the shores of Lake Michigan, was the latest in a blur of debates and forums that the candidates have attended. This one was hampered by a bulky format that made it difficult for the candidates to draw many contrasts among them.
On several occasions, Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, appeared frustrated as he challenged his opponents to promise, as he did, "as my first act in office" as president to repeal the Nafta deal with Mexico and Canada, which was passed under President Bill Clinton in 1993 and was strongly opposed by union leaders. Other candidates ignored Mr. Kucinich's entreaties as the debate moderator, Bob Edwards of National Public Radio, slid into the round of questions.
Still, even this format provided insights into the candidates and their strengths as they prepare for a shift to a fierce schedule after Labor Day.
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who has portrayed himself as the most centrist candidate, sought to stand out tonight as he refrained from offering unabashed endorsements of union positions.
At one point, the senator was booed when he said he would establish a pilot program to provide poor students with vouchers to attend private schools, a position strongly opposed by teacher unions.
"I'm going to speak the truth," Mr. Lieberman said. "I'm going say what I think is best for America regardless. This is an experiment. Try it for three to four years, limit it to poor children, don't take any money out of public school budgets."
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts had a second difficult night at a televised Democratic forum. As had occurred at a debate in South Carolina in May, he struggled with a hoarse, scratchy voice, a distraction from what his aides had hoped would be a commanding performance.
Mr. Kerry coughed and cleared his voice as he recited a detailed list of pay packages given to executives at corporations like Honeywell and Lucent. "My friends, that's trickle-down economics, and I believe every worker in America is tired of being trickled on by George W. Bush," he said.
Carol Moseley Braun, the former Illinois senator, attacked Mr. Bush for favoring the rich. "Greed has driven the economic policy of this administration," she said. The administration's approach to economics, she said, "does not work, has not worked, is not working."
The Rev. Al Sharpton of New York arrived late but offered a quick excxuse. "I had a nonunion cab driver," Mr. Sharpton said.
Mr. Kucinich and Mr. Gephardt were the most direct in professing their support for labor's goals. Mr. Gephardt noted that he had voted against Nafta in Congress and that others on stage -- among them, Mr. Kerry, Senator Bob Graham of Florida and Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont -- had supported the trade pact, even as they expressed reservations about that support in the course of a Democratic nomination process where labor plays a critical role.
"I appreciate the position that some take here, and I appreciate what they are saying," Mr. Gephardt said. "But I have just one thing to say to you: Check our records. Check out who was there when the fat was on the fire and we had to fight our own president."
Mr. Graham at one point seemed about to break with the orthodoxy of the evening on trade. "I know what I'm about to say may not be popular with everyone in this room," he said. "The fact is that the United States does not have a choice to become a protectionist nation."
But, Mr. Graham said, as president, he, too, would make sure that any trade pacts included provisions for "labor rights, human rights and environmental standards." 
The appeals for support went beyond the issues, with candidates invoking their personal backgrounds as they sought to bond themselves with the labor movement.
Looking out at the hall of workers, Mr. Edwards noted that his father was a mill worker, his brother is a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 553, and his mother is a retired member of the postal workers' union.
Mr. Gephardt noted that his mother, who died eight weeks ago, spent her life as a secretary and his father drove a milk truck. If elected, he vowed, "every day on every issue, I'm going to try to figure out how to take care of people like my parents."
On health care, Mr. Lieberman called for incremental changes to expand coverage, drawing a clear contrast with the ambitious program proposed by Mr. Gephardt. "If we try to do this all at once as much as some propose, we're going to spend our country as much into debt as George Bush's tax cuts," he said.
Mr. Kerry responded: "I believe that America deserves a bigger, bolder more realistic vision than the one that Joe just described to you." 
For his part, Dr. Dean warned about efforts by the administration to restrict the ability of union workers to organize. "What we have to do is let the American people understand that if you want a strong economy, the right to organize is important because you have to make sure middle-class people have enough money in their pockets," he said.

Car Bomb in Indonesia Kills at least 10
A sport utility vehicle packed with explosives blew up in Indonesia's capital, killing as many as 15 people and wounding nearly 150 in a Marriott hotel, a large restaurant and an office building. It was the most devastating attack on Indonesian soil since the twin blasts in Bali last October. There were no immediate claims of responsibility, but because all three buildings were frequented by Americans, Indonesia's vice president, Hamzah Haz, said the attack appeared to have been aimed at American interests. A1

Surprising Turn for Iranian
The grandson of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranian cleric who built his Islamic revolution on a platform of attacking all things American, said the overthrow of Saddam Hussein would allow long-awaited freedoms to flourish throughout the region, and if they did not, American intervention would be welcomed by most Iranians.

A Visit to Rebel-Held Monrovia
The commander of the West African peacekeeping force being sent to the Liberian capital crossed over to visit the rebel zone, which offered a different but still desperate landscape. The rebel-held side has no drugs or doctors but plenty of food and fuel, while theother side has little food or fuel, but sufficient medical care. A1

Bush Administration officials welcomed the arrival of Nigerian peacekeeping forces in Liberia but cautioned that conditions were not yet ready for American forces to follow suit and that the American military role, if it materialized, would be extremely limited. A8

Colombia Patrols May Resume
President Bush is expected to approve the resumption of anti-drug surveillance flights in Colombia that results in the forcible grounding or destruction of planes suspected of smuggling narcotics, officials said. A4

Hispanics Optimistic, Poll Finds
A new survey of the nation's Hispanics finds they are far more optimistic about life in the United States and the prospects for their children's future than are non-Latinos, despite being significantly poorer than other groups and less likely to ever gain the full benefits of citizenship. A1

Cutting Cancer Drug Payments
The Bush administration will soon propose significant cuts in Medicare payments for cancer drugs, based on new data suggesting that the government pays far more than the market price for such medicines, administration officials said. A1

Judge Faces Ethics Accusation
Environmentalists filed an ethics complaint against a judge who struck down a nationwide land conservation rule last month. The groups say the judge, Clarence A. Brimmer of Federal District Court in Wyoming, had $400,000 to $1.1 million invested in the oil and gas industry, which stands to benefit from his ruling. A11

HEADLINE: Sports of The Times; 
No Losing Sleep Over Losing Games

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

 BODY:
I LOVE my profession, I really do. But I am baffled by a persistent ambivalence in sports journalism when it comes to athletes and money. We acknowledge that sports is big business, but in our hearts, we seem to resent the business aspect of games that turn young athletes into multimillionaires. For the last three years, Alex Rodriguez of the Texas Rangers has been Exhibit A of our ambivalence. 
 In December 2000 Rodriguez, the best shortstop in baseball, left Seattle, where he had made his name, and signed as a free agent with the Texas Rangers for the largest contract in baseball history: 10 years, $252 million. The contract was much larger than any other Rodriguez was offered. 
 A-Rod was immediately blasted; phrases like "selling his soul" and words like "greed" were routinely used to describe the decision to accept a salary that would pay him more than five times more a season than what he was making in Seattle. This was an easy decision -- a decision most sports columnists I know, including me, would be compelled to make: five times more! But for the last three seasons the industry has derived some satisfaction watching A-Rod suffer losing season after losing season. 
 This explains the frenzy when Rodriguez told a reporter last week that if things did not change in the next two seasons, he would sit down with management and discuss options.
Before the Rangers opened a three-games series with the Yankees last night, Rodriguez was surrounded by reporters, who essentially wanted to know whether frustration had gotten the best of him. Did he regret his decision to become a multimillionaire with a bad club? Had he regretted his decision to chase the dollar? 
 "I think I made a very sound decision," he said. "I'm very proud of my decision; I think I'm the luckiest player in the major leagues to be playing under that contract that I have." A-Rod said he simply came along at a time when there was a "bump in the economy."
 "I was really a beneficiary of all the great things in the landscape in baseball," he said. "At the same time, it's been a challenge. I wish we were winning more. But that will come with time."
 What makes Rodriguez intriguing is that he represents a morality play, a living, walking parable. He is the quintessential modern-day athlete, the man who chooses money over loyalty. 
 But A-Rod does not look or sound unhappy to me. He sounds like someone who has adjusted very well to wealth and is not haunted by losing. 
 "We've played some good baseball the last two years; it's not like the frustration has been that bad," he said. "I have so many good things in my life to focus on than just saying, 'Well, we're losing, or this or that.' 
 "If we're losing with veteran players and there's no tomorrow, that frustration would be hard to overcome. When you're losing with young players knowing that in a couple years, hopefully, we can be in the position the Yankees are today, it gives me a sense of optimism and motivation to keep going."
 A-Rod has endured three years of losing: 89 losses in 2001, 90 losses last season. Last night the Yankees defeated Texas, 6-2, the Rangers' 64th loss. Meanwhile, his friend and fellow shortstop Derek Jeter has won four World Series. 
 But if Rodriguez stays the course and takes Texas to the World Series, this would be a significant accomplishment.
 "When I came here, we were in last place in a very tough division," he said of the American League West. "Our division is no joke." 
 Is there such a thing as enough money? Rodriguez said there was. He came from a low-income family; his mother worked two jobs, sometimes three.
 "Ten years ago it was too much money," he said. "I was a beneficiary of the economy. The stars aligned with the moon, I was at the right place at the right time. From where I grew up, the background that I have -- when I signed my first contract I thought that was all the money in the world. I still do." 
 The bottom line is that in two or three years if Texas is still struggling, A-Rod wants out. Two years is not that far away. This season is two months from being over -- and it has long been over for Texas. There must be an exceptional jump next season and a bigger jump to the playoffs after that. A-Rod essentially fired a fastball at management's head. 
 "We're just a hair away from turning this thing around," he said. "I think we're headed in the right direction. I just wanted to make sure that we keep going."
 "I'm an employee," Rodriguez added. "I want to follow these people and see where they go, and hopefully they'll go in the right direction."
 Win or lose, A-Rod already has.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
A new agency is born into a difficult marketplace.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
AT a time when start-up agencies confront an environment about as welcoming as the annual meeting of the Traditional Values Coalition would be to the cast of "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," a team of longtime Madison Avenue executives -- four of them former agency heads -- are opening a shop.
 The new agency, Brown Kelly O'Neill & Partners, based in New York, faces daunting odds. The struggling economy, coupled with merger mania in the advertising business, are hitting the industry particularly hard, producing a growing list of casualties like N. W. Ayer, D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, Earle Palmer Brown, Hampel/Stefanides, Harris Drury Cohen and, soon, Bates Worldwide. 
 Indeed, three partners in Brown Kelly O'Neill held senior posts at two New York agencies that closed: Biederman Kelly Krimstein & Partners and Warwick Baker O'Neill. 
"The last few years have been hard, which has caused a lot of agencies to go under," said Hasan Ramusevic, principal at Hasan & Company, a marketing management consulting company in Raleigh, N.C. "The year 2000 was such a high high that when conditions changed, it was a hard crash."
Still, Mr. Ramusevic said, this "might actually be an ideal time" for a start-up; after all, Fortune magazine was founded by Henry Luce during the Depression. As an example, Mr. Ramusevic cited the initial success of McGarry Bowen, a fledgling New York agency that has landed clients like Marriott International and Verizon Communications.
One reason Mr. Ramusevic gave for his optimism was gathering signs that the advertising economy "is springing back a bit," as evidenced by a growing number of searches by marketers for new agencies. He also cited "a trend for larger marketers to hire additional, smaller agencies for creative work or specialty projects beyond their big roster shops."
In fact, three of the initial clients of Brown Kelly O'Neill, which is opening with 18 employees and billings estimated at $11 million, fit that description. They are DuPont, for a new unit, DuPont Personal Protection, and the Tyvek line of construction, medical and packaging products; the McGraw-Hill Companies, for the Sweets construction information and services division, and the Sara Lee Corporation, for strategic and creative consulting on all its apparel, bakery and meat brands.
Bill Brown, chairman at Brown Kelly O'Neill, whose creation is expected to be announced formally today, acknowledged the challenges in starting an agency during troubled times.
"A loose analogy I'd offer is that when the stock market is down, that's sometimes the best opportunity to jump in," said Mr. Brown, who stepped down in May as chief executive at Mezzina/Brown in New York. 
Mr. Brown said he had recognized that his colleagues at Mezzina/Brown "deserved an opportunity to chart their own future," referring particularly to Mark Morrissey, chief operating officer, who was promoted to succeed him. At the same time, Mr. Brown said, he began meeting with his new partners to plan an agency that would "combine brand consulting, content creation and advertising services" like direct marketing and sales support.
In addition to Mr. Brown, who has retained a small equity stake in Mezzina/Brown, the other principals at Brown Kelly O'Neill are John Kelly, president and chief executive; Kevin O'Neill, chief creative officer; Rob Earl, partner and creative director; Kathy Gilbert, partner; and Gary Watson, chief service officer.
Mr. O'Neill also said he was aware of the potential difficulties ahead, but he offered a sanguine perspective.
"The unsettled economy creates two opportunities for us," Mr. O'Neill said. "It shakes loose clients, who get restless, and it shakes loose experienced talent."
Another of the agency's accounts, Burke Rehabilitation Hospital in White Plains, had been an assignment on which Mr. O'Neill worked at Warwick Baker O'Neill, where he was president and chief creative officer. Since that agency closed in July 2001, Mr. O'Neill has been consulting, he said, primarily with Sara Lee.
Biederman Kelly Krimstein, where Mr. Kelly had been president and chief executive, also closed in July 2001; since then, he has been a consultant. Ms. Gilbert also worked at Biederman Kelly Krimstein, as account services director, and after the agency closed she was a senior account director at Seiter & Miller Advertising in New York.
Mr. Earl and Mr. Watson accompanied Mr. Brown from Mezzina/Brown, where they had been, respectively, creative director for direct marketing creative services and client services director. Before that they operated a direct marketing agency, Watson Earl & Partners, which they sold to Mezzina/Brown.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE ATTACK; 
INDONESIA BOMBING KILLS AT LEAST 10 IN MIDDAY ATTACK

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Wednesday, Aug. 6 

 BODY:
A sport utility vehicle packed with explosives blew up here in Indonesia's capital early Tuesday afternoon, killing at least 10, and as many as 15, people and wounding nearly 150 in a Marriott hotel, a large restaurant and an office building. It was the most devastating attack on Indonesian soil since the twin blasts in Bali last October.
 There were no immediate claims of responsibility, but because all three buildings were frequented by Americans, Indonesia's vice president, Hamzah Haz, said the attack appeared to have been aimed at American interests. Page A10. 
 But the toll may be high among Indonesians. An American Embassy spokesman said here today that no Americans had been killed, though one had been treated for injuries and released and a second was still being treated at a local hospital but was not in critical condition. Local news media said this morning that of 15 dead counted at various hospitals, all but one was Indonesian. 
PT Rabobank Duta Indonesia, a bank that is majority-owned by Rabobank of the Netherlands, said the blast had killed Hans Winkelmolen, a Dutch citizen who had been its president until last Friday. 
Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim nation. The faith has traditionally been moderate here, but more radical pockets have taken root in recent years, first bringing separatist fighting, then terrorist attacks. Many have been linked to the group Jemaah Islamiyah, which has itself been linked to Al Qaeda. 
The explosion on Tuesday came two days before an Indonesian court was expected to announce a verdict in the first of a number of cases of men suspected to be members of Jemaah Islamiyah and accused of planning and carrying out the Bali attack, which killed 202 people, many of them Australian. At least one suspect has said the Bali attacks were meant to hurt "America and its allies because they are international terrorists." 
The White House strongly condemned the bombing Tuesday and said it would provide any assistance possible to Indonesia.
Prime Minister John Howard told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that the attack "had all the hallmarks of Jemaah Islamiyah." 
The Jakarta government immediately said it would impose more stringent controls on its people. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the coordinating minister for political and security affairs, said aftera cabinet meeting, "Those who criticize about human rights being breached must understand that all the bombing victims are more important than any human rights issue." 
The explosion on Tuesday appeared to have been carefully planned and timed. Indonesian officials said the vehicle was apparently moving through the horseshoe-shaped driveway serving the buildings when it exploded, and they suggested that this pointed to a suicide bomber. The police said the vehicle was a Toyota Kijang, which can carry eight people in its three rows of seats. (It is slightly larger than the Toyota 4Runner sold in the United States.) The S.U.V. burned fiercely after the blast.
The explosion took place at lunchtime, devastating the hotel's Sailandra Restaurant, a popular gathering place for expatriates and wealthy Indonesians. It ripped a six-foot hole in the pavement, tearing open a ragged skylight for the hotel basement below. 
It seriously damaged the 33-floor Marriott's lower floors and blew in windows on its higher floors. John Wolf, a Marriott spokesman, said 273 guests were registered. Three guests and eight hotel employees were injured, he said. He added that while no Marriott employees had been killed, he did not know whether any guests were among the dead. 
The hotel, which opened just two years ago, had been a symbol of Indonesia's gradual recovery from the Asian financial crisis of 1997, which so devastated the economy that it remains under the supervision of the International Monetary Fund. The bombing is a serious blow to hopes of emerging from that supervision by the end of this year. The American Embassy held its last two July 4th parties at the hotel. 
The office building, which houses the offices of many American companies, was also damaged. 
This morning, more than 100 local residents watched silently, pointing at some of the worst gashes in the buildings' facades, while four long military trucks stood near the Marriott. Dozens of white-shirted police officers stood outside the yellow tape cordoning off the site. Investigators appeared slow to enter the site, perhaps because of the criticism Indonesia received after evidence was not preserved at the Bali scene. 
Six incinerated taxis still stood near the entrance to the driveway while two gray, soot-stained pieces of metal that appeared to be chunks of automotive body panels could be seen in the Marriott's blue-tiled swimming pool, located on a terrace 20 yards above street level and nearly 100 yards from the site of the blast. In an adjacent office building, workers on several floors were picking up glass that had gone scything across offices shortly before 1 o'clock on Tuesday afternoon. 
President Megawati Sukarnoputri visited the site within hours, but made no public statement. 
The first verdict in the Bali cases, involving the trial of Amrozi, a defendant who is accused of playing a central role in planning that attack, is to be handed down on Thursday. 
Abu Bakar Bashir, a 64-year-old cleric whom intelligence officials have described as leading Jemaah Islamiyah, is being tried separately for subversion, although he is not accused of direct involvement in the Bali attacks; he has denied that Jemaah Islamiyah exists.
The man believed to be Jemaah Islamiyah's top bombmaking expert, Fathur Rohman al-Ghozi, escaped from a jail in the Philippines last month. Another activist often described as the former operations chief of Jemaah Islamiyah, Riduan Isamuddin, also known as Hambali, has been the target of an international manhunt by law enforcement agencies since 2001. He isbelieved to be the link between Al Qaeda and the Indonesian group. 
Noel Choong, the southeast Asian regional manager of the International Maritime Bureau Piracy Reporting Center, said in an interview last week in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, that Jemaah Islamiyah was an especially hard group to counter because its very loose organization meant that even a handful of activists could decide to carry out an attack.
Indonesia has considerable oil and natural gas reserves and lies astride the main routes used by ships carrying oil from the Mideast to East Asian countries. It has been struggling to rebuild its tourism industry since the Bali bombings. 
The State Department renewed on June 12 its advice for Americans to defer all nonessential travel to Indonesia, citing the continued risk of terrorism as well as a stepped-up effort by the Indonesian military since May to suppress a secessionist movement in Aceh province, in the country's northwestern corner.

HEADLINE: Despair of the Jobless 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; William Safire is on vacation.; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The folks who put the voodoo back in economics keep telling us that prosperity is just around the corner. For the unemployed, that would mean more jobs. Are there more jobs just around the corner?
 This alleged economic upturn is not just a jobless recovery, it's a job loss recovery. The hemorrhaging of jobs in the aftermath of the recent "mild" recession is like nothing the U.S. has seen in more than half a century. Millions continue to look desperately for work, and millions more have given up in despair. 
 The stories have been rolling in for some time about the stresses and misfortunes that are inevitably associated with long-term joblessness: the bankruptcies, foreclosures and evictions, the dreams deferred, the mental difficulties -- anxiety, depression -- the excessive drinking and abuse of drugs, the family violence. There are few things more miserable than to need a job and be unable to find one.
How bad is it? The Economic Policy Institute in Washington reported last week that "since the business cycle expansion began in November 2001, payrolls have contracted by 1 million (1.2 million in the private sector), making this the weakest recovery in terms of employment since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking monthly data in 1939."
John A. Challenger, who runs the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said it is taking an average of 20 weeks for job seekers to find employment, and many are unable to match their previous salary. "Employers have all the cards," he said. "Not only are they sharpening their salary pencils, but the screening of candidates is probably the toughest it has ever been."
The official jobless rate, now 6.2 percent, does not come close to reflecting how grim the employment situation really is. The official rate refers only to those actively seeking work. It does not count the "discouraged" workers, who have looked for jobs within the last 12 months but have given up because of the lack of offers. Then there are the involuntary part-timers, who would like full-time jobs but cannot find them. And there are people who have had to settle for jobs that pay significantly less than jobs they once held.
When you combine the unemployed and the underemployed, you are talking about a percentage of the work force that is in double digits. That's an awful lot of lost purchasing power for a society that needs broad-based wage growth among its consumers to remain economically viable. Most Americans depend on their paychecks to get from one week to the next. If you cut off that paycheck, everything tends to go haywire.
Right now there is no plan, no strategy for turning this employment crisis around. There is not even a sense of urgency. At the end of July the Bush administration sent its secretaries of commerce, labor and treasury on a bus tour of Wisconsin and Minnesota to tell workers that better days are coming. But they offered no real remedies, and the president himself went on a monthlong vacation.
The simple truth is that the interests of the Bush administration's primary constituency, corporate America, do not coincide with the fundamental interests of workaday Americans. On the business side of this divide, increased profits are realized by showing the door to as many workers as possible, and squeezing the remainder to the bursting point. Productivity (based primarily on improvements in technology) is way up. Hiring, of course, is down. Part-time and temporary workers are in; full-time workers with benefits are out.
And then there's the ominous trend of sending higher-skilled jobs overseas to low-wage places like India and China, an upscale reprise of the sweatshop phenomenon that erased so many U.S. manufacturing jobs over the past quarter century.
Working Americans need jobs just to survive. But the Bush administration equates the national interest with corporate interests, and in that equation workers can only lose.
There are ways to spark the creation of good jobs on a large scale in the U.S. (I will explore some of them in a future column.) But that would require vision, a long-term financial investment and, most important, a commitment at the federal level to the idea that it is truly in the nation's interest to keep as many Americans as possible gainfully employed.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Regardless of the progress of a few, many nations still face economic despair.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and the journal Indicators, and he also teaches at Cooper Union and New School University. His new book is "Why Economies Grow," from Basic Books and the Century Foundation. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
THE fierce arguments over whether income inequality and poverty rates in the world have risen or fallen somewhat in recent decades dominate international economic policy discussions. But for many poor nations, they are almost beside the point. 
 Even if the optimists are right, a little less inequality and modest poverty reduction hardly matter in a world where 1.2 billion people live on less than what $1 a day will buy in America. And 2.8 billion live on less than $2. 
 Now comes more bad news. While some nations made considerable progress in the last decade or so -- and there is no gainsaying that globalization was often a help -- matters are actually worse for many nations and have more or less stagnated for a great swath of them. 
For many countries, the 1990's were years of despair, the recently released Human Development Report 2003 of the United Nations Development Program concludes. The report's value is that the United Nations agency takes a broader perspective than do other international groups, like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. 
Its finest achievement has been the Human Development Index, which has steered analysis of a nation's standard of living away from sole reliance on per capita gross domestic product to include measures of education and health. The agency has added other formal indexes to measure gender equality, gender empowerment and poverty. 
The latest report emphasizes goals established by the United Nations in its Millennium Declaration of 2000, which ideally are to be met by 2015. They include halving poverty and hunger rates and reducing child mortality by two-thirds. 
It's easy to scoff at this seeming idealism. But many similar goals have been met in the past, like eliminating smallpox and polio and immunizing most infants against major diseases. 
So how has the world done since 1990? 
Fifty-four countries are poorer, as measured by per capita G.D.P. Sub-Saharan Africa is worst off, with per-capita G.D.P. falling in 20 nations. It fell in 17 nations in Eastern Europe, 6 in Latin America, and 6 in East Asia and the Pacific.
The rate of hunger has increased in 21 nations. The proportion of children who die under the age of 5 has risen in 14 nations. The development index itself, which almost always rises over time, fell in 21 nations. In the 1980's, it declined in only four nations. 
Still, some countries, even poor ones, have done well by many measures. China and India stand out, of course. Ghana reduced its hunger rates greatly in the 1990's, and Vietnam's index rose significantly.
And some take solace in the fact that only 23 percent of the global population lives on less than $1 a day, compared with 30 percent in 1990. But most of this improvement has to do with the stunning economic progress in China, a nation that conspicuously did not follow Western economic policies. In absolute numbers, more people are now extremely poor than in 1990 if China is excluded. 
Even in countries that have made significant progress on average, including China, the report notes that there are often large pockets of deprivation, especially in inland or rural areas. For example, only three nations with adequate statistics narrowed the gap in child mortality between the rich and the poor in the 1990's. 
The bottom line is that at this rate, some crucial goals set for 2015 will not be met by many regions for several decades, and in some cases not until the next century. 
What has gone wrong? Aside from generally slow growth, the spread of AIDS has been a tragic setback, reducing longevity significantly in many African nations. The collapse of Soviet-style economies is still extracting a heavy price. In general, more open markets and deregulation did not turn out to be cure-alls. 
But much aid also seems to have gone to waste. In recent years, critics assert that good governance among recipients has been neglected too often. Corruption, lack of follow-through and cookie-cutter policies afflicted development projects. But surely the call for good governance is no panacea, either. For example, did dictatorial China have good governance and dictatorial Russia poor governance? How can one tell before the fact? How do you enforce good governance even if you can define it? 
More important, in my view, the West is beginning to recognize, if slowly, that it too bears some responsibility for the inferior performance of poor nations. For one thing, trade barriers keep out exports of agricultural goods, processed foods and beverages, apparel and textiles from poor nations trying to climb higher. 
But what is becoming increasingly clear is that advanced nations with highly educated populations and sophisticated technologies have an inherent advantage because they can exploit still more educated workers and newer technologies in ways that poorer nations cannot. And the gap between rich and poor keeps widening.
This gives advanced nations some responsibility in helping developing nations that are trapped because they cannot afford the public investment in transportation, education, health and agricultural techniques that would enable them to benefit from new capital, technologies and skilled labor. Spending what is needed on public investment by these governments often runs the risk of undermining market incentives for business with high taxes and inflationary deficit spending. 
In fact, the story of the West's own development is one of significant public investment in health, transportation and education. Fortunately, Western leaders are now promising more money. President Bush announced an increase in annual aid to 0.15 percent of national income by 2006. Belgium pledged 0.4 percent a year by 2010, France 0.5 percent by 2007 and Sweden 1 percent by 2006. 
As the money available increases, none of the other lessons about international aid should be lost. Money is never the only solution. But if Western nations find the will, odds are much higher they will find the way.

HEADLINE: U.S. Frees $54 Million in 9/11 Business Aid 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
Federal officials approved more than $54 million in aid yesterday that more than 2,200 small-business owners in Lower Manhattan had been waiting for -- often anxiously and angrily -- after a 9/11 recovery program ran out of money.
 The funds, made available by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, will allow the state to finally send out checks to the businesses, which had qualified for the aid after applying for it in the weeks before the deadline on Dec. 31. 
 "The money probably will start going out over the next few days," said Alex Dudley, a spokesman for the Empire State Development Corporation, the state agency that runs the federally financed program, the World Trade Center Business Recovery Grant Program. 
The program received applications during virtually all of 2002. But a large surge of applications swept in as the deadline neared, Mr. Dudley previously said, and when the last application was processed in late March, nearly 15,300 companies had been approved for a total of $535 million.
But the program had been financed at $481 million, enough to provide aid to only 13,700 qualified companies, Mr. Dudley said in May. There was no money left for about 1,600 qualified companies that applied to the program for the first time late last year, or for 600 companies that had previously received money and successfully applied in December for a second payment. 
Those 2,200 approved applications required $54.3 million more, the money that the federal housing agency made available yesterday. The federal agency had also supplied the original $481 million, part of the $3 billion that Congress had authorized it to provide to revitalize Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack, which destroyed the World Trade Center and sent the area's economy into a tailspin. 
Jeannine Chanes, counsel to From the Ground Up, a group representing many Lower Manhattan businesses, said the approval of the additional funds in Washington was welcome. But she added, "The fact that they had to wait this long to receive their grants is outrageous." Many of the waiting business owners have said in interviews in recent months that they badly needed the money to help stay afloat.
Spokesmen for the federal and state agencies involved said their agencies had moved swiftly to provide the additional $54.3 million. The wait, they said, had resulted from unavoidable problems in handling the late tide of applications and from the need to adhere to requirements in making the funds available. 
One requirement was that the Empire State Development Corporation could not apply directly to the federal housing agency for the funds but had to apply through another state agency, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, whose approval was also needed.
Under the program, businesses and nonprofit groups between 14th Street and the Battery with fewer than 500 employees were eligible for compensation for economic losses stemming from the terrorist attack. The amounts they could get depended on their losses and their proximity to the trade center site. 
As part of yesterday's package, the federal housing agency also approved state requests for more than $90 million to cover efforts like street and park upgrading, construction of a temporary pedestrian bridge over West Street and more effective and attractive security barriers around the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Pfizer Moves to Stem Canadian Drug Imports 

BYLINE:  By GARDINER HARRIS

 BODY:
Just days after the House of Representatives voted to legalize the import of cheap prescription drugs from Canada, Pfizer has moved to squelch the nascent trade at its source.
 The company confirmed yesterday that it had sent letters to 50 Canadian pharmacies that it believes are exporting to the United States, telling them that they would have to begin ordering their drugs directly from Pfizer, rather than from wholesalers. If Pfizer decides that the pharmacies are ordering more drugs than they need to meet Canadian demand, it will cut off or curtail shipments to them, the company said. 
 "We feel the need to take appropriate steps to be able to enforce our terms of sale with these customers, including a long-standing provision that these medicines not be exported from Canada," a Pfizer spokesman, Nehl Horton, said. 
The action by Pfizer, the world's biggest drug maker, follows similar moves by GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca and Wyeth, all of which have sought to stem the tide of cheap Canadian drugs into the United States. 
Last year, drug prices in the United States were 67 percent higher than in Canada, a report by a Canadian health agency found. As a result, cross-border prescription drug sales have soared to as much as $650 million a year, according to IMS Health, a company that tracks drug sales.
Asked about Pfizer's move, Billy Shawn, chief executive of the Canadian Drugstore Inc., an Internet pharmacy, said that it could lead to product shortages and price increases on his and other Web sites selling to Americans. "We're pretty resourceful at getting product, but if they really stick to this policy, it could affect our business in a big way," Mr. Shawn said.
The United States is the last industrialized country where drug manufacturers are allowed to set prices without government interference. The pharmaceutical industry earns half of its revenues and most of its profits in the United States -- profits that it says are essential to pay for drug research. 
Drug makers also argue that imported drugs can be dangerous, noting that neither American nor Canadian health authorities assure their quality. Indeed, the Food and Drug Administration has repeatedly cited the risks from imported drugs, and regulators in recent months have sought to shut down small stores springing up across the country that help Americans buy imported drugs. 
But the growing disparity between American and foreign drug prices has led to a surge of sentiment against the industry in Congress -- even among Republicans, who have been the recipients of most of the drug makers' campaign contributions. The industry has become the largest contributor to federal political campaigns, donating about $21 million to parties and candidates during the 2002 election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. 
The House passed legislation to allow drug imports on July 25. But the provision faces an uncertain future in a conference with the Senate that must also reconcile competing proposals for adding a drug benefit to Medicare. Fifty-three senators have signed a letter circulated by the drug industry saying that they oppose drug imports.
In Chicago today, Representative Gil Gutknecht, a Republican from Minnesota, and Representative Rahm Emanuel, a Democrat from Illinois, are holding what they say will be the first of many town-hall meetings to build support for the drug importation measure.
Mr. Emanuel's office last night released a letter from the AARP, which lobbies on behalf of older Americans, endorsing the concept of legal reimportation of prescription drugs from Canada. 
"That country is already the source of considerable de facto re-importation, and safety violations appear to be minimal in extent and insignificant in nature," William D. Novelli, the organization's chief executive, wrote in the letter to Mr. Emanuel and Mr. Gutknecht.
The steps by Pfizer and other drug makers to restrict sales of their drugs in Canada, however, could help safeguard the industry's profits even if the measure becomes law.
Drug companies have sophisticated means of controlling imports. Data-tracking companies keep close tabs on doctors' prescriptions, so companies are keenly aware of actual local demand in much of the industrialized world. The companies also closely track buying trends. When drug orders at a particular pharmacy spike in the absence of a similar jump in nearby doctors' prescriptions, executives investigate.
Drug wholesalers also help manufacturers track these trends. "Together with the manufacturers, we have worked to identify the pharmacies that have been shipping back illegally," said Larry Kurtz, a spokesman for the McKesson Corporation, one of the largest drug wholesalers in the United States and Canada.
A spokeswoman for GlaxoSmithKline, Nancy Pekarak, said her company began using similar measures against Canadian exporters in January. She said they were meant to ensure that drugs needed by Canadians were not diverted to the United States.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Demand for Bonds Gives Lift to Blue Chips

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue chips reversed earlier losses to close slightly higher yesterday, after a successful debt sale by the Treasury pushed bond yields down, cheering stock investors worried about higher interest rates.
 But technology stocks finished lower after earnings from an industry bellwether, Cisco Systems, failed to top Wall Street expectations. 
 Investors bid briskly for $18 billion of five-year Treasury notes auctioned yesterday afternoon. Treasury prices jumped after the sale, pushing down the yield of the benchmark 10-year note to 4.27 percent from 4.40 percent late Tuesday. 
Stocks rallied after the Treasury sale, though they ended off the day's highs. The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 25.42 points, or 0.28 percent, at 9,061.74, after trading in negative territory for most of the morning. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.62 points, or 0.17 percent, to 967.08. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index fell 20.82 points, or 1.24 percent, to end at 1,652.68.
Tom Schrader, managing director of United States equity trading at Legg Mason Wood Walker, attributed the rise in stocks to the Treasury auction, which went better than expected. "Lower interest rates are better for the stock market than higher rates," he said, "so stocks should rally on that."
Rising interest rates are bad for the stock market because companies and consumers face higher borrowing costs, which could stifle an economic rebound. Hopes for a recovery later this year have fed a rally in stocks since mid-March.
"Stocks have been very nervous about activity in the bond market," said John Caldwell, chief equity strategist at McDonald Financial. "In the last several weeks, we've seen a substantial rise in bond yields, and when there's shocks like that, you have to ask if that could start to choke off economic activity."
Strength in shares in the financial and housing sectors helped lift the blue-chip Dow and the broader S.& P. 500. Housing-related stocks shot higher after a report saying that Americans applied for mortgages to buy houses in near-record numbers last week, rushing to take advantage of mortgage rates that are still low but have surged over the last few weeks.
Home Depot's stock rose 3.16 percent, or 96 cents, to $31.32, and was the Dow's biggest percentage gainer.
The S.& P. homebuilding index jumped 4.5 percent.
Financial stocks rose after a series of bullish comments from brokerage firms on leaders in the industry. Merrill Lynch upgraded its rating on Lehman Brothers, while Smith Barney raised its earnings forecasts for Lehman and Morgan Stanley.
Lehman Brothers shares gained $1.85, or 3.04 percent, to $62.65. American Express, a Dow component, rose $1.10, or 2.59 percent, to $43.55. Both helped push the S.& P. financial index up 1.0 percent.
But Cisco Systems shares fell sharply a day after it delivered earnings that met, but failed to beat, Wall Street forecasts. Shares of Cisco, the world's largest maker of equipment that directs Internet traffic, fell $1.21, or 6.42 percent, to $17.65.
Cisco's drop weighed on other technology stocks, pulling the S.& P. communications equipment index down 3.82 percent. 
In the bond market, by late in the day, the price of the 10-year note gained 1 1/32, to 94 29/32.
The 30-year note jumped 1 26/32, to 102, as its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.24 percent from 5.36 percent on Tuesday.
Here are the results of yesterday's auction of five-year notes:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Price: 99.771
High Yield: 3.300%
Low Yield: 3.200%
Median Yield: 3.278%

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE ATTACK; 
Group Linked to Al Qaeda Seen Behind Jakarta Blast

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Aug. 6 

 BODY:
The terror attack at the J. W. Marriott Hotel that killed at least 16 people and wounded 150 on Tuesday was almost certainly the work of Jemaah Islamiyah, a group terror experts have linked closely to Al Qaeda, American officials said today. 
 Most of the senior members of Jemaah Islamiyah, including its top operations officer and its most skilled bomb makers, remain at large even though about 50 members of the group have been arrested since the attack on a Bali nightclub 10 months ago, they said. 
 The blast at the Marriott illustrated what had been known for months, the officials said: that Jemaah Islamiyah, a group intent on achieving an Islamic state in Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia, consisted of many independent cells, each with the capacity to mount attacks. Indonesia is the most populous Muslim country, and its sprawling archipelago with 220 million people provides near perfect cover for fugitives. 
The group's operations officer, known as Hambali, is among the "top echelon" of Qaeda members wanted by the United States, an American official said. The bomb experts, Dulmatin and Azahari Husin, who the Indonesian authorities have said made the bomb for the Bali explosion, have been the targets of searches by the Indonesian authorities for many months. 
Another bomb expert, Fathur Roman al-Ghozi, was allowed to escape from a Philippine jail last month, according to the Philippine government. 
A defendant in the Bali bombing trials and a suspected member of Jemaah Islamiyah, Amrozi, is to appear in a Bali court on Thursday to hear the verdict in his case. There was some speculation that the Marriott attack was timed as a warning to the government not to impose the death penalty, which Mr. Amrozi could face if convicted. 
Another defendant in the Bali attack, Imam Samudra, told reporters in Bali today that he was "happy" about the attack in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. 
The center of the city returned to a sense of normalcy today as Indonesian officials said they would impose new security measures at major hotels and businesses. But precisely what those measures would be was not immediately clear. 
The choice of the 33-story Marriott, the most visibly American building in the city, left little doubt about the intentions of the terrorists. 
"In 20-20 hindsight, the Marriott was an obvious choice," said Ken Conboy, who heads a security company, Risk Management Advisory. "It had a reputation as an American brand; it flaunted its American connection." 
Interrogations of Jemaah Islamiyah members who have been arrested showed that they tended to give considerable thought to their choice of targets and the aftereffects, Mr. Conboy said. 
The Marriott, which was often the site of American events, was considered to have some of the best security in the capital. Even so, the trunks and undercarriages of cars were not inspected before they drove up to the front door, and the floor-to-ceiling windows of the coffee shop that bore the brunt of the attack on Tuesday faced the driveway. Guests at a Fourth of July celebration at the Marriott this year had to leave their cars at the foot of the driveway and walk 100 yards to the hotel entrance. 
A Jakarta police spokesman, Prasetyo, said the Indonesian authorities had found information about a planned attack on the Marriott when the police raided a Jemaah Islamiyah hideout in Semarang in central Java last month. Nine suspected members of Jemaah Islamiyah were arrested in Jakarta and Semarang at or around the same time. 
But the United States ambassador, Ralph L. Boyce, dismissed the notion that there was prior knowledge. "We didn't have any information that the Marriott was targeted," he said today. 
Because of mounting information from Indonesian sources of possible new attacks by Jemaah Islamiyah, he said, the United States Embassy has been at a "very high state of alert" and warnings had been in place for Americans living in and visiting Indonesia. "Soft targets" where foreigners gathered -- hotels and restaurants, for example -- have been of particular concern. 
The Australian foreign minister, Alexander Downer, took the unusual step of predicting a possible terrorist attack in Indonesia "in the next day or so," and on Aug. 17, when Indonesia celebrates its independence. "That is a day when we think it's possible there could be a terrorist attack in the central Jakarta area," he said. 
American officials said they preferred not to be so precise about possible attacks but, instead, to emphasize precaution at all times. 
The methods used in the Bali and Jakarta attacks were similar, the head of the Jakarta criminal investigation department, Erwin Mappaseng said today. 
Both involved a vehicle packed with explosives being driven to the site. The police said today that potassium chloride and TNT, both substances used in the Bali bomb, were found on the Marriott driveway, where an Indonesian brand sport utility vehicle packed with explosives blew up. The bomber appears to have been in the S.U.V., Indonesian officials said. A suicide bomber was involved in the Bali attack. 
A senior Australian official said today he was not surprised by the Marriott blast. "Everyone has been waiting for another attack," he said. "This is no more and no less than a reminder that Jemaah Islamiyah is still there, has the capability, and will use that capability from time to time." 
But the Australian warned that the Jakarta attack showed a ratcheting up of Jemaah Islamiyah's tactics. "Bali was rationalized by the expatriates as being a tourist place, of being Hindu," he said. 
Senior Australian officials said that by attacking a Western institution in the heart of the capital, the Islamic group was trying to create fear in the expatriate community. By intimidating foreigners, the militants would drive the struggling economy into deeper trouble, a goal that was consistent with their ideal of wanting to establish a radical Islamic state in a place where most of the population is moderate in its religious beliefs.

HEADLINE: Fannie Mae's Loss Risk Is Larger, Computer Models Show 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
Fannie Mae, the giant mortgage finance company, faces much bigger losses from interest rate swings than it has publicly disclosed, according to computer models used by the company to estimate the value of its assets and debts.
 At the end of last year, the models showed that Fannie Mae's portfolio would have lost $7.5 billion in value if interest rates rose immediately by 1.5 percentage points, internal company documents provided to The New York Times indicated. At that time, the market value of all the assets on Fannie Mae's books, minus all the company's debts, was about $15 billion. So it would have lost roughly half its market value from such a sharp increase in interest rates, according to the models. 
 With $923 billion in assets, Fannie Mae is the second-largest financial company in the United States, trailing only Citigroup. Fannie Mae, which is sponsored by the federal government, helps keep mortgage rates down by buying mortgages from banks and selling them or its own bonds to investors around the world. But some investors and outside experts say the company has become dangerously large and highly leveraged, with too much debt and not enough equity. 
The models were provided to The Times by a former Fannie Mae employee, in return for assurance that he not be identified. 
The company's chairman, Franklin D. Raines, responding to a question at a news conference last week, said Fannie Mae did not depend on the market value of its portfolio to judge the success of its business. Asked whether Fannie Mae constructed such estimates weekly, he did not reply.
In interviews yesterday, executives at Fannie Mae acknowledged that the company estimates the value of its portfolio weekly, though it discloses such information to investors only once a year. The models provided to The Times are several months old, the executives said, and present an incomplete and misleading view of Fannie Mae's finances. They added that Fannie Mae hedges its risks properly and discloses them fully to investors.
"There is no reason for anybody to be worried about the company," said Peter Niculescu, Fannie Mae's executive vice president for the mortgage portfolio. "We are very happy, comfortable, and proud of our performance this year in what has turned out to be a very volatile interest rate environment." 
Mr. Niculescu declined to say whether Fannie Mae's portfolio had gained or lost value this year.
The former employee, who now works for a company that does not directly compete with Fannie Mae, said he had decided to publicize the documents because he was worried that Fannie Mae was becoming a risk to taxpayers and the financial system.
Because it is so large, and because many investors think that the federal government will repay its bonds if the company cannot, the government could become engaged in a very expensive bailout of Fannie Mae if it mismanaged its risk, the company's critics warn. And if investors balked at buying Fannie Mae's bonds because they were concerned about the company's financial strength, mortgage rates could rise rapidly.
For years, critics of Fannie Mae have warned that it does not give them enough information to judge its risks. "I have no clue" about the company's sensitivity to interest rate moves, said Stan Jonas, managing director at Fimat USA, a bond and derivatives broker. "But no one else does either."
Fannie Mae has never publicly disclosed how much money it could lose if interest rates rose 1.5 percentage points in a very short period of time. The company said in its most recent annual report that if rates rose 1 percent on Dec. 31, it would actually have made $600 million. But that figure included gains that were not directly related to the value of its mortgages. In fact, the model predicted that Fannie Mae's portfolio would have lost $2.6 billion if rates rose 1 percent. From June 13 through July 29, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, the benchmark of long-term interest rates, rose 1.33 percentage points, from 3.11 percent to 4.44 percent. The yield has since fallen slightly but remains more than 1.2 percentage points above its June low.
Mr. Niculescu said Fannie Mae had moved in the last few months to protect itself more aggressively from interest rate changes. Compared with other financial institutions, he said, it is well hedged and has plenty of capital.
Fannie Mae has not disclosed how much the recent rise in rates affected the market value of its holdings, and analysts have wildly varying estimates. Kenneth Posner, a stock analyst at Morgan Stanley who is bullish on Fannie Mae, said it did not disclose enough information for outside analysts to determine monthly changes in the portfolio's value.
Fannie Mae is owned by shareholders but operates under a federal charter that exempts it from paying state or local taxes. As a result, many professional investors think the government would repay the debt that Fannie Mae had issued if the company could not, although Fannie Mae explicitly says that its bonds do not carry a federal guarantee.
This sense of an implied guarantee enables Fannie Mae to borrow money more cheaply than other financial institutions, and over the last decade it has taken advantage of its low borrowing costs to grow fivefold. But some investors and independent experts have questioned whether it is nonetheless too vulnerable to changes in rates.
Fannie Mae once mainly insured mortgages held by other financial institutions against default, a steady but unglamorous business. But in the last decade, it has steadily increased the quantity of mortgages it holds instead of selling to other investors.
To buy those mortgages, Fannie Mae raises money by selling bonds. It makes money on the spread between the interest it receives on the mortgages and the interest it must pay on its debt.
That business plan seems relatively safe, since people typically do not default on their mortgages. But it has a hidden risk. Because homeowners have the right to prepay mortgages if interest rates fall, mortgages rise in value more slowly than Treasury bonds when rates drop. But they lose value more quickly than bonds when rates rise.
So Fannie Mae can lose money on its portfolio whether rates rise or fall. If the change in interest rates is gradual, then Fannie Mae will lose less money from the change than it makes on the rate spread between mortgages and the debt it has issued. But if rates change quickly, Fannie Mae can lose billions of dollars almost overnight.
The models provided by the former employee offer a glimpse of the risk that Fannie Mae takes and the leverage it uses to increase its profit at times when interest rates are relatively stable. Fannie Mae has more than $50 in debt for each $1 in equity capital, according to its most recent annual report.
Equity is the cushion that protects financial institutions from unexpected changes in the value of their assets. The greater the leverage, the smaller the losses required to wipe out a company's equity, leaving it without enough money to repay the people who hold its debt. Because Fannie is so highly leveraged, its equity could be wiped out if its assets fell in value by less than 2 percent, although it would not necessarily be forced to liquidate.
But if rates are relatively stable, Fannie's high leverage allows it to be extremely profitable. Since 2000, the company says it has had almost $20 billion in "core business earnings," its preferred measure of profitability. By other measures, including return on equity and profit per employee, Fannie Mae is among the most profitable companies in the world.
Fannie Mae and other big holders of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities chronically underestimate the odds of a big move in interest rates that could devastate the value of their portfolios, said Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a hedge fund manager and the author of two books about risk and the financial markets. In general, he said, Fannie Mae and other companies rely too much on computer models that do not account for rare but devastating breaks in markets.
"The fact that they have not blown up in the past doesn't mean that they're not going to blow up in the future," said Mr. Taleb, who is also an adjunct professor of mathematics at the Courant Institute of New York University. "The math is bogus."
The model Fannie Mae uses each week to estimate the value of its portfolio and its vulnerability to interest rate swings is complex. It must estimate the value of all of the hundreds of thousands of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities by estimating how much cash they will produce over time.
So the company simulates hundreds of different changes in short- and long-term interest rates for 30 years, then estimates how quickly the mortgages it owns will be paid back under each simulation. Based on those estimates, the company can roughly value its portfolio and estimate how vulnerable it might be to changes in rates over time.
In addition, Fannie Mae will "shock" its portfolio, estimating its vulnerability to an immediate swing in rates. To do that, it immediately moves the entire yield curve of short- and long-term rates up or down by some arbitrary amount, like one percentage point, and then recalculates the value of all its mortgages. 
Rate shocks are almost always negative for Fannie Mae, and they are often strongly negative, because the shortfall between the value of the mortgages it owns and the value of the debt it has issued tends to widen at an accelerating pace.
Still, the simulations are not exact, because Fannie Mae can never exactly estimate all the factors that will affect its portfolio, or exactly how rates may change as it and other companies try to protect themselves from future changes, Mr. Taleb said.
"All these models are pseudoscience to me," he said. "There is no science in it."

(Photo by Bloomberg News) Graph: "Walking a Fine Line"The value of Fannie Mae's immense portfolio of mortgages is highly sensitive to rapid changes in interest rates, either up or down.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: THE MILITARY; 
TO MOLLIFY IRAQIS, U.S. PLANS TO EASE SCOPE OF ITS RAIDS

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Aug. 6 

 BODY:
The American military, in a major revision of strategy, has decided to limit the scope of its raids in Iraq after receiving warnings from Iraqi leaders that the raids were alienating the public, the top allied commander said today.
 In its search for Baath Party operatives and other friends of the former government, the American military has carried out large sweeps, some of which have rounded up hundreds of Iraqis. 
 But Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, the chief commander of allied forces in Iraq, said in an interview that the military had virtually exhausted the gains from this approach and that continuing it could be counterproductive.
"It was a fact that I started to get multiple indicators that maybe our iron-fisted approach to the conduct of ops was beginning to alienate Iraqis," General Sanchez said, referring to military operations. "I started to get those sensings from multiple sources, all the way from the Governing Council down to average people." 
The change in approach comes at an important juncture for the American-led coalition, which is striving to maintain the support of an Iraqi public that has had to struggle with erratic power supplies, high unemployment and rampant crime and which, despite the disorder, has not always been reassured by the presence of American troops.
American forces have mounted major operations, like one in mid-July that sought to break up a possible insurgent offensive. That operation involved 143 raids across Iraq. General Sanchez said last month that almost 700 loyalists of the old government and criminals were detained and that 64 of these proved to be "high-value targets."
But Iraqis have complained that during these raids too many of those rounded up by American troops were not Baath Party operatives but ordinary citizens. They say the American tactics have been too aggressive and not sensitive enough to Iraqi culture and traditions.
American commanders said they decided to revise their approach after concluding that the number of attacks against American forces had subsided somewhat and that Iraqis were providing more intelligence, a development that American officers say will enable them to take more of a "precision approach" in planning their operations to capture or kill Saddam Hussein and former ranking officials from his government.
But the new American approach alsoreflects a recognition that widespread raids could unintentionally be creating a reservoir of support for the insurgents or even spurring revenge attacks by ordinary citizens.
General Sanchez said: "After we declared an end to major operations we quickly realized that there was a noncompliant element out there that was very willing to conduct ops against us to kill us and therefore we had to go out there and do these big sweeps.
"Unquestionably, I think, we created in this culture some Iraqis that then had to act because of their value systems against us in terms of revenge, possibly because there were casualties on their side and also because of the impact on their dignity and respect," he said.
The general added that Iraqi leaders who supported the allies had indicated they understood the goal of the American raids, but that some had expressed concern over their effects on the Iraqi population.
Their message, he said, has been that "when you take a father in front of his family and put a bag over his head and put him on the ground, you have had a significant adverse effect on his dignity and respect in the eyes of his family."
General Sanchez said the message from the Iraqis was that in doing this, you create more enemies than you capture. 
In the interview, General Sanchez revealed other steps that he was taking to try to improve security. To reduce the risk to allied planes, the allies are beginning a new program to buy shoulder-fired surface-to air missiles from Iraqis. The Americans are offering $500 a missile but have yet to buy any. The missile threat has prevented the allies from reopening the Baghdad airport.
But developing a new approach that eschews large sweeps and relies more on cooperation with Iraqi tribal leaders, clerics and politicians is central to the new strategy.
The American military deployment has gone through several phases. Initially, the Americans were welcomed by many Iraqis. The biggest threat to order seemed to be looting and crime, including robberies by some of the tens of thousands of prisoners that Mr. Hussein freed last year.
But organized attacks began to increase in June. There are about 9,000 former Iraqi military officials who are barred from serving in the new Iraqi military or taking other government jobs because they were senior Baath Party officials. Nobody knows for sure how many are fighting the Americans, but the resistance is believed to number in the thousands. After the upsurge in attacks, American forces mounted a series of big raids.
In recent weeks, the average number of attacks against allied troops has gone down. One senior military aide said that the number of attacks currently averaged about a dozen a day or even a bit less -- about the same number that occurred during the middle of June and half the number that allied forces faced in early July, when enemy attacks were on the rise and allied commanders were worried about keeping open the supply lines from Kuwait.
With the attacks on American forces seemingly declining, United States officials think the time is right to change their approach as they try to increase the number of Iraqi police and develop a parallel Iraqi internal security force.
Under the new approach, American forces might withdraw from towns that are quiet and leave the policing to the Iraqis. When a raid is conducted, American troops will be encouraged to carry out a "cordon and knock" procedure in which a home is surrounded and the troops seek permission to enter accompanied by an Iraqi representative, instead of breaking down the door.
When theAmericans want to search mosques they will first send in Iraqis working with them. But American troops will not shrink from mounting raids in the locations of their foes that can be pinpointed.
This amounts to a type of approach used by the 101st Airborne Division in its administration of the northern city of Mosul, and by the British in their administration of the southern city of Basra. The tougher approach has generally been used in the troubled Sunni areas in central Iraq and around Baghdad.
"Instead of finding whole areas and taking them down there will be more precision," a senior allied officer said. "You will see more information operations and more dialogue with tribal leaders and clerics."
The need for change in the Baghdad area was advocated by Brig. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the new commander of the First Armored Division, which is deployed in the Iraqi capital. He recently sent General Sanchez a memo in which he recommended that his division focus less on maintaining a constant presence in the capital and more on gathering the intelligence for planning and executing raids.
"During the initial 90 days of our mission, it was important to establish a widely recognized presence in Baghdad in order to restore civil order," General Dempsey noted in his July 30 memo. "We are now at a transition point. I define that transition point as moving from presence as a goal to precision as a goal."
General Sanchez made a similar point about operations not just in Baghdad but in all of Iraq.
"We are in fact at a critical point," General Sanchez said. "The need for us to preserve the support of the Iraqi people that are lined up behind the coalition right now is important."
To do that, he said, it is important to minimize the adverse effects of American military raids on the average Iraqi citizen.

HEADLINE: First Test for Freshmen: Picking Roommates 

BYLINE:  By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Ankith Kamaraju has never met Zachary Manfredi, but he is confident that on Aug. 23, when they move into the room they will share as freshmen at Emory University, they will get along smoothly.
 At least, that's what the latest in computer matchmaking predicts. 
 This summer, for the first time, Emory let freshmen pick their own roommates in an online roommate-selection system that works on the same principles ascomputer dating.
Students, using screen names to hide their identities, posted profiles of themselves detailing personality attributes, work habits, music and food preferences, and answers to questions like whether they hoped to "do almost everything" with their roommate or "lead separate but compatible lives." 
Mr. Manfredi, who is from Michigan, was in Mr. Kamaraju's top five list of closest matches. "I think we matched on 70-some percent of the questions," said Mr. Kamaraju, who lives in Durham, N.C. "So I e-mailed him and said I was looking for a roommate." 
Roommate-matching is a summer ritual that plunges college housing offices into the most intimate realm of sleep patterns, cleaning habits, noise tolerance and sexual behavior -- and online matching is on the cutting edge. 
The roommate-matching service that Emory is using, WebRoomz, costs a university $35,000 and up, depending on size. The software developed by WebRoomz, a company based in Atlanta, is already in use at several other schools and is expanding soon to the University of Washington and other large schools.
Housing officials at Emory, in Atlanta, say they expect that letting students pick their own roommates will increase the likelihood of compatibility. And there's little risk of hurt feelings if the e-mail exchanges do not lead to a match, since the initial round of contacts is done under screen names.
"We hope that empowering students to choose their own roommate will increase their satisfaction," said Lisa DeMik, Emory's assistant housing director.
Several studies have shown that roommates have an impact on the attitudes and social behavior of those they live with. And one recent study by two economics professors at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., found that a roommate's academic performance has a small, but statistically significant, effect on the other roommate's grade-point average. Other studies, however, did not find that effect.
The business of assigning roommates varies widely across the country, ranging from random assignment to careful hand-selection based on psychological profiles, questions about how students live, essays and intuition.
At Barnard College, for instance, Cristen Scully Kromm, a residential life official, spends days on the process, scanning the forms on which the 534 young women in the Class of 2007 have described their hopes and their habits. She has sorted them into piles, based on how they rated themselves, one to five, in wanting their room to be neat or disorderly, quiet or lively. She is looking for matches within the piles, pairing those who keep similar hours, like the same noise levels, and share some musical tastes and extracurricular interests.
"No, these two won't work," she said, shaking her head emphatically. "This one goes to bed at 11 and that one goes to bed at 2."
Sleep hours are a straightforward consideration. But Ms. Kromm also pays attention to what the incoming students said they considered the most important factor in assigning their roommate. The young woman who wrote "I really consider cleanliness a really important factor and I cannot study in a messy room" seems like a natural fit for the one who wrote, "It is important to me that my roommate is clean and keeps good hygiene." But Ms. Kromm is perplexed about how to handle the one who wrote: "I tend to be claustrophobic in confined spaces. My roommate needs to understand that I enjoy being social with people of the opposite sex." 
Ms. Kromm said her only goal is to find pairs whose approaches to life will mesh nicely. She said she does not try to ensure racial or geographic diversity between roommates: "I try to be pure. I just look at lifestyle questions."
Occasionally, an incoming student asks to be paired with an Asian, or says she might not be able to get along with a Republican, or a lesbian. In such cases, Ms. Kromm calls them over the summer to remind them, as the form states, that Barnard does not accept roommate preferences based on race, ethnicity, religion and sexual orientation.
"I tell them this is a very diverse place, and we do not discriminate," she said. "No one's gotten mad. Mostly, they're surprised that someone actually read what they wrote. And it's not always what it seems. The one who requested an Asian roommate was not Asian herself. She said she'd been at boarding school, and had never had an Asian roommate and thought it would be interesting."
At Davidson College in North Carolina, every freshman takes the Myers-Briggs personality profile, which allows the housing staff to sort the students by personality type, then match them with complementary types. The matchmakers consider everything from geography to family size, and even read the students' applications essays.
"We had a match that seemed perfect, until we discovered that one was a cattle rancher's son and the other was a vegan," said Leslie Marsicano, the director of residential life at Davidson. "They should definitely meet, on the same hall. But we didn't want to put them in the same room."
The Davidson philosophy is that roommates should be as similar as possible, while halls should be as diverse as possible. "We wouldn't put a member of the Brady Bunch with the only child of a single mom," Ms. Marsicano said. "'But we'd love them on the same hall."
Davidson's care in matching pays off, she said. "By Christmas last year, we had only four requests for roommate changes out of 480 students. And we did one survey that found that 80 percent of our seniors were still living with their freshman roommates."
No one knows whether computer-matching works as well. But at Emory, so far, student reaction seems to be overwhelmingly positive, whether the students used it as Mr. Kamaraju did, looking at only about 10 or 15 profiles chosen by the computer's "auto-match" system, or whether they plowed through dozens and dozens of profiles and corresponded with more than a dozen potential roommates, as some more choosy students did.
"I think it's the best system I've ever heard of," said Jeanne Donaldson, an incoming Emory freshman from Melbourne, Fla. "I was online every day for weeks, looking for the perfect roommate. I must have gone through maybe 50 or 100 profiles." Ms. Donaldson said, contentedly, that she and her roommate-to-be, who is from North Carolina, both like to get their sleep, wanted a single-sex floor and are more interested in academic achievement than partying.
"We've e-mailed a lot, and talked on the phone a couple times, and I feel like I know her," she said. Some questions on the profile allow students to pick up, quickly, on likely trouble spots. Students must choose one of four responses to describe their reaction if their roommate had guests three nights in a row: "My roommate is not to invite anyone for the night," "It's fine occasionally but not every weekend," "It's O.K. and I would expect a reciprocal arrangement" or "It would be O.K. if I were gone for the weekend but not otherwise."
They are also asked how they respond to dirty dishes -- by cleaning them immediately, hoping someone else cleans them, or leaving them a while and then cleaning them?
"I think I saidI'd leave the dishes and then clean them later, but I'm not sure," Mr. Kamaraju said. "Some of the questions were kind of hard to answer."

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Hardware: Advanced Micro To Buy Chip Unit 

BYLINE:  AP

 BODY:
 In an effort to further expand its chip offerings beyond personal computers, Advanced Micro Devices said yesterday that it was buying the information appliance unit of the National Semiconductor Corporation. Financial details of the deal, which is expected to close later this month, were not disclosed. A.M.D. will acquire intellectual property and other assets, consisting mainly of the Geode family of microprocessors, which National Semiconductor bet would be the leading chip for so-called information appliances like kitchen Web browsers and e-mail readers. 
The machines never caught on because of high price tags and limited functions. They also were introduced just as the technology bubble was bursting. Under the deal, 132 employees from National Semiconductor will join A.M.D. About 65 employees will be laid off. National Semiconductor is based in Santa Clara, Calif. A.M.D. is based in Sunnyvale, Calif.

Front-Office Miscue Turns Into a Positive

BYLINE:  By JACK CURRY

 BODY:
Armando Benitez said he was not surprised that the Yankees unloaded him to the Seattle Mariners in what felt like a New York minute. But less than three actual minutes later, Benitez contended that everybody was surprised he had been traded. Some snippet of uncertainty about Benitez continued until his final seconds in pinstripes.
 Whether he was surprised was irrelevant to the Yankees, who were relieved to exchange the erratic Benitez for the more reliable Jeff Nelson yesterday. Nelson has been here and done that for the Yankees. A reliever Manager Joe Torre trusts, he should be able to help provide a bridge to closer Mariano Rivera. So, eventually, the Yankees figured out a way to turn Benitez into a positive, and that was by jettisoning him. 
 It took the Yankees three weeks to determine that Benitez could not be the man Torre would ask to get important outs in the eighth inning. Benitez made nine appearances with the Yankees, starting with two scoreless innings against the Cleveland Indians on July 18 and finishing with one and a third spotless innings against the Texas Rangers on Tuesday. In between, Benitez showed his famously inconsistent moments. His fastball was magnificent; his makeup was fragile.
After watching Benitez pitch poorly in two games against the Boston Red Sox in late July, then seeing him labor through a third of an inning against the Oakland A's last Friday, the Yankees must have realized that they could no longer dream of him tossing a pitch for them in October. Interestingly, the Yankees moved him to a team they might meet in the postseason and quickly erased a move many considered a miscue. 
"That deal was not a mistake," General Manager Brian Cashman said of acquiring Benitez from the Mets for three minor leaguers on July 16. "Benitez allowed us to make the trade to get Jeff Nelson. I think having the bird in the hand helped us get this done. I'm not denigrating the prospects we gave the Mets, but, with the way Seattle is configured, they would not have gotten us Jeff Nelson."
Even as Cashman lauded Benitez for providing a few decent outings and explained that it was difficult to tell the sensitive Benitez he had been traded, Cashman acknowledged he was a "happy man." Cashman described Nelson as a neater fit because he threw his nifty slider for the Yankees from 1996 to 2000 and was an integral part of four World Series championship teams.
Nelson, who implored the Mariners to add a left-handed reliever in June, criticized them harshly for not making any deals before the nonwaiver trade deadline last week. That might have contributed to Nelson's being involved in the type of deal he had clamored for, although the Mariners told him it had no impact. Still, playing part-time general manager, he speculated it might have been a factor. 
"I was shocked," Nelson said. "If I was going to get traded, and I didn't think I was going to get traded, I thought it would be a National League team. I wouldn't think that a playoff-contending team would trade a guy to a playoff-contending team."
When Torre heard about Nelson's remarks, he said, "We all know Nellie," and flashed the type of smile he seldom flashed when Nelson was complaining about something in his neighborhood. But, like Cashman, Torre was relieved to have Nelson back.
Nelson, a healthy Gabe White and Rivera give the Yankees the deep bullpen that has often separated them in the postseason. Nelson is 2-3 with a 2.66 earned run average in 47 postseason games and Cashman admitted the Yankees never suitably replaced him after he left for Seattle and a free-agent offer that exceeded the Yankees' by $1.65 million. Last night Nelson was already lobbying to sign a new free-agent deal with the Yankees. 
"Quit talking, Nellie," Derek Jeter said, "before you get traded again."
The Yankees wanted to add relievers Scott Williamson and Scott Sauerbeck last month, but the Red Sox beat them to both players and General Manager Theo Epstein turned into a folk hero in New England. But Cashman gained some redemption by claiming Nelson off waivers and sprinting into trade talks around 1 p.m. yesterday, after the Mariners claimed Benitez.
The Red Sox could have thwarted the Yankees if they had first claimed Nelson, which was their right because they have a worse record, but, inexplicably, they failed to do it. Cashman offered an alibi for Epstein by saying the current economic climate causes teams to be cautious about whom they claim for fear of being stuck with the player's salary. But Nelson is due about $1.2 million, not an obscene amount for the Red Sox to hurt the Yankees. 
Torre said Benitez was "not entirely comfortable," an admission the Yankees did not make until Benitez was poised to enter a stretch limousine outside Yankee Stadium. Benitez's brown eyes were moist after learning about the trade, but he insisted that his eyes were always glassy and that he would simply go and pitch for another team.
"What can I say?" he said. "I've been in New York. Sometimes, the people don't want to see what I do in New York. I think I do my job in New York. The reasons people don't like me, I don't know. I do my job. No matter where I go, I'll try to do my job."
But not in New York anymore. For that, the Yankees are relieved.

HEADLINE: A Suicide and Uncertainty in Korea 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: SEOUL, Aug. 6 

 BODY:
In life, Chung Mong Hun was this capitalist nation's economic ambassador to the Communist North, negotiating for South Korean tour buses to drive across the demilitarized zone, setting off fireworks to inaugurate North Korea's first industrial park, and posing with the North's reclusive leader, Kim Jong Il.
 All that abruptly ended when Mr. Chung's body was found Monday morning below an open window of his 12th-floor office at the headquarters of his troubled company, Hyundai Asan. Since then, Koreans have watched every turn of the case, fascinated by a prominent clan that is sometimes called the Korean Kennedys. 
 Their business fortune once made people call this country the Republic of Hyundai. Seventy years after the clan's patriarch arrived in Seoul as a construction worker, the Hyundai name is on South Korea's biggest car company and biggest shipbuilding company. The family's political fortune was less favorable; two members failed as presidential candidates. And on a personal level, the Chung clan's happiness has been marred by suicides and untimely deaths. 
But for North Korea, deeply suspicious of foreign investors, the loss of Mr. Chung may further slow the isolated nation's emergence from nearly 60 years of Communism. Hyundai has hemorrhaged millions of dollars annually on the cross-border tourism project, largely because North Korea dragged its feet for five years on allowing buses to cross the border.
On Tuesday, North Korea responded to Mr. Chung's death by indefinitely suspending tourist visits to the Hyundai-run resort.
"His death, in fact, cannot be regarded as a suicide," North Korea's Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, the state agency that was Hyundai's economic partner, said. "It was murder committed by the sword called 'special inspection' illegally engineered" by South Korean conservatives, referring to government investigations of Mr. Chung. The North postponed two economic cooperation meetings scheduled for this week.
While the suicide notes, the family history and Mr. Chung's exhaustion from repeated interrogations by prosecutors in a bribery case left little doubt about his suicide, question marks do hang over the future of inter-Korean economic cooperation.
"Knowing how personalistic all these inter-Korean exchanges are, I can only be guardedly pessimistic," Alexander Mansourov, a North Korea expert in Hawaii who was an economic officer in the Soviet Embassy in Pyongyang in the late 1980's, said Tuesday.
Others say that projects already established will sputter along, but new ones will falter. "For the projects already settled by the North and South Korean governments, I see no change, no problem," Dong Yong Seung, head of the North Korea team at the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul, said in an interview Tuesday. "But I think there will be some problems for projects in the pipeline."
South Korean officials are tumbling over themselves this week to assure that there will be continuity for these cross-border investments, which are rare market-economy islands in what, until recently, has been the world's most statist sea.
"The government will make positive efforts so the inter-Korean economic projects proceed as intended by the deceased," said President Roh Moo Hyun of South Korea, who interrupted his vacation to issue a statement. He cited the Kumgang tourism project, in which Hyundai is thought to have invested nearly $1 billion since it opened in 1998, and the Kaesong industrial park, which Mr. Chung inaugurated on June 30.
Jeong Se Hyun, South Korea's unification minister and point man for North-South contacts, gave a radio interview, assuring that Mr. Chung's death "will not specifically affect Hyundai Asan's joint inter-Korean projects because they are being carried out on a systematic basis, not on a personal basis."
But Mr. Chung's five brothers, who each run a Hyundai company, have all declined to bail out Hyundai Asan. Officers at the Hyundai Motor Group have said they make investment decisions based on profit potential, pointedly noting that 46 percent of their shareholders are foreigners.
"Chung Mong Hun's death puts a huge question mark over all the future of the investment in North Korea," Michael Breen, author of the book, "The Koreans," said today. "When he looked at North Korea, he thought of the old way the Koreans made business: nation-building, and not primarily looking at profit. You bribe where you have to, you borrow where you have to, you go into debt, but in the end, the result is worth it. Well, most companies here can't operate like that anymore."
In North Korea's system of one-man rule, where economic profit and legal contracts are alien concepts, Hyundai was able to make deals based on a personal bond forged between Chung Ju Yung, the clan patriarch, and Mr. Kim, North Korea's absolute leader. A peasant migrant from northern Korea, Mr. Chung caught Mr. Kim's fancy in 1998 when he herded 1,001 cows across a land bridge at the demilitarized zone. Mr. Chung, who died two years ago, said he was repaying North Korea 1,000 times over for the "loan" of a cow he had "borrowed" from his father to pay for his ticket south. 
Despite this bond, Mr. Chung and his son paid steep bribes -- $400 million by the son's admission -- for approval of seven projects by North Korea. Even then, progress was slow. Last week, Mr. Chung won permission for tour buses to start crossing the demilitarized zone this September, nearly five years after the tourism project opened and weeks after South Korea's conservative- controlled National Assembly voted to cut the project off from further government subsidies, which totaled $18 million last year. 
Conservatives saw the project as a cash cow that funneled Pyongyang money that could be used for nuclear weapons. More to the liking of all South Koreans is straightforward inter-Korean trade, which jumped 25 percent in the first half of this year, to $269 million.
The industrial park at Kaesong, also a Hyundai Asan venture, seems to make more economic sense. Situated 42 miles north of Seoul, just over the demilitarized zone, the park is intended to wed North Korea's cheap labor with South Korean technology and capital. The park is expected to employ 22,000 workers by 2007; the average wage is to be $95 a month.
With South Korea trying to double its per capita income to $20,000 by the end of this decade, industrial parks could divert to North Korea some of South Korea's investment in low-wage factories that now goes to China. Even though North Korea stands to benefit by taxing salaries in Kaesong, it took the government four years to approve the project, and work has yet to begin.
"I was in Kaesong a week ago, there were a lot of South Koreans there, still talking about details," said Tony Michell, president of Euro-Asian Business Consultancy, a British company that does business in North Korea. "They are checking the soils and surveying. Work is continuing on the road and railroad."
North Korea, which long enjoyed bottling up South Korea for strategic reasons, now spies lucrative opportunities as gatekeeper for rail, gas and oil connections between South Korea and Russia. If North Korea's nuclear program can be put back under international controls and peace is fully established on the peninsula, Russia wants to lead a $3.3 billion investment to link the Trans-Siberian Railroad and Trans-Koreanrailroads, allowing cargo to travel from Pusan, on South Korea's southern tip, to markets in Western Europe.
While progress is slow, foreign visitors to North Korea report a gradual acceptance of markets and foreigners. Last summer, price controls and rationing were dropped, moves that set off triple-digit price inflation. Two months ago, a directive went out to all towns to build district markets. 
"The government simply could not deliver the goods and services it used to deliver," Marcus Noland, North Korea expert for the Institute for International Economics, said from Washington. "Instead of eradicating markets, they are trying to control them, to regularize them. I don't get the impression that this is because they have seen the light and they want to have a market economy."
But through the cracks of the ailing state economy, new businesses are sprouting: restaurants, hair salons, kitchen gardens, smuggling people to China. Residential real estate increasingly is in private hands.
"There is much more openness to foreigners," said Kathi Zellweger, who oversees food aid for Caritas, the Christian charity. "The fear is gone. We can ask questions and discuss things. People are much more forthcoming."

HEADLINE: Pension Overhaul Wins Key Vote in Brazil 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Aug. 6 

 BODY:
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva scored his first major legislative success today since taking office in January, winning resounding approval in the lower house of Congress to overhaul Brazil's debt-ridden public pension system.
 Despite strong opposition from workers in the public sector and the more extreme fringes of his own Workers Party, Mr. da Silva, who canceled an African trip to stay in Brasilia and shepherd the bill through Congress, marshaled enough support to carry the initial vote in the lower house by 358 to 126, with 9 abstentions. 
 The government needed 309 votes, or a three-fifths majority, to pass the bill, as it required altering the 1998 Constitution. Producing a compromise on the issue has taken up much of the government's energy during its first seven months in power. 
After the vote, Luiz Dulci, one of Mr. da Silva's chief aides, said the president believed that "the country has won because Brazil needs these reforms to start growing again, to create jobs and create wealth."
The long-awaited bill to tackle the pension system's chronic $20 billion annual deficit must now be passed point-by-point in the lower house before heading to the Senate, but the comfortable government majority in the predawn vote sent a strong positive signal to markets.
"This is clearly good news," said Doug Smith, chief economist for the Americas at Standard Chartered in New York. "We expected there would be some bumps, but the government initially aimed high and so could afford to make some compromises."
In recent days, the real slid against the dollar and Brazilian bonds fell as investors worried that the president would cave in on one or more of the reform's cornerstones.
The currency was languishing at 3.06 to the dollar today, its weakest level since mid-April, though traders said a debt rollover, rather than any pessimism about pension reform, was dragging the real down. Brazil's country risk -- a barometer of investor confidence measured by how much the country must pay over United States Treasury bonds to tap the market -- fell from over 900 basis points last week to 876 today.
Mr. da Silva, a former union leader, was forced to dilute his plans to end decades of privilege for public retirees after civil servants staged a disruptive strike last month.
As deputies prepared to vote Tuesday afternoon, police in Brasilia had to block the entrances to the congressional building to keep out hundreds ofprotesters. Disgruntled workers, estimated by police at 20,000 to 25,000, marched in Brasilia today, with some kicking in windows of the congressional building.
Ultimately, the bill passed with its main points -- a controversial salary ceiling for judges, taxing pensions over 1,200 reais ($400) a month and bringing taxes on private-sector pensions in line with those for the public sector -- more or less intact.
The reform should make it easier for the government to meet payments on its $283 billion public debt and free cash for programs to reduce the country's social inequalities.
The government has indicated it could use the savings, for example, to give basic social security coverage to some 40 million Brazilians working in the informal economy.
Ricardo Berzoini, the minister of social security, has said he expects the change to save $3 billion over the next three years and $17 billion through 2028. Even watered down, the bill is expected to save Brazil $16 billion by the end of the decade. Fearing a showdown with the governors of Brazil's cash-short states, the government has postponed voting on an overhaul of the country's tax system until the end of the year.
But the most urgent problem is kick-starting the ailing economy.
After raising interest rates early this year to 26.5 percent to rein in inflation, the central bank started easing monetary policy last month. But the overnight interest rate is still 24.5 percent, meaning consumers and small businesses must pay some 80 percent a year for a loan.
Analysts expect the economy to have shrunk for two straight quarters this year, while industrial production in June slumped 2.6 percent compared with May and was 2.1 percent below June 2002 levels. Unemployment has spiraled to over 20 percent in Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial heartland.
Besides a further easing of rates, the government could reduce banks' minimum reserves to reflate the economy, but analysts say more reforms would be of more help in the longer term.
"We don't expect to see reforms every day, but it would be good to see progress on a monthly basis," said Mr. Smith of Standard Chartered.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 11, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in World Business on Thursday about the approval of pension legislation in Brazil misstated the date of the country's constitution, which the measure altered. It was 1988, not 1998.

HEADLINE: A Smoky Bar In New York? It's Just TV, Bloomberg Says 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
A new sitcom called "Whoopi," starring guess who, takes place in New York City and is being filmed in New York City. Its newly built sets on Stage H of Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens look very New Yorkish indeed -- with one exception that became readily apparent when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg dropped by yesterday.
 There are ashtrays on the tables of the bar set. 
 Not to worry, said Whoopi Goldberg, who is not only the show's star but also its executive producer. Asked about the habits of the character she plays -- described in promotional material as a "cigarette-smoking, alcohol-drinking, menopausal and especially opinionated hotelier" -- Ms. Goldberg held up a blank check.
"I have my checks ready," she said as she shared a microphone at a news conference with Mayor Bloomberg, the prime force behind the strict new smoking ban that has exiled ashtrays from real city bars. "So that when we're shooting and we find that within the scene someone has to smoke, I will be writing a check to the city of New York for that right."
Mayor Bloomberg, who was on hand to praise the show for filming in New York City, noted that there were exceptions to the ban when it came to actors in shows. 
He said the show, which is to be shown on NBC this fall, employs 250 people and is expected to pump $13 million into the local economy. And he said ABC was planning to film another show, starring Kelly Ripa, in the city. But the mayor did take issue with the name of Ms. Goldberg's show, "Whoopi."
"Now, I don't know how you can go and name something after yourself," said Mr. Bloomberg, the majority owner of the Bloomberg L.P. financial information company, the seller of computer terminals known as Bloombergs, and the author of "Bloomberg by Bloomberg." 
"People do that, I'm just shocked."

HEADLINE: Read His Lips: Do They Say Repeal All Those New Taxes? 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
As Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg casts an eye toward the 2005 mayoral elections by traveling around the city more and holding ever-more-elaborate photo opportunities, he is beginning to hone his message in an area that he is particularly sensitive about: taxes.
 Mr. Bloomberg, after all, ran for mayor in 2001 as a no-new-taxer. He mailed out campaign literature proclaiming that "the last thing N.Y.C. needs now is higher taxes," and, after he won, said in his inaugural address, "We cannot raise taxes." Then he began to govern and, faced with enormous deficits, raised the property tax, sales tax and income tax. 
 Now, after taking plenty of political heat for raising taxes, Mr. Bloomberg is trying to repair the damage. His message now is that he was able to save key city services by raising taxes, that the city is now emerging from the worst of the crisis thanks to his stewardship, and, above all, that he understands the pain that the higher taxes caused.
But in one area, his message is still a work in progress: will the taxes be lowered?
The mayor sounded a new note of optimism on that count last week when he told a state board that monitors the city's finances that all three taxes could be repealed. He said that he was "reasonably confident" that all three tax increases he pushed through -- would be "temporary."
Two of those taxes -- the sales tax and the income tax increases -- were always meant to be temporary. But his decision to describe the 18.5 percent property tax increase, which nets the city $1.7 billion a year, as "temporary" was new. This week, the mayor's communications director, William T. Cunningham, sought to clarify that remark, explaining that the mayor should have said that he would like to see the city's economy grow to the point where the property tax increase could be at least reduced.
That was the theme that the mayor stuck to yesterday, although he continued to hold out the hope that he could leave office with taxes lower than they were when he entered it, which again suggested that a full repeal was still a possibility. 
"I would like to leave office in six years with taxes lower than they were when I came into office and the city's economy in better shape," he said at a news conference in Queens.
Asked how likely it was that he would be able to lower the property tax, Mr. Bloomberg said, "I don't know how to assess it." (He made his remarks before it was learned that a state board had moved to block a municipal bond deal that is crucial to the city's efforts to balance its budget this year.)
Mr. Bloomberg did not allow that he misspoke last week before the board, contradicting the statement of his own communications director.
But the mayor did try to show his empathy for the people paying higher taxes.
"It's easy for people to just talk about taxes in the abstract, but the fact of the matter is, for people who have families, or don't have families, people who work for a living, taxes are a great burden," Mr. Bloomberg said. "They are unfortunately a necessity of life, and when you have to make the compromise between safe streets and taxes, I stood up and said this is what we should do."

HEADLINE: Pataki Blocks Deal Crucial to City Plan To End Fiscal Crisis 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 6 

 BODY:
In a direct rebuke to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Gov. George E. Pataki and State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi moved today to block a municipal bond deal that is critical to the city's efforts to close its $6.4 billion budget gap this year.
 The vote by an obscure but powerful three-member board threw into chaos the city's plan to solve its financial crisis, possibly depriving it of up to $500 million a year in savings through 2008. 
 The city had hoped to achieve those savings by having the state take over its debt left over from the 1970's financial crisis. Mr. Pataki opposed the idea, but the State Legislature overrode his veto in May. 
The vote to kill the plan was made by the board of New York's Local Government Assistance Corporation, which the governor, a Republican, effectively controls; two of the board's three members are appointed by him, and the other one is Mr. Hevesi, a Democrat. The move comes while Mr. Bloomberg and fiscal monitors have been saying that the worst of the city's budget crisis is probably behind it.
Mayor Bloomberg said last night that he would challenge the board's action in court, igniting what promises to become intense negotiations between City Hall and Albany.
"It is disappointing that after all the difficulties New Yorkers have faced to get us through the fiscal crisis, L.G.A.C. wants to saddle the people of New York City with even more of a burden in these tough times," Mr. Bloomberg said in a written statement.
The two-paragraph statement by Mr. Bloomberg still did not mention the governor by name. Leaders in the State Legislature, though, sharply criticized Mr. Pataki for opposing their efforts to help the city.
"It is only the continuation of his attempt to try to hurt the city in any way possible, and like a child who comes to a game with his ball and does not like the results, he takes the ball and goes home," said Sheldon Silver, the Democratic Assembly speaker. "The override of his budget veto is what he is still fighting."
Mr. Silver added, "This looks like a direct attack on his fellow Republican, the mayor of the City of New York, who, in previous attacks, has turned the other cheek and refused to criticize the governor."
Today's events raised questions about whether a rift had developed between Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bloomberg, those on both sides of the political aisle said. City officials said they were not warned of Albany's pending action and were taken by surprise.
As of late today, the mayor and other city officials were scheduled to hold a joint, unrelated news conference with the governor at a city park on Thursday; by the evening, the event had been canceled.
A response from the corporation's board, sent by e-mail last night by Kevin C. Quinn, a spokesman for the State Division of the Budget, seemed to underline just how fierce any fight could become: "It is unfortunate that the city has chosen to attack the Local Government Assistance Corporation board rather than work cooperatively with state officials and the Legislature to provide the budget relief New York City needs in a fiscally responsible and legal manner that doesn't burden taxpayers with billions of dollars in new costs."
For weeks, the governor and Mr. Hevesi have condemned the municipal bond plan as a bit of fiscal chicanery, saying it would stretch out the payment of debt left over from the city's 1970's fiscal crisis until the year 2034, or beyond.
The governor has continued that stance despite the pleas of Mayor Bloomberg to allow the deal to stand. Mr. Hevesi, a former city comptroller, said he decided the deal was not in the state's best fiscal interests.
When asked if the move was intended as a message to steer potential bond buyers on Wall Street away from the deal, Mr. Hevesi said: "I think any responsible investor is going to say, 'If I take these bonds, how is it backed up? Who is going to reimburse?' That's a fair question."
Under the plan, approved by state lawmakers last spring, the state would allow the city to create a new local development corporation. That entity would be allowed to borrow money to pay off the remaining bonds issued by the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was created in the 1970's to help the city out of its financial crisis.
The state would then pay the city $170 million a year, probably for about 30 years, to pay off the debt service on the new bonds. The state money would come from the Local Government Assistance Corporation, which gets its money from the state sales tax. The city would then not have to spend about $2.5 billion over the next five years paying off its remaining 1970's debt.
A city official said the issue was far from over. The mayor wanted to market his bonds on Wall Street next week, and on Tuesday, Standard & Poor's Ratings Service assigned a preliminary AA rating to the bonds and expressed confidence that issuing them would be constitutional. Now, the Bloomberg administration will speak with people at Goldman Sachs, the lead investment banker on the deal, to determine how and whether to proceed with the financing. "The city is analyzing its options," said Edward Skyler, a spokesman for the mayor.
City Hall's legal theory has been that because the financing arrangement was completed as part of the state budget, it is unimpeachable, so the state corporation cannot block it.
In May, the governor said this part of the Legislature's budget had been improperly drafted, and was therefore unconstitutional. One legislative aide said it appeared that the governor was now trying to use the state corporation to underscore that point.
The move was also a direct rebuke to leaders in the State Legislature, who saw the refinancing plan as a more palatable alternative than, for instance, taxing commuters who work in New York City, a measure Mr. Bloomberg advocated.
John E. McArdle, a spokesman for Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican State Senate majority leader, struck a conciliatory note, saying the Senate hoped the issue could be resolved in a budget cleanup bill. But, Mr. McArdle said, "we still support the basic agreement that has the state relieving the city of these payments."

HEADLINE: Movie Star In, Senator Out For Recall Race in California 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY with CHARLIE LeDUFF; David E. Sanger contributed to this article.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 6 

 BODY:
The recall election on Gov. Gray Davis of California took stunning turns today, as one of the state's most respected elected officials, Senator Dianne Feinstein, announced that she would not run to replace Mr. Davis, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, a politically untested movie star, announced that he would.
 As extraordinary bookends on a day of fast-moving events, the two decisions could not have been more dissimilar in style and substance. Public opinion polls have identified Ms. Feinstein, a Democrat, and Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, as among the most popular alternatives to Mr. Davis, who faces a recall vote on Oct. 7. 
 The developments, which also included the formal start of the candidacy of the columnist Arianna Huffington, had setoff a panic among many Democratic officials, who are searching for a fallback candidate should Governor Davis lose the recall. 
Mr. Schwarzenegger, who has been spending most of the past several weeks promoting his newest "Terminator" movie, made his intentions known before a cheering television audience at a taping in Burbank of the "Tonight" show with Jay Leno.
Instead of talking about issues like nuclear proliferation and appropriations, as Ms. Feinstein did, Mr. Schwarzenegger made light of his decision to run while joking with Mr. Leno that it was the toughest one that he had made since deciding to get a bikini wax.
He did address the main question in the recall, saying: "The man that is failing the people more than anyone is Gray Davis. He is failing them terribly, and this is why he needs to be recalled, and this is why I am going to run for governor."
Anxious members of the state's Democratic Congressional delegation held an urgent conference call in which there was "growing consensus" that a Democratic alternative to Mr. Davis must enter the recall race, a participant, Representative Cal Dooley, said.
"There is still time to identify another candidate," Mr. Dooley said, "and I think that we are fortunate that we have a very deep bench of prominent Democrats in this state." 
Ms. Feinstein, speaking from a foreign policy gathering in Aspen, Colo., said she had decided that Mr. Davis deserved a chance to finish his term and that it was more important for her to carry on the business of the United States Senate than to delve into the recall. 
Mr. Davis has strongly opposed the idea of a Democrat running on the so-called replacement part of the recall ballot.
Ms. Feinstein said she was appalled at the "frivolity" of the recall, which has attracted the interest of more than 500 possible candidates, from a pornographer to idle millionaires, describing it as "more like a carnival every day."
"My hope is that this recall causes all of us in California to do some deep soul searching as to whether we really want it to be this way," Ms. Feinstein said in a telephone news conference.
Mr. Davis, in a radio interview before Mr. Schwarzenegger's announcement, was asked about the prospect of running against him. 
"The Terminator!" the governor said on KGO-AM. "I just don't want to comment. But let me just say this. People have rued the day when they said they want to run against someone. A lot of people have been excited about the potential of running against someone and found out that they turned out to be the ultimate loser in the contest. So be careful what you wish for in this business."
Throughout the day, the disarray among the Democrats was palpable. The state party chairman, Art Torres, and the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Terry McAuliffe, who have stood by Mr. Davis on the recall, canceled a news conference this afternoon just minutes before it was scheduled to begin.
The telephone conference call among the Democratic Congressional delegation lasted about 90 minutes and involved about half its 33 members, Mr. Dooley said. Among the potential candidates most frequently mentioned in the discussion were Lt. Gov. Cruz M. Bustamante and Leon E. Panetta, a former California congressman and chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, Mr. Dooley said.
Though both men have expressed opposition to the recall and have indicated no intention to run on the replacement ballot, there was considerable speculation today that they might be open to a draft, particularly with the entry of a celebrity like Mr. Schwarzenegger.
Mr. Davis and his supporters were dealt another potentially devastating blow when Ms. Feinstein said in the telephone news conference that although she opposed a Democrat's stepping in, she would not try to dissuade one from doing so.
"I don't see that as my role," she said. "I have said what I think about that. The only way to keep them off is to tie their hands behind their back so they couldn't' sign the papers."
In his radio interview, Mr. Davis reiterated his opposition to a prominent Democrat's stepping in.
"To the extent that the Democrats get into the race," Mr. Davis said, "it makes it look like a normal election and legitimates what is really an effort by the right wing to steal back an election they couldn't win last November." 
But with the deadline of Saturday for candidates to file as a possible successor to Mr. Davis, some members of the state's Democratic delegation in Congress interpreted the timing of Ms. Feinstein's announcement as a green light for them to search for a contender.
"There is growing apprehension about the ability of Governor Davis to defeat the recall," Mr. Dooley said. "I think Senator Feinstein understands the interest among some of the Democratic leaders in California to consider other candidates for the recall and thus made her decision in order to allow consideration of the other candidates."
Ms. Feinstein was also openly critical of Mr. Davis's insistence on labeling the recall as a right-wing conspiracy. She said it was off the mark to characterize Representative Darrell Issa, the San Diego Republican who financed the signature gathering, as right-wing extremist. 
She said Mr. Davis would be able to defeat the effort to oust him only if he began to talk about his strengths.
"It is a sales strategy from the get-go," Ms. Feinstein said. "I mean Darrell Issa, I don't think is a right-wing coup. He may be a right-winger who spent a lot of money and wanted to short-cut to the governor's office himself, no more, no less."
At a news conference after his television appearance, Mr. Schwarzenegger also criticized Mr. Davis's strategy. "He can run a dirty campaign better than anyone, but he can't run a state," Mr. Schwarzenegger said. "In the end, it is my duty to jump into the race and to bring hope to the people."
Mr. Schwarzenegger, who has no political experience other than leading a successful statewide ballot initiative last fall on after-school programs, blamed California's politicians for the state's problems. The effort to oust Mr. Davis has been largely fueled by unhappiness with the state's economic woes, which included a $38 billion budget deficit.
To interspersed applause and cheers from the studio audience, Mr. Schwarzenegger said there was a "total disconnect" between ordinary people and elected officials.
"And what that means basically is the people are doing their jobs," he said. "The people are working hard, the people are paying their taxes, the people are raising their families. The politicians are not doing their jobs."
In an interview today in Aspen, where Ms. Feinstein has spent the week at a foreign policy conference and relaxing at her log house on a mesa overlooking the Aspen Valley, she said that she believed that Mr. Davis could survive the recall, but she acknowledged that he faced an uphill battle.
"I think it is tough, but I think he can sustain a 'no' vote on recall, if he lets people see him being decisive, solving problems, acting gubernatorial," she said. She argued that "there is an obvious choice," because Mr. Davis "was elected governor with seven million votes just nine months ago."
She said she gave the question of running "a lot of thought" but decided in the end that her Senate seniority was too important to give up. "So I am going to stay the course," she said.
Earlier in the day, Ms. Huffington, a populist author and syndicated columnist, officially announced her candidacy for governor. Ms. Huffington said she would not have entered the race if Ms. Feinstein had decided to present herself as the Democratic alternative. "I'm not interested in splitting the vote," she said.
An independent, Ms. Huffington made no bones about her disdain for both the Republicans and Democrats, calling them fanatics and fools.
"California is in deep, deep trouble," she said. "Its citizens deserve more than the partisan, petty and pathetic leadership it's getting at the moment."

HEADLINE: Northwest Chief Says Airline Will Not File for Bankruptcy 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: ROMULUS, Mich., Aug. 6 

 BODY:
Northwest Airlines, which warned unions in the spring that it would have to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection if workers did not grant nearly $1 billion in wage and benefit concessions, said today that a bankruptcy filing would not be necessary.
 That does not mean the airline has given up on obtaining cutbacks. Indeed, company executives reiterated their need to reduce wages and benefits to levels achieved at other large carriers like United Airlines, American Airlines and US Airways. 
 United and US Airways obtained concessions from their employees after filing for bankruptcy protection last year, while American's unions granted wage and benefit cuts in the face of the airline's threat to do so. US Airways has since emerged from bankruptcy, and United is preparing a revamping plan. 
However, Richard H. Anderson, the chief executive of Northwest, said in an interview today that the airline was not headed toward a bankruptcy filing. "We're going to continue to manage the airline," he said, "and get it restructured appropriately without a Chapter 11."
Mr. Anderson's comments came as Northwest unveiled the first of a new fleet of Airbus A330 jets at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, one of its major hubs. The planes, which will eventually replace the McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 and join the Boeing 747 on international flights, are up to 40 percent more efficient than those planes and can carry more passengers, executives said.
Mr. Anderson rankled Northwest's unions in April, when he said the airline would be forced to join United, a unit of the UAL Corporation, and US Airways in seeking bankruptcy protection unless workers granted $950 million in wage and benefit cuts by July 1.
At the time, analysts questioned Mr. Anderson's contention, citing Northwest's relatively healthy cash position, which it has maintained despite steep declines in traffic to Asia, where it has a significant presence along with United.
Unions refused to grant the cuts, and the deadline passed without any comment from the airline about a bankruptcy filing. Indeed, Mr. Anderson acknowledged today that the airline had been able to maintain its liquidity in the face of many challenges, from the Sept. 11 attacks to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. Since 2000, Northwest has cut its annual costs by $1.4 billion and reduced its operations by 15 percent.
"In the last two and a half years, we've been the most aggressive in the industry in terms of getting out in front of the problems that we faced," Mr. Anderson said. "It's necessitated some very hard decisions."
Northwest lost $160 million in the second quarter, before one-time government reimbursements for security fees. Nonetheless, it ended the second quarter with $2.9 billion in cash, which translated to 30 percent of the last 12 months of revenue, said the airline's president, Douglas M. Steenland. Even with labor concessions, Mr. Steenland estimated that United's cash was equal to 12 percent of its revenue, while American's cash translated to 11 percent of revenue. Mr. Steenland said the airline was continuing to discuss the proposed cuts with union officials but declined to say when he thought the discussions might yield results. Both he and Mr. Anderson were pessimistic about the immediate future for the major airlines, which have been buffeted by the weak economy and challenged by competition from low-fare carriers. "We don't see any end in sight," Mr. Steenland said. "We don't see any light at the end of the tunnel yet."
Mr. Anderson, in the interview, said traffic to Asia in August would continue to be down in the double-digit range because of the after-effects of the SARS outbreak. "I hope we don't have a wave of locusts," he said he recently told employees. "We've had war, and we've had plague, I guess," he added, referring to SARS, "and terrorism, and we seem to have sort of one event after another."
In fact, the airline had two more issues to contend with today. Mr. Anderson said the airline would be hurt by the government's decision to suspend two programs that allowed passengers to connect through American airports on the way to other countries without visas. He said that would primarily affect Northwest's flights from Minneapolis and Detroit to destinations in Canada. The cost of lost business from visa-less passengers who are forced to cancel flights would be in the millions of dollars, he said, declining to be more specific.
Also today, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers filed suit over Northwest's refusal to buy back 4.8 million shares of preferred stock that were issued to workers a decade ago in return for contract concessions. The airline was supposed to repurchase the shares, worth $225 million, by Aug. 1, and said in June that it would pay for them in cash.
But last week, Northwest said it was not permitted to buy the shares under the law in Delaware, where it is incorporated, and would instead pay dividends on the stock. In the suit, filed in New York State Supreme Court, the union, which represents customer service and reservations agents at the airline, sought immediate repayment of at least $100 million. 
"Our members fulfilled all their obligations under the agreement," said Robert Roach, the union's general vice president for transportation. "Northwest Airlines must live up to its commitments and provide what rightfully belongs to our members. This is a bill that is due, and a bill that must be paid." Northwest said it would not comment on the suit.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by Times critics of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums children under 12 and museum members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* "THE AMERICAN EFFECT: GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES ON THE UNITED STATES, 1990-2003," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street (212) 570-3676 (through Oct. 12). Exploring ways that artists throughout the world react to the United States as a superpower, this show of documentary films, videos, installations, photographs, paintings and objects by 47 artists and filmmakers and 3 collaborative groups runs from sunny side up to deep despair. There are reflections on America's military might, its industrial clout, its treatment of minorities, its consumerism, its justice system, its marketing strategies, its religious evangelism, its celebrity worship and its interference with other governments. On the other hand there are more positive expressions of admiration for the freedoms, the opportunities and the material achievements of a country unfettered by ancient traditions. The show has its weak spots but overall is provocative and visually compelling. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+ (Grace Glueck).

"ANSEL ADAMS AT 100," Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400 (through Nov. 3). This exhibition of 113 of Adams's photographs, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of his birth, has been traveling around the world for two years. In these warehouse galleries it has a strangely random and homely feel. The photographs look small and lost. Maybe it's the setting. Maybe it's because the show, organized roughly thematically -- austere peaks, plants, peaks with plants, grand vistas, rocks -- doesn't have a clearly focused concept. Or maybe it's because the curator wanted to tamp down Adams's bombast and replace it with something quieter, smaller and subtler. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays to 7:45 p.m. Admission: $12; $8.50 for students and 65+ (Sarah Boxer).

* "ART OF THE FIRST CITIES: THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN TO THE INDUS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Aug. 17). The most timely exhibition in years, as well as diplomatically dexterous and beautiful. It surveys the culture of the third millennium B.C., mainly centered in Mesopotamia, the crucible of Sumerian civilization, where art, architecture, law and writing developed with the rise of the earliest cities. The beginnings of a cosmopolitan art are in tiny cylinder seals and in figurines. The show is full of small objects that are monumental in concept. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $7, students and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman).

* MAX BECKMANN, Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400 (through Sept. 29). Like Beckmann, this retrospective of that German genius is dense, frequently revelatory and exhausting: -- all that heavy-handed symbolism and claustrophobia. Beckmann can seem like a truculent master, glaring balefully at us from his self-portraits, disappointed by our moral turpitude. It is easy to get bogged down in the miasma of his obscure allusions. But he also puts brush to canvas with surprising tenderness. Color is luxurious, not garish. The humor is sly and black. Finally, he is unavoidably compelling. Hours and admission: See above. (Kimmelman).

* "BLACK PRESIDENT: THE ART AND LEGACY OF FELA ANIKULAPO-KUTI," New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Sept. 28). The Nigerian composer, musician and activist Fela Kuti (1938-1997) invented the musical style called Afrobeat, relentlessly assailed political corruption and repression in Africa and beyond through his records and performances, and led a scandalous private life very publicly. This taut, vivacious exhibition is less about the man himself than about how 30 contemporary artists, most of them African or African-American, respond to his blazing, goading lodestar presence. Their reactions range from celebratory to critical, and few are simple, but his vision of a rejuvenated Africa still shines bright. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students, artists and 65+ (Holland Cotter).

"CUBA ON THE VERGE: AN ISLAND IN TRANSITION," International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000 (through Aug. 31). Is it possible for anyone to photograph Cuba without some sort of romance creeping in? The concept behind this show of Cuban, Cuban-American and American photographers was to eschew "cliched images of vintage American cars and other remnants of a prerevolutionary era" and instead to "convey Cuba present," as the show's guest curator, Terry McCoy, writes in the catalog. But some of the photographs suggest that even as Cuba sinks deeper into poverty, ruin and prostitution, the romance of faded beauty and glamorous revolution won't go away. The most refreshing shots are those in which subjects confront the camera and the fantasy. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, students and 62+ (Boxer).

"SALVADOR DALI: DREAM OF VENUS," Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700 (through Sept. 7). While images of the 1939 New York World's Fair in Queens remain ingrained in the American collective memory, one attraction, relegated to the "Amusement Zone," was largely forgotten until now: Dali's "Dream of Venus," a tacky Surrealist fun house with live, semi-nude women. This exhibition consists mainly of photographs that document the project from start to finish. Featuring the handsome, charismatic artist; his enigmatic wife, Gala; and lots of voluptuous, unclothed models, this show and its catalog tell a fascinating tale of idealism, opportunism, provocation and censorship. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 1 to 8 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 55+ (Ken Johnson).

"DRAWN HOME: FRITZ VOGT'S RURAL AMERICA," American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-1040 (through Sept. 21). During the last decade of the 19th century Vogt, a German immigrant, supported himself by making portraits of homes in upstate New York. A homeless itinerant who preferred to sleep in his patrons' barns, Vogt made wonderfully lucid, formally ingenious drawings of farms with multiple outbuildings and of elaborately decorated Victorian showpieces with manicured grounds. The 26 drawings here tap into an American ethos that elevated domestic prosperity to something like a national religion. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Admission: $9; $7, students and 62+ (Johnson).

* "DREAMING IN PICTURES: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF LEWIS CARROLL," International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000 (through Aug. 31). A photograph is at least as much a looking glass as it is a window. We see in it our own reflections and obsessions. A post-Freudian world has inevitably come to see C. L. Dodgson's photographs through the looking glass of his alter ego, Lewis Carroll. This provocative show tries to put Dodgson's pictures back in their context, to stress that we have lost touch with Victorian conventions, which Dodgson largely obeyed when he photographed little girls. Childhood to Victorians represented, as the show's curator puts it, an "alternate reality, a metaphysical state of preknowledge." Dodgson, he adds "could pose his charges in adult roles, give them guns, daggers and exotic costumes, even portray them as odalisques and half-dressed waifs, because he and most of his audience believed so emphatically in their total insulation from the implications of such postures." These presentations do not so much underscore the latent sexuality of the child (as we post-Freudians would have it) as they do an obvious lack of it." Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).

* "FROM EXPRESSIONISM TO THE BAUHAUS: HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART," Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200 (through Sept. 15). Borrowed from the Museum of Modern Art, this economical, powerfully resonant exhibition of German Modernist artworks from the first third of the 20th century includes Expressionist paintings by Ludwig Kirchner, Otto Mueller and Emil Nolde; mordantly satiric New Realist paintings by George Grosz and Otto Dix; and sumptuously elegant utilitarian objects by Marcel Breuer and Marianne Brandt. Hours: Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7 for students and 65+ (Johnson).

"FROM PICASSO TO POLLOCK: CLASSICS OF MODERN ART," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Sept. 28). This selective anthology of perennial in-house favorites in a major museum has much to be said for it. The bait is irresistible, the promised classics turn up here and there, and both the young and the not-so-young have a fine time on the ramps. In addition to fine examples by Kandinsky, Picasso, Leger, Chagall, Kokoschka and Malevich, there is an enormous piece in ceramic tiles by Joan Miro. Begun in 1965 and finished in 1967, it is largely in black and white, but every touch of color sings out. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $9 for students and 65+ (John Russell).

* "HENDRICK GOLTZIUS, DUTCH MASTER (1558-1617): DRAWINGS, PRINTS AND PAINTINGS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sept. 7). Goltzius (1558-1617) was one of the hottest of hotshot Dutch artists. He was particularly celebrated for his engravings, many of them mythological tableaus of pumped-up gods and pinup goddesses, rendered in the Mannerist way with flabbergasting elan. But he was also one of the greatdraftsmen of his age -- his landscape drawings prefigure Rembrandt and Ruisdael -- and became a virtuosic painter whose primary subject was bare human flesh: its texture, its color, its chemistry. To some eyes he remains strictly a period artist; to others he connects to the present in interesting ways. The Met show offers the raw materials for both reactions. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).

* "LANDSCAPE OF MEMORY: THE ART OF MU XIN," Asia Society and Museum, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400 (through Sept. 7.) The artist and writer Mu Xin, born into a wealthy aristocratic family in China, received a classical scholar's education and early exposure to Western culture. Targeted as a dissident during the Cultural Revolution, he was held in solitary confinement for 18 months, and he secretly wrote a series of first-person meditations now called "Prison Notes," which he carried out of jail sewn in his clothes. Under house arrest several years later, he executed a remarkable series of small landscape paintings in which traditional Chinese themes meet Leonardo da Vinci. The paintings and some of "Prison Notes" are brought together in this lean, penumbral exhibition, organized by the Yale University Art Gallery and the David and Alfred Smart Museum of Art at the University of Chicago. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays to 9 p.m. Admission: $7; $5, students and 65+ (Cotter).

"LEGENDS OF OUR TIMES: NATIVE RANCHING AND RODEO LIFE ON THE PLAINS AND THE PLATEAU," National Museum of the American Indian, George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700 (through March 7). This lively account of man, woman and horse among the native people in western reaches of the United States and Canada proves that a cowboy can be an Indian, and vice versa. The show depicts native peoples not as objects of exploitation by the white man but as ranchers, cowboys, entertainers and rodeo performers. It displays more than 700 objects -- saddles, bead and quill works, paintings, photographs, blankets, clothing, horse gear, hunting implements, roundup equipment, headdresses and other ceremonial garb -- from the 18th century to now. At least half of this huge show provides an engaging and comprehensive account of rodeo, but nonrodeo fans will probably have more fun with the bedazzlement of objects depicting the more traditional side of American Indian life. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays until 8 p.m. Free (Glueck).

"MANET AND THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR: THE BATTLE OF U.S.S. KEARSARGE AND C.S.S. ALABAMA," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Aug. 17). Along with many of his countrymen, the thoroughly French painter Edouard Manet was fascinated by a celebrated battle of the American Civil War that took place off Cherbourg in 1864: the fight between the Union sailing ship U.S.S. Kearsarge and the Confederate raider C.S.S. Alabama. Although he missed the battle itself, which ended in victory for the Kearsarge, he was inspired to make an imaginary rendition of it, and several weeks later, visiting the victorious Kearsarge at anchor off Boulogne, he painted the ship itself at first hand. His innovative paintings, with their striking compositional effects and fresher, freer brushwork, had an influence on other artists of the period, notably Monet, Whistler and Courbet. They are on view with other material bearing on the incident: photographs, memorabilia and paintings by others (among them a stunner by Monet). A bold depiction of the sea and ships, very different from the tight, literal renderings of more conventional marine artists, Manet's work helped lead the way to the radical brushwork of Impressionism. Hours and admission: See above.(Glueck).

Galleries: Uptown

TONY FOSTER, "Watermarks," James Graham & Sons, 1014 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 535-5767 (through Aug. 23). Mr. Foster is yet another Englishman whose art revolves around travel. Finding his way from South American tropical forests to glaciers in Greenland, he neatly documents what he sees in watercolor; he then adds found objects like bones, shells, vials of water, rocks and feathers. The art in the gallery is not as adventurous as the artist himself seems to be (Johnson).

Galleries: 57th Street

"H2O," Danese, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 223-2227 (through Aug. 22). For obvious reasons a lot of summer group shows take water as a theme, this one more directly and more effectively than most. Works by more than 30 artists include Sally Mann's mysterious photograph of three naked, nubile girls urinating; a piece of magic illusionism by Amy Jenkins that has a bathing woman video-projected into a miniature bathtub; Laura Aguilar's portrait of her own mountainously corpulent self lying naked next to a small rock pool; and a gigantically enlarged sweat gland reproduced in rubber by Jeanne Silverthorne (Johnson).

BEN POLSKY, "Siteunseen," Luxe, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 404-7455 (through Aug. 16). Mr. Polsky's extra-large drawings on heavy sheets of paper are appealing, though overly indebted to Toba Khedoori. With a near miniaturist touch he makes densely detailed images of ruined buildings and rubble by drawing through carbon paper. Surrounded by smudgy expanses of paper, these images have a mournful, disembodied quality (Johnson).

"PUDDLE-WONDERFUL," Artemis Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212) 445-0444 (through Aug. 15). If this eight-artist show has a theme, it remains obscure. The exhibition includes one of Felix Gonzalez-Torres's memorial piles of candy; quasi-scientific, politically suggestive photographs by Francis Alys, which document people standing in the shadow of a big flagpole in a Mexican square; wind-blown trees video-projected on a gold canvas to magically illusionistic effect, by Donald Moffet; and a melting wax abstraction applied to the gallery skylight by Ferran Martin (Johnson).

Galleries: SoHo

"ASSUME VIVID ASTRO FOCUS VII," Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, (212) 343-7300 (through Aug. 15). In its seventh installation incarnation, Assume Vivid Astro Focus, as the Brazilian artist Eli Sudbrack prefers to be known, takes Pop-Nouveau multicultural sensory overload to new extremes, with profuse stick-on prints covering most available surfaces, an irresistible music video and enough collaborations with and by other artists to qualify as a group show that is part chapel, part disco and part tattoo parlor. Whatever he is called, Mr. Sudbrack may be the 21st century's Andy Warhol (Roberta Smith).

"FROM GASLIGHTS TO TELEVISION," Susan Teller, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 941-7335 (through Aug. 28). Typewriters, stoves, refrigerators, clocks, pumps, sewing machines, telephones, fans, ice cream makers, irons and other labor-saving devices turn up in this surprising show about appliances in 20th-century American domestic life. From John Sloan's sexy etching of a woman turning off the light before joining her lover in bed to Louise Leech's painting of her teenage daughters watching the first Moon landing on television, the show conjures an engagingly humane vision of living with modern technology (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

ANSEL ADAMS, "100 + 1," Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212) 989-2947 (through Aug. 22). Great modern artist or purveyor of high-toned kitsch? Coinciding with the retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, this substantial show affords a fine occasion to weigh the evidence. Looking at Adams's skillfully manipulated, Wild West landscapes, one feels less awakened to the wondrous complexities of photography and nature than bludgeoned by a proto-Spielbergian romanticism (Johnson).

"BOYS OF SUMMER," ClampArt, 531 West 25th Street, (646) 230-0020 (through Sept. 6). If you like to look at men, and you're passing by, stop in. Standing out among the crowd of pictures by more than two dozen photographers are "Bruce in His Car," a 1981 portrait of a skinny bohemian in his big red convertible by Nan Goldin; a beefy, shirtless young football player celebrating with his team, by Brian Finke; men in leather, by Barbara Nitke; and, by Malerie Marder, a large color image of a mixed-sex group of naked people relaxing in a California bathhouse (Johnson).

"FRANKENSTEIN (OR IT'S ALL FUN AND GAMES UNTIL SOMEONE LOSES AN EYE)," Tanya Bonakdar, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, (through Aug. 22). Organized by Ethan Sklar, the gallery's director, this exhibition examines the ways artists subvert the physical and decision-making processes of art making by using machines, accident, science, random selection and all-inclusiveness and has a title perfectly suited to its sometimes scary weirdness (Smith).

RACHEL HARRISON, HIRSCH PERLMAN, DIETER ROTH, JACK SMITH, REBECCA WARREN, Matthew Marks, 523 West 24th Street, (212) 243-0200 (through Aug. 15). This show by European and American artists from different generations pays tribute to the ability to conjure loony, often sexual excess from next to nothing in terms of materials or techniques. A museum-quality effort organized by Jeffrey Peabody, the gallery's director, it sings the body electric in clay, found materials, altered stuffed animals and photography (Smith).

* "IN FULL VIEW," Andrea Rosen, 525 West 24th Street, (212) 627-6000 (through Sept. 13). A show that invites visitors on a pluralistic treasure hunt for 18 artworks that tease one's limits of visual perception. Look for Christopher Chiappa's Ford Taurus gas-tank door built into the wall; Maurizio Cattelan's roosting stuffed pigeons; Vincent Shine's tiny, gold Brancusian wasp; Jim Hodges's jewelry-chain spiderweb and Charles Ray's classic "Rotating Disc" (Johnson).

"LIGHT AS AIR," Fischbach, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212) 759-2345 (through Aug. 22). Most remarkable of all in this 26-artist show is Victoria Gitman's actual-size picture of a moth-shaped silver brooch, its extremely fine filigree painted with eye-straining exactitude. Kevin King's painting of two white swans flying low at a man on railroad tracks is haunting; George Nick's picture of a Victorian house is juicy; and Meg Shields's small painting of an ordinary neighborhood with water tanks towering in the background is nostalgic but not sentimental (Johnson).

ANDREI MOLODKIN, Kashya Hildebrand, 531-539 West 25th Street, (212) 366-5757 (through Sept. 13). This skillful Russian draftsman has a heavy-handed way with popular and political symbols. He draws giant parodies of "I Love N.Y." or "I Love Sex" bumper stickers, replacing the valentine heart with anatomically accurate skulls. Also on view is a double portrait of Lenin and Stalin. What's most interesting is not the imagery but how these enormous drawings are made: entirely with a blue ballpoint pen (Johnson).

CARTER POTTER, "New Film Paintings," Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-2410 (through Aug. 15). Mr. Potter's "paintings" consist of yards of found movie stock stretched in horizontal bands around wooden frames. Including lengths of pure color, sequences of Disney cartoons and lots of illegible imagery, they glow like stained-glass windows while toying with Modernist abstraction, the cult of cinema and the promises and disappointments of new technology (Johnson)

JAMEL SHABAZZ, "Last Sunday in June," Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 352-2238 (through Aug. 15). Mr. Shabazz is the best kind of photojournalist: one driven simply by curiosity about other human beings. His pictures of the annual Gay Pride Parade participants, most in color, are like snapshots in a generously inclusive family album. All kinds pose happily for the camera: a pair of handsome black men dressed like twin schoolboys in white caps and shorts and mint-green shirts; a trio costumed to look like the Andrews Sisters; five laughing lesbians gathered as if at a college reunion (Johnson).

"SPLIT," Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, (646) 336-7183 (through Sept. 6). The best thing in this six-person show is Xavier Veilhan's bigger-than-life skeleton woven in wicker; it slouches casually in a corner of the gallery, a marvel of exotic faux-folk art. Note, too, a dense mix of cartoon characters and abstract patterning painted collaboratively in gouache by Christian Schumann and Gary Panter (Johnson).

JONATHAN TORGOVNIK, "Bollywood Dreams," Klotz/Sirmon, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 741-4764 (through Aug. 15). An accomplished photojournalist realizes his fascination with the world of Indian cinema -- better known as Bollywood -- in big, documentary color pictures. Mr. Togovnik's jam-packed images of moviegoers, actors, billboards and theaters mix the sacred and the profane with alternately fabulous and heartbreaking results (Johnson).

"VACATION," Spike, 547 West 20th Street, (212) 627-4100 (through Sept. 20). Innocence and experience collide in the works of Norm Magnusson, who outlines juvenile, coloring-book-style images over gridded fields of pages from pointedly selected books. Jesus offering guidance to a little boy is drawn over pages from Bulfinch's "Mythology," for example, and paper-doll clothes over "Lolita." Also on view: Buck Henri's engaging photographs of exotic dancers, old cars, mannequins, small-town parades and other subjects; Alan Schmer's illustrative paintings of farm animals; and Melissa Stern's pedestal-size figurative sculptures that blend surrealism and primitivism (Johnson).

Other Galleries

OLAV WESTPHALEN, "The First Long Island City Blimp Derby," Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750 (through Aug. 16). The Blimp Derby, produced by Mr. Westphalen, took place on June 28. You can still see the track painted on the floor where contestants steered their ungainly, remote-control miniature dirigibles; the lumpy, handmade and clumsily painted silver winner's trophy; and painted on one wall in delicate gray washes, an advertisement for the race sponsor, Budweiser (Johnson).

"DIRT WIZARD," Brooklyn Fire Proof, 101 Richardson Street, at Leonard Street, Williamsburg, (718) 302-4702 (through Aug. 18). Organized by the artist Kathy Grayson, this ambitious show of paintings, drawings and wall paintings uses the work of emerging artists like Keegan McHargue, Matt Leines, Maya Hayuk, Xylor Jane and Justin Samson. It highlights the graffiti-based drawing wizardry emanating from the East and West Coasts, as well as a spiritual and stylistic meeting of East and West in the global sense (Smith).

Last Chance

"BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY," David Zwirner Gallery, 525 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2070 (through today). This dense, wildly eclectic exhibition of art from the 1980's and early 90's is a memento mori to the fleetingness of time, fame and in some cases talent. It is based on the third issue of the magazine Charley, whose pages are culled from the art magazines and catalogs of the period (Smith).

TODD KNOPKE, "Group Sh/Deep Down," I-20 Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-1100 (through tomorrow). The two best things in Mr. Knopke's cheerfully fragmented show are a crude, life-size sculpture of five white, life-size wolves sitting in a tree, based on a psychoanalytic patient's dream famously written about by Freud, and a miniature closet built into the gallery wall at floor level. An 18-inch-tall bookcase filled with tiny volumes hinges open to reveal an electrically lighted interior with wire coat hangers, a polished, hardwood floor and a revolving disco ball (Johnson).

ELLEN KOOI, "(where the grass is green . . .)," P.P.O.W., 555 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 647-1044 (through today). The big, glossy, staged photograph made popular by Gregory Crewdson has reached retirement age, but the best of this Dutch artist's efforts are still divertingly dreamy, especially those of kneeling women shouting into curbside street drains or of a long line of people emerging from the sea (Johnson).

* "NOW PLAYING," D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)352-9460 (through today). This lively, don't-miss show combines three up-to-the-minute guest impresarios, Scott Hug, John Connolly and Daniel Reich. The collectivist spirit afoot blithely mixes media into environments. Gender-bending sex is pervasive. The operative analogy is a treasure hunt. Allusions fly to cartoons, fashion, hip-hop, television, neo-punk culture, pornography and Chinese landscape painting, with the 1960's a touchstone, consciously or otherwise, but the 60's through the darkening lens of later decades. Craft is slyly sold: the affect of slapdash construction belies studious art school craftsmanship and even the prevalence of a certain technical, market-conscious fussiness (Kimmelman).

"ONLINE," Feigen Contemporary, 535 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-0500 (through tomorrow). Not about Web art but about the traditional use of line, this 38-artist show includes too much that is only tangentially linear. But works like Daniel Zeller's intense fields resembling a zany topographical map, Hilary Harkness's fantasy of sexy female sailors drawn with Ingres-like refinement and Beth Campbell's branching diagram of her possible futures suggest that a more focused investigation of the varieties of linear expression in contemporary art would be worth pursuing (Johnson).

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
Black Theater: Beyond Definition

BYLINE:  By BRUCE WEBER 

DATELINE: WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., Aug. 7 

 BODY:
Maybe it's the obvious question here this week, during the semiannual National Black Theater Festival, which continues through Saturday at sites throughout this friendly, steamy Southern city. But ask for a definition of black theater, and no consensus really emerges. 
 Some suggest it's theater that celebrates black people and the black experience, as do a plethora of shows here this week based on real lives. They include the brassy, autobiographical concert show "From Brooklyn to Broadway II" being performed nightly to raucous applause by the actress and singer Lillias White, and a variety of thoughtful character habitations based on important cultural figures like Paul Robeson, Thelonious Monk, Dorothy Dandridge, Louis Armstrong and Lena Horne. (A query for black creators of biographical shows: Why so many entertainers as the subjects and so few plays about anyone else?) 
 In any case, celebration is not the only strain of performance that falls under the rubric of black theater. Another you might call defiant lamentation, the kind of show that focuses on the distressing history of black oppression and that is on display here in dramas like David Feldshuh's "Miss Evers' Boys," about the Tuskegee syphilis experiment; and "Memory Is a Body of Water," by Tanisha Christie and Lisa Biggs, which traces a theme of violence in the lives of black women, not entirely self-exculpatorily, from contemporary Washington back through the 20th century and even before the African diaspora. 
Some suggest black theater to be theater produced by black people, but that would exclude, for example, the Classical Theater of Harlem, whose revival of "The Blacks" by Jean Genet was one of the most provocative shows of last season off Broadway and which is educating a company of young black actors at warp speed but happens to be run by two white men.
Some suggest it's theater that focuses on the specific concerns of black people and black characters, but that makes you wonder why shows like Yvette Heyliger's "Hillary and Monica" (as in Clinton and Lewinsky) and a revival of Neil Simon's romantic comedy from the 1960's, "Barefoot in the Park" -- with the television actors Kim Fields and Ella Joyce -- are featured offerings at this year's festival. 
And black theater is obviously not confined to shows written by black men and women, as some instinctively suggest, because while that would include Ms. Heyliger, it would leave out not only Neil Simon and Mr. Feldshuh but the likes of Shakespeare and Euripides, whose "Medea" is represented here, mounted by a company from Jersey City called Ghetto Ghost Girl Productions.
The problem, of course, is that none of these deserves to be excluded, and no one wants to exclude them. It's just that black theater, always an elusive concept, has grown more so. In fact, if there is any theme to the sprawling, pleasantly chaotic festival this year (the seventh following the founding event in 1989), it is, well, inclusion. And that's not really to say that the festival -- or the world of black theater -- has spread its doors wide to let the mainstream in. The 40,000 or so attendees here this week are overwhelmingly black, and there are no more than a handful of nonblack performers to be seen onstage. It feels more as though the doors have opened inward and the world of black theater is streaming out.
"When I first got into it, it was about theater run by black people, about black people and located in black communities," said Larry Leon Hamlin, the festival's founder and still its artistic director. "But we can no longer hold on to such a small notion of ourselves."
Mr. Hamlin, a man with sleepy eyes but the shrewdly shameless enthusiasm of a good showman -- "Marvtastic!" is his favorite self-coined locution, generally applied to the state of affairs here this week -- began the festival to help unite the fragmented and financially challenged galaxy of black theaters around the country. He puts the number of such theaters at about 300, most of which -- like his own North Carolina Black Repertory Company, which puts on three or four shows a year in a rented space on a budget of about $500,000 -- are small enough to live beneath the radar of mainstream regional theater. 
Even collectively, these companies rarely seem to break into whatever national conversation exists about the art and business of the stage. And aside from being a side issue in the intermittent debate over nontraditional casting, the idea of black theater rarely emerges for discussion. 
In fact, when it did, famously, in 1997, in a public debate between the critic and director Robert Brustein and the playwright August Wilson, the impression was clearly left that black theater had virtually disappeared. Mr. Brustein took issue with Mr. Wilson's contention that black people needed to concentrate on producing theater by, about and for themselves. And Mr. Wilson, who was an enthusiastic attendee of the first festival here, made the memorable point that only one of the 66 members of the League of Resident Theaters, the leading association of nonprofit theater companies, was a black theater. Since then, that theater, Crossroads Theater in New Brunswick, N.J., has gone out of business. But the entire discussion failed to account for the companies that are routinely represented at this festival.
"August is, of course, entitled to his opinion about black theater," Mr. Hamlin said. "But there are others of us who are in the trenches of it. We see things a little differently. We say we are very much alive." He added, "Black theater will be viable as long as there is racism, injustice and inhumanity practiced against us."
The growth and success of the festival are measurable in myriad ways. Its 31 productions this year are up from 17 in 1989; the number of individual performances up from 31 to well over 100. The budget has tripled, from $500,000 in 1989, to about $1.5 million today, about half of which is expected to be paid for through ticket sales. 
The festival has been embraced by Winston-Salem, about 40 percent of whose 180,000 residents are black. The city supports the event to the tune of $150,000, making it the festival's biggest donor, and no wonder. The festival makes an $11 million contribution to the city economy in five days, Mayor Allen Joines said. 
Mr. Joines, who characterizes Winston-Salem as being in transition from a tobacco-and textile-based economy to an information-based one, said the festival was crucial to the city's reputation as an arts-friendly, sophisticated place, home to five colleges and universities (including Wake Forest and the North Carolina School of the Arts), a growing financial-services industry, one of the nation's largest training hospitals and what city officials claim to be the country's oldest arts council. (It was founded in 1949.)
"The intangible benefit is that it promotes our efforts to let people know we are a quality city," said Mr. Joines, who, not incidentally, served as the festival's fund-raising chairman.
But none of this quite explains the uniqueness of this event, which has to do with its, well, lack of focus. That's hardly a criticism; it turns out to be a strength. 
Unlike other theater festivals or conferences where the offerings are themed, where the professional attendees are from narrowly defined groups (producers looking for new work and agents looking for new talent, for example) and where the audiences tend to be tourist-heavy or local-citizen heavy, the National Black Theater Festival has an almost impossibly wide range of constituencies. It serves aspiring writers, directors and performers with dozens of impromptu readings and open auditions. It's an opportunity for young artists to gain public exposure for their work in an encouraging setting. 
"The vibe is like performing for your family," said Gregory Morrison, a 30-year-old writer and actor from Washington who goes by the stage name Psalmayene 24. His impressive one-man-work in progress, "Free Jujube Brown," melds Eric Bogosian-like character monologues with the language and movement of hip-hop, all in the service of a narrative about a young black man who has been jailed for shooting a cop under disputed circumstances. Mr. Morrison performed it here at the festival in a hotel banquet room.
The festival is also a showcase for artists hoping to raise funds for their productions. At the end of Laurence Holder's "Monk," a one-man show about the tormented genius of the jazz piano, starring and directed by Rome Neal, the actor appealed to members of the audience for investors for an Off Broadway production of the show this fall. "I got some people who are interested," he said later.
The theatergoers come from all over the place, it seems, and for all kinds of reasons. There was Betty Sessions, for example, a stamp collector from Washington with an inclination toward historical plays like "A Prisoner of Passion: The Paul Robeson Story." She was attending her third festival, she said, "just because I love the arts." There was Lydia Barnes, a stage manager and director at the Paul Robeson Theater in Buffalo, who was attracted by the opportunity to see new works. "There's a juice here that you get from being around others in your industry," she said. 
And then there was the gaggle of high-school sorority sisters from around the state of North Carolina who were agog at the bling-bling, to use the prevalent argot for stars.
Indeed, the celebrity quotient was substantial. Diahann Carroll received an opening-night award, and the likes of Malcolm Jamal-Warner (whose own one-man show, "Love and Other Social Issues," has its premiere on Friday), Melba Moore, CCH Pounder and Richard Roundtree (usually with a six-inch cigar in his mouth: "my all-night sucker," he said) wandered easily and unobtrusively about, to be gawked at, engaged in conversation and asked for autographs or career advice. (Ben Vereen canceled at the last minute, but flowers addressed to him did show up in my hotel room, for some reason.)
Available for all of them is an extraordinary variety of shows -- from the Greeks to hip-hop; from the polish of television professionals doing Neil Simon to the moving, rawly expressed experiences of former convicts, the work of the Medea Project in San Francisco; and yes, the pretentious and self-righteous as well as the understated and accomplished. 
For me, a first-time visitor, the festival's vitality, not to mention its sheer size, has been a revelation, vivid proof of the vibrancy of a community of theater professionals that is routinely presumed moribund and an audience that is routinely described as untapped.
"There are these perceptions: 'We don't go to the theater,' 'We're not sophisticated,' " said Malik Yoba, an actor probably best known for his starring role in television's "New York Undercover." 
"But this," he said, gesturing around him in a hotel restaurant crowded with festivalgoers, "is my home, culturally, artistically, economically."
Mr. Yoba has his own theatrical production company geared to what he refers to as "the urban theater market."
"My daddy told me, 'Build your own generator, so when they turn off the power, you have lights.' "

 CORRECTION:
A Critic's Notebook article in Weekend on Friday about the National Black Theater Festival in Winston-Salem, N.C., misstated the situation of the Crossroads Theater in New Brunswick, N.J. Although it did close in 2000, it held an abbreviated season in 2002-03 and is planning four productions for its 25th anniversary season, in 2003-04, in partnership with the Kennedy Center. It has not gone out of business.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The economic and human costs of incarceration highlighted in "The Growing Inmate Population" (editorial, Aug. 1) are magnified for women, the fastest-growing segment of the criminal justice system. 
 The majority of incarcerated women are mothers. The increase in female incarceration has significant consequences for children, families and neighborhoods. 
In New York State, approximately 50 percent of women in prison are incarcerated for drug-related offenses; 69 percent for nonviolent offenses. By devoting more resources to community corrections with treatment, job-training and family preservation services -- which are far more cost-effective than arrest and imprisonment -- we can begin to reverse this trend and its devastating effects on children, families and communities.

HEADLINE: 4 Mexican Banks Still Fight Government Over '99 Bailout 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH MALKIN 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
A dispute over the auditing of bad loans sold to the government by four of Mexico's leading retail banks after the 1995 banking crisis is reopening one of the murkiest chapters in the country's recent financial history.
 It is also creating a political headache for the bankers, who want to sweep the remnants of the debacle from their balance sheets. 
 Prodded by Congress, the government agency that inherited $6 billion in nonperforming loans from the four banks in 1999 wants to do a careful review to see whether it is holding credits that were not allowed under the sale agreements. The loans have swelled to some $20 billion with interest, or about one-fifth of the estimated total cost of the bank bailout. 
But the banks have resisted the review, pointing to a 1999 report prepared for Congress as evidence that they have already been audited, and tying up the new demands with legal challenges in Mexico's glacial judicial system. 
Both the legislators and the agency, the Institute for the Protection of Bank Savings, known widely as IPAB, an acronym of its Spanish name, say that new audits could uncover improper loans that the banks might have to take back. And that, they say, could help chip away at the overall cost of the rescue.
"Nobody seems interested in finding those who are responsible, in finding solutions to the things that are stuck in the law's inefficiencies and to recover the money," said Jorge Carlos Ramirez Marin, a congressman from the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party, who is pushing for the audits.
Legislators from President Vicente Fox's National Action Party joined the other two mainpolitical parties Wednesday in a formal demand for the audits, raising the pressure on the banks to drop their legal challenges and agree to the reviews.
If no agreement is reached soon, the political heat could rise even further when a new Congress, with legislators who have been among the angriest critics of the bank rescue, convenes on Sept. 1.
The congressional auditor, who revises annual government spending, has, meanwhile, come up with his own numbers, although he did not have access to all relevant documents. In a report released July 28, he estimated that the IPAB was holding some $2 billion in loans that the four banks should not have passed to the government.
His authority to demand the return is also under legal challenge.
Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service have estimated that the ultimate cost of the rescue of the banking industry could reach $100 billion including interest -- more as a percentage of gross domestic product than the savings and loan crisis in the United States.
That figure covers a hodgepodge of programs that policy makers came up with as the banking crisis deepened after 1995. Along with the purchase of bad loans and debtor relief plans, the government also took over banks that collapsed under corrupt or inept management.
Only the four banks now fighting with the oversight agency survived: the Banamex unit of Citigroup; BBVA Bancomer, which is controlled by the Spanish banking group Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria; Banorte, owned by a Mexican business group; and Bital, purchased last year by HSBC Holdings.
The global banks stepped in to buy the banks from Mexican shareholders long after the bad loans were sold.
Under the convoluted terms of the bank rescue plan, the government may have a hard time reducing the total cost. 
Many members of Congress say they believe that opening the ledgers will show how bankers lent to their wealthy friends and then passed on the losses to the government. It could also embarrass officials who served in the government of President Ernesto Zedillo who were in charge of the bank rescue, including a former finance minister, Guillermo Ortiz, now the central bank governor.
The four banks argue that the IPAB and Congress are on a fishing expedition, looking for somewhere to lay the blame.
"The banks' position is that the IPAB's criteria are too general," said Jorge Hierro, executive director of institutional affairs at Banamex.
For now, the banks have won injunctions limiting the scope of any new audits and blocking the IPAB's access to crucial documents.
Attempts by the Finance Ministry to broker a deal have foundered, though negotiations continue.
Adding to the pressure, next year Congress will face the question of how to repay the zero-coupon bonds the government gave the banks in exchange for the bad loans -- bonds that were never approved by Congress.
Counting interest and bonds passed to banks that the government later took over and sold, almost $17 billion comes due in 2005 and an additional $7.4 billion matures in 2006, the two heaviest years for repayments, according to a Moody's study. 
"There's no way that Congress is going to be able to approve $17 billion to pay out to the banks," said Jonathan Heath, chief Mexico economist for Latinsource, a network of independent economists throughout Latin America. "At the same time, you would have to argue that they can't default on that debt, either."
Under the 1998 law setting up the IPAB, the original bonds were to have been replaced by now with new congressionally sanctioned bonds after an audit of the loans.
The banks want new congressionally approved bonds because they take the uncertainty off their balance sheets. But the IPAB, which is in charge of the bond exchange, says the audits must be carried out first.
"The banks are obviously defending their economic interests," said Roberto Barrera, a spokesman for IPAB.
At the heart of the dispute remain many unanswered questions about the near-collapse of Mexico's banking system after the December 1994 peso devaluation. Even now, the issue infuriates the public.
Mexicans want a full accounting of who benefited from the loans that bankers made to their friends without investigating the ventures' viability. Though these loans were not illegal, they raised ethical concerns and may prove to have been improperly sold to the government.
An example that became public was that of Grupo Sidek, a conglomerate that built up $2.1 billion in debt in the early 1990's with investments in tourism and real estate. One of Sidek's top two executives sat on the Banamex board while the other, his brother, sat on Bancomer's.
The congressional auditor estimates that Banamex, BBVA Bancomer and Banorte unloaded about $300 million in Sidek loans on the government.
And the bank rescue program has left the public with a sense that the rich benefited and nobody was held responsible.
At Banamex, for instance, the owners received $12.5 billion tax-free when they sold to Citigroup in 2001, just four years after Banamex sold $2.6 billion in bad loans. Even now, the government bonds account for 10 percent of the bank's balance sheet.
Another irritant is that despite the billions spent to keep the banks alive, most Mexicans still have almost no access to credit.
Mr. Hierro of Banamex says that his and the three other banks in the audit dispute are being singled out because they are the main banks still standing. Those that were taken over, and from which no loans can be recouped, account for the bulk of the rescue cost, some 80 percent, the surviving banks say.
In the 1999 report prepared for Congress that the banks are using as proof they have already been audited, the auditor, Michael W. Mackey, a Canadian accountant, complained that both the banks and government agencies dragged their feet in giving him information. Hampered by banking secrecy laws, his report offered only general sums of the costs of the overall bank rescue program and did not name specific banks or detail the loans they sold.
Over all, Mr. Mackey reported only $638 million in illegal loans held by the government. But he counted an additional $7.1 billion in "reportable" -- or questionable -- loans, either because they were not included in the original loan purchase agreements or because they involved loans to bank shareholders or other associates. So the dispute has persisted.
"I think the only way to really solve it is to take the operations that are 'reportable' and carry out a legal audit on those specific operations," Mr. Heath, the analyst, said. "Let's get it over with."

HEADLINE: Chevrolet Aims to Take Lead From Ford With Nine New Models 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: TRAVERSE CITY, Mich., Aug. 7 

 BODY:
The Chevrolet division of General Motors plans to introduce nine new models over 20 months, starting in January, setting up a battle to overtake the Ford brand as the nation's top seller.
 "This product barrage should help get Chevy back to selling three million cars and trucks a year," said Gary L. Cowger, president of G.M.'s North American operations. 
 The comments were made in a speech today at an auto management conference here. In other news at the conference, a top Honda safety official said the company had been redesigning its vehicles with the aim of reducing injuries to pedestrians, an issue that has caught the attention of regulators in Japan and Europe but has been largely overlooked in the United States market. Of the 42,815 traffic-related deaths last year in the United States, 4,808 were pedestrians. 
"Five thousand is not a small number," said Tomiji Sugimoto, senior chief safety engineer at Honda. 
Mr. Cowger said that G.M. was developing a new crossover vehicle, the Chevrolet HHR, as part of its product assault. The vehicle would very likely compete most directly with the Chrysler Group's PT Cruiser and, like it, would be manufactured on a base used to make small cars. The designer of the PT Cruiser, Bryan Nesbitt, is now a G.M. executive who oversees the design of cars as well as crossover vehicles, a rapidly growing category that combines car and S.U.V. attributes. 
Mr. Cowger said that the vehicle would have a retro design similar to the 1949 Chevrolet Suburban, a vehicle with some characteristics of the modern sport utility vehicle. G.M. is taking a similar approach with the Chevrolet SSR, a combination of pickup, convertible and two-seat sports car that is set for its debut later this year. Both the SSR and HHR recall the curvy, almost anthropomorphic look of trucks from an era when men wore fedoras, in contrast to the more militaristic bearing of today's pickups and S.U.V.'s. But while the SSR has a price starting above $40,000 and will be produced in limited numbers, Mr. Cowger described the HHR, which will make its debut in the 2006 model year, as a much more affordable vehicle meant for high-volume production. 
Because of its design, it could also help G.M. comply with fuel economy regulations, which the Bush administration has notched up slightly for light trucks, the regulatory category that encompasses S.U.V.'s, pickups and minivans. 
"What this allows us to do is have a crossover that is much more fuel- efficient, aimed at young families," Mr. Cowger said. 
Though G.M. is the largest automaker in unit sales, Ford is the best-selling brand, with just under 3 million vehicles sold last year, compared with 2.64 million vehicles for Chevrolet, according to the Autodata Corporation. Through July, fewer than 170,000 vehicles separate the two brands this year. 
"If they keep cutting Chevy prices, the three million is doable," said David B. Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities. 
"Whether they can do so without hitting the bottom line is questionable, and Ford has a lot of new iron coming," he said. The products include a redesigned F-Series pickup this year and a crossover wagon, the Freestyle, next year, and two new sedans by 2005 to replace the Taurus. 
The Honda executive, Mr. Sugimoto, said that his company was the first to develop a pedestrian crash-test dummy and make pedestrian safety a priority. 
Mr. Sugimoto said that his company was focusing its efforts on head injuries, which account for more than half of pedestrian fatalities, and had integrated designs aimed at this issue on most of its new vehicles. The new Honda Accord has such enhancements, including a hood that bends somewhat, a redesigned fender that has more give and wiper mechanisms that are more forgiving when struck. 
The fender and wiper changes reduce the chance of serious head injury by two-thirds if the head hits those specific areas, Mr. Sugimoto said. Over all, the company predicts the changes could reduce pedestrian fatalities from Honda accidents each year by at least 5 percent.
Much of the conference was consumed with talk of the increasingly difficult conditions of the United States market. The auto industry has long been used to cycles of low volume and scant profits followed by high volume and big profits. But a prolonged period of healthy sales, but huge buyer incentives -- $4,000 rebates and interest-free financing -- has sapped profits and led to questions about the industry's basic structure. 
"What we have now is high volume and low profits, so volume itself is not going to heal the industry; that means you need structural change and to change the business model itself," said David E. Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research, which sponsored the conference along with the University of Michigan. 
Mr. Cowger said "it's a tough market out there right now," but added, on a more optimistic note, that he believed that the sharp increases in incentives would be "mitigated" by a recovering economy in the second half of the year. 
Joe Eberhardt, Chrysler's new marketing chief, said, "We are unable to escape the environment of the deal," adding that "today's unworkable market contest must come to an end."

HEADLINE: Productivity Jumps Again As Job Creation Remains Slow 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
The productivity of the nation's workers climbed at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in the second quarter, the government reported today, an increase that was good news for corporate profits but that also heightened fears about a jobless economic recovery.
 The increase was higher than most economists expected and nearly three times the pace of the previous three months. 
 In general, big increases in productivity are bright spots for the economy because they mean that production and wages can rise faster than would otherwise be possible without aggravating inflation.
The big surprise over the last two years is that American productivity has continued to increase briskly throughout the recession and then far longer than is typical after the recession ended. 
But almost all of the improvement has come at the expense of job creation, which is why unemployment has remained stubbornly high -- 6.2 percent in July -- long after the recession technically ended in late 2001.
And though rising productivity has led to an increase in corporate profits over the last several months, many economists also warn that an extended stretch of comparatively high joblessness could eventually choke off the weak recovery.
"If you can't get the labor market going by next spring, as the stimulus of tax cuts begins to fade, there is a very significant risk that the expansion will start to sputter," said Bruce Kasman, an economist at J. P. Morgan Chase.
For the moment, most economists say that they think the higher productivity will contribute to a significant jump in economic growth and ultimately to a jump in new jobs.
Indeed, the government also provided some evidence today that the optimists could be proved right. New claims for unemployment benefits fell by 3,000, to 390,000, for the week ended Aug. 2. It was the third consecutive week that new jobless claims were below 400,000, and many economists consider that to be a sign that the labor market has stabilized.
"We are already seeing some signs of stability in the labor market," said Peter D'Antonio, an economist at Citigroup. "We have not had three consecutive numbers below 400,000 in six months. It's looking like a trend."
Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, said he remained nervous about the weakness of the labor market but nonetheless viewed the sharp improvement in productivity as a good omen.
"This is the most fundamental reason to be optimistic about the economy's prospects," Mr. Zandi said today. "An economy that was flawed could not produce these kinds of gains, and the benefits of these gains have to accrue to somebody." 
American productivity continues to grow significantly faster than that in Europe or Japan, and that difference is a primary reason the American economy has consistently outpaced those of the euro-zone countries over the last decade.
But the nature of the increased improvement in the United States has changed drastically since the end of the economic boom of the late 1990's. Back then, much of the improvement was coming from huge corporate investments in technology, which greatly increased the output of individual workers.
But technology spending has been weak since the stock market bubble burst three years ago, and business investment over all has been the weakest segment of the economy for the last several years.
Instead, companies have shifted strategy and hunted relentlessly for every possible way to squeeze more production out of the remaining workers.
"What this is telling us is that we have a more structural change, that we have become more efficient at using capital than we used to be," Mr. D'Antonio said.
The most widespread view among economists is that the higher profits made possible by cost-cutting will eventually lead to an increase in overall business activity and a resumption of hiring. 
The hope is that the Bush administration's recently passed tax cuts, which include rate reductions as well as immediate rebates for families that claim child tax credits, will increase consumer demand for the next six to nine months. By that time, economists say, increased sales will have forced companies to start expanding both their factories and their work forces.
"You can't just increase your productivity gains like this forever," said Alan D. Levenson, chief economist at T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore-based mutual fund company. 
But even those who agree are cautious. Manufacturing in the United States remains stagnant, with ever greater numbers of domestic producers being eclipsed by low-wage rivals in China.
"I agree with the consensus," said Mr. Zandi of Economy.com. But he added, "It's not hard to paint alternative, darker scenarios."

A Marriage, and Divorce, of Convenience at Verizon

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

 BODY:
Negotiations between Verizon Communications and its two main unions appeared to grow more thorny yesterday, with a settlement now unlikely in the next few days.
 But while the company and its workers currently find themselves on opposite sides of the bargaining table, they have often found themselves fighting on the same side, lobbying politicians and petitioning regulators. 
 Organized labor has for years helped the industry push its political and regulatory agenda. But that help has come at a price. In supporting management's efforts to, for example, break into the long-distance market, unions have earned concessions for their members. 
This kind of relationship extends beyond Verizon, with labor being an influential supporter of major telecommunications companies like SBC and BellSouth with regulators. Indeed, industry analysts assert that while it is not uncommon for unions and management to work together on regulatory issues, the level of cooperation in telecommunications is perhaps more pronounced and sustained than in any other industry.
"The depth of the alliance is quite unusual," said Harry C. Katz, a professor of collective bargaining at Cornell University. "It's been an interesting strategic move by the C.W.A.," Mr. Katz said of the Communications Workers of America, the industry's largest union, "to take advantage of its political clout and link it to collective bargaining goals and organizing." 
Labor and management have said their relationship has been fruitful because both sides have an interest in seeing companies grow in a way that leads to more jobs and better benefits and wages. 
But there are questions about whether this symbiotic relationship can continue to thrive, said Scott Cleland, chief executive of the Precursor Group, a research firm.
Mr. Cleland said cooperation between labor and management is cooling because the companies feel the biggest regulatory battles are behind them and they are under such financial duress that they have to cut jobs, even if that means losing political support from the unions.
The unions' "political support largely gave them a pass from cost-cutting," Mr. Cleland said. "But now the industry is melting down." He noted that there were only two ways to pare expenses: cut investment and cut jobs.
Union and management have said that their cooperation does not typically manifest itself as a quid pro quo, where a union demands specific benefits in exchange for supporting a particular political position. Rather, the understandings have been more general: The union supports positions that would economically benefit the company (like helping it win approval to compete in new markets) with the company then weighing that benefit in its labor relations.
That cooperation was in evidence last week. Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers union, testified in front of Congress, urging legislators to suspend embattled MCI from receiving new federal contracts. MCI, which is not unionized, competes with AT&T, Verizon, SBC and the other telecommunications giants with heavy union memberships. During his testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Bahr sat beside William Barr, Verizon's general counsel.
The union was also active in the fight over whether telephone companies should be required to lease lines to competitors at discounted prices. The Federal Communications Commission ruled this year to enforce the leasing requirement -- going against the position taken by the union and the companies it works with.
The union has filed numerous petitions in more than two dozen states since 2000 to assist former Bell telephone companies in winning approval to offer long-distance service. 
"In some cases, our lobbyists go to the Hill with their lobbyists and show a united front," said Jeff Miller, a spokesman for the C.W.A., noting the union's efforts can bolster the generally strong ties the corporations have with the Republican Party. "We have obviously stronger ties with Democrats and it's been helpful to them to be able to join forces."
But Mr. Miller agreed with Mr. Cleland, from the Precursor Group, that the companies feel they are now less in need of labor's lobbying support. "Now that they've gotten the mergers they wanted," he said, "they think we have less leverage to offer them in the regulatory area."
Of course, the political efforts of the unions are not always in support of the companies. In New York, for example, the Communications Workers of America has presented state regulators and legislators with evidence it says shows that Verizon's cuts to investment and labor have hurt customer service -- encouraging state officials to take a closer look at Verizon's performance.
Still, Eric Rabe, a spokesman for Verizon, said that the company had benefited from labor's political muscle. "It's certainly helpful anytime you get somebody weighing in," Mr. Rabe said. He noted that the union was "certainly helpful and supportive" in urging the Department of Justice, the F.C.C. and individual states to approve the merger of Nynex and Bell Atlantic in 1997 and then the additional merger with GTE that created Verizon in 2000. 
At that time, the union gave its support in part because the company made a number of promises not to move work from one location to another. Mr. Rabe said Verizon has since "extended" those agreements, but the agreements were not meant to stand in perpetuity, and that the current business situation is "quite different from the environment of the past."
Mr. Miller countered that the agreements made at the time were meant to "govern the new merged company" and should be sustained.

HEADLINE: Younger Blacks Tell Democrats To Take Notice 

BYLINE:  By LYNETTE CLEMETSON 

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark. 

 BODY:
The debate had become a familiar one for LaShannon Spencer. As director of political affairs for the Democratic Party of Arkansas, Ms. Spencer, 30, is charged with taking the pulse of voters and keeping them connected to the party. 
 But at Cajun's Wharf, a restaurant and bar on the banks of the Arkansas River that is popular with young professionals, Ms. Spencer's political pitch was met with skepticism. 
 "Democrats just assume my political affiliation, based on my ZIP code or voting precinct," said Khayyam Eddings, a 31-year-old labor lawyer, referring to his predominantly black neighborhood. He was one of three African-American men engaged with Ms. Spencer in an animated discussion. "I don't cast my ballot based on learned behavior." 
Mr. Eddings's comments were emblematic of what some Democratic strategists fear may be a growing problem: The party is perilously out of touch with a large swath of black voters -- those 18 to 35years old who grew up after the groundbreaking years of the civil rights movement. It is a group too important and complex to ignore, many strategists caution, when analysts are predicting another close election. 
Democrats have traditionally counted on more than 90 percent of the black vote. Blacks 18 to 35 make up about 40 percent of the black voting-age population, but turnout among young blacks was so low in the 2000 elections that they made up only 2 percent of the entire vote.
Democratic leaders are expressing concern about the disengagement. Young blacks are responding by warning the party not to take their votes for granted.
"Not only do I not see myself as part of the base," Nnamdi Thompson, a 30-year-old investment banker, told Ms. Spencer at the restaurant, "I wish the Democratic Party would stop seeing me as part of its base. We have more power as voters if they have to come and court us."
A 32-year-old lawyer, a friend of the other two who did not want his name used because he is in state politics, said: "I question whether the party sees us at all. First they calculate who they do not want" to alienate. "Then they decide on acceptable losses. We seem to fall into the acceptable losses." 
Ms. Spencer, who is also African-American, said their frustrations were not unusual. "These are the concerns I hear over and over," she said. "These are people who care, people the party needs. If we could only convince them of that." 
Over the years, African-Americans have proved a reliable source of support for Democrats, whom they viewed as more responsive than Republicans to their issues and concerns. But members of Generations X and Y, reared on hip-hop and the Internet, in a niche-market culture, are proving to be a tougher sell.
While still more closely aligned with Democrats than Republicans on issues like affirmative action and health care, younger blacks are more open to at least exploring initiatives shunned by the Democratic Party, like school vouchers and partial privatization of Social Security, polls show. 
Polls also indicate that younger blacks place a higher priority than older African-Americans on issues like racial profiling and protecting civil liberties. 
In 2000, 74 percent of African-Americans identified themselves as Democrats. By last year, that number had dropped to 63 percent, according to a recent survey by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a research group devoted to African-American issues.
Those shifting away from the Democratic Party are not necessarily becoming Republicans. An overwhelming majority of blacks still vote Democratic. But an increasing number, especially those 18 to 35, are identifying themselves as independents. Some 24 percent of black adults now characterize themselves that way. Among those 35 and under, said David Bositis, a senior researcher at the Joint Center who conducted the survey, the figures are 30 percent to 35 percent, with men leaning more heavily independent than women.
For Democrats, the downside of weaker partisan ties is twofold. Unlike older blacks, many of whom vote consistently because they remember a time when they could not, younger blacks are more prone to sit out an election if no candidate grabs their interest. And even if they are not registered Republicans, younger blacks are more open to supporting Republican candidates and issues than older blacks. Sylvester Smith, 27, whose mother was a Democratic state legislator in Arkansas, is a policy adviser for minority affairs for Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, a Republican.
"I have a Frederick Douglass philosophy," said Mr. Smith, who voted for Al Gore in the 2000 presidential race and remains a registered Democrat. "I believe African-Americans have no permanent friends and no permanent enemies, only permanent interests."
For Democratic leaders the trends are a worrying sign that their base, as it has traditionally been defined, is not as stable as it used to be. "This is very disconcerting for us going forward," said Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. "It is critical that we do a better job of connecting."
If state party campaign plans do not include "integral, aggressive outreach strategies" aimed at young nonwhite voters," Mr. McAuliffe said, "they will not be approved and funded" by the national committee.
The move by younger African-Americans away from strong partisan affiliation mirrors that of younger whites. But Mr. Bositis and others studying the issue argue that the shift in African-American behavior is more damaging for the Democratic Party because of its heavy dependence on black voters.
Cornell Belcher, a pollster who specializes in minority and youth constituencies, contends the message in the trends is clear. "This group really should be considered swing voters to be targeted specifically," he said. "But if you look at or listen to the typical political ads aimed at black voters, there is a huge disconnect with younger blacks."
When Michael L. Steele, a black Republican, ran for lieutenant governor of Maryland with Robert L. Erlich Jr. in 2002, he hired a consultant to design radio advertisements specifically for the state's major hip-hop radio stations. Tapping into frustration among black voters over the fact that Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the Democratic candidate for governor, had chosen a white running mate, the radio spots used tag lines like, "Why must African-Americans always wait?" 
Mr. Erlich and Mr. Steele won the election, ending a 36-year Democratic hold on the Statehouse. The team not only swung traditionally Democratic white voters, it also received 14 percent of the black vote, the largest percentage of African-American votes ever for a Republican ticket in Maryland. In Baltimore, one of the areas deluged with the hip-hop radio spots, the ticket won 30 percent of the black vote.
"Republicans took a pass on the civil rights agenda in the late 50's and early 60's, and it cost us," Mr. Steele, 44, said. "This is a door that has opened, and we can't let this pass." The Republican Party is pushing a series of political training seminars to groom nonwhite candidates. 
In January, Democrats announced the formation of an African-American Leadership Council, aimed at black voters 18 to 35. Among its objectives is getting one million young African-Americans to register as Democrats and to vote in the next presidential election. 
Some younger blacks around the country have taken strategic outreach into their own hands. In the 2002 campaign season, James Gee, 31, deputy chief of staff for Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey, a Democrat, developed a test program aimed at younger voters called the Six Degrees Project. The program, which focused on Trenton, the majority black state capital, took a group of 140 voters and asked each of them to get 20 friends to the polls on Election Day. Using a computer program to cross reference and track the voters down to their voting station, team leaders were able to call their charges on Election Day if they failed to vote by the time they said they would. 
While overall voter turnout in Trenton was a rather dismal 14 percent, it was 78 percent among the roughly 2,800 people in the Six Degrees Project. Mr. Gee said he would like for the state party to expand on the program.
"Rather than having candidates showing up in black churches preaching and waving a week before elections," Mr. Gee said, "I'd rather see us use a real quantitative approach to targeting black voters."

HEADLINE: Pataki Warns of Financial Consequences if Racing Agency Is Indicted in Tax Fraud 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
New York State stands to lose millions of dollars in gambling revenue if federal prosecutors decide to seek an indictment against the New York Racing Association on tax fraud charges, the Pataki administration has informed the United States attorney's office in Brooklyn.
 Gov. George E. Pataki authorized his former counsel, James M. McGuire, to represent his administration at a meeting on Tuesday between prosecutors and racing association officials. The meeting was to discuss the possibility of avoiding an indictment with a negotiated settlement. Mr. McGuire said he told the prosecutors at the meeting that he was not there to discourage the pursuit of an indictment, but he did lay out the economic consequences for the state. 
 "I made it crystal clear at the outset that I was not urging the government not to indict," he said in an interview today. "And I made it clear at the outset I was not there on a particular side."
Prosecutors are weighing whether to seek an indictment of the racing association, a quasi-public corporation that operates the Aqueduct, Belmont Park and Saratoga racetracks, on charges of conspiracy to commit tax fraud. The three-year-old investigation flowed from the arrests of 16 parimutuel clerks on charges of tax evasion and 3 on charges of money laundering, in cases that have painted a picture of a gambling operation in which extremely lax accounting and auditing were the norm.
The investigation centers on whether the managers at the tracks knew about or could have stopped the criminal activity. Racing officials have proposed paying a civil fine as an alternative to the criminal charges. They have also argued that an indictment would jeopardize their simulcasting contracts and could make it impossible to get bank loans for the installation of video lottery terminals at Aqueduct, terminals that the state government is counting on to generate revenue.
Mr. McGuire's role in the meeting was first reported in today's editions of The Times Union in Albany.
Mr. McGuire said lawyers for the racing association had invited him to come to the meeting because, as a former counsel to Mr. Pataki, he had expertise on the racing organization and on the way an indictment would affect its efforts to install video lottery machines. He then contacted the governor, who approved his involvement and gave him the authority to speak for the administration. He was not paid to attend the meeting. He said he had also contacted the state ethics commission, which told him that his involvement would not break state ethics laws.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki said he was not trying to influence the decision of the United States attorney's office. "The governor believes the federal prosecutors should take whatever action that they deem appropriate under the law," said the spokeswoman, Suzanne Morris.
The governor and Mr. McGuire both have close political ties to the United States attorney in Brooklyn, Roslynn R. Mauskopf, but she has recused herself from the case because she previously served as the governor's inspector general. 
The presence of Mr. McGuire, who served as the governor's counsel for eight years before entering private practice in January, underscores the importance of the matter to the Pataki administration. It also reflects the political power of the racing association, whose board members give hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to Democrats and Republicans.
Members of the racing association's board, for instance, have given Mr. Pataki $219,000 since 1999. The State Senate Republican Campaign Committee, controlled by Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, an upstate Republican and a supporter of the association, has received $141,000 in the same period.
Senator Bruno, who has defended the current management of the tracks, said the Senate's Republican majority was also worried that an indictment of the organization could delay the installation of video lottery games at Aqueduct, according to his spokesman, John McArdle. The State Legislature had hoped that the gambling devices at racetracks would bring in as much as $150 million this year and at least $360 million in each of the following years.
As if to underscore the threat to state revenues, the association announced late this evening that it had suspended the construction of a gaming building at Aqueduct that was to house the new video lottery terminals, because its partner in the venture, MGM Mirage, said it could not go forward with the deal if the racing organization was indicted.
Barry K. Schwartz, the racing association's chief executive and chairman, did not return telephone calls from a reporter, but released a prepared statement: "Obviously I am disappointed that recent developments have put hundreds of millions of dollars for education, purses and breeders' awards in serious jeopardy. Nevertheless, I remain optimistic that the legal matters will be sorted out and the V.L.T. project will get back on track."
The racing association has come under fire from many sides recently. In June, the state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat, issued a lengthy report describing criminal activity in the betting booths, where clerks used the cash boxes to launder money, make loans, gamble and cheat bettors. The report mirrored the findings of the State Racing and Wagering Board, which issued its own scathing critique of the lax controls over money at the racetracks in March.
"These are state-owned facilities that simply aren't well managed," said Mr. Spitzer's spokesman, Darren Dopp. "There is overwhelming evidence of problems."

HEADLINE: In New York, Hispanics Hold Bleaker Views 

BYLINE:  By MIREYA NAVARRO and MARJORIE CONNELLY

 BODY:
Hispanics in New York City are unhappier with their government and more pessimistic about the economy than Hispanics in the nation as a whole, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll has found. In many ways, the poll shows, they hold opinions that are closer to those of their fellow New Yorkers than to those of Hispanics in the rest of the country.
 The differences are more pronounced among the city's largest Hispanic subgroup, Puerto Ricans, who are more likely to have been born in the 50 states, or to have lived there longer, than Hispanics from other countries. When their responses are removed from the poll results, the responses of the Dominicans, Mexicans and Ecuadoreans who make up most of the rest of New York's polyglot Hispanic population are often more in line with the responses by Hispanics elsewhere, who are predominantly of Mexican descent. 
 In New York, however, 79 percent of Puerto Ricans are registered to vote, making them more likely than other Hispanics to express their opinions in a voting booth. 
Over all, 51 percent of Hispanics in New York City said they disapproved of the way President Bush was handling his job, as did 61 percent of non-Hispanics in the city. Nationwide, only 38 percent of Hispanics and 41 percent of non-Hispanics disapproved of the president's performance.
The unhappiness among New York's Hispanics extends to local leaders like Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who is given worse marks than the president: 74 percent of Hispanics and 65 percent of other New Yorkers disapprove of the job he is doing.
On the economy, too, Hispanic New Yorkers have greater anxieties than Hispanics in the rest of the country. About half of all Hispanics in the city said they thought the economy was getting worse, compared with 35 percent of Hispanics in the rest of the country.
That pessimism places them closer to other New Yorkers, with 41 percent saying the economy is worsening, than to Hispanics in the rest of the nation. The difference can most likely be explained by the fact that the recession has been slower to ease in the region, and the unemployment rate has been higher than in the rest of the country.
The city poll was conducted July 13 through 27 as part of a nationwide telephone survey of 3,092 adults, of whom 1,074 considered themselves Hispanic. The New York City portion of the poll included 391 Hispanic residents and 420 non-Hispanics.
The margin of sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points for all New Yorkers and five points for Hispanics and non-Hispanics separately. The size of the telephone survey allowed for an examination of attitudes among Puerto Rican New Yorkers, but there were not enough respondents from other nationalities to analyze their opinions separately.
Puerto Ricans make up 38 percent of the Hispanic population in New York, according to the 2000 census. Nationwide, Mexicans are the dominant group, making up 67 percent of the country's Hispanic population.
One area in which that diversity plays out is in attitudes toward immigration. Only 19 percent of Puerto Ricans, who are American citizens even when born in Puerto Rico, say legal immigration to the United States should be increased, while 36 percent said they would prefer to see it reduced. Among other New York Hispanics, 31 percent said immigration should increase and 25 percent said it should be curtailed. Nationwide, 28 percent of Hispanics said immigration should increase; 27 percent wanted it reduced.
Republicans are bringing their national convention to New York City next summer and have announced their intentions to win the state for President Bush, but they may not have an easy time of it. Over all, 62 percent of city residents had an unfavorable opinion of the Republican Party, and so did 52 percent of Hispanic New Yorkers, including 66 percent of Puerto Ricans.
Nationally and in the city, most Hispanics have a generally favorable view of the Democratic Party.
Mr. Bloomberg, too, was viewed unfavorably by New York City's Hispanics, despite his efforts to reach out to various Hispanic groups and their leaders. Seventy-four percent said they disapproved of the way he was handling his job, in line with the 72 percent of non-Hispanic blacks and 63 percent of whites in the city who also voiced disapproval. The numbers show a steady erosion in support for him over the last year.
Hispanics seem to be among the unhappiest of Mr. Bloomberg's constituents; when asked how much they thought he cared about their needs and problems, 45 percent answered "not at all," compared with 36 percent of non-Hispanic blacks and 24 percent of non-Hispanic whites.
Apparently aware of the problem, Mr. Bloomberg, in the past week alone, flew to Santo Domingo, marched in an Ecuadorean parade in Queens and a Puerto Rican Day Parade in the Bronx, spoke Spanish at different events and held a reception at Gracie Mansion "in honor of Dominican cultural heritage."
But it may take more effort to sway residents like Marilyn Perez, 49, a Republican and mortgage officer from Queens. In a follow-up interview, Mrs. Perez said that among the mayor's attempted budget cuts were city services for children with disabilities, like her 9-year-old son. And as a smoker, she said, "I feel that he's making my life miserable."
"I'm so annoyed with Bloomberg I don't want to live in New York any more," she said.
Hispanics, in fact, found President Bush more caring than their mayor; only 19 percent said the president did not care at all about their problems. 
That was not the only sign of hope for national Republicans. Hispanics other than Puerto Ricans hold a more favorable opinion of President Bush and the Republican Party. Republicans are focusing on New York's Hispanics as potential new party members and opening an outreach office in Washington Heights, in Upper Manhattan, where many Dominicans live.
Still, more typical of the poll respondents was Julio Pilco, 39, an Ecuadorean waiter from Queens and a Democrat. He linked both Mayor Bloomberg and President Bush to "the bad economic situation."
"Bush is spending too much money on the war, money that could go to poor people, to schools," he said in a follow-up interview.
Mr. Pilco said Mr. Bloomberg was busy extracting money from New Yorkers any way he could. "Taxes are up," he said. "They ticket people for nothing -- for feeding pigeons, for sitting down on the street, for riding a bicycle in the park. They are sucking money out of people, and people don't have jobs."
The prospect of losing a job is particularly worrisome. More than half of New York Hispanics, 58 percent, said they were concerned that someone in their household might be out of work in the next year.
Black New Yorkers were just as concerned -- 56 percent also said they feared unemployment -- but more Hispanics are unemployed, and they generally make less money than other city residents, the poll found. Among Hispanics, 62 percent of households have an income of less than $30,000 a year, compared with 46 percent for non-Hispanic blacks and 25 percent for whites.
The poll said Hispanic New Yorkers are more likely to be Democrats, to speak English and to support affirmative action, and are somewhat more liberal on social issues like abortion rights and gay marriages than Hispanics nationwide.
Hispanic New Yorkers, however, share many similarities with other Hispanics that set their ethnic group apart. Unlike most non-Hispanics, most Hispanics everywhere would prefer a tax cut over reducing the federal budget deficit. And the majority of all Hispanics do not use computers at home, at work or in school, unlike more than 70 percent of non-Hispanic respondents.
Spanish is the big unifier among Hispanics in this country, but the poll found that in New York as well as nationwide, more than two-thirds of Hispanics would not be any more or any less likely to vote for a political candidate who speaks Spanish. Another clear majority, 71 percent in New York and 67 nationwide, said that whether a company uses Spanish to pitch a product makes no difference in what they buy.
(Most respondents said they were born outside the United States and Puerto Rico: 59 percent in New York, 57 percent nationally.)
Culturally, Hispanics everywhere hold views on gender roles and race that sometimes reflect more the values of Latin America than those of the United States. A majority of Hispanics in the city and nationwide said most men they knew thought they were better than women, a view shared by a majority of non-Hispanic blacks in New York but by only a third of non-Hispanic whites.
And just as they did in the last census, a significant number of Hispanic respondents nationwide, and a majority in New York, refused to be pigeonholed into the standard racial categories and answered "other" when asked their race.
As a group, New York Hispanics were somewhat less inclined to see relations among the different ethnic groups in a positive light than non-Hispanic blacks and whites. Relations between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites were described as generally good by 73 percent of whites in the city. But just 57 percent of Hispanics in New York said they felt the same way. Seventy-seven percent of non-Hispanic blacks view their relationship with Hispanics as good. Only 52 percent of Hispanics agreed.

How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted July 13 through 27 with 3,092 adults throughout the United States. Of those, 1,074 identified themselves as Hispanic in origin or descent. Interviews were in English or Spanish.
Of the 3,092 total respondents, 811 were interviewed in New York City: 391 Hispanics and 420 non-Hispanics.
The national Hispanic sample was drawn in three ways. First, based on all Times/CBS News polls since January 2001, every phone number that resulted in an interview with a self-identified Hispanic was called back for the new study. Second, every phone number that yielded a Spanish-speaking person from those same polls was also called back, even though in the original poll only English speakers were interviewed, according to standard practice by pollsters. Third, to supplement the sample, new phone numbers composed of random digits were called in exchanges around the country that contain 35 percent or more Hispanic residents, based on census data. 
Nationally, the non-Hispanic portion of the sample was composed of callbacks to phone numbers in all Times/CBS News polls since January 2001 where respondents had originally identified themselves as non-Hispanic.
Similarly, the New York City sample was constructed following comparable steps, based on local polls by The Times and CBS News in 2002 and 2003. An exception was that in the city, non-Hispanic respondents resulted from random digit dialing rather than from callbacks.
The resulting oversamples of Hispanic respondents were weighted down to their proper proportion of the population in the United States and in New York City, respectively.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age, education and native versus foreign born.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than two or three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults, and by no more than four percentage points from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult New Yorkers.
For smaller subgroups the margin of sampling error is correspondingly larger: three points for non-Hispanic respondents nationally, four points for Hispanic respondents nationally, and five points for either non-Hispanic or Hispanic respondents in New York City.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in English versus Spanish wording of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results. 
Complete results are available at www.nytimes.com/politics.

YankeeNets Unravels, And Teams May Move

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The strains within YankeeNets, once heralded as a model for sports conglomerates, are so deep and bitter that the holding company is close to breaking apart, according to people involved with the company.
 If YankeeNets dissolves -- considered a near certainty by people involved in the company's recent dealings -- it could ultimately result in the relocation of the New Jersey Nets and the New Jersey Devils to New York under revised or new ownership. 
 The turmoil is so intense at YankeeNets, whose ownership team includes George Steinbrenner, that individual owners and suitors are exploring the idea of bringing the Nets to Brooklyn, possibly along with the Devils, or putting one or both of the teams on the West Side of Manhattan.
Officials with YankeeNets would not comment publicly. But the holding company -- born four years ago as a novel marriage of a baseball and basketball team and, potentially, a wildly lucrative broadcasting network -- has been plagued from the beginning by sharp differences over vision, finances and management. 
"It looks like they're unwinding it," said Dean Bonham, chairman of the Bonham Group, a sports industry consultant in Denver. "It's unfortunate that the YankeeNets as an ownership model appears not to be working."
In one of the more startling proposals, according to people involved in the negotiations, Lewis Katz, a wealthy businessman from New Jersey and a principal owner of the Nets, could join with the developer Bruce Ratner in moving the teams to downtown Brooklyn, where a new 20,000-seat arena would be the centerpiece of a real estate development designed by Frank Gehry, the architect responsible for the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, and the Mighty Ducks' training facility in Anaheim, Calif.
The developer has asked New York City officials to come up with a memorandum of understanding by the end of the month expressing public support for the multibillion-dollar project. Under the terms of the proposed deal, Ratner is putting together a group to buy a $50 million stake in the teams.
The people involved in the negotiations said it was impossible to forecast the ultimate outcome, and they suggested that some of the details of the emerging alternatives -- a number of which were cited in an article yesterday in The Star-Ledger of Newark -- might have become public as the principals sought to gain some advantage in the deal-making.
But it is clear that those involved with YankeeNets have scrambled in recent months to resolve the company's fate, in part because several of the principals, including Katz, must pay the former Devils owner John McMullen $50 million on Aug. 22 as a final payment for the team, according to people involved with YankeeNets.
A move to Brooklyn is by no means certain, and any potential change faces enormous obstacles, including the untangling of the ownership of YankeeNets, which brought together the New York-based owners of the baseball team with the New Jersey-based owners of the Nets. 
Relocating the Nets and the Devils would also have enormous economic implications for Newark, Brooklyn and the Meadowlands. New Jersey has no intention of losing the teams to the city across the Hudson. The Knicks and the Rangers would almost certainly oppose any move by the Nets and the Devils to New York, and a move would require approval from the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League.
Whatever happens, sports industry executives and people in both of the ownership groups say the YankeeNets marriage is nearly over.
Bonham said he was disappointed by the turn of events. If the purchase of sports teams by giant media and entertainment companies like Fox and Disney were the model for the 1990's, Bonham said, the YankeeNets' bottom-up combination of teams, arenas, stadiums and a broadcast network was the model of the future.
YankeeNets assets include the Yankees, the Nets, a 30 percent stake in the Devils and 60 percent of the YES Network. Under the merger four years ago, Steinbrenner retained control of the Yankees and a 22 percent stake in the holding company. A group led by Katz and Raymond Chambers, a philanthropist, which bought the Nets in 1998, controls 40 percent of the holding company. Separate from YankeeNets, Katz and Chambers also own 70 percent of the Devils, who were acquired in August 2000.
YankeeNets has been an uneasy partnership in which the two sides "didn't even speak the same language," one person who works with the New Jersey group said in the early days of the merger. Steinbrenner has a blustery, bottom-line style and loves the limelight. Chambers, who rarely grants interviews, bought the teams in an effort to move them to Newark and revitalize the city's battered economy. He and Katz pledged to donate all their profits to a newly formed charity, the Community Youth Organization.
The two groups have clashed over team management, the YES Network, players' contracts and the purchase of the Devils. Steinbrenner has refused to help finance the Devils' losses.
People involved with the two teams say that Steinbrenner and his partners consider the New Jersey owners to be rubes when it comes to the complexity of the sports business. The same people say that Katz, Chambers and another owner, Alan Landis, have had enough of Steinbrenner and Randy Levine, the Yankees' president.
"It's really a divisive situation," said one executive. "Chambers and Katz detest Steinbrenner, and Steinbrenner feels the same way about them."
In the meantime, the two New Jersey teams lost about $25 million combined last year and are in the bottom ranks of their respective leagues in terms of attendance, despite the Devils' winning the Stanley Cup for the third time in eight years and the Nets' advancing to the N.B.A. finals for the second consecutive season.
Both sides want to break up YankeeNets. But, according to people involved with the teams, the owners may want to keep the YES Network in place. It has long-term agreements with the Yankees and the Nets, while the Devils are expected to join up after their current contract with Cablevision expires. Most of the owners believe that the network is valuable because it can command high prices by providing year-round sports programming.
The owners of the Nets spent the last four years negotiating a deal for a $355 million arena in Newark, with $210 million coming from the state and the city. But talks foundered this spring after the teams sought special financing from the state. Some owners also began questioning the wisdom of moving the Devils to Newark, where they may not find an audience.
With the Devils losing money and a $50 million payment due at the end of August, Katz and other New Jersey owners began looking at alternatives in a post-Yankees world.
One Nets owner, Landis, talked to New York City officials, the Jets, Cablevision and Brookfield Properties about moving the Nets to a new Manhattan sports complex on 12th Avenue that would combine a new Madison Square Garden and a stadium for the Jets. But Cablevision, which owns the Garden, the Knicks and the Rangers, was not interested, according to three people involved in the talks.
Katz has been having more success in his discussions with Ratner about Brooklyn, where the two men figured that a large-scale real estate project could jolt the downtown neighborhood and improve the financial feasibility of the arena. The proposal is to build the arena as the centerpiece of a project that would include up to 5,000 apartments and more than two million square feet of office and retail space on a 21-acre parcel at Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues, opposite Atlantic Terminal and stretching toward Sixth Avenue. City officials have found the project interesting, but enormously complicated.
"They've come to us with an intriguing prospect that could have enormous benefits for Brooklyn and the city," said Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff.
The site, which includes a rail yard and public and private land, strikes a historical echo in Brooklyn. In the 1950's, Walter O'Malley, the owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, wanted to build a stadium there to replace Ebbets Field. When he failed to gain permission, O'Malley moved the Dodgers to Los Angeles, leaving a hole in the Brooklyn psyche.
Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz has already embraced the Nets and the Devils.
"It would be returning to Brooklyn that which was unceremoniously taken away from us in 1957," he said. "We're a city of more than two and a half million people, we have great transportation and a reputation for being the most loyal fans of all."
People involved with the teams say that Landis is not convinced of the viability of the Brooklyn project and expects the teams to remain in New Jersey, while Chambers would probably sell his stake in the teams if they relocated to Brooklyn.

HEADLINE: Back in Fray, Gore Urges Voters to Fire Bush 

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
Former Vice President Al Gore waded back into presidential politics yesterday with a speech accusing the Bush administration of having promoted "false impressions" about the need to go to war in Iraq and to cut taxes.
 Mr. Gore, speaking at New York University before more than 500 people invited by a political advocacy group and the campus chapter of the College Democrats, said Mr. Bush had engaged in a pattern of distortion when it came to foreign, economic and environmental policy. 
 "The president's mishandling of and selective use of the best evidence available on the threat posed by Iraq is pretty much the same as the way he intentionally distorted the best available evidence on climate change, and rejected the best available evidence on the threat posed to America's economy by his tax and budget proposals," Mr. Gore said.
The speech was Mr. Gore's first major policy address since he announced in December that he would not run for president in 2004. Yesterday, he said again that he would not enter the campaign, but the timing of the speech -- as the campaign season heats up -- raised eyebrows in Democratic circles.
Two weeks ago, Mr. Gore asked Moveon.org, an Internet-based advocacy group that protested the war, to organize the event as a way for him to address the direction of the country, his assistants and officials at Moveon.org said.
"He did make clear he was not going to run, but his feeling was there was sentiment not being put in words in terms of patterns and practices of the Bush administration and he felt he was in position to make that case," said Eli Pariser, the international campaigns director of Moveon.org. "Some of the candidates have to be more guarded."
An adviser said Mr. Gore was not seeking to "take oxygen" from the candidates or to criticize them but "to provide a road map and direction on some issues he feels are appropriate."
Mr. Gore devoted two lines of praise for the candidates, none by name, toward the end of his 40-minute speech. "I am not going to join them," Mr. Gore said. "But later in the political cycle I will endorse one of them."
For someone who is now a college lecturer and business consultant, the appearance created a fair amount of political buzz -- former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York said on a radio show on Wednesday that Mr. Gore should get in the race -- and it had all the trappings of a campaign event. Nearly 100 members of the national and international news media registered to cover it.
Mr. Gore seemed to relish the opportunity to step from the sidelines and assess the opponent who defeated him in the bitterly contested 2000 election. And his language was generally harsher than that of the Democratic contenders.
"Too many of our soldiers are paying the highest price for the strategic miscalculations, serious misjudgments and historic mistakes that have put them and our nation in harm's way," Mr. Gore said.
He credited Mr. Bush for having removed Saddam Hussein but lamented what he called the lack of "honesty and integrity" in the debate leading to the war. He noted that no nuclear weapons had been found in Iraq and no direct link between Mr. Hussein and Al Qaeda established. He suggested that a hidden motivation for the war was securing access to oil.
After musing aloud about whether Mr. Bush's advisers had steered him wrong, Mr. Gore said, "I've just about concluded that the real problem may be the president himself and that next year we ought to fire him and get a new one."
He called on Mr. Bush to "rein in" Attorney General John Ashcroft and the "gross civil rights abuses" he said were taking place under the Patriot Act. He likened a proposed Defense Department surveillance program to George Orwell's "1984." A White House spokeswoman, addressing reporters near Mr. Bush's ranch near Crawford, Tex., dismissed Mr. Gore's complaints. Americans, said the spokeswoman, Claire Buchan, know "the president's commitment to the security of the United States and to winning the war on terror and to securing our economic security."
Christine Iverson, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, said Mr. Gore's record on terrorism was less than perfect. "It's almost as if he were not vice president when the terrorists attacked the U.S.S. Cole, military barracks overseas and the World Trade Center for the first time," Ms. Iverson said, referring to the 1993 bombing.
Four Democratic candidates -- former Governor Howard Dean of Vermont, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina and Senator Bob Graham of Florida -- issued statements praising the speech.

HEADLINE: Actor Calls for Overhaul Of State Economic Engine 

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: NORWALK, Calif., Aug 7 

 BODY:
Arnold Schwarzenegger took the second step in his fledgling campaign for governor this afternoon, stopping to pick up his application papers.
 It was a scene similar to a Hollywood premiere, with Mr. Schwarzenegger signing T-shirts and photo albums for shrieking fans. Some said they were voters, some said they were not, others said they just wanted their car tax cut. 
 In a short news conference on the steps of the Los Angeles County Registrar building, Mr. Schwarzenegger, the hulking 56-year-old movie star, was skimpy on details about how he would conduct his two-month campaign or how he might conduct business in California should he unseat Gov. Gray Davis.
"I have a very, very good agenda," Mr. Schwarzenegger promised. "We have to overhaul our economic engine in California. We have to bring back businesses to California and to make sure that everyone in California has a great job, a fantastic job."
He said he would reveal a comprehensive plan in the next few weeks to balance the budget, cure an ailing educational system and encourage business back into the state while protecting the environment. He also said that as governor he would not negotiate with the special interests or special-interest politicians he said infested the state capital.
Asked about his lack of credentials or political experience, Mr. Schwarzenegger said there were more important things than qualifications.
"The most important thing when you run a state is leadership," he said. "Governor Davis has said his is experience you can't buy. Well, look what it's gotten us."
"In everything I ever did, I showed great leadership," he added and then launched into what is shaping up to be his stump speech, about a penniless farm boy from Austria who went to America and became the highest-paid entertainer in the world.
"The rags-to-riches story plays well in a state with so many immigrants," said a top Californian Republican strategist. "But at some point he has to make the transition. In a few weeks people will start to get sick of the bikini-wax jokes and the general circuslike atmosphere. He'll have to become a politician."
Mr. Schwarzenegger made his announcement Wednesday evening on the "Tonight" show. It was part high drama, part "Simpsons," with him reciting his famous movie lines, like "I'll be back" and saying the hardest decision he faced before this was the time he got a bikini wax.
His surprising plunge into political life propelled him into this morning's headlines, but the metamorphosis is not yet complete. Mr. Schwarzenegger's first one-on-one interview was not with a member of the political press corps, but with Pat O'Brien, host of "Access Hollywood."
Mr. Schwarzenegger could become a caricature of himself if he falls back on this strategy, some political veterans believe.
"The media, the scrutiny, it's going to be a new world for him," said Sheri Annis, who advised Mr. Schwarzenegger last fall when he was the sponsor of Proposition 49, a successful ballot initiative for after-school programs.
"He's extraordinarily smart, and extremely savvy, but he has to be careful," Ms. Annis said in an interview before Mr. Schwarzenegger entered the race. "When the press looks at an actor in Hollywood who doesn't do Shakespeare, they don't think there is a lot upstairs. So if he's protected too much from the political media, he'll have trouble."
Mr. Schwarzenegger's handlers said today that his first business was completing the paperwork, and second was touring the morning talk shows. Then he would begin to make himself available for substantive questions, they said. He plans to barnstorm the state. "The public will not be disappointed," said Sean Walsh, a spokesman for Mr. Schwarzenegger. "The public will see a lot of Arnold in the coming weeks."
Not only will his inexperience be an issue, but unflattering accusations are sure to surface, like the tabloid accounts of groping and boorish behavior on movie sets that surfaced when Mr. Schwarzenegger considered a run for governor two years ago. He said after his television announcement last night that he was expecting as much.
"I know they're going to throw everything at me and say I have no experience, that I'm a womanizer, that I'm a terrible guy," he said. "All these things are going to come my way. But this is why you have a great team together, a great staff. You fight these things off."
Mr. Schwarzenegger is not a student of the bond market, but he does have a correspondence degree in business from the University of Wisconsin. He won the Mr. Olympia bodybuilding title six years in a row beginning in 1970. He was the national fitness guru for the first President Bush and has devoted his life to promoting education and nonviolence among children. He has committed more than 500 on-screen murders, according to a Web site that tracks such things.
The election will be 59 days from Saturday. The filing deadline and the shortened format should help Mr. Schwarzenegger, said Karal Ann Marling, professor of pop culture and the University of Minnesota.
"If I was running his campaign, I'd have him say nothing," Ms. Marling said. "A 60-day election is a popularity contest. And in today's society, Arnold is the winner."

HEADLINE: Bechtel Ends Move for Work In Iraq, Seeing A Done Deal 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
The Bechtel Group, one of the world's biggest engineering and construction companies, has dropped out of the running for a contract to rebuild the Iraqi oil industry, as other competitors have begun to conclude that the bidding process favors the one company already working in Iraq, Halliburton. 
 After the United States Army Corps of Engineers quietly selected Halliburton in the spring to perform early repairs of the Iraqi oil business in the aftermath of the war, other companies and members of Congress protested that the work should have been awarded through competitive bidding. 
 Halliburton's role in the rebuilding has been under political scrutiny because the company was formerly headed by Vice President Dick Cheney. But the Bush administration and the Corps of Engineers, which is overseeing the Iraqi oil reconstruction effort, have repeatedly said that Halliburton has no inside track. 
Preliminary plans for a new contract, which industry executives had thought might total $1 billion, were announced late in June by the Corps of Engineers. The bidding was meant, in part, to introduce competition and a sense of fairness into the lucrative Iraqi reconstruction market, an executive with a major engineering concern said. Like many industry executives, he would speak only on condition of anonymity because his company does not want to jeopardize its chances for future government contracts. 
But in the last month, the corps, which is overseeing the reconstruction efforts, has specified a timetable for the work that effectively means that the value of any contract companies other than Halliburton could win would be worth only about $176 million, according to Corps of Engineers documents and executives in the engineering and construction business. 
Earlier this week, Bechtel cited the timetable as its reason for dropping out of the bidding. The company now plans to deal directly with the Iraqi oil ministry for future reconstruction work, a spokesman, Howard N. Menaker, said.
Although the oil ministry and the Army Corps of Engineers nominally cooperate, industry analysts say the Americans have the upper hand.
Officials of the Corps of Engineers did not return numerous phone calls yesterday seeking comment on the contract. But last month, in response to questions from other companies about Halliburton's role, the corps said on its Web site that all potential bidders had received the same information to "eliminate any competitive advantage" Halliburton might have from its involvement in the Iraqi reconstruction work so far.
A spokeswoman for Halliburton, Wendy Hall, would not discuss whether its engineering unit, Kellogg Brown & Root, would bid, saying only that "we will evaluate the opportunity." 
After indicating in June that it planned to solicit bids, the Corps of Engineers held a conference of prospective bidders in Dallas on July 14. Records of the meeting show that it was attended by some of the most experienced engineering and construction companies in the world -- including, besides Halliburton and Bechtel, Fluor, the Parsons Group, Schlumberger and Foster Wheeler.
Among those companies, only Fluor and Parsons have indicated so far that they plan to make bids by the Aug. 14 deadline. A winner will be announced by Oct. 15, according to the Corps of Engineers.
At the meeting and in the initial request for proposals, the Corps of Engineers put forth what the industry calls "an indefinite quantity, indefinite delivery" contract. Industry executives said they were told there could in fact be two principal contracts, one for the oil industry in northern Iraq and the other for the south. The value of each contract could range from $500,000 to $500 million over several years, according to the Corps of Engineers, which cited the continuedinstability in Iraq as a reason for keeping the terms so vague. 
A transcript of the July meeting shows that bidders were concerned even then that Halliburton would have a competitive advantage over other companies because it was already working with the Corps of Engineers in Iraq and helping to assess the repairs needed at oil production sites and pipelines after the war and years of an economic embargo.
The corps denied that such a conflict of interest existed, according to the transcript.
Over the last three weeks, however, the Corps of Engineers has provided additional information to bidders indicating that by the July meeting, it and Halliburton already had a fairly clear understanding of the scope and financial value of the work to be done and the timetable for completing it. 
The newly released information indicates that a week before the Dallas meeting, the Corps of Engineers and Halliburton participated in a large workshop in Baghdad that also included representatives of the Iraqi oil ministry and the ruling Coalition Provisional Authority to draw up a detailed plan for rebuilding much of the Iraqi oil industry by the end of March 2004. 
A week ago, the Corps of Engineers Web site carried an amendment to the contract proposal, saying that 220 projects, mostly at installations above the ground, must be completed for Iraq's oil production to reach prewar levels. The projects are divided into three phases, with a total estimated cost of $1.14 billion. 
But the corps notes in the plan that the first two phases, which together would require about $967 million in investments, would have to be completed by Dec. 31.
Halliburton's competitors worry that if the winner of the new contracts is not announced until Oct. 15, that company could not even begin the work before year's end. The only company that could do the work based on that timetable is Halliburton, its competitors say. 
Only the third and final phase, worth about $176 million and requiring the work to be completed by March 31, could realistically be performed by a Halliburton competitor, its rivals say. 
"The feeling at our company was 'Yes, Halliburton is the incumbent, but we had an opportunity there,' " a representative of another engineering concern said. "But if we had believed that from the beginning we had no chance of winning this, we wouldn't have bid."
Responding to pointed questions about the timetable by potential bidders, the Corps of Engineers' Web site said the proposed schedule was "not intended to change anything" about the bidding process.
For its part, the Kellogg Brown & Root unit of Halliburton will do whatever work the corps gives it, Ms. Hall, the spokeswoman, said. 
"It is not known at this time how or if the future award of another Corps of Engineers contract will affect current K.B.R. operations or the terms and conditions of its contract," she said.
The first wave of Halliburton employees arrived in Iraq in March, to oversee the extinguishing of several oil well fires near Basra. Since then, its responsibilities, under the direction of the Corps of Engineers, have expanded from its initial job of making emergency repairs. 
Working in Iraq has helped turn around Halliburton's financial performance, its second-quarter results showed. The company made a profit of $26 million, in contrast to a loss of $498 million in the period a year earlier. The company stated that 9 percent, or $324 million, of its second-quarter revenue of $3.6 billion came from its work in Iraq.

HEADLINE: Defying Davis, Two Democrats Say They'll Run in Recall Vote 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
The unified front of the Democratic Party in California was shattered today when two prominent Democrats openly defied Gov. Gray Davis, announcing that they would join the race to replace him should he lose the recall vote on Oct. 7.
 Mr. Davis and his supporters were also dealt a sweeping legal setback late in the day, when the State Supreme Court refused to intervene in the recall. The seven-member court rejected five legal challenges, including one filed by Mr. Davis on Monday that would have delayed the vote until March and would have let him run as a possible successor to himself. 
 Another denied petition sought to eliminate from the recall ballot the list of candidates who might replace Mr. Davis. If that petition had been successful, it would have effectively handed the governor's position to Lt. Gov. Cruz M. Bustamante, also a Democrat, if Mr. Davis lost the recall vote. 
It was unclear this evening whether any of the rulings would be appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Other recall suits are pending in federal court.
"We are not going to make that decision tonight," a lawyer for Mr. Davis, Robin B. Johansen, said about an appeal. "I am really disappointed. I think it is going to be a ridiculously difficult election. I think after the election there is going to be litigation all over the place."
The two Democrats who broke ranks with Mr. Davis, Mr. Bustamante and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, had previously ruled out candidacies. But with the waters around Mr. Davis becoming ever choppier, the two officials said Democratic voters needed an alternative to the growing list of Republican and other contenders.
"I hope he is able to beat the recall," Mr. Bustamante said in Sacramento. "And we are going to be fighting to make sure in fact we do beat the recall. But if in fact he does not win, I believe we need another candidate, a serious Democratic candidate."
The defections occurred as Republicans sorted through the aftermath of their own thunderbolt, the announcement on Wednesday by the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, that he would jump on the increasingly crowded carousel of candidates and seek to replace Mr. Davis. More than 500 people have indicated an interest in appearing on the ballot.
State Republican officials said Mr. Schwarzenegger's entry produced an overnight groundswell of support, as people went to party offices across the state to volunteer time, and voter registration drives soared.
"Arnold shows that there are Republicans that are different than the image of the typical Republican," George M. Sundheim III, chairman of the state party, said. "In California, we haven't had that single individual that changes the image of the party. By running candidates across the spectrum, we are showing that all of these are good Republicans."
Even with Mr. Schwarzenegger, the Republican side of the recall equation remained in flux, as his oversize presence seemed to crowd out some ambitions and inspire others. The Republican politician most responsible for the recall qualifying for the ballot, Representative Darrell Issa of San Diego, issued a teary statement that he was dropping out of the contest. Mr. Issa surprised his own staff when he appeared outside the office of the Registrar of Voters in San Diego, filing papers in hand, only to end his candidacy.
"This was never about higher office," Mr. Issa said. "It was about higher obligation." 
He contributed $1.6 million toward the signature-gathering effort and just this week chipped in an additional $50,000 toward the legal costs of the pro-recall groups. 
Nonetheless, he was considered a long shot in the crowded field of replacement candidates, which in addition to Mr. Schwarzenegger is highly likely to include other well-known Republicans like Bill Simon Jr., who lost to Mr. Davis in November, and State Senator Tom McClintock, who also ran for statewide office in November. 
Later in the day, another prominent Republican was said to be weighing the prospect of joining the race. The Republican, Peter V. Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner who oversaw the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, began filling out papers for a possible candidacy, according to Dan Schnur, a consultant.
Mr. Schnur said Mr. Ueberroth was contemplating a "bipartisan campaign and administration," a unity government of sorts that would bring Democrats and Republicans together in an effort to end the state's economic and political crises.
"He is getting a very positive response," Mr. Schnur said. "He will have a decision by tomorrow morning."
On the Democratic side, Mr. Davis's supporters played down the significance of Mr. Bustamante and Mr. Garamendi's defections. Those actions followed a decision on Wednesday by Senator Dianne Feinstein to stay out of the race.
"I believe Democrats are united on one crucial point, we are against the recall," Mr. Davis said at an education conference in Anaheim. "This process is a wonderment to me. People are parachuting in. People are parachuting out. I'm just going to wait till everyone has decided on Saturday night before I start commenting and getting into the back and forth."
But many Democrats said the candidacies of the two major state officials were the worst possible outcome of more than two weeks of jousting between Mr. Davis and his critics.
The fallout was twofold, the Democratic officials said. The candidacies ended the party's common approach to keeping Democratic attention focused on the recall vote itself, while also creating a situation where top Democrats will campaign against one another on who would succeed Mr. Davis if he is ousted.
Though the defections by no means ensure his defeat, they highlight the monumental task that he faces in not only turning off Mr. Schwarzenegger's celebrity glare, but also quelling an open rebellion in his own party.
"The dam has broken," said Leon E. Panetta, the former California congressman who was chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. "It looks like we have the worst of all worlds."
The recall mechanics mean that Mr. Davis could be ousted by a simple majority and that a decision on a successor would be in a separate part of the ballot, where the person receiving the most votes wins. A voter could vote to retain Mr. Davis and then vote for another person on the second part.
The developments led to the second effort in two days by Democratic members of the state's Congressional delegation to come up with a consensus candidate for the replacement ballot.
While there was considerable support for Mr. Bustamante, there was also widespread recognition that Mr. Garamendi, a Clinton administration official who has run for governor twice, was highly unlikely to back out.
"Zero is gone," said Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat of the San Fernando Valley, referring to the number of Democratic candidates. "It is either going to be one or several. It is not like we have a playbook on this one. We are running this as we are going."
Some Democratic officials said they were still holding out hope that Mr. Panetta might emerge as a consensus candidate, but he said he saw that as unlikely. 
"Once the barn door is open," Mr. Panetta said, "it is tough to put candidates back inside. You have too many egos involved here to be able to make that happen. That is the nature of politics."

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
For Pataki and Bloomberg, The Rift Is Becoming Visible

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and AL BAKER 

 BODY:
In the nearly two years of Michael R. Bloomberg's mayoralty, he has enjoyed what many political experts and government officials say is the best relationship a New York City mayor has had with his governor in decades.
 Even as Mr. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki have disagreed over major policy and budget issues, they have taken pains to be publicly solicitous. In the case of the mayor, his generous and constant praise of Mr. Pataki has often made him the object of ridicule among fellow elected officials. 
 But on Wednesday, when a board controlled by the governor's representatives voted to quash a five-year $2.5 billion aid package for the city, a year's worth of acrimony brewing between the two men was laid bare. Mr. Bloomberg called the action "irresponsible" and "illegal," and vowed to fight it in court. 
Suddenly, the city canceled a joint news conference the mayor and governor had scheduled yesterday, and though the two men were polite in referring to each other, City Hall remained steamed.
"We're not going to let it get personal," said William T. Cunningham, the mayor's communications director. "But we are going to protect the interests of the city of New York. We don't need to take a step backward."
And many on both sides of the political aisle in Albany said the two men appeared headed for a war -- if they were not already in one. "It's escalating," a legislative official said today of the tension between the two men. "They are on a collision course here." The official added: "It could get uglier. It could get into other things. It could carry over into other areas."
Over the last several months, aides and associates say, Mr. Bloomberg has privately seethed over a variety of actions by the governor, among them his attempt last spring to redistribute federal money the city won for antiterrorism into the state's coffers; his appointment of the head of an agency that controls the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan without consulting the mayor; and his threat to veto the construction of a water-filtration plant in the Bronx.
With each incident, Mr. Bloomberg and his aides have chafed as the governor has exercised the prerogatives of his office.
And more recently, according to many lawmakers in the State Capitol, Mr. Pataki continues to be angry with the mayor for joining forces with the Legislature in supporting a budget deal that left the governor on the sidelines last spring.
But the undoing of the bond deal -- which represents about $500 million annually in overall aid to the city over five years -- comes as Mr. Bloomberg seeks to make a political comeback from a year of increasing taxes on New Yorkers and cutting their city services. To that end, he has recently spoken publicly about the city's economic recovery, and offered up the possibility of future tax cuts.
But the vote on Wednesday by an obscure but powerful board essentially controlled by Mr. Pataki may force Mr. Bloomberg to cut more from the city's budget, and stop talking about tax cuts. In its action, the board -- made up of two people appointed by Mr. Pataki and the state comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi -- voted not to finance a deal struck between the city and State Legislature for the state to take over payments of debt from the fiscal crisis of the 1970's.
The action comes at a delicate time; the last thing Mr. Bloomberg wants to do is go back to his agencies and ask them to whack their budgets again to compensate for what his administration thought was money in the bank. "Just as the sun was starting to peek out," one city official said, "they threw a half-a-billion dollar grenade."
But aides to Mr. Pataki said today that rather than highlighting tension between the men, the litany of issues the governor and mayor had faced in recent months actually underscored how durable their relationship is, and said the men had a better relationship than perhaps any governor and mayor in state history.
Lisa Dewald Stoll, a spokeswoman for the governor, said the men worked hard to get along and clearly like one another.
"The water filtration plant -- in the beginning there was a difference in opinion -- and in the end, the strength of the relationship was demonstrated," she said, referring to Mr. Pataki's initial objections to the city's plan for a plant in the Bronx.
Although Mr. Pataki kept the city on pins and needles on the filtration-plant decision, Ms. Stoll pointed out that "they came together and found a way to move forward." 
But the unraveling of the bond deal caused tensions to escalate. 
From the city's point of view, the bond refinancing deal is legal, since it was passed in the budget by the Legislature, which adopted it over the governor's vetoes. But the governor said that part of the budget was improperly drafted and thus unconstitutional and was also fiscally irresponsible.
"There are those who share the governor's opinion, including Comptroller Hevesi, a statewide elected Democrat, and there are those who share the mayor's opinion," Ms. Stoll said of the debt issue. "Having said that, they have one of the best working relationships between a governor and mayor, arguably in New York history."
Mr. Bloomberg's strategy all along, no matter how personally vexed he has been by the governor's moves, has been to bend over backward to keep the relationship on friendly terms, even while his aides groused privately that the governor has tried to shut the mayor out of the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan and taken other actions against Mr. Bloomberg's interests.
While Mr. Bloomberg may not have gotten substantial rewards from Mr. Pataki, who faces his own budget woes, the mayor and his aides have calculated that they may have staved off worse treatment.
By having a public brawl, they reason, the Bloomberg administration risks facing Mr. Pataki's wrath in the fall, when the Legislature returns to fine-tune the budget.
In general, it is not unlike a bad marriage in which one partner keeps up appearances even when the whole world is predicting divorce behind their backs.
Yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg hewed somewhat to that program. 
When asked about Mr. Pataki's role during a news conference yesterday at a Midtown hotel, Mr. Bloomberg replied: "The actions were taken by the three members of the board -- two are appointed by the governor, one is the state comptroller. I don't know, I don't want to personalize any of this."
Earlier in the day at a news conference at the same hotel, Mr. Pataki indicated a desire to work with the mayor. "I think the mayor has made tremendous progress toward putting the city's fiscal difficulties behind us," he said.
The two men also spoke on the phone yesterday, and Edward Skyler, a spokesman for the mayor, said their relationship remained cordial. "The mayor is disappointed in the governor's decision but they have a good relationship which can survive disagreements," he said.
Indeed, unlike the protracted feuds that consumed previous governors and New York mayors -- from Hugh Carey and Abe Beame to Mr. Pataki and Rudolph W. Giuliani -- the tensions between the men are not personal, and may be more rooted in their often contradictory missions.
"The job of the mayor is to take as much of the whole pie as he can get for his 36 or 37 or 38 percent of the population" of the state, said former Governor Mario M. Cuomo. "But that slice of the pie comes out of the rest of the pie that belongs to the larger part of the population and that's the governor's mission, to make sure it's distributed fairly."

HEADLINE: PAN AMERICAN GAMES; 
Games Lift Spirits in Santo Domingo

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
The 400 meters' worth of hurdles that faced Felix Sanchez on the track were nothing compared with the obstacle course confronting thousands of his fans who descended upon Olympic Stadium on Wednesday night. Soldiers with shotguns tried in vain to slam shut entry gates while frantic groups of people with and without tickets rushed through any opening, dashed up ramps and packed every available inch so that the standing-room-only crowd could hardly breathe, much less move.
 Yet such discomforts meant little, at least for 48.19 graceful seconds, as Sanchez won a gold medal and broke the Pan American Games record. His victory, one of a handful expected for Dominican athletes, was among the few things that went off without a hitch. 
 Tickets and credentials, many of which were made available at the last minute, were often useless, while security varied from excessively tight to talk-or-run-your-way-anywhere lax. Government and sports officials face criticism for spending tens of millions of dollars, if not hundreds of millions, on first-class facilities that were finished at the last minute and might never be used again.
The Dominican Republic faces mounting social problems and an economic catastrophe from a $2.2 billion bank failure. Street demonstrations have sparked violence outside the capital, even though they were banned by the government for the duration of the games, Aug. 1 to 17. People complain of 15-hour power blackouts while athletic sites are assured of light and air-conditioning because of diesel generators. 
Despite those feelings, or maybe even because of them, Sanchez's victory was embraced by the nation.
"Felix Sanchez was worth the investment in the games," said Vicente Paniagua, coach of the Dominican men's volleyball team. "He gave satisfaction to the country because we need a hero in Olympic sports. Sammy Sosa does it for the money. Felix Sanchez does it for the country."
The games are a controversial point of pride for President Hipolito Mejia, who saw them as his legacy. Despite substantial financial problems, he said his "checkbook was ready" to cover any last-minute costs to make good on the international commitment made by his predecessors.
Many hope that the games will help lift tourism in this already popular Caribbean destination, which like many of its neighbors has nonetheless suffered a falloff since Sept. 11, 2001.
The successful bid for the games was made in the mid-1990's, when this country had one of the highest growth rates in Latin America. But in more recent years the country has been plagued with rising unemployment, a plummeting peso, legendary blackouts and a public health system in such neglect that AIDS patients had to sue the government in an international human rights court to get crucial drugs that are still in short supply as the government pleads poverty.
There was hardly anything impoverished about the sites that were built or refurbished for the games. 
"Everything is brand new," said Jeff Morrison, a member of the United States tennis squad. "The tennis stadium is beautiful."
Athletes said that although the early days were marked by logistical problems, officials had worked to improve conditions.
"When we got here, it was a little lost, but every day it gets better," said Mauro Menezes, coach of the Brazilian tennis squad. "At first they did not have balls to practice with or a place to go sign up for a court. Yesterday we did not have towels. There are problems, but they can happen anywhere."
Ramona Pagel, manager of the United States women's track and field team, was similarly forgiving.
"It's a pretty big task for them to accomplish," she said. "They're trying to live up to everybody's expectations, and that is never easy."
Expectations were obviously high for the 400-meter hurdles, and some of the people inside the stadium could not even see the track, much less Sanchez. 
"I should have stayed home and watched it on television," one woman lamented as she tried to squeeze her way through the crowd. "Ralphie! Has he run yet?"
The fear among many Dominicans, however, is that sites like those for tennis will stay quiet long after the games are gone. Although many here are crazy aboutsports, baseball and basketball are the obsessions, not badminton and fencing. Not too far away from the complex with the tennis courts and the handball stadium, another monument to presidential ego and excess looms large: the Faro a Colon, or Columbus Lighthouse, a battleship-size concrete edifice built in the presidency of Joaquin Balaguer to honor the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the New World. 
The lighthouse, actually a huge cross laid lengthwise, is dark these days, since to turn it on would result in huge power failures. An honor guard solemnly marches around a crypt that may or may not hold Columbus's bones. (Spanish scientists have not settled the matter.)
The lighthouse, completed at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars, is hauntingly empty. Not too far away, behind a wall, is a poor community of people who were forcibly evicted to clear the land for the lighthouse. In what is either an act of defiance or convenience, children toss bags of garbage over, sometimes impaling junk on the wrought iron fence that tops the wall, known locally as the Wall of Shame.
The children here are poor but fit. Half-court basketball is the rule on one nearby block, as one basket has been smashed and gravel covers the ground. A nearby baseball diamond fares better, although there is no place for fans to sit.
"We asked the government for help, but imagine," said Alex Diaz, the field's caretaker. "The more you ask, the harder it gets."
A few blocks away, a slender man shimmied up an electric pole and gingerly spliced into a high-voltage line as a friend connected another wire to his house. The power lines here are usually dead, many residents said, but they had electricity these days thanks to the nearby games. And light at night means fewer thugs on the streets.
"Now we have 17 days of light," Millie Matos said. "While the foreigners are here for the games, everything is fine. You don't even hear a gunshot. I hope they stay."

HEADLINE: Your Neighborhood Highway 

BYLINE:  By Richard Moe; Richard Moe is president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
If you lived through the mid-1960's in an American city, your memories of the period are probably punctuated by the crash of the wrecking ball. In those days, the federal government's "urban renewal" program and the construction of the Interstate System were operating in high gear, flattening older buildings and even entire neighborhoods from coast to coast.
 Eventually, Congress put the brakes on such destruction by adopting several important pieces of legislation, including the 1966 Department of Transportation Act. Specifically, Section 4(f) of the act states unequivocally that transportation officials must give paramount consideration to the protection of historic properties in planning their projects, making it the strongest federal preservation law on the books. 
 It has been invoked to great success, keeping countless historic places from being sacrificed to America's seemingly insatiable appetite for asphalt. The law prevented, for example, the construction of an elevated highway between the Mississippi riverfront and the historic French Quarter of New Orleans, and it helped persuade officials to build a tunnel under Baltimore's harbor instead of a bridge that would have loomed above Fort McHenry.
Unfortunately, the Bush administration has made changes that will eviscerate the law, and Congress will vote on them shortly. The proposed revisions would undo the most vital protection: forbidding highway construction at historic sites "unless there is no feasible and prudent alternative." 
Instead, developers would merely be asked to conduct procedural reviews that "take into account" any historic resources that might be affected by their projects. The message to road-builders is unmistakable: try to avoid destroying America's heritage unless it's just too much trouble. That's a loophole big enough to drive a bulldozer through.
The revision effort is largely fueled by the perception in some quarters that measures intended to protect natural and cultural treasures cause major delays in road projects. That is dead wrong. A 2002 report by the General Accounting Office found that the studies repeatedly cited as justification for weakening preservation and environmental reviews are based on anecdotal evidence rather than fact. 
Another report, this one prepared by the Federal Highway Administration itself, attributes road-building delays to many causes, with lack of money as the most common and environmental and preservation requirements ranking far down the list.
Everyone agrees that construction delays are both irritating and expensive, and preservationists are prepared to work with transportation planners to find ways to make the approval process more efficient and less time consuming. But weakening or eliminating parts of the 1966 transportation act won't gain us anything -- and could cost us a great deal.
Take Ocmulgee Old Fields, for instance. This tract near Macon, Ga., is dotted with ceremonial and burial mounds built by the Muscogee Creek Nation. Even though much of the site was ruled eligible for the National Register of Historic Places as a "traditional cultural property" -- the first area east of the Mississippi to be so designated -- the Georgia Department of Transportation wants to push a multilane highway through it. Right now, Section 4(f) is the only major regulatory barrier in its way. So if this essential piece of legislation goes, an important chapter in America's story is almost sure to be paved over.
Nobody wants that to happen, just as nobody wants to see more communities torn apart by transportation projects that are supposed to knit them together. Preservation and environmental reviews may be perceived as a nuisance to some, but saving something precious and irreplaceable for the benefit of future generations is surely worth a little extra time and thought.
We shouldn't be content to go down in history as a people who allowed movement to take precedence over place. Bulldozing America's past is not the way to to build roads to its future.

HEADLINE: Some Trade Barriers Won't Fall 

BYLINE:  By Rick Lazio; Rick Lazio, a former United States representative from New York, is president of the Financial Services Forum.

 BODY:
Trade negotiators often use a bicycle analogy to describe their craft: if you are not moving forward, you begin rolling back down the hill. Actually, global trade talks are more akin to the Tour de France: an arduous, multistage race that requires endurance and cooperation among a strong team. Unfortunately, with a World Trade Organization meeting set for Cancun, Mexico, next month, there is little cooperation among the leading trading nations, and the backsliding into protectionism has begun. 
 The United States and an ever-increasing number of countries benefit greatly from the liberal trading order established after World War II. The focus of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the forerunner to today's W.T.O., was on reducing barriers in manufactured goods. This made sense, as the American economy and global trade were both powered primarily by manufacturing and agriculture. 
 In the decades since, however, the dominance of American manufacturing and agriculture has been eclipsed by the service industries. Such exports -- from banking to travel and tourism -- typically make up 25 percent to 30 percent of our annual exports. They are also one of the few bright spots in our trade balance: the service sector ended last year with a $49 billion trade surplus, preventing America's $435 billion trade deficit from being even larger.
If our economy has changed so dramatically, shouldn't our trade priorities shift with it? To some extent they have: Robert Zoellick, the United States trade representative, did a masterly job of negotiating provisions on regulatory transparency in the recent trade agreements with Chile and Singapore. But the success of such aspects in bilateral trade pacts has yet to be incorporated in the administration's approach to broader negotiations in the World Trade Organization. 
As usual, the sticking point involves agricultural subsidies in rich countries that wreak misery on the developing world. Out of frustration over the way America and Europe protect their farmers, textile producers and others, developing countries like Brazil are refusing to further open their markets to service imports. 
In 2002, the 30 industrial nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development spent $311 billion on domestic agricultural subsidies, which is more than the combined gross domestic products of all the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. The World Bank calculated that the European Union's annual subsidy to dairy farmers comes out to $913 per cow; this dwarfs sub-Saharan Africa's per capita gross domestic product of $490. 
Likewise, America and Europe subsidize sugar production through a complex web of subsidies and tariffs that raise prices for consumers and force sugar-dependent businesses to move their factories to more competitive nations. Sugar farmers in South Africa alone lose $100 million in annual exports to these subsidies. 
Sugar farming is just the tip of the iceberg. It is completely inconsistent for the United States and Europe to preach the virtues of capitalism and open markets while using statist policies to strip struggling countries of one of their few comparative trade advantages. 
In addition, agricultural subsidies also undermine our national security. One lesson of the 9/11 attacks was that we need to relieve poverty in the failed states that become recruiting grounds for terrorists. "Persistent poverty and oppression can lead to hopelessness and despair," said President Bush last March. "These failed states can become havens for terror." 
Free trade of agricultural products isn't the only way to help poor countries -- easing their restrictions on foreign financial services can also help them find a way out of poverty. The World Bank has compelling evidence that competition in financial services creates stronger domestic capital markets in developing nations -- more efficent capital allocation and more access to banks, securities firms and insurance providers for businesses and individualsare sure ways to speed economic growth. 
Success at Cancun will require the United States to resume its historical role as the chief promoter of trade liberalization. Maintaining our agricultural subsidies not only hurts the developing world, it also puts millions of American service jobs at risk.

HEADLINE: U.S., Approving Health Measures, Partly Lifts Ban on Canadian Beef 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: TORONTO, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
The Bush administration today partly lifted an 11-week-old ban on Canadian beef imports that had nearly crippled the Canadian cattle industry since the carcass of a single cow tested positive for mad cow disease.
 Although the border will remain closed to live cattle for now, the announcement was met with relief by Canada's beef producers, who have lost more than $8 million a day since late May. Prices for cattle have plummeted on Canadian auction blocks, leading to the loss of several thousand jobs and fears that the industry might collapse. 
 Eighty percent of Canada's beef exports go to the United States, and Washington's action today is expected to help persuade at least some of the more than 30 other countries that have closed their markets that Canadian meat products are safe.
The American decision also came as a relief to the overall Canadian economy, which has slowed in recent months after a string of hardships starting with an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in Toronto in March.
The American policy will immediately permit veal from calves 9 months old or younger, meat from cattle under the age of 30 months, fresh or frozen beef liver and boneless sheep or goat meat from animals under 30 months old. Hunted game and vaccines for veterinary medicine will also be allowed to cross the border.
Canadian officials have slaughtered more than 2,000 cattle in three provinces in efforts to reassure consumers here and abroad that the outbreak of the disease, formally called bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or B.S.E., was limited. But officials were unable to explain how the single cow on a ranch in Alberta contracted the illness, leaving open questions about safety standards for Canadian beef and cattle feed.
In her announcement today, Secretary of Agriculture Ann M. Veneman said, "We reviewed the Canadian system of beef processing and production and concluded it has been and continues to be based on a strong foundation of B.S.E. preventative measures."

HEADLINE: Fuel Prices Move Higher, and Trend Is Expected to Persist 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE

 BODY:
Notice that recent rise in prices at the gas pump?
 Fuel prices have risen over the last two weeks, and analysts warn that the increase may be an early signal that prices of gasoline and heating oil could stay higher than usual through the end of the year, in large part because of chronically low stockpiles of crude oil and petroleum products in the United States. 
 The average retail price of regular gasoline is about $1.54 a gallon, about 2 cents higher than a week ago and 14 cents more than a year ago, according to the Energy Information Administration, the analytical arm of the Energy Department.
The main factor in higher gasoline prices is the price of crude oil, which reached $32.85 a barrel during trading in New York yesterday, its highest point since March 18, two days before the start of the war in Iraq. It closed at $32.18 a barrel, down 21 cents. 
"Crude oil, I think, will stay around $30 a barrel for the remainder of the year," said John Cook, senior oil economist at the Energy Information Administration. "I'm looking for relatively high prices for gasoline and heating oil."
Consumers are only now becoming aware that gasoline prices are edging higher, just as many prepare to leave on vacation, said Geoff Sundstrom, a spokesman for the American Automobile Association. Drivers generally begin to complain when prices are considerably higher, closer to $2 a gallon, but the relatively high price of fuel has now caught most consumers by surprise, Mr. Sundstrom said.
"Strictly speaking from the consumer side, a lot of Americans thought that as things got more and more settled in Iraq, its oil would make its way back to the world market and that oil supplies would be more, not less," he said.
Iraq may be among the most important of a host of factors keeping inventories low and prices high.
Supplies in the United States dropped to alarmingly low levels in the winter as a year of reductions in output by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and then a general strike in Venezuela crimped global output and compelled refineries to draw down petroleum stockpiles.
Since then, inventories have not rebounded to comfortable levels, industry analysts say, in part because demand for oil, despite the stop-and-start economy, has grown more than expected.
Oil traders and consumers thought that exports from Iraq would resume almost immediately after the war and replenish supplies, driving prices lower. Now, more than three months after President Bush declared an end to the war, the Iraqi oil industry is pumping only about a million barrels a day, less than half its prewar output, and exporting oil only sporadically. While the war left the oil sector largely unscathed, postwar looting has decimated the industry, and persistent sabotage of pipelines and other installations has delayed exports.
In Venezuela, exports have begun to slip, further tightening global oil supplies. In July, Venezuela pumped 2.58 million barrels a day, although its OPEC quota is 2.92 million barrels a day, according to Platts, an oil industry newsletter.
After the nationwide strikes in Venezuela earlier this year, the government of President Hugo Chavez fired about half the work force at the state oil company and then boasted of bringing back oil production, which had dwindled to a trickle during the work stoppage.
Venezuela succeeded in keeping up exports for a while, but the damage from the strike has now overtaken the industry, analysts say. A sharply reduced work force has made it harder to run fields and installations. More important, Venezuela's geologically and technologically difficult oil fields are lacking for investment, and output there is falling, analysts say.
"Venezuela has very complex old fields near the Lake Maracaibo area that some former oil ministers have said need about $4 billion in investment a year just to keep production stable," said Jan Stuart, vice president for energy research at Fimat USA, the commodities trading arm of Societe Generale.
Without such investment, output could decline by 10 percent to 25 percent a year at such fields, Mr. Stuart said. "It's clear that government hasn't been able to make that kind of investment," he added.
Production from another OPEC member, Indonesia, has been steadily declining, and the 10 voting members of the cartel have gradually reined in some of their overproduction this summer, which has also eroded supplies.
In the fall, Mr. Cook and other analysts said, bottlenecks might develop in the United States' refining network and lead to even higher prices. Some refineries will be taken out of service for a few weeks for routine but necessary maintenance.
And in New York and Connecticut, Mr. Cook said, refiners will begin to add ethanol rather than the additive MTBE to gasoline to reduce emissions. "When that kind of change is made, markets are always tight," he said, "so that could affect prices, too."

Dow Makes Lukewarm Gains as Nasdaq Moves Lower

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street ended an indecisive week on a quiet note yesterday, with investors half-heartedly picking up shares in response to strong sales at McDonald's. Technology stocks sagged on a profit warning from Nvidia.
 Analysts said investors were refraining from major commitments, with many waiting for guidance on the economic outlook from the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, which meets Tuesday. 
 "We had good news from McDonald's and a couple of upgrades," said Todd Clark, head of listed equity trading at Wells Fargo Securities. "So, the market has a better tone to it. But we're having a classic summer Friday without a whole lot of impetus." 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 64.64 points, or 0.7 percent, at 9,191.09, after a two-day gain of 90 points.
The broader market finished mixed. The Nasdaq composite index fell 8.15 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,644.03. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.47 points, or 0.4 percent, to 977.59.
For the week, the three main gauges also ended mixed, with the Dow gaining 0.4 percent, the Nasdaq losing 4.2 percent, and the S.& P. declining 0.3 percent.
McDonald's advanced $1.83, or 8.3 percent, to $23.89, after it said July sales in its American business rose 9.9 percent, amid stronger demand for its Big Mac sandwich and breakfast foods.
Stocks have surged since mid-March, but analysts say investors now worry the advance may have come too fast and want to see stronger evidence of a solid economic recovery before pushing prices significantly higher. Investors also fear that rising interest rates may stifle the recovery, analysts say.
Mr. Clark said that investors were worried that high rates would curtail mortgage refinancing and home sales, one of the few bright spots in the uncertain economic recovery. A rebound in the bond market, sending prices higher and yields lower, would help lift stocks, he said.
Some investors were also taking a wait-and-see attitude in advance of the Fed meeting, even though policy makers were widely expected to leave rates unchanged.
"Investors will be watching what the Fed says in its policy statement and if there are any surprises," said Tracy G. Herrick, chief investment strategist at Jefferies & Company. If there is any sign the Fed might raise rates, "that would absolutely knock the market off its haunches."
Computer Associates rose 57 cents, to $24.17, after Deutsche Securities upgraded the company's stock to buy from hold.
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries gained 31 cents, to $55.07, after the Food and Drug Administration gave the company tentative approval to make a generic form of the epilepsy treatment Neurontin.
Decliners included Nvidia, which tumbled $3.80, or 19.7 percent, to $15.50, after the company reported a larger quarterly profit but said higher technology costs were hurting gross margins. It also cut its third-quarter outlook.
Intel fell 41 cents, to $23.58, while AT&T lost 21 cents, to $20.91.

Mixed Day for Treasuries
By The Associated Press)
Treasury bond prices were mixed yesterday.
The price of the 10-year note rose 7/32, to 99 26/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.27 percent from 4.30 percent in late trading Thursday.
The 30-year bond lost 9/32, to 102 4/32. Its yield rose to 5.23 percent from 5.22 percent.

Another Mass, But Minus One Regular

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
MARYANNE MACALUSO no longer attends Mass at St. Jean Baptiste Roman Catholic Church. This development may not cause concern in the Vatican, but clerics in authority should take note, because something has broken. And now Miss Macaluso is absent from the pew.
 She goes way back with the church, at 76th Street and Lexington Avenue. She wore its blue-plaid uniforms from 1st grade to 12th. She received First Holy Communion at its altar, helped set up the thrift shop in its basement. She watched the coffins of her father, mother and grandmother be carried down its aisle. 
 Miss Macaluso, 46, was so ubiquitous that the Blessed Sacrament order, whose priests run the parish, hired her to do administrative work. Then, in early 2002, the new pastor, the Rev. Mario Marzocchi, summoned her from a prayer session to offer her a part-time secretarial job. She accepted, she said, with the understanding that it would lead to full-time work.
Last October, Miss Macaluso telephoned another Blessed Sacrament priest she knows to report an incident: Father Marzocchi had sneaked up behind her in the rectory, she said, fondled her right breast, and whispered something lascivious. He vanished before she could confront him, she said, but then he reappeared "and stuck his tongue out at me."
She had cried before calling. The medical and funeral costs for three loved ones had tapped her out, and she was having trouble paying the rent for the apartment she has lived in all her life. She feared for her job, she said, but wrong is wrong.
The Rev. Norman Pelletier, the order's provincial superior in Ohio, dispatched a priest-psychologist to St. Jean's. He asked Miss Macaluso to confront Father Marzocchi in his presence, she said, and she reluctantly complied. When the psychologist observed that the pastor needed to learn boundaries, she said, she answered: "Boundaries? He's a 67-year-old man."
Miss Macaluso took a month's paid leave. After her doctor called the order to say that she was in emotional and financial distress, it paid for three months' rent and some counseling. She went four times. 
Father Pelletier said that Father Marzocchi disputed Miss Macaluso's account but was sent for a psychological evaluation that "found nothing wrong with him." But because Miss Macaluso "was constantly complaining about having to face this priest every day," he said, he reassigned Father Marzocchi to a parish in Florida -- where there was no response to a message left for him this week.
Back at the rectory, Miss Macaluso said, she heard whispers. The parish hired her full time, but cut her back to part time after a week. Extra work hours that she used to receive went to others. She scoffed at the order's contention that it tried to help her. "I was no longer welcome," she said.
Her landlord began eviction proceedings in the spring. She wrote a letter to the new pastor, the Rev. Anthony Schueller, asking for an assurance of six months' full-time work and an advance to stave off eviction. 
The pastor interpreted this as an ultimatum -- incorrectly, Miss Macaluso says. He wrote back that since he could not offer her a full-time job "at this time -- and you require such -- it is best that I terminate your employment here." He closed with, "Thank you for your service at St. Jean's."
Miss Macaluso sought unemployment insurance, but was denied because the parish maintained that she had quit. At a hearing last month before an unemployment appeals board judge, Father Schueller also testified that parishioners were complaining that a good pastor had been removed for spurious reasons.
Susan B. Egan, a lawyer for Miss Macaluso, said this week that the Blessed Sacrament priests were "punishing her for raising this issue." Michael Dowd, another of her lawyers, said, "It's almost like a 40-year marriage and her spouse kicked her out."
BUT Father Schueller responded that he had "no choice based upon her need" for full-time employment. He also said that the parish had often assisted Miss Macaluso, citing the time that St. Jean's helped to pay for her mother's funeral.
Asked about her accusations against his colleague, Father Schueller said, "It's her word against his word." Asked about her problems in the rectory, he said, "Whether it was because of the environment or something within her, that is unclear."
Miss Macaluso, who says she feels like a parishioner in exile, is scheduled to be evicted from her childhood home a week from Monday. That news upset Father Pelletier.
"I just don't know how we got to this point," he said.
