HEADLINE: After a Hard Month, a Budget Agreement in California

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 27 

 BODY:
California will probably have a budget in place by the end of the week for the fiscal year that began July 1, but the bruises from a month of difficult negotiations between Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and legislative leaders may take far longer to heal.
 The Republican governor and lawmakers agreed on a $103 billion state budget late Monday night, ending a 26-day impasse that signaled an end to Mr. Schwarzenegger's honeymoon in Sacramento. The fight saw the re-emergence of the Democratic-led Legislature as a political force after months of dominance by the governor from Hollywood. 
 The budget contains no new taxes, fulfilling a pledge by Mr. Schwarzenegger in last year's campaign in which he unseated Gov. Gray Davis in a recall election. The plan relies heavily on borrowing, accounting maneuvers and one-time deals with local governments, colleges and public school districts. It also includes hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenue from Indian casinos.
 The budget covers the fiscal year that began July 1. By law, the budget is supposed to be in place by June 30, but California officials seldom meet that deadline. Mr. Schwarzenegger had promised an on-time budget but was unable to deliver after negotiations deteriorated into name-calling and partisan wrangling over tangential issues. Ten days ago, in frustration, Mr. Schwarzenegger used the term ''girlie men'' to describe Democrats who refused to go along with his spending plan.
 The governor repeatedly broke off negotiations to appear at rallies, where he derided lawmakers as children in need of a timeout and threatened to campaign against legislators who defied him on the budget.
 But in announcing the accord late Monday night, Mr. Schwarzenegger changed his tone. 
 ''I'm a very happy governor today because we have agreed upon a budget, a budget that California needs and that the people of California deserve,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger told reporters in his Capitol office shortly before midnight on Monday. ''We proved again that by working together, Democrats and Republicans, we can make the impossible possible.''
 The final hurdle concerned the use of local tax revenues by state government. Mr. Schwarzenegger earlier this year negotiated a deal with local government officials to borrow $2.6 billion in local sales and property tax revenues over the next two years with a promise to avoid such borrowing in the future. On Monday he struck a deal with Democrats that any such borrowing in the future would require a two-thirds vote of the Legislature and be limited to twice every 10 years and only when all previous loans have been repaid.
 Democrats in turn gave in to a Republican demand for changes in a law signed last year by Mr. Davis that makes it easy for workers to sue their employers for labor violations.
 ''We all had to agree to things that we don't like,'' said Senator John Burton, the Democratic president pro tem of the Senate and one of the chief negotiators of the budget pact.
 The agreement came days before $570 million of payments to schools, universities and local governments were due to be paid. The State Controller, Steven P. Westly, said he could not authorize the payments unless a budget agreement was in place.
 Speaker Fabian Nunez, a Democrat, said that Mr. Schwarzenegger's public rallies might have pumped him up, but that they had done nothing to resolve the state's problems. He said the final details of the deal were hammered out over the weekend and on Monday.
 ''The only way to solve the problems we face and overcome the obstacles is by working together,'' Mr. Nunez said. ''You don't do it by threatening, by cajoling, by bullying the Legislature around. You do it cooperatively. That's how we started the process and, interestingly enough, in the last three days, that's how we finished the process.''
 Mr. Nunez said that the governor had treated members of the Legislature with disrespect and that it would take some time for hurt feelings to heal. ''I will not stand here and see their role diminished or their character called into question,'' the speaker said. ''I'm glad the governor changed the course he was embarked upon before last weekend. It's not healthy for him, it's not healthy for the Legislature and it's not healthy for the state of California.''
 Timothy Hodson, executive director of the Center for California Studies at California State University, Sacramento, said enactment of a budget in California was always an ordeal. Dr. Hodson noted that California had the fifth- or sixth-largest economy in the world and an annual state budget bigger than that of most countries.
 ''It's the equivalent of the French or the Spanish or the Japanese adopting their budget,'' Dr. Hodson said. 
 He also said that the annual budget debate had become the dominant political ritual of the year. All sorts of extraneous issues are addressed in the intense horse-trading of the budget's final act, he said.
 ''It has become the vehicle through which people pursue policy goals that don't have anything to do with the budget,'' he said.
 California is one of only three states that require a two-thirds vote of the Legislature to ratify a budget. The Democrats have large majorities in both houses of the Legislature, but not enough votes to pass a budget without some Republican help. Aides to the governor said on Tuesday that they were confident there were enough Republican votes to assure passage. 
 Several Democratic state lawmakers are in Boston for the party's national convention. They will fly home for a vote, tentatively scheduled for Thursday, to ratify the budget agreement. Mr. Schwarzenegger is expected to sign it on Saturday.
 Senator Burton, the acerbic San Franciscan who is retiring at the end of the year, said things looked bleak until the final moments before an agreement was reached. He said the breakthrough was more psychological than political.
 ''Speaking for myself and my Senate colleagues, when we accepted the fact that we were really girlie men, we just were able to get over that and get on with the budget,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Kerry Must-Sell: A Tough Foreign Policy

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 27 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry knows one simple truth about the election: if he cannot persuade Americans he will keep them safe, his chances of winning in a country transformed by the Sept. 11 terror attacks will be much diminished.
 Foreign policy, a virtual nonissue in the 2000 election, has become a big one: no longer a remote subject for post-cold-war pontification but a matter of life and death. Mr. Kerry, the Democrats' expected presidential nominee, has responded by trying to position his party as no less resolute than the Republicans but smarter, saner and more solid.
 ''Strength and wisdom are not opposing values,'' former President Bill Clinton said Monday, the opening night of the Democratic National Convention, adding that the United States could not ''possibly kill, jail or occupy'' all of its enemies. The choice he sought to frame was clear, one between the steady hand of Mr. Kerry, who saw combat in Vietnam, and the adventurism of President Bush, who did not. 
 ''We should have strengthened, not scorned, the alliances that won two world wars and the cold war,'' Senator Edward M. Kennedy told the convention delegates on Tuesday. 
 A tough foreign policy is not an easy sell for the Democrats. They have often struggled since Vietnam to articulate a unified position or have tried to ignore the issue in favor of domestic themes -- ''It's the economy, stupid'' -- that worked more in their favor. Mr. Clinton did his best to avoid the topic in 1992.
 But Mr. Kerry, a diplomat's son and a man with two decades of Senate service devoted to foreign affairs, is dealing with a world that has proved how much it can hurt the United States. With growing numbers of Americans uneasy about the country's international image, he has the opportunity to score decisive electoral points by reassuring them.
 At the same time, as a Massachusetts Democrat, he cannot afford to leave himself exposed to Republican charges of liberal wobbliness. Such accusations already abound, fed by Mr. Kerry's evolving position on Iraq since his vote in 2002 authorizing Mr. Bush to use force.
 ''He's been all over the place on foreign policy,'' Max Boot, a conservative foreign policy expert, said. ''For the Iraq war. Against it. For it in certain circumstances. He was an idealist on Bosnia and Kosovo. Now he sounds more like a student of realpolitik.''
 Certainly, the Democratic platform, the party's first articulation of foreign policy after Sept. 11, seeks to project strength. It calls for winning ''the global war against terror,'' increasing the military by 40,000 troops, revamping intelligence services, preserving the option to strike first in the face of an immediate threat and staying the course in Iraq.
 ''As president, I will not wait for a green light from abroad when our safety is at stake,'' Mr. Kerry said this year, while making clear that he would define imminent danger far more stringently than Mr. Bush.
 These promises -- with their refusal to reject entirely the Bush doctrine of pre-emption, their embrace of war and a strengthened military, and their open-ended commitment to Iraq -- will scarcely delight estranged allies like France and Germany or the antiwar wing of Mr. Kerry's party. 
 No matter: the priority is ousting the incumbent. 
 ''There are some inflated expectations in Europe,'' said Philip H. Gordon, a foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution. ''American foreign policy under Kerry would not change dramatically.''
 Still, advisers to the Democratic candidate believe that even a change of tone, with a limited change in substance, will have a dramatic effect on the nation's international standing. This now suffers from the wide perception of American arrogance, dishonesty and ineptitude in the preparation and conduct of the war in Iraq
 ''The rest of the world will breathe a huge sigh of relief with a Kerry administration, one willing to listen rather than bully,'' said James P. Rubin, a State Department spokesman in the Clinton years and a Kerry adviser. ''He will not agree with the Europeans on everything, but NATO would be a first rather than a last resort.''
 Of course, nothing, not even good intentions, is more vulnerable to events than a foreign-policy platform. Mr. Bush came to office dismissing the notion of nation-building; he is now an advocate of building democratic nations in an entire region, the Middle East.
 A second major terrorist attack on the United States could push a Kerry administration in equally unexpected directions. Mr. Kerry would probably feel the need to respond quickly with overwhelming force. But would shaken allies go along?
 For now, the Kerry strategy seems clear. He has chosen to give his acceptance speech under the slogan ''Stronger at Home, Respected in the World.'' The second clause reflects a conviction that Mr. Bush has destroyed the nation's moral authority through a might-is-right mixture of hubris, carelessness, bullying and incompetence. 
 ''We have lost the good will of the world,'' Mr. Kerry said late last year.
 There are signs that more Americans now share this view. Support for the war in Iraq, where more than 900 Americans have died, has eroded sharply. Mr. Bush's clear lead on national security issues has gone with it.
 The latest New York Times/CBS News poll shows that Americans harbor a deep post-Iraq skepticism about war, with 59 percent of voters and 72 percent of Democrats saying the United States should not attack another country unless attacked first.
 ''The American public is increasingly uncomfortable with not being loved around the world,'' said Ivo H. Daalder, a former Clinton administration official.
 Speaker after speaker at the convention has sought to ram home the view that Mr. Kerry alone can salvage the nation's authority and alliances and so fight terror more effectively.
 ''We cannot stop terrorism alone,'' William Perry, a former defense secretary, said. ''We must isolate the terrorists -- not isolate the United States.'' 
 Former President Jimmy Carter argued that ''we cannot lead if our leaders mislead.''
 Such statements brought prolonged cheers, a reflection of the passions now aroused by, of all things, foreign policy.
 But the fact is that Mr. Bush's America is far from alone, with support from London to Tokyo, and winning a war on global terrorism is an undertaking so vast that it seems likely to frustrate any president.
 Still, Mr. Kerry is convinced that he can do better than the Bush administration. He is promising to open ''a new era of alliances.'' 
 By instinct and upbringing Mr. Kerry dislikes broken bridges. Raised partly in Europe, speaking French and German, he is an internationalist who tends to seek coalitions in the belief that they best preserve and extend American power. Mr. Bush, by contrast, did little to reach out to allies early in his presidency and has given the impression that his favorite trips are to Texas.
 ''Kerry would never say, 'You're either with us or against us,''' Richard C. Holbrooke, an adviser to Kerry, said, ''because he knows that it's oversimplistic, however pleasing to certain Americans, and it is ultimately self-defeating.'' 
 Mr. Holbrooke was referring to Mr. Bush's statement after the Sept. 11 attacks that every nation faced a choice: ''You are either with us or against us in the fight against terror.''
 Rather than a system of fealty and punishment, Mr. Kerry hopes to emphasize cooperation even when there are differences. 
 His advisers believe that through efforts like an eagerness to hear from allies or a greater commitment to tackle Israeli-Palestinian differences, Mr. Kerry could signal a new beginning.
 His very presence in the White House, they insist, would sweep away the lost trust that is the lingering legacy of Mr. Bush's arguments for war in Iraq.
 But the notion of a panacea, or anything close to one, seems far-fetched. A Kerry administration would face a lot of disgruntlement linked to differing threat perceptions in Europe and the United States and the fact of the country's crushing military and economic supremacy.
 Short of being liked, Mr. Kerry appears determined not to be disliked. His foreign-policy answer to the mortal threats to the country amounts to an eclectic menu meant to appeal to a broad constituency.
 There are elements of realpolitik: no to the urgent promotion of democracy in places like Pakistan when American national security demands other priorities. There are elements of Wilsonian idealism: try to extend American values in the Middle East. A strong attachment to international institutions is accompanied by a readiness, in extremis, to go it alone. There is a strong belief in the value of military force.
 Events, of course, will determine which of these elements proves most important. But personality will also play a big role. Mr. Bush has shown a readiness to gamble, follow his instincts and trust that his faith and deep convictions about what is right will prevail.
 Mr. Clinton offered this view of Mr. Kerry: ''In a time of change, he has two other very important qualities: an insatiable curiosity to understand the world around him -- and a willingness to hear other views, even those who disagree with him. Therefore, John Kerry will make choices that reflect both conviction and common sense.''
 Those words, rather than an elaborate platform, may in the end offer the best clues to the likely nature of a Kerry administration foreign policy.

HEADLINE: New Life for the Taj Mahal of Rye Brook

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: RYE BROOK, July 22 

 BODY:
Rejecting conventional wisdom about the best uses for old corporate headquarters, Robert P. Weisz, a White Plains developer, has agreed to purchase Altria's sprawling 523,000-square-foot building here and plans to convert it to upscale offices for small and midsized firms. 
 Even 21 years after it was built, it is an imposing structure with a central domed atrium and has been called the Taj Mahal of office buildings in Westchester. It was opened as the headquarters of General Foods, which was soon acquired by Philip Morris, which later also took over Kraft Foods. Philip Morris changed its name to Altria in January 2003. 
 Mr. Weisz said he would seek as potential tenants top executives and company owners living in Westchester and Fairfield Counties who have tired of commuting to Manhattan and want to work closer to home. He will also market the building, which is set on 54 wooded acres with its own lake, to business owners already situated in Westchester who seek a setting with more prestige. 
 ''My goal is to fill the need in Westchester for luxury office space'' beyond what is found in the typical new office tower, he said. Annual rents, however, will be in the high $20's a square foot, about the going rate for other Class A commercial space in the county. In nearby Greenwich, Conn., by comparison, high-end office space rents for twice that amount and more, Mr. Weisz said. The Altria building is near Interstate 287, the Hutchinson River Parkway and Interstate 95 and thus an easy commute from Greenwich, Stamford and downtown White Plains.
 In January, when Altria announced that it was restructuring and would vacate the 20-year-old behemoth, some developers shied away. They claimed that the building was too big and unwieldy to be easily subdivided.
 Commercial real estate agents, meanwhile, feared they would be saddled with yet another empty corporate headquarters that would languish on the market and inflate Westchester's office vacancy rate (currently just under 13 percent) until a single user came along. 
 That has happened before: with I.B.M.'s former Americas/Far East headquarters in Mount Pleasant and Texaco's former headquarters in Harrison, among others. In those cases, single tenants -- New York Life and Morgan Stanley -- eventually acquired the properties, but only after several years.
 This time, though, Mr. Weisz -- a developer with about one million square feet of properties in the metropolitan area -- snapped up the former headquarters. 
 ''Look at all those windows and the long and narrow floor plates,'' he said during a visit to the site. ''It's perfect for what I have in mind. I can't see what everyone is so worried about.''
 The developer has a penchant for turning around commercial properties that others reject. For example, he bought the former Nestle headquarters on Bloomingdale Road in White Plains, which had been empty for about five years, and converted it for multitenant use.
 Mr. Weisz would not divulge the price he paid for the seven-story Altria building and a 59,000-square-foot building also on the property. The main structure includes three floors of covered parking. ''I will say, though, that I bought it at an extremely competitive price,'' he said. He added that he expected the purchase and renovation to cost him $60 million to $75 million.
 His company, RPW Group, includes a construction unit, enabling it to renovate projects economically. In addition, the county's Industrial Development Agency has indicated it will extend about $3 million in sales and property tax exemptions to RPW. 
 Mr. Weisz said the building would be ready for tenants next spring. Among them will probably be Ted Dacey, the president of Electronic Land Services, an 11-year-old real estate title insurance company with 15 employees, now situated just outside downtown White Plains. 
 ''It's time for us to move into an office building with that kind of cachet,'' said Mr. Dacey, who expects to lease about 4,000 square feet in Mr. Weisz's newest building. ''It will enhance our image.''
 Mr. Weisz, who owns seven other buildings in Westchester, expects to attract banking, investment, law and telecommunications companies, among others. In addition to subdividing the space into units as small as 2,000 square feet and as large as 200,000, he said, he plans to triple the size of the lobby and upgrade the amenities. Altria employees still working at the site -- there were about 1,000 when the company announced its plan to move -- will be vacating the building shortly.
 The developer said he would revamp the fitness center in the building, along with the squash and racquetball courts, and redecorate the large cafeteria and executive dining room. Other amenities will include a carwash, beauty salon, barbershop, dry cleaners, travel desk and shoeshine stand. 
 Despite the pessimism among real estate professionals when Altria announced it was putting the property on the market, Mr. Weisz was not the only interested party. ''In broker talk, there was actually a frenzy of interest in it,'' said William V. Cuddy, a senior vice president for CB Richard Ellis, a real estate services firm.
 Theresa G. Waivada, the executive director of the county's Industrial Development Agency, reported that a number of different developers had offered plans for the property. Among them was Mitchell C. Hochberg, a home developer in Valhalla, who said he wanted to turn the property into upscale residences.


CORRECTION-DATE: August 14, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on the Commercial Real Estate page of Business Day on July 28 about the sale of an office building in Rye Brook, N.Y., by the Altria Group misstated the time on the market for another corporate site in Westchester County. Texaco's headquarters property in Harrison was sold to Morgan Stanley after a few months -- not several years.

HEADLINE: S.&P. Rises From Year's Low as Profits Beat Forecasts

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks climbed yesterday, helping the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rebound from a 2004 low, after companies including Verizon Communications reported better-than-expected profit.
 The S.&P. 500 rose 10.76 points, or 1 percent, to 1,094.83, and the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 123.22 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,085.14. Both benchmarks had their biggest gains since June 7. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 30.08 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,869.10. 
 The Russell 2000 index, which tracks companies with a median market value of about $500 million, added 11.12 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 544.61.
 Verizon, the largest provider of phone services in the United States, jumped $1.36, to $37.86. Second-quarter profit surged to $1.8 billion from $338 million. Its earnings of 64 cents a share exceeded the average analyst estimate of 60 cents in a Thomson First Call poll.
 An index of telephone companies increased 2.3 percent. SBC Communications, the No.2 local telephone company, advanced 59 cents to $25.34. The BellSouth Corporation, the third-largest American local-phone company, added 50 cents, to $27.31.
 Pulte Homes Inc., the nation's largest home builder by stock market value, rose $3.08, to $53.38. Profit from continuing operations this year will be $7.80 to $8 a share, the company said. It previously expected earnings of as much as $7.25.
 A government report yesterday showed that home sales fell less than forecast. In addition, consumer confidence climbed to a two-year high in July as expectations for the job market improved, the Conference Board reported. 
 Dillard's Inc. and Sears, Roebuck & Company led gains among retailers. Dillard's jumped $1.24, to $23.06, while Sears added $2.04, to $35.38.
 An index of 30 department stores and discount retailers in the S.&P. 500 rose 2.9 percent, the biggest advance among the benchmark's 24 industry groups.
 Monster Worldwide Inc., the owner of the world's most-used Internet site for job advertising, rose $1.84, to $22.31. After the market's close, the company said second-quarter profit jumped to 14 cents a share. Analysts in a Thomson poll expected 13 cents.
 ''Hopefully the worst of the earnings is behind us,'' said Maria L. Azari, a money manager at Denver-based Cambiar Investors, which has $3 billion in assets. ''If anybody has positive surprises, it would help the market.''
 Of the 300 companies in the S.&P. 500 index that have reported second-quarter earnings, 69 percent exceeded analysts' estimates. On average, 58 percent topped quarterly forecasts over the past 10 years, according to Thomson.
 Shares of Cardinal Health Inc., the drug distributor, lost $6.47, to $44. The 13 percent drop was the steepest in the S.&P. 500. The company said Richard J. Miller, 46, resigned as chief financial officer after regulators stepped up an investigation of the company's accounting.
 Anthem Inc., which is seeking to buy WellPoint Health Networks to become the nation's biggest health insurer, fell $6.38, to $81.78. Anthem's medical costs rose more than expected in the second quarter, and the company predicted that medical costs this year would probably jump by about 10 percent, and premiums by 9 percent.
 Concern about rising medical costs drove the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payers Index, which includes 12 health insurers, down 4.2 percent. WellPoint declined $6.18, to $99.03, and PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. lost $2.37, to $31.31.
 Five stocks rose for every three that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.6 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 14 percent more than the three-month daily average.
 The 10-year United States Treasury note tumbled after consumer confidence rose more than forecast and the government's auction of $11 billion in inflation-linked bonds drew less demand than traders anticipated. The price of the 10-year note fell 11/32, to 101 2/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 4.61 percent, from 4.49 percent on Monday. 
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week bills and 20-year inflation-protected notes:

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Speeches on Broad Variety of Issues at the Convention in Boston

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from some speeches last night at the Democratic National Convention in Boston, as recorded by The New York Times. Full transcripts are at nytimes.com/campaigns. 

Barack Obama
 There is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America. 
 The pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states. Red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats. But I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states and, yes, we've got some gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq, and there are patriots who supported the war in Iraq. 
 We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the Stars and Stripes, all of us defending the United States of America. In the end, that's what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or do we participate in a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope.
 I'm not talking about blind optimism here -- the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't think about it or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. That's not what I'm talking about. 
 I'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs. The hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores. The hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta. The hope of a millworker's son who dares to defy the odds. The hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. Hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope!

Teresa Heinz Kerry
 My name is Teresa Heinz Kerry. And by now I hope it will come as no surprise that I have something to say. Tonight, as I have done throughout this campaign, I would like to speak to you from the heart. 
 With John Kerry as president, we can and we will protect our nation's security without sacrificing our civil liberties. In short, John believes that we can and we must lead the world -- as America, unique among nations, always should -- by showing the face, not of its fears, but of our hopes.
 And John is a fighter. He earned his medals the old-fashion way, by putting his life on the line for his country. And no one will defend this nation more vigorously than he will. And he will always, always, be first in the line of fire. But he also knows the importance of getting it right. For him, the names of many friends inscribed in the Vietnam Memorial, that cold stone, testify to the awful toll exacted by leaders who mistake stubbornness for strength.
 And that is why, as president, my husband will not fear disagreement or dissent. He believes that our voices, yours and mine, must be the voices of Freedom. And if we do not speak, neither does she. In America, the true patriots are those who dare speak truth to power. And the truth that we must speak now is that America has responsibilities that it is time for us to accept again.

Richard A. Gephardt
 When I think back on the months and miles of my own campaign, my heart is full. You see, I didn't come from much. My dad was a milk truck driver, a proud member of the Teamsters. My mom was a secretary. Neither finished high school. I never dreamed I'd have the chance to serve so many people in so many ways. I found a true partner in life, my wife, Jane, who I adore, and children, Matt, Chrissy and Kate, and their families, that I couldn't be prouder of.
 I had the honor to serve my constituents in Missouri and a gifted and loyal staff who helped me throughout my career. I'm a lucky man. Together, they taught me that win or lose the dream is what matters. The fight is what it's all about for an America that works for the many, not just for the few, for an America that lifts all those who've been locked out and left out of our bountian promise. 
 I ran for president because I wanted to give those people a voice. And I stand proudly at John Kerry's convention because he speaks for them, he strives to lift them up. 

Howard Dean
 I may not be the nominee, but I can tell you this. For the next 100 days, I'll be doing everything that I can to make sure that John Kerry and John Edwards take this country back for the people who built it, because tonight we are all here to represent the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party.
 I am proud of John Kerry's leadership and I intend to stand shoulder to shoulder with him as we fight for the things that Harry Truman promised us in 1948 -- health insurance for every single American, a jobs program that will create jobs instead of destroy them, standing up for middle-class and working Americans who got a tax increase not a tax cut and standing up for a foreign policy that relies on the president of the United States' telling the truth to the American people before we send our brave soldiers to fight in a foreign war. 
 I'd like a commander in chief who supports our soldiers and supports our veterans instead of cutting their hardship pay abroad and cutting their health benefits when they get back home. I'm Howard Dean and I'm voting for John Kerry.

Ron Reagan
 I know a child -- well, she must be 13 now; I guess I'd better call her a young woman. She has fingers and toes. She has a mind. She has memories. She has hopes. She has juvenile diabetes. Like so many kids with this disease, she's adjusted amazingly well. The insulin pump she wears -- she's decorated hers with rhinestones. She can handle her own catheter needle. She's learned to sleep through the blood drawings in the wee hours of the morning. 
 She's very brave. She is also quite bright and understands full well the progress of her disease and what that might ultimately mean -- blindness, amputation, diabetic coma. Every day, she fights to have a future. What excuse will we offer this young woman should we fail her now? What might we tell her children? Or the millions of others who suffer? That when given an opportunity to help we turned away? That facing political opposition we lost our nerve? That even though we knew better we did nothing?
 And, should we fail, how will we feel if, a few years from now, a more enlightened generation should fulfill the promise of embryonic stem cell therapy? Imagine what they would say of us who lacked the will. No, no, we owe this young woman and all those who suffer -- we owe ourselves -- better than that. We are better than that. We are a wiser people, a finer nation. 
 And for all of us in this fight, let me say we will prevail. The tide of history is with us. Like all generations who have come before ours, we are motivated by a thirst for knowledge and compelled to see others in need as fellow angels on an often difficult path, deserving of our compassion.
 In a few months, we will face a choice. Yes, between two candidates and two parties, but more than that. We have a chance to take a giant stride forward for the good of all humanity. We can choose between the future and the past, between reason and ignorance, between true compassion and mere ideology. This is our moment, and we must not falter. 
 Whatever else you do come Nov. 2, I urge you, please, cast a vote for embryonic stem cell research.

Edward M. Kennedy
 Our struggle is not with some monarch named George who inherited the crown. Although it often seems that way.
 Our struggle is with the politics of fear and favoritism in our own time, in our own country. Our struggle, like so many others before, is with those who put their own narrow interest ahead of the public interest. 
 We hear echoes of past battles in the quiet whisper of the sweetheart deal, in the hushed promise of a better break for the better connected. We hear them in the cries of the false patriots who bully dissenters into silence and submission. These are familiar fights. We've fought and we've won them before. And with John Kerry and John Edwards leading us, we will win them again and again and again and make America stronger at home and respected once more in the world. 
 Today, because of the surpassing wisdom of our founders, the constant courage of the patriots of the past and the shared sacrifice of generations of Americans who kept the faith, the power of America still rests securely in citizens' hands. In our hands. 
 True to our highest and noblest ideals, we intend to use that power. We will use it wisely and well. We will use it, in the poet's words my brothers loved, ''to strive, to seek, to find and not to yield.'' We will use it to heal, to build, to hope and to dream again. And in doing so, we will truly make our country once more America the Beautiful.

HEADLINE: From Chicago '68 to Boston, The Left Comes Full Circle

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 27 

 BODY:
At a standing-room-only forum against the war in Iraq, Tom Hayden, a leader of the bloody antiwar protests at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, began Tuesday by asking how many members of the audience were Democrats.
 Virtually all of the 400 people, including those sitting in the aisles, raised their hands. 
 Then Mr. Hayden asked, ''How many of you have been in the streets five times in the past two years?'' 
 Again, almost everyone raised a hand.
 Mr. Hayden, a member of the Chicago Eight, a co-founder of Students for a Democratic Society and a former California state senator, spent much of the next 20 minutes urging the audience, members of the Democratic Party's left, antiwar flank, to vote for Senator John Kerry. 
 Mr. Hayden, who spent much of the 1960's battling against the Democratic Party, now urged antiwar activists to work within the party. 
 Sitting next to a sign saying, ''End the Occupation of Iraq,'' Mr. Hayden told members of the audience, many of whom had originally backed Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, that whatever their reservations about Mr. Kerry, it was vital that they vote for him.
 ''In a rough but very real way the November election will be a referendum on the war in Iraq,'' Mr. Hayden told the gathering at a Roman Catholic conference center. ''The antiwar movement must step up to its responsibility to make this a referendum on the war.''
 In 1968, during the convention in Chicago, thousands of leftists took to the streets to protest the Vietnam War and to belittle the party's nominee, Hubert Humphrey, for not opposing the war. But Mr. Hayden's remarks on Tuesday indicated that, many antiwar stalwarts have embraced Mr. Kerry even though he voted for the war in Iraq. 
 Even some former supporters of Ralph Nader, including the filmmaker Michael Moore, are backing Mr. Kerry because they are so upset with President Bush.
 Liberal Democrats have descended on Boston by the thousands, though many are not convention delegates. They have organized more than a dozen forums to protest the war in Iraq and the president's policies on the economy, civil liberties and abortion. 
 One forum featuring Mr. Moore and Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor, attracted so many to a hotel in Cambridge that fire marshals turned away 700 people.
 Liberals in groups like the Progressive Democrats of America have crowded into Boston to pursue several strategies. Many are trying to push the Democratic Party and Mr. Kerry further to the left. Many support Mr. Kerry's goal of building a broad, unified Democratic Party to maximize the chances of winning. And many see their role as helping woo Nader supporters into the fold.
 ''We know that we progressive Democrats may well be the difference in the election,'' Mr. Kucinich said. ''We're going to reach out and help put up that big tent. We will ensure that John Kerry wins by showing those who would otherwise vote for Ralph Nader that there is a place for them in the Democratic Party.''
 Mr. Moore, who backed Mr. Nader four years ago, said at the forum with Mr. Dean that the Nader campaign had helped Mr. Bush win. He excused Mr. Kerry for voting for the war, saying that the senator, like many lawmakers, had been misled by the administration.
 Mr. Kucinich, who has called on the Bush administration to withdraw American troops from Iraq, said he would not let Mr. Kerry's support of the war deter him from campaigning for the Democratic ticket. 
 ''We're not going to hold John Kerry accountable for the war,'' Mr. Kucinich said. ''We're going to hold George Bush to account, because it's George Bush's war.'' 
 The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a powerful figure on the Democratic left, said there was no question that liberals should rally around Mr. Kerry. 
 ''The Bush-Cheney-Ashcroft team is extreme in its anti-civil rights and anti-abortion policies,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''On the other hand, John Kerry and John Edwards open new possibilities for progressives.''
 Still, some Democratic antiwar activists remain unconvinced.
 Eileen Riordan of Keene, N.H., backed Mr. Kucinich in the primary. Now, she said, she is tempted by Mr. Kerry but remains unsure. ''I do not agree with Kerry's position on Iraq,'' she said, adding that she hoped he would agree to a quicker troop withdrawal.
 Mr. Hayden said the left's marching days are not over. He said he hoped 200,000 people would protest during the Republican convention next month in New York.
 ''People need to stand up to the Bush administration in Iraq,'' he said. ''The peace movement has to be in the streets of New York.''

HEADLINE: Senate Nominee Speaks of Encompassing Unity

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE; Brian Wingfield and Jonathan P. Hicks contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 27 

 BODY:
Barack Obama took the dais as the keynote speaker at the Democratic convention here on Tuesday and told a classic American story of immigration, hope, striving and opportunity. He did not speak of race or civil rights or a struggle for equality. He did not speak, as the Rev. Jesse Jackson did so passionately in 1996, of the legacy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a black America still in despair.
 Instead, Mr. Obama, a black state senator from Illinois who is running for the United States Senate, spoke of ''one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.'' 
 He drew rousing applause, and tears in some cases, for lines like, ''There's not a liberal America and a conservative America. There's the United States of America.''
 For some black delegates and elected officials, Mr. Obama's optimistic theme of one America -- for Arab-Americans and Latinos, red states and blue states -- was entirely appropriate. Many of his listeners here tonight said they could not help but feel pride that Mr. Obama could become the only black member of the Senate and the third since Reconstruction.
 ''I think he is going to be a star in the Democratic Party,'' said Frederick Young, a member of the Illinois delegation. ''I am proud, as a black man, to see him give a speech like the one he gave. It was inspirational.''
 But for some an equally compelling feature is that Mr. Obama could help the Democrats win a majority in the Senate. And many black delegates are so eager to defeat President Bush and the Republicans this year that they have embraced the theme of unity and optimism imposed by Democratic leaders and put aside their intraparty struggles of the past. 
 ''What you're seeing is a maturation of the African-American vote and presence in the party,'' said Alexis M. Herman, the secretary of labor in the Clinton administration and a senior adviser to Senator John Kerry. ''We're at the table and helping to shape the agenda as opposed to being on the outside trying to get in.''
 Four years ago, the keynote speaker, Representative Harold E. Ford Jr. of Tennessee, was also black. Mr. Ford, who gave a fairly innocuous speech, was overshadowed by Mr. Jackson and the party's black caucus, who pointedly questioned the commitment of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the vice-presidential nominee, to affirmative action and public education.
 The message of Mr. Obama was quite different. The son of a black man who grew up in Kenya herding goats and a white woman from Kansas, he said his parents shared ''an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation.''
 Mr. Obama, 42, went on to study at Columbia and was the first black president of The Harvard Law Review. He scored a stunning victory in the March Democratic primary in Illinois, facing six opponents and still winning 53 percent of the vote. His Republican opponent, under fire, dropped out and has not been replaced. 
 ''I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story,'' he said.
 Some in the audience said Mr. Obama, who is married and has two daughters, had immediately risen to star status in a party eager for one.
 ''His story symbolizes the country's opportunities,'' said Tom J. Troetti, a delegate from New York. ''Based on that speech, he now personifies this party's future.'' 
 There is already greater-than-usual enthusiasm among black delegates here. Walter Johnson, 49, a postal worker from Visalia, Calif., said he was so energized to work for Mr. Kerry that he would try to drum up voter support when he returned home ''by walking the street, by knocking on doors, and by phone banking.''
 ''To those that I reach,'' Mr. Johnson said, ''I'm going to say, 'Hey, get your family members, get your friends. This is important.'''
 Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, said that many blacks were motivated by the disputed vote in Florida in 2000.
 ''Black folks started campaigning against Bush right after the last election was stolen,'' Mr. Rangel said. ''You put out the word to the black man and say 'Don't forget Florida,' you are putting out the most powerful message that we can put out politically.''
 Mr. Kerry chose Mr. Obama to deliver the keynote address long before Mr. Bush asked black voters last week to consider voting Republican.
 Some said they were insulted by Mr. Bush's pitch.
 ''African-Americans are smart,'' said Mayor Douglas Palmer of Trenton, the president of the National Conference of Mayors. ''They realize that we have given the Republican Party a chance going all the way back to Abraham Lincoln.''
 Some said the Democratic Party had achieved a level of equilibrium, where its message could speak to both its most loyal constituency and swing voters. As Mr. Obama himself said earlier to black delegates here, ''Democrats succeed when they reach out to other people but don't forget the base.'' 
 He sought to do just that in his speech on Tuesday, as he addressed ''Democrats, Republicans, Independents'' and talked about jobs, the high cost of health care and college tuition, the needs of veterans, and the imperative to ''never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war.''
 David Bositis, a research associate at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington, said Democrats were in agreement on issues, and as such should focus on getting blacks to the polls. Mr. Bositis noted that blacks made up a significant percentage of the vote in several of the contested states, including Florida, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania. 
 Stephanie Cutter, a spokesman for Mr. Kerry, said, ''By conducting this type of convention the way we have and by striving for a convention that reflects America, we're showing that we aren't taking anything for granted.''

HEADLINE: Brazilian Bank Official Resigns Amid Reports of Tax Evasion

BYLINE: By TODD BENSON

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, July 28 

 BODY:
Luiz Augusto Candiota, the director of monetary policy at Brazil's central bank, resigned on Wednesday amid accusations of tax evasion that have also focused on the bank's president, Henrique Meirelles.
 The announcement came less than a week after a local newsmagazine, IstoE, published an article claiming that Mr. Candiota and Mr. Meirelles had failed to accurately report income held in overseas bank accounts before they assumed their posts in early 2003. The report also said that federal prosecutors were investigating tax irregularities. 
 In a joint news conference in Brasilia, both Mr. Candiota and Mr. Meirelles denied any wrongdoing. But Mr. Candiota said that the accusations had compromised his ability to conduct his job and that he felt obliged to step down in order to shield the bank from unwarranted criticism.
 ''I confess I have absolutely no motivation left to remain in this job,'' he told reporters after reading a letter of resignation in which he harshly criticized the IstoE report as unfounded.
 However, Mr. Meirelles, a former FleetBoston executive, said he had no intention of resigning. Federal prosecutors confirmed earlier this week that they have been investigating the central bank chief since June.
 Mr. Candiota is suspected, the magazine reported, of having failed to report money transfers from a bank account in New York.
 Mr. Meirelles is accused of not reporting income from foreign bank accounts in 2001 and 2002, the magazine reported, despite having established residency in Brazil to run for Congress. The central bank, however, issued a statement last week saying that for tax purposes Mr. Meirelles was a resident of New York, where he was living at the time.
 Mr. Candiota, a Harvard-trained economist who worked for Citigroup in Brazil before joining the central bank, will be succeeded by Rodrigo Telles de Rocha Azevedo, who has been the chief economist at Credit Suisse First Boston's Brazilian subsidiary since 1999. Mr. Azevedo, who holds a doctorate in economics from the University of Illinois, has to be approved by the Senate before he can assume the post, a process that is expected to take a few weeks.
 Brazilian financial markets, which had fallen earlier in the week in the wake of the accusations against the bank officials, took the news of Mr. Candiota's resignation in stride. The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange's benchmark Bovespa index was up 0.4 percent in late afternoon trade, and the country's currency, the real, strengthened slightly against the dollar.
 ''This was a nice and fast solution to the tax fraud allegations,'' said Jankiel Santos, an economist at ABN Amro in Sao Paulo. ''And I don't think it means any changes in monetary policy are likely. Azevedo has a good reputation in the market and is a very good replacement.''
 Mr. Candiota was one of the best-known members of the central bank's monetary policy committee, which sets Brazil's benchmark interest rate. Mr. Candiota was also instrumental in the bank's policy of actively seeking to reduce the government's debt load linked to the dollar as a way of shielding the country against external economic shocks.

HEADLINE: U.N. and U.S. in Urgent Appeals to Help Refugees in Sudan

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 28 

 BODY:
Secretary General Kofi Annan appealed to 11 European and Asian nations on Wednesday to meet urgent financing needs for the crisis in western Sudan, and the United States pressed reluctant Security Council members on a resolution threatening the government with sanctions.
 An estimated 30,000 black Africans have been killed and 1.2 million have been displaced by marauding Arab militias armed by the government in Khartoum in a campaign that United Nations officials -- and the United States Congress -- have characterized as genocide. 
 ''There is a universal recognition that Darfur is a disaster, that the government of Sudan is culpable and that action on a very tight time frame is essential,'' John C. Danforth, the American ambassador to the United Nations and formerly President Bush's special envoy to Sudan, said in arguing for swift passage of the resolution. 
 Marie Okabe, a United Nations spokeswoman, said the United Nations had received only $158 million in response to its appeals for $349 million for the victims in the Darfur region in western Sudan and for refugees in neighboring Chad. 
 Mr. Annan's appeal went to leaders in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, and to the Netherlands in its role as current chairman of the European Union.
 The Netherlands, the United States, Britain and the European Commission have contributed 70 percent of the current total, Ms. Okabe said. In Berlin on Wednesday, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, the overseas development minister, announced that Germany was raising its contribution by $24 million, to $40.2 million.
 Ms. Okabe said that in spite of the Sudanese government's pledge to Mr. Annan this month to halt the violence, the United Nations was receiving daily reports of intimidation of refugees by the government and attacks on villagers by the government-sponsored Janjaweed militias. She said United Nations staff members had interviewed 38 women and girls who said they had been raped in the past week, sometimes repeatedly, by Janjaweed fighters.
 A report by the African Union on Wednesday said Arab militiamen had recently burned villagers who had been shackled in chains.
 After a second day of talks in the Security Council on the American-sponsored resolution, Mr. Danforth said the United States would push for a vote on Thursday or Friday.
 The draft resolution has been revised to include more support for an African Union relief and police action under way in Sudan. But the United States has not backed off its insistence that the measure include the explicit threat of sanctions against Sudan if the government does not live up to pledges to rein in the marauding militias. The measure demands that the government show tangible progress in 30 days in disarming the fighters and bringing them to justice.
 ''It would have to be clear to the government of Sudan that what we mean is sanctions,'' Mr. Danforth said. ''The prime responsibility of the government of Sudan is not to brutalize its own people, not to bomb people, not to arm militias to attack people, not to support people who engage in the burning of villages and rape.
 ''That's what's going on in Darfur right now. Human beings are being killed, hundreds of them every day, as a direct result of the actions of the government in Khartoum.''
 Differences over what action to take exist even within the European Union. France's foreign minister, Michel Barnier, has said the African Union should solve the problem without outside involvement; Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, on the other end of the spectrum, has gone so far as to suggest sending troops.
 Richard A. Grenell, the spokesman for the American mission at the United Nations, indicated that the strategy in the Security Council would be to shame objecting governments into the open. ''People who don't vote for this resolution will have a lot of explaining to do,'' he said.
 Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, in Cairo for meetings with President Hosni Mubarak and other senior Egyptian officials, stressed that international pressure must be kept on Sudan to rein in the militiamen. Ahmed Abul Gheit, Egypt's foreign minister, said Sudan should be given a chance to stabilize the situation and allow hundreds of thousands of refugees to return.
 ''We should give the Sudanese government time to respond,'' Mr. Powell said, ''but these people don't have that much time before disease and famine take tens of thousands of lives.''

CORRECTION-DATE: July 30, 2004

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about an appeal by Secretary General Kofi Annan for donations to help the 1.2 million people of Darfur, in southwestern Sudan, misstated United Nations officials' characterization of the situation there. They describe the attacks on black African villagers by Arab militias, which have left some 30,000 dead, as ethnic cleansing, not genocide.

HEADLINE: Now Playing, a Digital Brigadoon

BYLINE: By CHRIS THOMPSON

DATELINE: SANTA CRUZ, Calif. 

 BODY:
LIKE most cities in Silicon Valley's outer stratosphere, Santa Cruz has a district dedicated to an odd marriage of high and low tech, where lumber mills and cement factories squat beside gleaming software business parks. But the geeks and hipsters who parked their bikes on this slab of broken land and sneaked past the ''no trespassing'' sign were not here on business. They were going to the movies.
 Few theaters consist of dead weeds and a mound of gray slag squeezed between a laboratory and an alloy manufacturing firm. But these movie buffs have brought their own theater with them. For three years, cult-movie buffs have been organizing ''guerrilla drive-ins'' in a number of cities, rigging together a nest of digital projectors, DVD players, and radio transmitters or stereo speakers, spreading the word online, and assembling on parking lots or fields to watch obscure films beneath the stars. 
 They project the image onto warehouses or bridge pillars, tune their car stereos to a designated FM frequency, and sit back and enjoy the show. The only thing they do not do is ask for permission. 
 As dusk crept over the hills on a Friday night, a 1964 Ford pickup careened to the curb, and out jumped Wes Modes, the impresario behind the Santa Cruz guerrilla drive-in collective. Dressed in black and distinguished by a shock of frizzy red hair, Mr. Modes, 37, reached into the truck bed and began hauling out milk crates bristling with surge protectors and extension cords, a DVD player wired to an amplifier, and two 50-pound golf-cart batteries. 
 The police had broken up two showings in the last few weeks, so he kept his eyes peeled for patrol cars. As about 100 slackers, electrical engineers and graduate students unfurled blankets and waited for the opening credits to Richard Linklater's 2001 movie ''Waking Life,'' Mr. Modes checked his equipment. ''I don't know how good the batteries are going to be,'' he fretted. ''So I think I want to run backup.'' With a few sidelong glances, he strung out 300 feet of extension cord, crept down to the adjacent lab, and plugged into a socket he found in the driveway.
 VCR's and specialty video stores may have exported art films to every corner of the country, but to Mr. Modes and his friends, they also left people stranded in their living rooms, starved for the community and fun of rep houses and B-movie drive-ins. In the mid-90's, cultural pranksters like David Krzysik, who runs the annual Brainwash Movie Festival in Oakland, Calif., experimented with replicating the ambience of old drive-ins, organizing movie showings in empty lots and open-air art spaces. But 16-millimeter projectors were too bulky and expensive for any but the most dedicated movie lover.
 Now, high-quality DVD players, digital projectors and iPods have put the technology of drive-in movies into the hands of anyone with $1,500 to spare, giving rise to outdoor movie nights in locations from warehouse packing districts to suburban cul-de-sacs. Instructions on converting iPods into radio transmitters are available at Web sites like engadget.com, many DVD players cost less than $100 and any blank wall will work as a screen. 
 In cities like Tampa, Fla., and West Chester, Pa., as well as Santa Cruz, people are pirating a piece of that old Hollywood magic and challenging conventions on the role of public space in the process. ''The one I used last week was unbelievable,'' Mr. Krzysik said of the latest liquid-crystal-display projector he set up in Oakland. ''And it's cheap, too. I think it cost $1,200, whereas in the old days it would have cost $30,000.''
 Even $1,000 was too steep for John Young, a technophile in West Chester who became infatuated with guerrilla drive-ins after reading about them in a hobbyist magazine. So Mr. Young decided to build his own projector and found step-by-step instructions after just a few minutes of Web research. 
 ''There's a community out there for some serious home theater geeks,'' he said. ''They're using parts from old rear-projection video systems, from sports bar televisions from back in the day.'' Within a few weeks, Mr. Young had assembled his Commando Projector, a mass of circuit board and liquid crystal encased in an old heating duct mounted on the handlebars of his motorcycle. 
 For a year, Mr. Young has cruised the roads of Pennsylvania, scouting sites and tipping off his friends when he finds a winner. His Web site, www.tikaro.com/gdi, is emblazoned with an image of Che Guevara wearing 3-D glasses. ''There's no novelty in watching a movie by yourself anymore,'' Mr. Young wrote in a recent e-mail. ''It's way more fun to watch 'The Bad News Bears Go to Japan' on the back of the old Y.M.C.A. building than it is to watch reruns of 'Jerry Maguire' on cable by yourself.''
 Unlike Mr. Young, most guerrilla drive-in ringmasters seem to have come up with the idea by themselves and for their own reasons. In Florida, a pirate-radio enthusiast, Kelly Benjamin, staged a series of drive-in screenings to raise money for a quixotic 2003 Tampa City Council race. A Los Angeles filmmaker, Lawrence Bridges, has used guerrilla drive-ins to get around traditional distribution networks. 
 Mr. Bridges, an advertising executive who heads the digital design company Red Car, spent 12 years and $300,000 making a movie about ancient Greek demigods condemned to live in Los Angeles and act as characters from ''The Importance of Being Earnest.'' By the time he finished his project, he decided that the best showcase for this elegy to his hometown would be in the open air, with the cityscape as a living backdrop. So his staff spent a year sneaking onto parking lots and projecting his film against a wall on Saturday nights. 
 Red Car employees are currently showing his film at various locations in Dallas and plan to take the movie to an empty lot somewhere in Brooklyn. ''We don't say, 'Can we use the space?''' said Mr. Bridges's executive assistant, Destiny London, in a telephone interview. ''But we've never had any problem.''
 Mr. Modes and his Santa Cruz friends started showing movies in the backyard of the house they shared (their ''collective'' is largely a grander reference to their former living arrangements) before taking their act on the road, as it were. But Mr. Modes aspires to more than a good time on a Friday night: he wants to change the way people use public space, and return the commons to an idealized past untainted by money. 
 ''Part of why we're doing this is to reclaim public space and give people a way to use the nighttime that's not mediated by commerce,'' he said. ''In our town, the parks close at sundown, you have to buy something at coffee shops. We wanted to give people a way to interact with each other outdoors without having to spend any money.''
 Of course, he is also organizing guerrilla drive-ins for the thrill of being naughty. Not only are Mr. Modes and his friends trespassing when they set up their events, they are not exactly clearing their project with the companies that own the rights to the films they show, either. 
 Michael Bergman, a Los Angeles-based entertainment lawyer, said the fact that Mr. Modes does not charge admission does not diminish his basic violation of copyright law. ''The copyright proprietor for the film has the exclusive right to publicly perform the work,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''Projecting a rented DVD onto the side of a building, where anybody who wants to can come and watch it, is certainly a violation of the copyright act.'' 
 But whether Hollywood would bother to crack down on a few enterprising movie fans is another question. Breena Camden, a spokeswoman for Fox Searchlight Pictures, which owns the rights to the Linklater film that Mr. Modes showed here in mid-July, refused to comment, if only because her company has never encountered this situation before. ''This is the first I've heard of it,'' Ms. Camden admitted.
 So for now, Mr. Modes and his friends seem safe. Even the police do not really care; the Santa Cruz deputy police chief, Patty Sapone, said her officers had shut down the previous movie because Mr. Modes was using public property; as far as trespassing at the new site, it is not a matter for the police unless the property owner complains. 
 As the ocean breeze took the edge off the summer heat, Becca Anderson, 24, sat on a blanket and waited for the show to start. Ms. Anderson moved in May from Wisconsin to San Mateo, south of San Francisco, looking for work and a taste of the Bay Area's counterculture, she said, but found herself surrounded by computer geeks who talked endlessly about gaming. 
 The San Francisco club scene was too fast for her, she said, so she and her friends logged onto www.squidlist.com, the local Web clearinghouse for subversive culture, and found out about Mr. Modes's labor of love. ''They show some awesome movies,'' Ms. Anderson said. ''You don't often see a drive-in with 'Waking Life.' Or 'Dr. Strangelove.'''
 Just before the main feature, Mr. Modes showed a few experimental short films as appetizers. The clear crowd favorite was ''Round and Round,'' a 1939 General Motors educational cartoon about the laws of economics. After all, buying and selling was exactly what these people have come here to avoid.

HEADLINE: Fed Regional Survey Shows Slowdown in Recent Growth

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve reported on Wednesday that the economy cooled in June and July as consumer spending slowed after a surge in early spring.
 Separately, the Commerce Department said that orders to factories for durable goods rose 0.7 percent in June, reflecting demand for military aircraft, after declines in orders in April and May. The increase was nonetheless smaller than analysts expected. 
 The survey of business activity, compiled from reports from the Federal Reserve's 12 regional banks, was the latest indication of what the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, calls a ''soft patch'' in the economy that developed in June. Elements of the Fed report, known as the beige book, will be used on Aug. 10 when the Federal Open Market Committee meets on interest rates. 
 The survey found that wholesale prices, especially for energy, steel and cement, were rising but that relatively little price pressure other than in energy products was being passed on to retail buyers.
 The Fed depicted an economy that was rebounding unevenly from a period of recession and weak employment.
 ''Several districts reported that the rate of growth moderated,'' the beige book said, listing New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City and San Francisco as regions where pauses in activity were detected.
 Much of the weakness was attributed to a slowing of consumer spending, particularly on autos. But the report said there were ''pockets of weakness'' in manufacturing as well.
 It described travel and tourism, hit hard after the September 2001 terrorist attacks, as ''strong'' and said that residential construction remained healthy despite a recent rise in mortgage rates from 40-year lows.
 June's gain in orders for durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, followed declines of 0.9 percent in May and 2.7 percent in April. The drop in May had originally been reported as a sharper fall of 1.8 percent. Orders last rose in March, when they surged 5.9 percent.

HEADLINE: Love of Leisure, and Europe's Reasons

BYLINE: By KATRIN BENNHOLD; Elisabetta Povoledo of The International Herald Tribune contributed reporting from Rome for this article.; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN 

 BODY:
Between mountains of suitcases and children racing each other with luggage trolleys at the airport of this Scandinavian capital, Maibritt Ditlev, husband, Anders, and daughter, Lotte, in tow, remarked that her whole country seemed to be going on vacation. 
 ''In Europe we like our summer holidays,'' she said, emphasizing that even a lot of cash would not tempt her to give up her two-week trip to Iceland. In fact, she works part time because she treasures time off. ''We have a nice house and can afford to go on two family holidays a year -- what would we need more money for?''
 This image of a casual Western European work ethic tends to be viewed with just short of scorn by the world's other wealthy economies. As Europeans like the Ditlevs happily continue to trade income for a slice of leisure time that would be unthinkable in the United States or Asia, the gloomy headlines about Europe's economic future multiply. 
 Europe, the standard criticism goes, has not matched the American expansion for most of the last decade and has even fallen behind Japan in recent quarters. Its citizens are on average almost 30 percent poorer than their counterparts on the other side of the Atlantic, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 30 countries committed to democracy and the market economy. Potential growth in the next decade risks being stuck at 2 percent -- one percentage point below that of the United States.
 Is Europe, with the shortest workweeks and longest holidays in the world, doomed to lag behind, a victim of its penchant for more leisure and a too generous welfare state?
 One response: If the answer is yes, then so what?
 Some economists and European officials argue that, rather than reflecting a failure to catch up with its more industrious competitors because of faltering productivity growth, Europe's more modest income level mainly reflects policy choices that have tended to put a premium on leisure and equality at the expense of greater wealth. 
 Over the last half century, Western Europeans have gradually opted to work less and take longer vacations. They have put in place varying national versions of public universal health care, education and retirement benefits. They have set up a complex web of minimum income legislation, including unemployment subsidies and disability benefits, and basic social welfare, in an effort to limit the risk of destitution.
 ''The welfare state is an efficiency device against market failure,'' said Nicholas Barr, a professor of public economics at the London School of Economics. ''It's a perfectly rational policy to accept lower output for higher welfare.''
 Or as Joaquin Almunia, European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, put it, for Europeans, economic growth is a tool, not an end in itself. 
 ''We are not in a race with the U.S.,'' he said. ''Our goal is not to grow as fast as the U.S. or anybody else, but to do what we need to protect our economic and social model.''
 Plenty must be done to keep the system financed and the moral principles underlying it alive, Mr. Almunia said. The European Union faces challenges, including a stagnant, aging population, chronic underemployment and competitive pressures from the eight new Eastern European members and Asian growth markets like China and India. It has already missed many of the targets it set in its bid to become the most competitive economy in the world by 2010, as promised at a leaders' meeting in Lisbon four years ago. 
 As the German telecommunications giant Siemens showed by extending a union's work week to 40 hours from 35 with no extra pay, pressure is mounting to wring more work from Europeans, who put in an average of 10 percent fewer hours than Americans.
 But for all the bad publicity the European economy receives, it is not performing that poorly. The combined gross domestic product of the 15 members of the European Union before the expansion on May 1 lagged behind that of the United States by about one percentage point a year in the last decade, largely because the region's population expanded at less than half the pace of United States'. The average income per person grew about 1.8 percent a year on both sides of the Atlantic, said to Kevin Daly, an economist at Goldman Sachs in London.
 Contrary to conventional wisdom, Western European productivity growth outpaced that of the United States in the last 30 years: gross domestic product per hour in the European Union is less than 10 percent below G.D.P. in America today; in 1970 the gap was closer to 35 percent, said the European Union's Ameco database. In some countries, including France, productivity now exceeds that in the United States. 
 But if Europeans are still poorer than Americans, it is because fewer of them hold a job, and those who do have gradually reduced the time they spend at work. Americans have been much more hesitant to work fewer hours, keeping the tally virtually unchanged over the last 10 years despite strong growth. 
 ''You have to ask yourself who really is the odd one out,'' Mr. Daly said. ''Leisure is a normal good, and as you become richer, economic theory says that you consume more of it.''
 Polls show that Europeans are by and large happy to pay high taxes in return for social services, and anecdotal evidence suggests that the concept of well being in Europe is less linked to material wealth than it is in the United States.
 ''Americans move from the 20,000 -square-feet house to the 30,000-square-feet house to the 40,000-square-feet house. It's a different mentality,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, an economist at Harvard University and former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund. 
 Enjoying coffee at a brasserie in Paris, Thomas Levassor, 28, said he worked in Silicon Valley as a software engineer for three years, but returned to France to have a family. 
 ''There is a window of maybe five years where the American lifestyle is great -- when you're young and healthy and ambitious and single,'' he said. ''After that, other things become more important, like culture and family, and then you're much better off in France.''
 Giuseppe Roma, who conducts society studies at Censis in Rome, says European shoppers are increasingly rejecting status-quo purchases to buy quality-of-life products. 
 The new attitude, he says is: ''I care about the real quality of life. I may not buy Prada, but I will buy organic olive oil.''
 Still, some economists say Europe's social model is costing it dearly. In a society that prides itself on egalitarian values, too many people are unemployed or outside the labor market, doubly raiding public coffers by not paying taxes and often receiving benefits at the same time. The jobless rate in the European Union's 15 old members rose to 7.8 percent last year, compared with 6.1 percent in the United States, said the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
 With a growing number of retirees, joblessness is increasingly straining the continent's state-financed pension and health systems: the combined burden is forecast to rise to as much as 8 percent of gross domestic product in most European Union member nations, the European Commission estimates.
 Martin N. Baily, who led the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton, says the important thing for European policy makers is to replace the concept of job security with that of employment security.
 High minimum wages coupled with high payroll taxes and strict job protection laws have priced low-skilled workers out of the labor market in Europe's core economies, notably Germany and France, he said. Lowering both and paying low-wage earners a subsidy would achieve comparable income levels and make it cheaper for companies to hire.
 Instead of an American-style anything-goes labor market, he said, Europe has its own success stories to learn from. Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands have all increased employment beyond even American levels by conditioning generous jobless benefits on tangible efforts to look for work. 
 ''The notion of social cohesion has tended to protect existing workers to the detriment of those out of a job,'' said Mr. Baily, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''But that doesn't mean that you have to dismantle the welfare state. There are European solutions for European problems.''
 A generous welfare state does not only have costs. Europe has less child poverty, a lower incidence of illiteracy and a smaller prison population than the United States, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development statistics show. Europeans have a slightly higher life expectancy and can hope to spend more of their old age in good health than Americans.
 According to surveys by the World Database of Happiness, which is run by Prof. Ruut Veenhoven at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, residents in many European nations are more satisfied with their lives than Americans and residents in more hard-working nations, like Japan, where people have been clocking even more hours than in the United States. More significantly, measures of happiness in the America and Japan has been flat over the last 30 years, while they have been rising in most Western European countries.
 ''The main difference with the U.S. is that we spend more time enjoying life,'' said Jorgen Ronnest, director for international affairs at the Danish Employers' Confederation, which represents about 30,000 companies. ''And if you look around, maybe we don't need more refrigerators and more cars.''

HEADLINE: Annuity Sales Help MetLife Increase Profit 45% in Period

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
MetLife Inc., the big life insurer, said yesterday that its second-quarter profit rose 45 percent as sales of annuities and other policies increased and it sold the Sears Tower in Chicago.
 Net income climbed to $842 million, or $1.11 a share, from $580 million, or 79 cents a share, a year earlier. Profit excluding realized investment gains was 88 cents a share, compared with the 77 cent estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. 
 Total revenue rose 9.3 percent, to $9.69 billion, in the quarter, helped by a 7 percent increase in premiums and fees to $6.1 billion. Fees from annuities surged 64 percent.
 MetLife has cut expenses and introduced products like variable annuities with minimum income guarantees to increase profit. 
 The company expects to earn more from its investment portfolio as United States interest rates rise, even as the higher rates erode the value of its bonds.
 ''Things are clicking well at the company right now,'' William Wheeler, the chief financial officer, said at an investor conference last month.
 MetLife may revise its second-quarter earnings figures before it files a quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange Commission because of a tax audit under way for 1997 to 1999 accounts, the company said. 
 The Internal Revenue Service audit will likely increase earnings, it said. 
 A spokesman, John Calagna, declined to comment on how big that increase might be.
 The sale of the Sears Tower produced an $85 million gain. In total, the company had $174 million of realized investment gains in the quarter, compared with $40 million of losses in the quarter a year earlier. 
 Second-quarter profit last year included $126 million of gains from accounting changes in Mexico and a legal settlement in the United States.
 MetLife increased this year's profit forecast to a range of $3.22 to $3.30 a share excluding realized investment gains, from a previous estimate of $3.08 to $3.18 a share.
 Shares of MetLife closed up 8 cents yesterday, at $34.30, before the company announced its results.

HEADLINE: Mormon Renewal Creates a Stir in an Illinois Town

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER

DATELINE: NAUVOO, Ill. 

 BODY:
High upon a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River stands a soaring Mormon temple, the biggest building for many miles around. Closed to non-Mormons, it symbolizes the tension that has reshaped life in what was until recently a typical Midwestern town.
 The Mormons opened their rebuilt temple here two years ago, and since then more than half a million people, many from Utah, have come to see it. About 300 Mormons have moved here, bringing the population to 1,100. 
 ''There's no religious animosity, but these people have created a big stir,'' said Bob Soland, a city councilman.
 Mormons have brought a good deal of money to Nauvoo, something that many other towns along the Mississippi River might envy. Places like Warsaw, 17 miles north, and Fort Madison, Iowa, on the other side of the river, have few apparent prospects and seem to be shriveling away.
 In Nauvoo, though, Mormons have restored two dozen historic buildings to give visitors a sense what life may have been like here in the 1840's. Cars, many with Utah license plates, creep in and out of a new 200-car garage. There are seven restaurants, all open year-round.
 A temple like the one recently restored stood on the same bluff in the 1840's, when Nauvoo was the center of the Mormon world. It was destroyed during a bloody conflict between Mormons and their enemies in which the religion's founder, Joseph Smith, was killed. Soon afterward, the Mormons set out on their epic trek to Utah, where they prospered and built what has become one of the world's fastest-growing religions.
 Smith founded the Mormon faith in upstate New York, where he claimed to have been guided by an angel to a spot where he discovered gold plates on which ancient prophets had written a series of divine revelations. He led a small band of followers to Nauvoo, and within a few years the group swelled to 10,000, ranking this town, with Chicago, as the two biggest in Illinois. Mormons established their own legal code and raised a militia with about 3,000 men. Smith gained considerable political power and announced plans to run for president.
 ''Nauvoo is the beginning of a lot of things,'' said Samuel Park, president of the Illinois Nauvoo Mission, which oversees the church's operations here. ''It's a sacred place to us, a place of sacrifice. We're coming back here, and we want to stay.''
 Mr. Park said he recognized that some longtime residents were unhappy with the increased traffic, skyrocketing real estate prices and other changes Mormons have brought to Nauvoo. ''There's a certain fear that our presence here is a tad too dominant,'' Mr. Park said. ''But we're a peaceful group. We obey rules. Maybe the good example is irritating.''
 Al Stevenson, a retired farmer, stood outside Grandpa John's cafe on a recent afternoon, chewing on a toothpick and grousing about the newcomers. He had a few unprintable comments about the Illinois state legislature, which recently passed a resolution apologizing to Mormons for the way they were treated here in the 19th century, and then spoke about his new neighbors.
 ''I just don't like pushy people,'' Mr. Stevenson said. ''If they had come in here and sat down with us and asked our advice and tried to understand who we are and how we've been living all these years, that would have been fine. But they don't show any respect for us. The only way to get along with them is to do what they want.''
 Mr. Stevenson said he and his friends were angry that Mormons had paid a six-figure price for a home across the street from the temple and then destroyed it so there would be more open space around their building. He said some people here had joked about buying another home near the temple and opening a bar or strip club, presuming that the church would then pay them a huge sum to buy and close it.
 Mayor Thomas J. Wilson said he had decided to step down in April after 12 years in office, partly because he disapproves of the ways Nauvoo is changing. Mr. Wilson predicted that the day would come when Nauvoo would have a Mormon mayor and a Mormon-dominated City Council.
 ''It's going to happen over time,'' he said. ''They're here, and every day they grow a little. It's a reality.''
 As the two men spoke, a well-scrubbed young woman named Rebecca Bingham emerged from the cafe. She said she was one of 128 recent high school graduates from Utah who had come here on a bus tour to explore their Mormon roots.
 ''We all know about Nauvoo,'' Ms. Bingham told the bemused locals. ''It's a big place, big in our hearts.''
 Many of the businesses along Nauvoo's main street cater to Mormons, including one that sells T-shirts proclaiming, ''Modest Girls are the Hottest Girls.'' But at the Nauvoo Christian Visitors Center, Colleen Ralson, a former Mormon, spends her days telling everyone who drops in that the Mormon faith is based on lies.
 ''If they're following Joseph Smith, they're not following the God of the Bible,'' Ms. Ralson said.
 Mormons, whose church is officially called the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, use Christian iconography and say that they follow the biblical God, but with additional revelations not included in the Bible.
 Economic, political and social tensions have grown as Mormons have poured into Nauvoo. A developer wants to build a 70-unit residential complex on the edge of town, and the unspoken assumption is that Mormons would buy most of them. The City Council has blocked the project, citing concerns about its size.
 ''Real estate sales are five times bigger than before they came in with the temple,'' said Wayne S. Marting, the town's only real estate agent. ''If in a normal year you used to sell six or seven properties, now it's 25 properties. And if you sell 25, then 21 or 22 of those sales would be to Mormons.''
 Rustin Lipincott, director of the Nauvoo tourism office, said he spent much of his time ''trying to find that happy balance between local folks and Mormon folks.''
 ''This is an exciting time for Nauvoo, especially for people in business,'' Mr. Lipincott said, ''but I can also see the hesitation of longtime residents.''


CORRECTION-DATE: August 4, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about tensions in the town of Nauvoo, Ill., as more Mormons move there referred incorrectly to Wayne S. Marting, who said real estate sales had risen since a Mormon temple was restored. He is an agent for one of the town's three real estate agencies, not the town's only agent.

HEADLINE: Egyptians Question Powell on Mideast Reform

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Abeer Allam contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: CAIRO, Thursday, July 29 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, in an unusual meeting on Wednesday with a small group of Egyptian civic group leaders and other activists, was told that American backing for political reform in the region would only truly gain momentum if Washington pushed for a fair settlement to the Israeli-Arab dispute.
 Mr. Powell, who left Egypt for Saudi Arabia on Wednesday and was expected to continue on to Kuwait on Thursday, is visiting the region for talks on a broad range of issues, including the proposed Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the stability of Iraq, fighting terrorism, and possible sanctions against Sudan, as well as political change in the Arab world.
 There are widespread doubts in the region that the Bush administration is serious about pushing political change. Many in the Arab world view the effort as a bargaining tactic to pressure longtime Arab allies into unpopular decisions, like pushing the Palestinians to come to unfavorable terms with Israel and supporting changes in Iraq. 
 Part of the problem was evident in the meeting with Mr. Powell, participants said, in that he did not appear to have much to offer beyond verbal support for civic groups.
 ''Although America is talking about reform and democracy in the Middle East, it still lacks a comprehensive vision regarding the issue,'' said Hala Mustafa, editor in chief of the quarterly Democracy Review and one of the participants at the meeting, held in the restaurant of a luxury hotel. ''That is why sometimes we find one item on the top, civil society, another day technology, then human rights.''
 Participants in the meeting, billed by the Egyptian news media as the first of its kind, and generally welcomed by civic groups here as a sign of support, stressed to Mr. Powell that the United States lacks credibility because it is seen as fundamentally biased against Arabs.
 ''If the Americans want to be more effective in the process of reform, they must make a greater effort to solve the Arab-Israeli conflict,'' said Osama el-Ghazaly Harb, a noted Egyptian political analyst who also took part in the meeting. ''This will make the environment easier for reform. The American image is poisoned by the Arab-Israeli conflict.''
 Asked about the issue at a joint news conference with Mr. Powell, the Egyptian foreign minister, Ahmed Abul Gheit, said the recently appointed Egyptian cabinet is eager to pursue reform.
 ''Egypt has been developing over the last 200 years, we are embracing modernity, we are working on our plans to generate resources in our society, to develop economically and socially,'' he said. ''The new government is determined to pursue that objective. If you call it reform, I call it energetic development.''
 In Saudi Arabia, the subject was also raised at a news conference the secretary held later with Prince Saud al-Faisal, the foreign minister. Mr. Powell said the two sides had discussed various reform measures, including municipal elections scheduled for the fall, but that the United States accepted the idea that each nation must change according to its own traditions. 
 As for the Saudi side, ''the whole country is working on this issue,'' the prince said. 
 In Cairo, on the main regional issues, there were differences of emphasis between the United States and Egypt. 
 On Iraq, Mr. Powell said the United States was continuing to lobby for Arab and Muslim countries to send troops to help protect United Nations workers who are expected to begin working in Iraq soon to organize elections to be held in January 2005.
 Egyptian officials said Cairo was not contemplating sending troops and questioned an apparent attempt to build a force from Islamic or Arab countries.
 Contributing troops to any such force would likely be wildly unpopular in any Arab country, as the public would view it as propping up what is still considered an American occupation.
 In Jidda, Prince Saud said the two sides had also discussed dispatching a Muslim force to Iraq. It would presumably not include any Saudi troops, given that the Iraqis have repeatedly stated that they do not want any troops from any neighboring states.
 On the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, Mr. Powell expressed somewhat less patience than his Arab counterparts with the attempts by the Palestinian Authority under Yasir Arafat to bring calm to Gaza in advance of any potential withdrawal.
 Mr. Arafat pledged on Tuesday to give the prime minister, Ahmed Qurei, greater powers to consolidate the security forces and gain political control, long an American demand.
 ''We hope that this is in fact what has happened and that the prime minister of the Palestinian Authority will have the necessary influence,'' Mr. Powell said in Cairo.

HEADLINE: After Layoff, a Start-Up

BYLINE: By NEIL A. MARTIN

 BODY:
Soon after David Riedel lost his job two years ago as an equity analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in a wave of layoffs on Wall Street, his entrepreneurial juices kicked in.
 He knew that more investors, in the wake of a research scandal, were looking for advice at small, independent research firms with no conflicts of interest that could taint their reports. He knew that he had valuable expertise about a part of the world that American securities firms generally did a poor job of covering. And he knew that the Internet could deliver tools that would have been unimaginable a few years earlier.
 All he needed to translate that knowledge into a money-making opportunity was a tolerance for risk. So, with $200,000 in capital, he started the Riedel Research Group in May 2003 in his seventh-floor loft apartment in Manhattan's TriBeCa neighborhood. 
 A little more than a year later, he has signed up six clients to pay $60,000 a year for research about companies in Southeast Asia, written by analysts he recruited there. He says he is confident he will reach his goal of 30 subscribers within a year. He also says that, given the generally lower compensation costs in Asia and the free tools offered by the Internet, his revenues already cover his overhead costs.
 Mr. Riedel's swift transition from Wall Street reject to successful business owner illustrates the power of the Internet to propel people with specialized expertise into global entrepreneurs. 
 ''It is a testament to this new age of Internet-based commerce,'' he said, ''that someone like myself, with knowledge and experience but limited capital, is able to use technology to run and manage a global business efficiently and with relatively low costs.'' 
 At Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup, Mr. Riedel, 37, covered small companies and was not caught up in the storm over tainted research, but he nevertheless found himself among the legions of analysts who found themselves out of work when the dust cleared in early 2003.
 Even before he left Salomon, he had been toying with the idea of starting a research firm to specialize in Asian companies, keeping his eye on niche outfits like the Avalon Research Group in Boca Raton, Fla., the Garp Research Corporation in Towson, Md., and Farmhouse Equity Research in Portsmouth, R.I., which did research on a small number of American, European and Japanese stocks and which -- with doubts growing about the veracity of research by the Wall Street giants -- were gaining converts.
 But, except for Japan, the independent firms mostly ignored Asia. And Asia was Mr. Riedel's specialty. He had studied Chinese and Asian affairs at the University of California, Berkeley, and had earned an M.B.A. at the Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, where he joined the local office of a British broker, Smith Newcourt, in 1992. Fluent in Thai and Chinese, he moved two years later to Salomon Brothers, before its 1997 merger with Smith Barney, as an analyst covering the telecommunications industry in Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries. 
 In 1998, he was transferred to New York, where he followed small company stocks until his layoff in December 2002.
 At that point, he took a hard look at Asia and saw an opportunity that was tailor made for him.
 ''There were some small research firms around region specializing in China or Hong Kong or Singapore, but mostly providing macro-economic analysis,'' Mr. Riedel said. ''No one was really following individual companies, except the Asia-based brokers. And if you think Wall Street has conflicts of interest and relationship problems affecting its research, then you'd be shocked at what passes for 'unbiased' equity analysis in Asia.''
 The Internet was crucial to starting his company. A Buenos Aires company, the NetMen Corporation, created his logo, business cards, letterhead and a static Web page for the soon-to-be-announced company in six weeks, for $550. AmbitionWeb in Houston designed his Web site, www.riedelresearch.com, for $1,110. Eire Web Design in Dublin developed Microsoft Word document templates for analysts to use in writing their reports for $350.
 Mr. Riedel then turned to Hong Kong-based JobsDB, Asia's largest interactive recruitment network, which covers Australia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore, to help him find the talent he needed. He knew there was an abundance of smart analysts. Even so, he was taken aback by the response he received.
 ''I put a help-wanted listing for three markets -- Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia -- and received 300 responses, 120 of which were very well qualified for the job,'' Mr. Riedel said. In early September, he hired four analysts in Thailand, two in Indonesia and one in Malaysia. By Sept. 15, his site was up and running with coverage of three of his four target countries.
 One of his analysts in Indonesia worked for BNP Paribas, studied at Columbia Business School and worked for a hedge fund in New York before returning to Jakarta, where Riedel hired him. Another analyst worked for Merrill Lynch in Thailand before the American broker shut down its Thai operations two years ago and worked for the local office of SBC Securities before joining Mr. Riedel's group. 
 An eighth analyst has been hired to cover China, and Mr. Riedel says he intends to increase his staff to 16 within a year, with 4 analysts in each of his four core markets. He says clients so far include a San Francisco hedge fund, an emerging-markets stock fund in New York and a London investment fund that specializes in Asia. 
 ''There are hundreds of fund managers with an interest in Asia,'' Mr. Riedel said. ''I am initially targeting those based in Europe or the U.S.'' He says his firm benefits from the cultural divide between the United States, which values straight talk, and much of Asia, which frowns on direct criticism. ''By having an independent view,'' he said, ''we have the advantage of being able to say we think the market is wrong or missing the point or neglecting an opportunity or overstating the prospects for a stock.''
 That is what attracted the head of the New York emerging-markets fund to Mr. Riedel's research. ''He is the only one around I have found providing independent research on individual companies in Southeast Asia,'' said the money manager, who requested anonymity. He said he liked the way that Mr. Riedel ''is not shy about telling you when to hold or sell a stock.'' 
 He cited recent contrarian calls by the firm's researchers on two Thai companies: CPF, a Thai agri-business concern that had been hit hard by the avian flu virus at the start of this year and whose stock had been pounded as a result, and Grammy, a Thai media and entertainment company that, despite its popularity with investors, was under increasing competitive pressures.
 Mr. Riedel's analysts rated CPF a buy because they saw data and developments that indicated the stock was poised for recovery, while they issued a sell advisory on Grammy, which they believed faced increasing problems. The New York money manager, who bought CPF, says that it has so far outperformed a declining market by 2 percent and that Grammy has fallen by 13 percent. ''One good call can be worth the price of the service,'' he said.
 Some potential clients who have reviewed Mr. Riedel's research are not necessarily buying it, however. John Chisholm, who co-manages the $440 million Acadian Emerging Markets mutual fund in Boston, which invests primarily in Asia, says he probably will not -- at least not yet. 
 ''Coverage in the four markets looks good, and the reports are relatively clear and well explained,'' Mr. Chisholm said. However, he said, some of the reports had not been updated in six months and ''many of the companies are lacking earnings and cash flow models.''
 Mr. Riedel says he is confident he can reach his goal -- and, he says, his limit of 30 -- for his the Web-based service by next summer. Growing interest of institutional investors in Asian, and particularly Chinese, companies is driving demand, he says.
 ''Asia is back on the radar screens of most global investors looking for alternatives to Wall Street,'' he says. ''But they want to see what is happening clearly and honestly without any hype or conflicts. That's our market.''

HEADLINE: Ask not what you can do for marriage; ask what marriage can do for your bottom line.

BYLINE: By Hal R. Varian. 
Hal R. Varian is a professor of business, economics and information management at the University of California, Berkeley.

 BODY:
MARRIED men make more money than single men. A lot more: labor economists estimate that even when you control for age, education and other demographic effects, the ''marriage wage premium'' is 10 percent to 50 percent.
 The question is why.
 There are two broad classes of explanation. One view holds that marriage causes men to receive higher wages. The other view is that higher wages are simply correlated with, but not caused by, marital status. 
 There are a variety of reasons that marriage might cause higher wages.
 It might be that employers prefer married men to single men because they are more productive. After all, they have spouses who share responsibility for household chores and provide other sorts of support and assistance. Single men just have that empty apartment.
 On the other hand, it could be that employers have an irrational prejudice for married men. Employers might view them as more productive, more reliable and more committed, whether or not these things are true.
 Whether employer preference for married men is accurate is irrelevant. Marriage has a causal effect: single men who choose to marry will tend to receive higher wages.
 The other class of theories holds that being married is simply correlated with higher wages. Just as with the causal theories, the correlation can work through productivity effects or through prejudice.
 Perhaps women are attracted to stable, hardworking men. Employers also find such men attractive, so they want to hire and promote them. If true, we would see married men having higher wages. But it isn't that marriage caused those higher wages -- rather, the same things that caused marriage caused the higher wages.
 Such a correlation could also arise from irrelevant characteristics. Maybe women prefer good-looking guys, and employers also like handsome men, even when appearance has nothing to do with job productivity.
 In this case we would also observe that the same men who are more likely to be married are also more likely to be employed and have higher wages.
 In the correlation explanations of the marriage premium, the same factors that caused the men to marry caused them to get higher wages -- but there is no direct causal link between marriage and high wages.
 To drive this point home, suppose Hamlet is considering proposing to Ophelia, but is consumed with doubts. ''To be married or not to be married, that is the question.''
 If the causal theories are correct, then if Hamlet proposes and Ophelia accepts, his future wages would be higher on average than if he stayed single. If the correlation theories are correct, then choosing to marry would have no effect on Hamlet's future wages, and he may as well remain single.
 Recently two economists, Kate Antonovics and Robert Town of the University of California, San Diego and the University of Minnesota, respectively, have come up with a clever way to decide between the causal and the correlation theories. Their paper, ''Are all the good men married? Uncovering the sources of the marital wage premium,'' was published in the May 2004 issue of The American Economic Review.
 Their approach is based on looking at monozygotic, or identical, twins. The authors argue that twins have the same genetic endowment and (usually) the same upbringing. Since twins have the same underlying physical and mental capabilities, they should have similar productivity. Even if employers are biased toward certain irrelevant characteristics, monozygotic twins should be affected by such biases equally.
 Hence differences in wages between married and unmarried twins should control for most of the effects that might cause a spurious marriage-wage correlation. If a married twin has a higher wage than his single brother, the difference is probably caused by marriage, not just correlated with it.
 The economists drew on a unique dataset, the Minnesota Twins Registry, which tracked most twins born in Minnesota between 1936 and 1955. In the mid-1990's, the Registry sent the twins a questionnaire asking about their socioeconomic status.
 Using this data, the researchers were able to construct a sample of 136 pairs of monozygotic twins, of whom 85 percent were married. In 23 percent of the cases, one twin was married, the other wasn't.
 They extracted data from the survey on the hourly wages, weeks worked a year, age and educational attainment of the men in their sample and compared these with figures for all American males. The results implied that their sample was reasonably representative of the nation's population.
 Consistent with other studies, they found a significant marriage premium: controlling for education, age and other variables, the married men in their sample earned about 19 percent more than unmarried men.
 They then examined just the wage differences between twins, while still controlling for education. They found that married twins had 26 percent higher wages than their unmarried siblings. Hence, even among very similar men, those who are married earn substantially more.
 The authors found essentially the same results if they factored in divorced or widowed status, or added variables like a spouse's work experience, number of children and wage history.
 This result suggests that marriage really does have a causal impact on wages. Of course, it is not conclusive. After all, maybe the married twin really is different in some way from his brother, and that difference is important to both potential spouses and employers. Still, it is suggestive evidence.
 So, here's the advice Hamlet would get from an economist: put your doubts aside and marry Ophelia. Stop moping around and go get a job. You may not be any happier, but at least you'll make more money.

HEADLINE: Late-Day Buying Sends Both the Dow and S.& P. Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Late-day buying rescued Wall Street from a losing session yesterday, as stocks overcame record-high oil prices and disappointing economic news that had kept the major indexes negative for most of the day. Blue-chip stocks closed higher, but technology stocks lagged.
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 31.93 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 10,117.07, recovering from a low of 9,994.22. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 0.59 point, to 1,095.42. The Nasdaq composite index fell 10.84 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,858.26, largely on weakness among semiconductor makers. 
 Advances in the final hour came after oil futures topped $43 a barrel, a 21-year high, raising inflation worries among investors already nervous about slower growth in the second half of the year. Some analysts doubted the strength of the rally, however, attributing it to bargain hunting after four weeks of selling and programmed trading, which occurs when large investment houses automatically purchase shares because they have reached a preset buying point.
 ''The valuations on the Standard & Poor's 500 are at a level we haven't seen since 1995, which is pretty impressive if you're out there shopping for stocks,'' said Thomas F. Lydon Jr., president of Global Trends Investments in Newport Beach, Calif. ''However, the average investor doesn't have the confidence to do real buying in this market.''
 September crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed up $1.06 at $42.90 a barrel, as the Russian oil giant Yukos warned that it might have to shut down production pending the enforcement of a Moscow judge's order, raising concerns about global and domestic supply. Oil prices were lower in after-hours trading.
 While the oil situation did not help the market, analysts said the day's mostly downward trend -- which came after a sharply positive session Tuesday -- simply extended a month-old pattern, in which poor performance in the technology sector led the rest of the market lower. Much of the anxiety has been focused on semiconductors. Because chips are used in virtually all technology products, any weakness in that industry is seen as bad news for the rest of the sector. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index closed down 0.9 percent, recovering from the day's low.
 Among the advancers, Boeing gained 79 cents, to $49.01, after reporting better-than-expected profits and raising its forecasts for the rest of the year and next year. The company said that it expected to deliver more jets than previously forecast in 2005.
 Time Warner lost 26 cents, to $16.65, even after reporting profits that were ahead of expectations, and an increase in revenue because of the latest Harry Potter movie and its cable services and networks. The media conglomerate, which operates CNN, Warner Brothers and HBO, lost more customers from its troubled America Online division, but advertising buoyed revenue and profits there as well.
 Shares of the cable operator Comcast fell $1.18, to $27.56. Although the company's profits beat analyst estimates by 2 cents a share, it disappointed investors by scaling back an earlier forecast that it would add 10,000 subscribers this year.
 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a wide margin for most of the day, but had only a slight edge on the New York Stock Exchange by the end of the session. Volume was 1.54 billion shares, compared with 1.6 billion traded on Tuesday.

Treasury Prices Gain
By Bloomberg News
 The price of Treasury notes advanced yesterday as a surge in oil prices and a smaller-than-forecast increase in durable-goods orders heightened speculation that economic growth will slow.
 Higher oil prices ''are considered a depressant for the economy -- it helped provide a bottom in Treasuries,'' said Michael McGlone, interest-rate futures analyst at ABN Amro. 
 Treasury prices rebounded as the persistent climb in oil prices called into question the ability of the economy to gain momentum, even after Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, last week said that he expected any slowdown in growth to be temporary.
 The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 8/32, to 10110/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 4.58 percent, from 4.61 on Tuesday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of two-year notes:

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Says Americans' Income Shrank for 2 Consecutive Years

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
The overall income Americans reported to the government shrank for two consecutive years after the Internet stock market bubble burst in 2000, the first time that has effectively happened since the modern tax system was introduced during World War II, newly disclosed information from the Internal Revenue Service shows. 
 The total adjusted gross income on tax returns fell 5.1 percent, to just over $6 trillion in 2002, the most recent year for which data is available, from $6.35 trillion in 2000. Because of population growth, average incomes declined even more, by 5.7 percent.
 Adjusted for inflation, the income of all Americans fell 9.2 percent from 2000 to 2002, according to the new I.R.S. data. 
 While the recession that hit the economy in 2001 in the wake of the market plunge was considered relatively mild, the new information shows that its effect on Americans' incomes, particularly those at the upper end of the spectrum, was much more severe. Earlier government economic statistics provided general evidence that incomes suffered in the first years of the decade, but the full impact of the blow and what groups it fell hardest on were not known until the I.R.S. made available on its Web site the detailed information from tax returns. 
 The unprecedented back-to-back declines in reported incomes was caused primarily by the combination of the big fall in the stock market and the erosion of jobs and wages in well-paying industries in the early years of the decade.
 In the past, overall personal income rose from one year to the next with relentless monotony, the growth rate changing in response to fluctuations in economic activity but almost never falling.
 But now, with many more ordinary employees joining high-level executives in having part of their compensation dependent on stock options and bonus plans, a volatile and relatively unpredictable new element has been introduced to the incomes of millions of workers.
 ''Risks used to be confined largely to executives and business owners with large incomes,'' said Edward N. Wolff, an economist at New York University who studies wealth and income.
 ''But now for many people with more modest incomes their earnings are more volatile,'' Mr. Wolff added, leaving them more vulnerable to losing pay they count on to meet regular expenses like mortgage payments, car loans and day-to-day living costs. 
 The new data also helps explain why personal income taxes, the government's most important source of revenue, are subject to much greater fluctuations than in the past. It may help analysts do a better job in predicting changes in government receipts and provide businesses with clues to help anticipate bigger ups-and-downs in spending for their goods and services.
 Before the recent drop, the last time reported incomes fell for even one year was in 1953. The only other time since World War II that the I.R.S. reported an interruption in income gains was from 1947 to 1949, but that was because of changes in the tax law at the time that affected how income was reported rather than an actual fall.
 From 2000 to 2002, individual income taxes fell 18.8 percent, more than three times the decline in adjusted gross incomes, the I.R.S.'s latest statistical reports show. (Adjusted gross income is the broadest category of income taxpayers report to the government, excluding only a small portion of income in other forms, notably interest on tax-free bonds.)
 To some extent, taxes fell more than incomes because of tax cuts championed by President Bush and approved by Congress in 2001. But in that year and in 2002 the cuts applied primarily to those making less than $100,000, especially families with children, and to capital gains from the sales of appreciated assets like stock.
 The major tax rate reductions for highly paid Americans did not take effect until 2003, when -- it is clear from spending patterns, general income data and the performance of the stock market -- more affluent taxpayers regained some of the losses they experienced in the earlier years of the decade. 
 Falling incomes, rather than tax cuts, appear to count for the greatest share of the decline in income taxes paid. That is because the higher one stood on the income ladder the greater the impact was likely to be from the stock market crunch.
 At the same time many of those whose incomes fell the most -- those reporting $200,000 to $10 million in income -- paid at the highest rates, which meant that the drain on revenues was even greater when their incomes shrank.
 More than 352,000 taxpayers, one of every eight who had worked their way above $200,000 of income in 2000, fell below that figure in 2002. 
 At the very top the ranks thinned by more than half. The number of taxpayers reporting adjusted gross income of $10 million or more fell to 5,280 from 11,215. 
 The combined income of this rich and thin slice of Americans plummeted 63 percent, to $110 billion, in 2002 from $300 billion in 2000. Among those who stayed in this category average annual income fell 22 percent, to $20.9 million from almost $26.8 million in 2000.
 Capital gains income, which results from selling stock market shares and other assets at a profit, fell over the two years by more than 29 percent, to $246.8 billion from $349.5 billion. So many companies reduced or halted dividends after 2000 that by 2002 dividend income had fallen 17.4 percent, to $98.8 billion. 
 The stock market decline also affected the incomes of those between $1 and $5,000, which includes large numbers of children in affluent families with investments for college costs. Incomes for that group fell 7.8 percent over the two years, to $33.3 billion, as dividends fell and those who had to sell equities in the depressed market to pay tuition reaped smaller gains in 2002.
 Two factors appear to be at work in the decline in capital gains income, which is highly concentrated among the wealthy. 
 The primary factor was the Wall Street debacle, especially the collapse of many dot-coms and telecommunications companies, which eliminated trillions of dollars of paper wealth.
 The second was the creation of a large reservoir of losing stocks, which can be sold to offset gains on winning stocks, reducing the amount of capital gains subject to tax for perhaps years to come. 
 While detailed analysis of how much losing stocks were used to offset income from winning stocks is not yet available from the I.R.S., the agency did report the number of taxpayers who said they had an overall loss in the value of assets they sold. Net capital losses more than doubled, to $29.9 billion from $13.6 billion, and the number of taxpayers with net losses grew 96 percent, to 13.3 million. 
 During the same two years the number of Americans reporting no income or that they actually lost money for tax purposes exploded, growing 48.5 percent, to 1.7 million in 2002. 
 These ''negative incomes'' come primarily from two groups: people closing out a failed business and full-time real estate investors, who are allowed to use paper losses like depreciation to offset their wage income.
 The huge increase in the number of people with reported losses is an indication of how many people were wiped out as the widening waves of losses from the dot-com era swamped many vendors, from small businesses to landlords. 
 Those who reported negative incomes in 2002 reported being $65.6 billion in the hole for that year, 12 percent worse than in 2000. 
 Pearl Meyer, a leading executive pay consultant in New York, said the stock market even took a toll on the pay to the chief executives of the 200 largest publicly traded companies.
 ''You can see the effect of the stock market's decline in pay actually taken home each year,'' she said. 
 For the 200 executives, stock option profits, which are taxed at the same rate as salaries, fell to an average of $3 million in 2002 from $5.3 million in 2001 and $7.4 million in 2000, Ms. Meyer said.
 Total pay for the top 200 chief executives, she calculated from reports to shareholders, plummeted to an average of $7.9 million in 2002 from $12.5 million in 2000.
 The collapse of the stock market boom, however, also affected many people well below that level. John A. Caldwell, chief investment strategist for the McDonald Financial Group in Cleveland, said that when ''you have a flat stock market over a two- or three-year time period people are less likely to exercise their options.''
 That is because most people, even if they have a meager gain on their options, delay exercising them in the hope that stock prices will rise before their options expire.

HEADLINE: Losing Energy and Investors

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: SANTA CRUZ, Bolivia 

 BODY:
A one-time cabbie and restaurant worker in Washington, Fernando Virreira returned to his native Bolivia in the 1970's and, with seven siblings, helped to build an oil and gas service company just as the energy industry in this booming eastern city was taking off. 
 The company, Serpetbol, short for Servicios Petroleros Bolivianos, grew rapidly -- from $200,000 in assets and 30 employees in the 1970's, to a $7 million outfit today. Depending on the scope and size of its contracts, Serpetbol can easily employ 1,000 workers to build roads and platforms for companies like Petrobras of Brazil, Total of France and other multinationals that have made Bolivia a potential force in natural gas production.
 But now, after two years of protests by Bolivia's indigenous groups that drove one president from office and forced another to hold a referendum asking Bolivians what to do with their gas, the industry has hit a wall of uncertainty. Companies are holding back on investments, and Serpetbol's permanent and part-time work force has dropped to 400, from 1,200 in early 2003. 
 ''Investment has been practically zero this year,'' said Mr. Virreira, 58, who joined the company in 1975 overseeing construction projects and is now its chief executive. ''We're very worried because we are totally Bolivian,'' he said. ''We have no foreign capital. We have nowhere else to go.''
 The turmoil in this isolated, landlocked country in the center of South America has been quickly snuffing a nascent gas industry that seven years ago appeared to have no limits.
 The protests have already sunk one project that, at its inception, was being called the largest energy infrastructure development in Latin America: a plan by Repsol-YPF of Spain and British Gas to build a $5 billion pipeline to Chile's coast, and a gas-to-liquids plant so the gas could be exported to Mexico and California. But angry that the plan would have benefited Chile, a historic enemy that snatched Bolivia's coastline in a war 121 years ago, protesters rose up against President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, forcing his resignation in October after protests killed about 60 people.
 Other projects, meanwhile, have shriveled. Investment in the oil and gas industry has fallen from $680 million in 1998 to $160 million last year and is expected to be lower still this year, said Carlos Alberto Lopez, a former vice minister of energy and now a lobbyist for foreign energy companies.
 ''There's total uncertainty regarding the legal, regulatory, political and social framework,'' Mr. Lopez said. ''This is a sector that, having discovered the reserves, should be investing substantial amounts to develop the fields,'' he said. ''Instead, it is an industry preparing for the worst.''
 The current president, Carlos Mesa, has heralded the future in the days since his July 18 referendum, saying he has a framework for a gas policy that will benefit both Bolivians and investors.
 Though the five questions of the referendum passed, including a crucial one asking Bolivians if gas should be exported, energy companies here are not celebrating. The 1996 law that opened the gas sector to private companies will be repealed and new legislation will soon follow. And the new law, which still needs congressional approval, will raise taxes and royalties to as much as 50 percent, up from a scale ranging from 18 to 38 percent, and will give the government more say in how gas is sold.
 The centerpiece of Bolivia's new energy policy is an $800 million plan to revive Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos, or YPFB, a notoriously inefficient and corrupt government-run company that was largely privatized in the mid-1990's. Companies like Petrobras, Repsol-YPF, Perez Companc of Argentina and British Petroleum bought up YPFB's exploration and refining operations, leaving a sliver of a state company to simply administer contracts.
 The idea behind strengthening YPFB, said Jaime Barrenechea, the company's president, is that it will ''be looking out for the Bolivian state'' on energy matters, entering into refining projects with private companies and expanding household gas use to poor, highland districts that have been flashpoints of protest.
 ''With everything that happened last year, we are living a new reality,'' Mr. Barrenechea said in a telephone interview from La Paz. ''We want to have an energy company that is socially sustainable.''
 Those plans are unpalatable enough for oil companies. But what worries them more is that it remains unclear how the answers to the five referendum questions, all ambiguous, will be interpreted by lawmakers and radical indigenous leaders who have called for expropriation of private gas installations. 
 Mr. Mesa's task is to push through a law that does not scare off investors while mollifying indigenous leaders who worry that multinationals are plundering Bolivia's resources.
 ''The referendum has calmed the people,'' said Carlos Kempff, a former minister for economic development and now a businessman in Santa Cruz. ''The question is, 'What will the government do in this time of calm?'''
 The future was far rosier for energy companies in 1996, when Mr. Sanchez de Lozada, then in his first presidency, opened the industry to foreign investment as part of an aggressive plan to privatize government companies and put in place market openings prescribed by Washington.
 Companies flooded in, including such giants as Petrobras, the Brazilian oil company; Repsol-YPF; BP and BG of Britain; Total; and Royal Dutch/Shell.
 In all, about 20 foreign companies have invested $3.5 billion in exploration, with their discoveries raising the country's reserve estimates of gas from 5.5 trillion cubic feet in 1996 to 55 trillion cubic feet -- enough to last Bolivia up to 1,200 years if consumed domestically. Bolivia now has the second-largest gas deposits in Latin America, after Venezuela.
 ''It was an investment stage without precedent in the country,'' Mr. Lopez, the former vice minister for energy, said.
 The country's geographic position was seen as advantageous, with the gas fields of Tarija in the south perfectly positioned to serve Brazil, with its seemingly insatiable need for energy, as well as two other growing economies, Argentina and Chile.
 But a continentwide backlash against foreign investment that gathered momentum in the past four years has been strongest in Bolivia, with protesters halting projects like the privatization of Cochabamba's water system and assorted mining ventures.
 ''We were going to become the energy hub of the Southern Cone,'' said Ed Miller, the president of Gas TransBoliviano, who saw his dream of piping gas to Chile evaporate and now runs a pipeline that transports gas to Brazil. ''Nationalist, populist and emotional politics don't mix well with oil and gas.''
 Mr. Mesa, though, remains optimistic.
 Within days of the referendum, he and his Argentine counterpart, President Nestor Kirchner, had signed a preliminary deal in which Bolivia would increase its gas exports to that country.
 And Peruvian and Bolivian officials are to hold negotiations that Mr. Mesa hopes will lead to the construction of a pipeline through Peru to the Pacific, giving Bolivia coastal access for northbound gas exports.
 Political analysts, though, say the president will surely face opponents who are unlikely to back down from their calls for tight restrictions on foreign companies. Their argument -- one often heard in the highlands -- is that Bolivia holds the cards because of its gas riches. Countries are scrambling to buy Bolivia's gas, the thinking holds, so Bolivia should push foreign companies hard, even to the point of breaking agreements.
 But Bolivia is not the only country that has quickly developed its gas reserves. Others have come so far, in fact, that Bolivia lost one deal to pipe gas to Mexico and California when Sempra Energy, a California company that was to buy Bolivian gas for 20 years, pulled out and negotiated deals with companies in Indonesia.
 In Latin America, Venezuela has larger deposits and is close to reaching agreements with companies to develop its offshore fields, close to the United States. And countries like Iran, Qatar and Russia hold deposits far larger than Bolivia's. If Bolivia does not move now, say experts, it could lose out in the long run.
 ''If Bolivia were to stop producing hydrocarbons tomorrow, the only one who would be affected would be Bolivia,'' said Eduardo Gamarra, who was born in Bolivia and heads the Latin America studies program at Florida International University in Miami. ''These companies would pull out and they would sue Bolivia, and Bolivia would be in court 20 years.'' 
 No one would care, he said. ''It's not Venezuela.''
 Already, some of Bolivia's big potential customers are developing new sources of gas. Brazil, now Bolivia's largest client, recently discovered large gas deposits. It is also trying to negotiate with Bolivia to lower its prices, a politically difficult proposition for the government in La Paz. Argentina, meanwhile, also has growing reserves, enough not only for its own needs but also for export.
 Chile, which is locked out from receiving gas until it negotiates the return of Bolivia's former coastline, has decided to look to Asia for its gas.
 Peru, meanwhile, is considered an impractical location for a Bolivian pipeline and coastal plant, since the companies that may initiate such a project say it would cost $600 million more than building through Chile. Peru is also developing its own gas project, called Camisea.
 ''Through Peru you can't, and through Chile we don't want to,'' Mr. Lopez said. ''And with that, we're giving up markets that we were competing for with Camisea, like Mexico. Bolivia is shooting itself in the foot.''

HEADLINE: Yukos Warns of Export Halt, Driving Oil Futures to Record

BYLINE: By ERIN E. ARVEDLUND and JONATHAN FUERBRINGER; Erin E. Arvedlund reported from Moscow for this article and Jonathan Fuerbringer from New York.

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 28 

 BODY:
Russia's largest oil producer warned on Wednesday that it might be forced to stop exporting, as the brinkmanship between the company, Yukos, and the Kremlin intensified. The warning rattled world energy markets, driving crude oil futures to the highest level in 21 years. 
 Russian officials, who are seeking billions of dollars in back taxes from Yukos and may ultimately confiscate its major assets, sought to dispel worries about supplies, saying that crude oil shipments would not be disrupted. And the company continues to pump and ship oil. 
 But even the remote prospect of losing the more than 1.6 million barrels a day that Yukos produces was enough to rattle traders at a time when demand is high and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is pumping near its capacity. 
 The surge in prices on Wednesday underlined the importance of Russia -- the world's second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and currently the largest producer -- as an alternative to the Middle East and its uncertainty. Yukos accounts for nearly a fifth of Russia's oil production.
 ''I think Yukos is the background noise,'' said Gary N. Ross, chief executive of the PIRA Energy Group, an international consultant. ''Yukos is just adding to the fear and trepidation of tight supplies.''
 In New York, the price of crude oil for September delivery settled at $42.90 a barrel, up 2.5 percent, after touching $43.05 at one point during the session -- the highest since the futures contract began trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange in 1983. Crude oil is up 32 percent so far this year, and has quadrupled since the deep slump of late 1998. 
 Yukos said that its three main production subsidiaries -- Yuganskneftegas, Samaraneftegas and Tomskneft -- had received letters from Russian court officials forbidding them from selling assets.
 While the company had previously been forbidden from selling any assets but crude oil, the latest communication suggested that it would no longer to be able to do that either, it said. 
 At the same time, Yukos is fighting to regain access to its bank accounts, which are frozen. 
 Yukos's American chief executive, Steven M. Theede, told reporters Wednesday in Nizhnevartovsk in western Siberia that ''we are seeking clarification.''
 ''There's no choice,'' Mr. Theede said. ''We must comply with the bailiffs. But it isn't logical to stop Russia from producing 1.6 million barrels of crude a day.'' 
 Still, Yukos continues to produce. 
 ''We're supplying oil to China by rail today,'' Mr. Theede said at Tomskneft, the second-largest producing unit of Yukos, in Nizhnevartovsk, a swampy, if oil-rich city. ''Of course it would be more efficient to deliver it by pipeline, but ultimately the construction and the timing are a government prerogative.'' 
 Mr. Theede said Yukos was in talks with court officials to clarify the details of the letters. Yukos has also sent a letter to the Justice Ministry saying that it would not be able to operate normally without access to its bank accounts, which ''will lead to the unemployment of 15,000 employees of the companies.'' 
 The company, Mr. Theede said, had already paid for rail shipments, which carry a quarter of its oil output, until the end of next week.
 ''We've paid pipeline tariffs through August, rail through the first week of August,'' he said. ''If we don't get access to the accounts, the rail shipments will be affected.''
 Should Yukos's oil output have to go into inventory, that would fill up in about three days.
 Mr. Theede, 52, was named chief executive last year, succeeding the company's founder, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, after his arrest in October. Mr. Khodorkovsky remains in jail, charged with fraud and tax evasion, and his trial is to resume on Thursday. 
 The cases against Mr. Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, and the company are widely seen as a campaign backed by the Russian leadership to strip him of his power and remove him as a political threat. Mr. Khodorkovsky has financed political parties independent of President Vladimir V. Putin and advocated that the government-owned oil pipelines be privatized.
 Justice Minister Yuri Y. Chaika sought to discount Yukos's concerns. Russian news agencies quoted him on Wednesday as saying, ''I am officially announcing that the company will have no problems, including with paying wages, as a result of a freeze of its accounts.'' 
 And court officials denied that their actions could paralyze Yukos's business operations. ''The accusations are absolutely groundless,'' Andrei Belyakov, head of the Justice Ministry's bailiffs department, told the Interfax news agency. ''The actions of court bailiffs are not directed at freezing accounts or obstructing the business operations of Yukos subsidiaries.''
 The tax case against Yukos is grinding slowly and confusingly, and analysts say that the company will continue producing oil, but may have to fight for control over how it is exported and over the money earned from its sale. 
 The conflicting statements on Wednesday were typical of the standoff between the company and the government. 
 So far, court officials ''have not shown any flexibility in favor of Yukos, although in this situation it would be sensible to allow the company to access its accounts to avoid halting production,'' said Steven Dashevsky of Aton Capital, an investment bank in Moscow. 
 Still, even if court officials allow Yukos access to its bank accounts, Mr. Dashevsky said, ''the main concern still stands: that is the sale of Yukos's core asset to pay the $3.4 billion tax bill for 2000 is still pending.''
 The crackdown against Yukos seems to have had little effect so far on how some foreign investors view Russia. This week, the chief executive of the oil giant BP, Lord John Browne, praised his company's Russian joint venture, TNK-BP, saying that ''BP's presence is decidedly welcome in Russia.'' And the American company ConocoPhilips is expected to bid for the government's 7.59 percent stake in Lukoil, Russia's No.2 oil producer.
 While market analysts said the news about Yukos did help push oil prices higher on Wednesday, many said they thought that any Yukos disruption would be temporary. 
 In addition, they said that strong demand, tight supplies of low-sulfur crude oil and concerns about production in Iraq, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela were having a far greater effect on the world price of oil.
 Katherine Spector, an energy strategist with J.P. Morgan, attributed the spike on Wednesday to speculators who ''are using these headlines.''
 She said a report that oil imports reached a record 11.3 million barrels a day last week and news that oil inventories had risen in the last week were bearish signs on prices. Because Russia has limited oil pipeline capacity, Ms. Spector said that other Russian companies would be ready to step in to export their oil if there was a disruption in production at Yukos.
 Dr. Ross of the PIRA Energy Group said that Venezuela's use of money for social programs in preference to oil production and development was already having a longer-term effect on future supplies than the current disruptions at Yukos. 
 He argued that once a new company took over Yukos, it would concentrate on restoring production and development.
 Yukos is still highly profitable and efficient. It is valued roughly at $30 billion to $40 billion, although its back tax bill could grow to as much as $10 billion if claims for 2002 and 2003 are added. 
 Many investors and political analysts expect that the Yukos subsidiary Yuganskneftegas will be confiscated by the government to pay the tax bill. There has much speculation over which Russian rival may receive the assets directly or be allowed to bid for them.
 Political machinations in Moscow this week put an oil company with friendly government relations in a good position to bid for Yuganskneftegas, which supplies 60 percent of Yukos output. 
 That company, Rosneft, appointed Igor Sechin, deputy head of the Kremlin administration, as board chairman. Mr. Sechin is considered one of the most prominent members of a faction representing powerful ministries within Mr. Putin's government.
 Yukos and Rosneft could not be more different. Rosneft has stuck close to the Kremlin. Yukos has been more Western, hiring foreign oil executives like Mr. Theede to improve its drilling techniques and outpace competitors.
 Shares of Yukos tumbled about 20 percent on Wednesday, and Russia's benchmark stock market index fell nearly 6 percent. 
 ''Fundamentally, Yukos continues to be a very successful company,'' Mr. Theede assured Tomskneft employees in Nizhnevartovsk. ''Assuming that we can work through the issues with the government, then certainly Yukos will continue to fully fund its commitments,'' including social programs and wages. 
 Still, he said, ''Until we are to the point we know whether or not we'll be able to submit a settlement to the government, to operate as a going concern, the answer is difficult to give you.'' 
 The workers took the latest threat to Yukos in stride.
 Although he is proud of the new electric station he helped design at Tomskneft, one which provides power to the oil drilling operations, an employee, Sergei N. Makafeyev, said he had heard ''someone might buy it, and we're worried about it, yes, but we don't think we'll lose our jobs.''
 ''Maybe we'll end up working again for the state, or for someone else,'' he said. ''This is Russia. We're used to it.''

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New Jersey: Trenton: Moody's Lowers State's Bond Rating

BYLINE: By Laura Mansnerus (NYT); Compiled by George James

 BODY:
New Jersey's bond rating was downgraded yesterday by a third credit rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, because of the state's heavy borrowing to balance the current budget. Moody's downgraded the state's general obligation bonds from Aa2 to Aa3 and lowered ratings on most other bonds by one level. 
The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled on Monday that money raised by bonds could not be counted as revenue for purposes of a balanced budget in future years, but it declined to interfere with the state's authorization of $2.7 billion in bonding to finance $1.9 billion of operating expenses in the fiscal year that began on July 1. Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings downgraded the state's rating on Tuesday. Laura Mansnerus (NYT)

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE; Jodi Wilgoren contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 28 

 BODY:
Senator John Edwards, summoning all his skills as a trial lawyer and a populist, made an impassioned case for Senator John Kerry on Wednesday, hailing him as a battle-tested veteran ready to be commander in chief and a man who could restore economic hope and opportunity. 
 ''Hope is on the way,'' Mr. Edwards declared to a cheering Democratic National Convention.
 The heart of Mr. Edwards's speech was the theme he sounded throughout his primary campaign, that ''we still live in a country where there are two different Americas,'' one for people who ''are set for life,'' the other for ''most Americans who live from paycheck to paycheck.'' He proudly recounted his own rise as the son of a millworker, paying tribute to his emotional parents in the convention hall, and made the case for a return to Democratic economic and domestic policies to ''build one America.'' 
 But Mr. Edwards, who will officially become the Democratic nominee for vice president on Thursday, also tried to make a simple but politically crucial point: that Mr. Kerry, criticized by Republicans as too risky and untested to be a wartime president, is made of sterner stuff, with strong values that he demonstrated even as a young Swift boat commander in Vietnam. [Man in the News, Page P8.]
 After Mr. Edwards spoke, the convention delegates proceeded through the traditional roll call of states to nominate Mr. Kerry, each state officially delivering its votes even though the nominee has been known for months. Delegates in Ohio, an important swing state, got the honor of putting Mr. Kerry over the top, with the declaration that the nominee would, in an echo of President Bill Clinton's phrase, serve ''the middle-class Ohioans that get up every day, work hard and play by the rules.'' 
 In a soaring tribute, Mr. Edwards said that Mr. Kerry's crewmates 35 years ago ''saw up close what he's made of.'' He added: ''They saw him reach down and pull one of his men to safety and save his life. They saw him in the heat of battle; they saw him decide in an instant to turn his boat around, drive it straight through an enemy position and chase down the enemy to save his crew.
 ''Decisive. Strong. Is this not what we need in a commander in chief?''
 Rarely was the impact of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the war with Iraq more apparent on American politics, as Democrats rolled out a series of testimonials from leaders in the military establishment, comrades of Mr. Kerry from Vietnam and a chorus of elected officials. The testimony was aimed at what many consider Mr. Kerry's principal vulnerability in his fiercely competitive race with President Bush: that voters still tend to trust Mr. Bush more to keep them safe, according to polls.
 Mr. Edwards assured the nation that a Kerry administration would pursue terrorists.
 ''You cannot run,'' Mr. Edwards said of terrorists. ''You cannot hide. We will destroy you.''
 Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, now retired, and one of a dozen retired top military officials who have endorsed Mr. Kerry, declared, ''I stand here as an old soldier and a new Democrat.'' The general said that he believed in Mr. Kerry, and particularly believed that ''no one will be more resolute in defending America nor in pursuing terrorists than John Kerry.''
 In one of the evening's several implicit references to Mr. Bush's lack of combat experience, General Shalikashvili said of Mr. Kerry, ''He knows from experience a commander's responsibility to his troops.'' When he finished, most of Mr. Kerry's leading military supporters appeared on stage in a striking tableau. 
 Mr. Edwards's speech, while focused in part on Mr. Kerry, was also an effort to introduce himself to the American public after a meteoric six-year political rise: from successful trial lawyer to senator to one of his party's stars. He returned to the sunny populism of his unsuccessful primary campaign, even while accusing the Republicans of ''doing all they can to take this campaign for the highest office in the land down the lowest possible road.''
 He implored voters to reject what he called the ''tired, old, hateful, negative politics of the past'' and instead embrace the hope that he and Mr. Kerry offered. Again and again, he returned to the refrain ''hope is on the way.'' And the Democratic delegates, who revel in economic populism as part of their party's proudest traditions, chanted along. 
 Tommy A. Maynard, a delegate from Nashville, said: ''I'm from Music City and I know a good song when I hear it. I am hearing it tonight. This man has talent and is going places. He talks about down home issues that anyone can relate to.'' 
 Al Hanna, a delegate from Ridgeway, S.C., said: ''The man is talking plain language everyone in America can understand. He is bringing America together.''
 Mr. Edwards described the outlines of Mr. Kerry's domestic agenda: rolling back the Bush tax cuts for people making more than $200,000 a year, giving tax breaks to families for health care, child care and education, and using new tax breaks to encourage corporations to keep jobs at home.
 Mr. Edwards got some of his loudest applause when he declared that it was appropriate to talk about the problems of race, equality and civil rights ''everywhere, everywhere, everywhere.'' Echoing the theme of unity that Barack Obama, the Senate nominee from Illinois, struck the night before in his keynote address, Mr. Edwards declared, ''This is not an African-American issue, this is not a Latino issue, this is not an Asian-American issue, this is an American issue.''
 The audience responded with its own chant, ''Everywhere! Everywhere! Everywhere!''
 Mr. Edwards was introduced by his wife, Elizabeth, who declared: ''I married him because he was the single most optimistic person that I have ever known. He knew there was a brighter day ahead even as he swept the floors of the cotton mill as a high school student.''
 At the end of his speech, he stood on the stage swinging his young son and daughter, with his wife and older daughter at his side, with the audience erupting in cheers. 
 On the third day of the four-day convention, a beaming Mr. Kerry arrived in Boston, just hours before his party was to nominate him. At a rally at the Charlestown Naval Yard, he was introduced to the Bruce Springsteen song ''No Surrender'' and took its lyrics as his charge.
 ''No retreat, no surrender,'' he said to a crowd of cheering supporters. ''We are taking this fight to the country, and we're going to win back our democracy and our future.'' 
 Mr. Kerry, ending a six-day swing through crucial swing states, was greeted when he landed in Boston by what he calls his ''band of brothers,'' a dozen of his crewmates from Vietnam. He worked his way down the line, pausing for long hugs, handshakes and private words with men who have testified to his character throughout the campaign and are doing so again this week.
 He seemed to pause and take the measure of an extraordinary political moment: standing dead even in the polls against an incumbent president, about to accept the nomination of a battle-hardened party, but still facing the daunting challenge of introducing himself to millions of Americans. 
 ''This has been an amazing journey for me over the last few days,'' he said. 
 As for the convention speech he has slaved over for weeks, Mr. Kerry would say only, ''you'll be surprised.''
 The Democrats were engaged in subtle and serious political business throughout the day, setting aside their normal preoccupation with domestic policy. One speaker after another rose to chastise Mr. Bush about his handling of national security. 
 At the same time, Democrats presented Mr. Kerry as a man who will not rush to war because he knows what war is like. Mr. Edwards spoke to that anguish, evoking not only the dead, but also the disabled.
 ''The word 'hero' was made for them,'' he said. ''And they deserve a president who understands that on the most personal level, what they have gone through, what they have given and what they have given up for their country.''

HEADLINE: We Are the World

BYLINE: By Harry McPherson. 
Harry McPherson, counsel to President Lyndon B. Johnson from 1965 to 1969, is the author of ''A Political Education: A Washington Memoir.''

 BODY:
Tonight, at the Democratic National Convention in Boston, John Kerry will step onto the podium and accept his party's nomination for president. Though conventions themselves have receded in importance, the acceptance speech has remained potent, offering the candidate the chance to introduce himself to America. So what should Mr. Kerry say? The Op-Ed page asked speechwriters from the last five Democratic administrations to propose a conclusion to Mr. Kerry's address -- one that sums up what they think the winning Democratic campaign themes for 2004 should be.
 For four centuries America has been a beacon light of freedom and hope for millions of people from every continent.
 It still is. It must always be. We Americans have obligations to the world, just as we do to ourselves.
 The world needs our strength, and it needs confidence that we will use that strength wisely, and only when we must.
 The world needs our leadership, our determination, our allegiance to principle -- which is not the same thing as our disdainful readiness to go it alone.
 The world needs our steadfastness in the defense of reason against fanaticism; in the struggle for health against epidemic disease; in the containment of nuclear threats to peace.
 The world needs our participation in widespread economic growth, in demanding fair terms of trade, in vigorously encouraging democratic institutions and transparent markets.
 The world needs all this from America; to the extent we provide it, we and the world will prosper. If we misunderstand, if we fail to appreciate the gravity of these needs, the world will be seriously weakened, and so will we.
 Our obligations here at home extend from the generations that answered the call in past conflicts, to the children whose health and competence will determine their futures and the nation's.
 The first obligation of our government is to secure the nation from attack. As the 9/11 commission has told us in unmistakable terms, we must do much more to meet this fundamental obligation.
 We must be unceasingly vigilant. We must be resourceful. We must summon the courage we have always shown in times of national emergency, and with the cooperation of our friends in other nations, we will beat this villainous challenge.
 And we will beat it without abandoning the standards of justice that distinguish decent societies from totalitarian regimes.
 In the end, it will be our willingness to meet our obligations to ourselves -- to respect one another, to strive for the common good, to take actions that will bear fruit a generation from now -- that will make our land continue to be the blessing it has been for so many years, for so many human beings.
 My obligation to this great party is to carry its banner proudly in the campaign to come. And to the American people, if they shall make me their president, I give this pledge: to speak and act honestly, and to bear the responsibilities of that office with a high and confident heart.
 May God bless the United States of America.

HEADLINE: Meant Well, Messed Up

BYLINE: By Theodore C. Sorensen. 
Theodore C. Sorensen, a lawyer, was counsel, policy adviser and speechwriter for President John F. Kennedy.

 BODY:
Tonight, at the Democratic National Convention in Boston, John Kerry will step onto the podium and accept his party's nomination for president. Though conventions themselves have receded in importance, the acceptance speech has remained potent, offering the candidate the chance to introduce himself to America. So what should Mr. Kerry say? The Op-Ed page asked speechwriters from the last five Democratic administrations to propose a conclusion to Mr. Kerry's address -- one that sums up what they think the winning Democratic campaign themes for 2004 should be.
 Only 96 days remain to take back our country from the most secretive, hypocritical and dangerous band of ideologues in our governmental history. Let no doubt remain; this is the most important election of our time. Either we take the road forward to national unity and international cooperation, or we fall further into despair, division and dangerous isolation.
 Our nation cannot go on like this -- squandering brave young lives and hundreds of billions of dollars on unnecessary war, losing old friends and creating new enemies, abandoning the middle class while making the rich richer and saddling our children with unsustainable debt and pollution. 
 The Kerry-Edwards administration, unlike the Cheney-Bush agenda, will invest in jobs, health care and education, not Halliburton and other corporate cronies. We will practice transparency, not evasion. When trouble comes, we will find solutions, not scapegoats. We will protect our borders without bending our Constitution.
 I am proud to have led Americans under fire, proud to have fought hard in the Senate for hard-working families; proud to have protected the environment without sacrificing jobs; proud to have prosecuted corporate predators; proud to have devoted my life to public service and the search for peace, and proud that I am the only presidential nominee this year who can make any of those statements.
 Mr. Bush, you meant well and tried your best. But by weakening our alliances, our economy, our national unity and global respect for our values, you have weakened our security. Too many American lives have been lost already and too many more are at increased risk. We can and must do better. We can restore our security, our economy and our global standing. I beseech thee, in the name of all we hold dear, go home before you do any more harm.

HEADLINE: Delay, Deadline and Another Court Date on Schools

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 29 

 BODY:
Friday is the day by which the state's highest court ordered New York State to come up with a plan to improve education in New York City. But after more than a year of delay and fruitless backroom negotiations, elected officials in Albany have failed to agree on a plan, and all sides agree that the deadline will be missed.
 Most lawmakers were not even at work in Albany on Thursday, and state officials said they were preparing for the issue to return next week to court, where the case that led to the Court of Appeals ruling was first lodged in May 1993.
 It was 13 months ago that the high court ruled the state had been shortchanging city schoolchildren for decades, depriving them of their constitutional right to a decent education. The court did not try to calculate how many billions of dollars would be needed, giving Albany until Friday to agree on a specific number. Now there is a possibility the judicial branch will simply tell the legislative branch how much to spend. 
 The roots of the state's failure to agree on a figure are long, and can be explained by a mix of mistrust and self-interest. They extend a ritual of delay that has come to define the triumvirate that has ruled Albany for the last decade, Gov. George E. Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno.
 Mr. Pataki fought the case from the beginning, and at one point his lawyers embraced an intermediate court's ruling that the state was obliged to provide no more than an eighth-grade education. When the Court of Appeals ruled against him last year, Mr. Pataki smiled and called the opinion a ''historic opportunity'' to remake education, a phrase he often repeated.
 But political bickering followed, and much of Albany's important business sputtered to a halt.
 Democrats treated the court ruling as a jackpot for needy school districts. Republicans insisted existing education money must be spent wisely before adding a penny more. Mr. Pataki spoke of accountability but waited until last week to put his ideas into a bill. Things are so stalled, the matter is now headed back where it began: before the original trial judge, Justice Leland DeGrasse. Meanwhile, some religious leaders are urging people to pray, hoping ethereal powers might fill a void left by politicians.
 The next step is likely to be a hearing on Tuesday before Justice DeGrasse, who has indicated he will name special masters or referees to advise him. No one knows how long their work could take; the plaintiffs say about 90 days.
 As a practical matter, legislators say they have until Tuesday to deliver a plan to the court, a day after they are set to return to Albany to resume work on the schools issue and a budget that is late for the 20th consecutive year. Even if they go further into August before coming up with a plan, legislators say the court should consider it.
 But that remains an open question. ''We've never had anything quite like this,'' said Richard Rifkin, the deputy attorney general for state counsel.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said that even though the deadline would be missed, the leaders in Albany still had a kind of operational reprieve based on the calendar and the court date next week. ''They're trying very hard, I think, to come up with a solution,'' the mayor said on Thursday. ''So far, that solution has avoided them, but I'm still hopeful that they can come up with something.''
 The specter of the judicial branch drawing up a plan is something education advocates hoped to avoid. A court might tell the state what to pay and when, and might limit its ruling to New York City, whereas the plaintiffs had hoped the plan might deal with the entire state.
 ''One of the problems in going back to the legal process is there is some uncertainty there,'' said Michael A. Rebell, the executive director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, the group that brought the lawsuit. ''It will take some time. There could be some legal maneuvering, and there will be attempts at delay.''
 Legislators said that the best they can hope for is to iron out the beginnings of a plan to satisfy the court as soon as possible. Failing in that, Mr. Bruno said, would be an atrocity for more than 700 school districts that begin to set property taxes in mid-August, based on the aid they receive from Albany, in time to send out local bills come September.
 In its plan, the Democrat-led Assembly wants to spend more state money on education than either the governor or the Senate, including $3.8 billion for the city. The Republican-led Senate wants to preserve the current formula for divvying up school aid, so that suburban and upstate lawmakers will not be hurt. Its plan is worth about $10 billion, but that includes a plan to give the city permission to borrow $2.8 billion.
 Mr. Pataki wants to fix the city's schools with the profits from video lottery terminals, which would provide a $325 million increase to education spending in their first year, an amount the governor's office calls a foundation. That amount would grow to more than $2 billion a year, though opponents say that responding to the court order with such a foundation is too risky for the court to accept.
 Analysts in the Assembly Ways and Means committee say the governor's plan would actually decrease the recent pattern of school aid growth. Over the last five years, even with an economic downturn, the bursting of the dot-com bubble and a terrorist attack, all of which contributed to a $12 billion budget deficit last year, education spending in New York has grown by $2.61 billion.
 All along, Mr. Silver has rejected the notion of paying for education with a separate, dedicated fund. Instead, he said it should be treated as any other state obligation, like prisons, police officers or health care, and paid for with overall state revenues.
 Educators fear a court-imposed solution, with no political support, will be chaotic because it could be challenged all over New York. Already, the Utica school district has filed a similar lawsuit to the New York City case and school districts in Syracuse and Rochester are moving in the same direction.
 ''No mater what happens,'' said Senator Michael A.L. Balboni, a Republican from Long Island, ''at the end of the day, it is not likely, particularly given the threat of more lawsuits from suburban, upstate and big five school districts throughout the state, that there will be any resolution of this for months, if not years.''

HEADLINE: Report Looks Harshly at I.M.F.'s Role in Argentine Debt Crisis

BYLINE: By TODD BENSON

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, July 29 

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund was too lenient for too long with Argentina and made a series of mistakes in the 1990's that contributed to that country's spectacular economic implosion in late 2001, according to a report released on Thursday.
 The 193-page report by the Independent Evaluation Office of the I.M.F., which serves as a sort of ombudsman's office for the fund, criticized the international lender for supporting Argentina's exchange rate policy that pegged the peso to the American dollar for too long -- a policy that caused the country's debt to balloon out of control and ultimately forced the government to declare the largest sovereign debt default in history in early 2002.
 In the crisis that followed, President Fernando de la Rua was forced from office, as were three more presidents in two weeks before Eduardo Duhalde took over. Argentina defaulted on most of its $141 billion in public debt, abandoned its currency peg and imposed draconian limits on bank deposits. Millions of Argentines were pushed into poverty in a crisis that has been compared to the Great Depression in the United States. 
 The I.M.F. contributed to this outcome by failing to recognize early on that Argentina was running up an unsustainable debt, the report said. Even though Argentina had repeatedly missed macroeconomic goals agreed upon with the fund, I.M.F. officials did not press the Argentine authorities for significant changes and even hailed the country at times as an example for other emerging market countries.
 ''The I.M.F. remained engaged in a program relationship with Argentina too long, when the policies being supported were inadequate,'' the report said. 
 The report also says that the fund was wrong to have increased its lending to Argentina to as much as $22 billion from late 2000 to late 2001, just as analysts were increasingly warning that the country was heading toward a collapse. Instead of searching for ways to minimize the costs of devaluing the peso, the report went on, the I.M.F. scrambled to find ways to preserve the currency peg until it was too late.
 But the report stops short of laying the ultimate blame for Argentina's demise on the I.M.F., and instead points a finger at the Argentine authorities.
 ''The crisis resulted from the failure of Argentine policy makers to take necessary corrective measures sufficiently early,'' it said. ''I.M.F. surveillance failed to highlight the growing vulnerabilities in the authorities' choice of policies.''
 The report draws 10 lessons from the Argentine crisis, and urges the fund to strengthen its surveillance of loan programs by making exchange rate and debt sustainability the core focus. It also concludes that the I.M.F. should always have a contingency strategy, with clear-cut criteria to determine if the initial approach is working, and if and when a policy shift is in order.
 The report was released as the I.M.F. appeared to be taking a harder line with Argentina, which has a $13 billion loan deal with the fund. An I.M.F. team visited Buenos Aires in June to review the government's compliance with the agreement, but has yet to disburse a $728 million installment under the loan. If the revision is not completed by the end of next week, when the I.M.F. staff members break for summer recess, Argentina may have to dip into reserves to make payments to lenders.
 Argentina's economy minister, Roberto Lavagna, asked the fund last week to release the loan payment before the recess, noting that the country had met goals stipulated in the agreement. But the I.M.F. has dragged its feet in what many analysts say is a sign of its displeasure with the hard line that the government has taken with private bondholders in its latest debt restructuring proposal.
 ''I was not expecting this shift in attitude from the I.M.F. to take place so soon,'' said Alberto Bernal, chief economist at IDEAglobal, a Wall Street research firm. ''The only thing I can point to is that the creditors appear to have done a good job of selling the idea that Argentina can afford to pay more.''
 The government of President Nestor Kirchner needs I.M.F. backing for its plan to renegotiate some $100 billion in defaulted debt. But the fund has been reluctant to support it, insisting that Argentina negotiate with its creditors in good faith.
 The I.M.F.'s delay may also stem from a change in leadership. Rodrigo Rato, Spain's former economy minister, became managing director earlier this month and has suggested that he intends to take a wait-and-see approach with Argentina.
 The Global Committee of Argentina Bondholders, which claims to represent about $37 billion in Argentine debt, has criticized the restructuring plan announced in June. Under the offer, Argentina would cut its debt by $60.9 billion and issue $38.5 billion in bonds. That would amount to about a 75 percent reduction in the market value of the debt.
 But with the Argentine economy growing at a fast clip and tax revenues booming, bondholder groups think the country can pay more.

HEADLINE: Claims for Jobless Benefits Rise Slightly, to 345,000

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing claims for jobless benefits rose last week, and employment costs moderated in the second quarter, the Labor Department reported yesterday.
 The increase in claims was influenced by seasonal closings at automobile plants and was too small to suggest anything other than a continued expansion of the job market, economists said.
 States received 345,000 initial applications for unemployment insurance, compared with 341,000 a week earlier, the Labor Department said. The numbers are consistent with the addition of about 200,000 jobs this month after a smaller increase in June, economists said. 
 ''Claims do not have to keep falling to imply rising payrolls,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. Recent levels of claims indicate no sign of a slowdown in employment, he said.
 The four-week moving average of claims, a less volatile measure, fell to 336,250. It was the fourth consecutive week at less than 340,000. Claims so far this year have averaged 345,633 a week, compared with 402,115 for all of last year.
 A separate report from the department showed that employment costs rose 0.9 percent in the April-June quarter after rising 1.1 percent in the first three months of the year. A 1.8 percent increase in benefit costs led the gain, outpacing a 0.6 percent increase in wages and salaries.
 Compared with a year earlier, employment costs were up 3.9 percent. Wage and salary costs were up 2.5 percent, matching the smallest 12-month gain since record keeping began more than two decades ago. Benefit costs were up 7.2 percent, the highest since mid-1990. Adjusted for inflation, wages dropped 0.8 percent.
 The United States economy recorded its strongest labor force expansion since 2000 in the first six months of 2004 -- averaging 211,000 new jobs a month. At the same time, the June increase of 112,000 jobs was the smallest since February. 
 In another sign that labor demand slowed in June, the Conference Board said yesterday that help-wanted advertising dropped during the month. The group's index of job ads in major United States newspapers dropped to 38 in June, from 39 in May.

Surrealist Art In Paris Sale
 It is highly unusual, perhaps even unprecedented, for a group of Modern paintings and drawings from a New York collection to be sent to Paris for sale. It generally works the other way around: each season, auction giants like Sotheby's and Christie's fill their sales of Impressionist and Modern art with works from France, betting that they will appeal to the American nouveau riche.
 But Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips, de Pury & Company recently refused to sell the collection of nearly 900 works from the estate of Jean Levy, the widow of Julien Levy, the Manhattan dealer known for bringing Surrealist artists to New York. So Ann Horton, an art consultant representing the estate, decided to sell it at Tajan, the French auction house at 37 rue des Mathurins in Paris.
 ''The French are honored that we are sending it back to France, a country whose art inspired him,'' Ms. Horton said, referring to Levy.
 Sotheby's offered some works from Mr. Levy's estate in 1981. (He died that year, his widow last August.) Back then, however, the market was depressed, and Surrealism was not fashionable, so many offerings failed to sell. A few items in this auction, Oct. 5 to 7, will be inventory from Levy's gallery, and some will be works his widow lived with. Tajan estimates that the collection will bring $6.8 million to $8.1 million.
 Among the highlights are two abstract paintings by Gorky, who was a close friend of the Levys. ''Pirate I'' (1942) is estimated at $1.4 million to $1.6 million, and ''Pirate II'' (1943) at $1.1 million to $1.3 million. Experts said they believed that French museums would try to buy them.
 Also for sale are the largest group of works by Marcel Duchamp to come to auction. There are also many works on paper by Gorky, as well as by Noguchi, Tamayo, Tanguy, Matta, Ernst and Dali, along with assemblages by Man Ray.
 Museumgoers may remember that besides being a dealer, Levy was one of the most important proponents of Modern art photography in this country. In 2001 his widow arranged a partial gift and partial purchase of 2,000 images to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which explains why there are no photographs in the sale at Tajan.

A Vocal Expression
 It is always interesting to see how an artwork can take on different meanings at different times. Consider ''Freedom of Expression National Monument'' by the architect Laurie Hawkinson, the performer John Malpede and the visual artist Erika Rothenberg. The work, a giant red megaphone that visitors can talk into, set atop a flight of stairs, was originally installed 20 years ago as part of ''Art on the Beach'' on the landfill created by the construction of the World Trade Center before Battery Park City was built. At the time the work was meant to speak to issues like AIDS, homelessness, human rights, the economy and the environment.
 Now, on the eve of the Republican National Convention in Manhattan, ''Freedom of Expression National Monument'' is being installed once more. From Aug. 17 to Nov. 13 it will occupy Foley Square in Lower Manhattan, between the federal, state and city courthouses, so that visitors can shout about issues that particularly relate to today's world.
 ''The city has changed so much in 20 years, and the art world has changed so much,'' said Anne Pasternak, director of Creative Time, the nonprofit organization that commissioned the piece in 1984 and has installed it again. ''The need for a soapbox is so important, especially now, during the conventions.''

Next Stop, the World
 The underground universe of the New York City subways has been enlivened by artists for years now, largely because of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Arts for Transit Program, which has commissioned many different projects. One common thread, however, is that most of the works reflect something about their place.
 The latest is being installed on the Lexington Avenue line's 86th Street station. It is ''Happy City'' by Peter Sis, a Czechoslovak-born illustrator and children's book author who won a MacArthur genius award last year and has created a series of four murals.
 ''It's a celebration about the creation of 86th Street,'' Mr. Sis said in a telephone interview. ''I've been here for 20 years now, and I hope we will all live together post-9/11.''
 In his throughly original, lighthearted style, Mr. Sis has used glass mosaic and precious stones from different countries to create a giant eye looking at the city. Around the eyeball are some of his meticulously rendered architectural details, in this case neighborhood landmarks. There are the museums, from the Metropolitan to the Guggenheim and the Cooper-Hewitt. There are also generic buildings representing the neighborhood.
 Mr. Sis has also used the circular form as a carousel, with children playing and riding on whimsical animals. He has lifted some characters in the design from his books. ''They are symbols of harmony,'' he said. ''They are all children from different cultures and traveling musicians playing different instruments from different countries.''
 Installation is expected to be completed by Sunday.

A New Showplace
 When the American Folk Art Museum was unable to book its usual space, the Metropolitan Pavilion in Chelsea, for its fourth annual American Antiques Show from Jan. 20 to 23, 2005, it was forced to look elsewhere. The Seventh Regiment Armory at Park Avenue and 67th Street was already booked, as was the 69th Regiment Armory on Lexington Avenue at 26th Street.
 The museum had to think of something original. The solution: the north tower of the new Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle.
 ''The building has developed a following,'' said Barry Briskin, the show's executive chairman. ''We think it's hot property.''

HEADLINE: Bush Approves Using 9/11 Aid For J.F.K. Link

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
The White House has agreed to let New York use $2 billion in Sept. 11 aid to help build a $6 billion rail link connecting the World Trade Center site to the Long Island Rail Road and Kennedy International Airport.
 The decision by the Bush administration is a huge boost for Gov. George E. Pataki's efforts to get a direct rail connection from Manhattan to the airport. Such a link, common in most other large cities, has been a dream of urban planners for decades. 
 And advocates for downtown say putting the link at the World Trade Center site would significantly enhance Lower Manhattan's efforts to attract new business and recover economically from the terror attack. 
 The money for the rail project would come from unused portions of a multibillion-dollar tax-incentive package that Washington allocated in 2001 to help spur redevelopment of Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11 attack, according to city, state and federal officials. The rail plan must still be approved by Congress.
 Governor Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had pushed the White House in recent weeks to redirect the funds, from the so-called Liberty Bond program, to the planned rail link.
 The project is expected to be completed in 2013. It would allow travelers heading to Manhattan from Kennedy Airport to travel aboard new trains on existing AirTrain tracks that loop around the central terminal area and then run along a viaduct in the middle of the Van Wyck Expressway to Jamaica, Queens. There, a new 1,500-foot elevated connector would carry the trains from the AirTrain tracks to the Long Island Rail Road tracks heading toward Brooklyn. 
 Just before Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn, and joined to it by a new underground station, a three-mile tunnel would begin, burrowing under Brooklyn and the East River into Lower Manhattan. 
 The tunnel would come close to Hanover Square, the intended terminus of the Second Avenue subway, and the World Trade Center, the existing terminus of the E train. 
 Once completed, officials say, the link would greatly expand the ability of businesses in the financial district to attract workers from Long Island, who now have to take both trains and subways to get downtown. It would accommodate up to 100,000 Long Island commuters a day, according to the governor's office.
 The White House's decision to provide the money was detailed in a document prepared by the Office of Management and Budget as part of the midyear budget review that the Bush administration plans to submit to Congress today.
 The document itself does not specify how the $2 billion is to be spent, other than noting that it is being set aside for ''transportation infrastructure'' in New York. But both the governor and the mayor have said that they will use the money to pay for the rail link.
 The aid request must still go to Congress, where the Bush administration's support could go a long way toward quieting protests from Republican budget hawks who are increasingly concerned about the growing federal deficit, particularly in an election year.
 In a statement, Mr. Pataki said the decision brought the rail project one step closer to reality.
 ''President Bush's support is a tremendous boost for the rail link project,'' he said. ''Now, it is up to Congress and our state's Congressional delegation to ensure this proposal becomes law. I look forward to working with them to make the rail link a reality.''
 Mr. Bloomberg also praised the decision. ''By improving regional access to Lower Manhattan,'' he said, ''we can continue the area's dramatic rebirth from the attacks of Sept. 11 and ensure its future as an economic engine for the entire city.''
 The decision by the White House comes a few weeks after Mr. Pataki made an unusually direct appeal to President Bush, a fellow Republican, asking him to provide cash for the rail project in lieu of unused parts of the multibillion-dollar Liberty Zone tax-incentive package for Lower Manhattan.
 Those tax breaks have been controversial from their inception, with some New York politicians, economists and real estate experts questioning their value and arguing that Lower Manhattan has been in desperate need of a large infusion of actual money from the federal government.
 The Bush administration and New York officials are trying to figure out how the $2 billion will be doled out. The federal government could give the city and state hard cash, though that option would probably meet resistance in Congress, given the federal government's budgetary predicament.
 But another approach is apparently being considered by all sides: permitting the city and state to raise the money needed for the rail project by selling tax credits on the open market that allow businesses to reduce their federal tax liability.
 Charles E. Schumer, New York's senior senator, said allowing the city and state to sell federal tax credits was ''an elegant solution'' given the opposition that might arise in Congress to providing $2 billion in hard cash to the city and state. ''There's more than one way to skin this cat,'' said Mr. Schumer, a Democrat.
 Some New York City Democrats, while describing themselves as pleased with the news, said they would be keeping a close eye on how much political capital the White House was willing to expend in getting the $2 billion aid package approved in Congress. 
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, suggested that the test of the Bush administration's commitment to the project would be its willingness to persuade Republicans to adopt the $2 billion aid package. ''We have to be sure it's real,'' she said. ''We need the administration to work very hard.'' 
 Mr. Pataki's office says that financing for the $6 billion project will include at least $560 million from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and unspecified amounts from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and other sources.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.

Now Playing

''ANCHORMAN,'' starring Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate. Directed by Adam McKay (PG-13, 91 minutes). Neither as crazy as ''Old School'' nor as charming as ''Elf,'' this extended comedy sketch (directed by a former ''Saturday Night Live'' head writer) will nonetheless satisfy, for now, the national hunger for Mr. Ferrell's special brand of goofiness. This time he plays Ron Burgundy, a San Diego newsman whose supremacy is threatened by the arrival of a woman (Ms. Applegate) who becomes his rival, his love interest and, of course, his straight man. The movie's ideas are none too fresh -- the crazy sideburns and ugly neckties of the 1970's will yield only so much hilarity -- but there is a reasonably high quotient of funny jokes and off-the-wall, nutty gags, including a street fight among rival news teams as amusing for its movie-star cameos as for its brutal slapstick (A. O. Scott).

* ''BEFORE SUNSET,'' starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Directed by Richard Linklater (R, 80 minutes). Nine years after parting, in Vienna, at the end of ''Before Sunrise,'' Jesse (Mr. Hawke) and Celine (Ms. Delpy) rediscover each other in Paris and relive their brief encounter. This time it is even briefer: the film unfolds, without skipping a minute, in the hour or so before Jesse must catch a plane home to New York, and all those minutes are filled with looping, self-conscious talk as the reunited lovers wander along the Seine. Their intimacy is tinged with nostalgic regret. The airy sense of freedom that they shared in their early 20's has given way to the resignation of adulthood, even as they meander toward a second chance. The liberating sweetness of the earlier movie has mellowed into a saltier, sadder flavor, but Mr. Linklater, one of our most literate and intelligent directors, has not talked himself out of the possibility of romance, and the movie's relaxed, discursive structure is dense with implied feeling and oblique drama (Scott).

* ''THE BOURNE SUPREMACY,'' starring Matt Damon, Franka Potente, Brian Cox and Julia Stiles. Directed by Paul Greengrass (PG-13; 120 minutes). It may sound odd to call a chilly paranoid thriller entertainment comfort food. But in the wake of 9/11 this globe-trotting post-cold war melodrama full of standard cloak-and-dagger intrigue has the reassuring aroma of a home-cooked meal. There are no jihads or terrorists in sight and no apocalyptic scenarios, only dirty little secrets, as spies and counterspies from Russia and America tangle in a grubby story involving oil, sold secrets, murders and cover-ups. In this sequel to ''The Bourne Identity,'' many of the major hands who created the first film have returned, including Mr. Damon as Jason Bourne, the C.I.A.-trained assassin who still has serious memory problems and can't recall why he is being hunted by everybody, although blurry flashbacks leave him with clues. As before, he spends almost the entire movie on the run. The thriller reminds you that rhythms of film editing and collage-making have allowed Hollywood to make the chase movie a surefire format. Plot and character ultimately don't matter much in a film that's all about building and sustaining a mood in which visceral and emotional rhythms are blended into a high-gloss thrill ride (Stephen Holden).

''CATWOMAN,'' starring Halle Berry, Benjamin Bratt and Sharon Stone. Directed by Pitof (PG-13, 110 minutes). Ms. Berry, doing her utmost to persuade the Academy to take back her Oscar, plays Patience, a flighty would-be artist who is bumped off after she uncovers the nefarious corporate secrets of a cosmetics company. Brought to life by feline mouth-to-mouth, she acquires interesting cat powers and cat behaviors, and begins eating tuna straight out of the can, stealing jewels and carrying a whip. Mr. Bratt is the upright, studly cop who serves as her obligatory love interest, and Ms. Stone is her icy rival. There is a diverting element of campy, kinky sexuality in this mess, and lots of bright colors and stroboscopic editing effects. In the end, though, you might find yourself thinking back fondly on ''Garfield'' (Scott).

''A CINDERELLA STORY,'' starring Hilary Duff. Directed by Mark Rosman (PG, 97 minutes). If adolescent rebellion were channeled toward a useful cause, the tweener audience for ''A Cinderella Story'' and for the recent ''Sleepover'' would march en masse to Hollywood to protest the cynicism, sloppiness and condescension of the toxic fantasies being hurled at them. Set in the San Fernando Valley, ''A Cinderella Story'' strains to bend the classic fairy tale to accommodate another coarse high school comedy of air-headed teenage vixens ganging up on a meek little angel. Samantha (the talent-challenged Ms. Duff), or ''Diner Girl,'' as she's jeeringly labeled, is a pariah because she drives a battered old car and toils like a slave in her evil stepmother's hideous pink-painted diner. That stepmother (Jennifer Coolidge), who suggests a nightmarish hybrid of Zsa Zsa Gabor and Tammy Faye Bakker, is a greasy-looking sexpot manque. The resident Prince Charming (Chad Michael Murray) is the courtly captain of the football team, student council president and closet poet, and the fairy godmother (Regina King) the salty, good-hearted African-American manager of the diner. Even for a fairy tale, ''A Cinderella Story'' fails to make sense (Holden).

''THE CLEARING,'' starring Robert Redford, Helen Mirren and Willem Dafoe (R, 91 minutes). Joining ''In the Bedroom'' and ''House of Sand and Fog'' in the new subgenre of tastefully filmed literary fiction, ''The Clearing'' is centered on the frayed but enduring marriage of Wayne and Eileen Hayes (Mr. Redford and Ms. Mirren), whose inner tensions (tastefully) explode when Wayne is kidnapped by a former employee (Mr. Dafoe) and taken on a forced march through the Smoky Mountains. Eileen and her two adult children try to cope with the crisis as best they can, but a pesky F.B.I. agent (Matt Craven) keeps stirring up the past, in the form of Wayne's adulterous relationship with another of his workers. The film is self-consciously classy, in the tidy, antiseptic way of a New Yorker short story (Dave Kehr).

''DE-LOVELY,'' starring Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd. Directed by Irwin Winkler (PG-13, 125 minutes). Unfolding as a bumpy, muddled ''This Is Your Life'' series of confusing, overcrowded tableaus, the new Cole Porter biography gives you the creepy sense of watching adult children (with the singular exception of Mr. Kline, who can surmount any disaster) dressed up in period costume at a school pageant. Although its publicity goes out of its way to pat the movie on the back for its supposed candor about Porter's homosexuality, the film's attitude toward sex is dainty. The heat in a film about the man who wrote ''Too Darn Hot'' remains a steady, air-conditioned 68 degrees. It can't imagine a wealthy, sophisticated couple marrying for friendship and social advantage without that arrangement involving torment and guilt over its lack of sex. Some two dozen Porter songs are glossed by contemporary singers like Elvis Costello (''Let's Misbehave''), Alanis Morissette (''Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love''), Sheryl Crow (''Begin the Beguine'') and Diana Krall (''Just One of Those Things''). If they're not awful, these labored, self-conscious interpretations are undercut by flimsy period arrangements (Holden).

* ''THE DOOR IN THE FLOOR,'' starring Jeff Bridges, Kim Basinger and Jon Foster. Written and directed by Tod Williams (R, 111 minutes). Avoiding the traps of sentimentality and overdone whimsy that lie in wait for adaptors of John Irving's fiction, Mr. Williams has made a version of ''A Widow for One Year'' that is better than the book. Mr. Foster plays Eddie, a prep school student who spends a long, eventful summer working as an assistant to Ted Cole (Mr. Bridges), a famous writer and illustrator of children's books. Ted and his wife, Marion (Ms. Basinger), are still grieving over the loss of their two sons in a car accident years before, and their marriage is falling apart. All of this might have made for maudlin, precious melodrama -- especially when Eddie and Marion begin their affair -- but rather than emphasize the plot, Mr. Williams makes it a relaxed, roomy landscape for the characters to roam around in. The cast rises above the occasional implausibility of the material, and the movie is funny, touching and understated. It is dominated by Mr. Bridges's performance, one of the finest pieces of screen acting by an American man so far this year, a heroically life-size portrait of wounded narcissism and masculine need (Scott).

* ''FAHRENHEIT 9/11,'' written and directed by Michael Moore (R, 116 minutes). Mixing sober outrage with mischievous humor and blithely trampling the boundary between documentary and demagoguery, Mr. Moore takes wholesale aim at the Bush administration, whose tenure has been distinguished, in Mr. Moore's view, by unparalleled and unmitigated arrogance, mendacity and incompetence. Of course your estimation of the movie will depend largely on whether you share his view, but this unabashedly partisan collage of interviews, archival video clips and Mr. Moore's trademark agitprop stunts is nonetheless his most disciplined and powerful film. Mr. Moore is a prodigious talker and a wily showman, but he is also a good listener, and when he visits his hometown, Flint, Mich., to speak to the mother of a marine killed in Iraq, the film achieves an eloquence that its most determined critics will have a hard time dismissing. The movie's cheap shots and inconsistencies may frustrate its admirers, but by now we should have learned to appreciate Mr. Moore for what he is. He is rarely subtle, often impolite, frequently tendentious and sometimes self-contradictory. He is also a credit to the Republic (Scott).

''A HOME AT THE END OF THE WORLD,'' starring Colin Farrell, Dallas Roberts, Sissy Spacek and Robin Wright Penn. Directed by Michael Mayer (R, 95 minutes). Michael Cunningham's adaptation of his novel is so well meaning that you may trick yourself into thinking that it's a good movie. But feeling sympathy for a film and its characters is not the same thing as liking or admiring it. Mr. Farrell and Mr. Roberts are childhood friends who, in adulthood, form an odd, triangular household with Ms. Penn's character, a kooky older woman. There are interesting ideas at work here about love, loss and sexuality, but the emotional subtleties of the novel turn into bland speechifying (Scott).

''I, ROBOT,'' starring Will Smith and Bridget Moynahan. Directed by Alex Proyas (PG-13, 110 minutes). Once again, machines are threatening to take over the world, and once again, they have developed feelings, which poses the usual conundrums of sci-fi philosophy. ''Suggested by'' Isaac Asimov's classic book of short stories, this sleek, hectic thriller engages some interesting ideas on its way to an overblown and incoherent ending. Mr. Smith, in weary-action movie mode, plays Del Spooner, a homicide detective in 2035 Chicago investigating the death of an old friend. Spooner is a confirmed robot-hater, and as he confronts his bigotry the movie develops a clever, if obvious, racial subtext. With the help of Susan Calvin (Ms. Moynahan), a concerned scientist, and a soulful machine named Sonny, Spooner contends with an apparent corporate conspiracy aimed at usurping human control of everything. ''You're the dumbest smart person I've ever met,'' Spooner says to Dr. Calvin at one point, and for a dumb movie, ''I, Robot'' turns out to be pretty smart (Scott).

''KING ARTHUR,'' starring Clive Owen and Keira Knightley. Directed by Antoine Fuqua (PG-13, 130 minutes). This misty, smoky, plodding epic claims to resurrect the ''true story'' that has been buried in centuries of Arthurian legend. Arthur (Mr. Owen) is a mopey Roman officer, whose knights are a band of conscripts policing the area around Hadrian's Wall and fighting off the Woads, a band of guerrilla fighters led by Merlin. The Romans withdraw, the Saxons arrive (led by Stellan Skarsgard, hamming it up in braids), and Arthur grapples with his identity crisis and falls in love with Guinevere (Ms. Knightley), a tough Woad babe he has rescued from a Roman dungeon. The battle scenes have some impact, though not much coherence, but Mr. Fuqua gives the movie an element of brawny, B-picture camp that mitigates its ponderous dullness (Scott).

* ''MARIA FULL OF GRACE,'' starring Catalina Sandino Moreno and Yenny Paola Vega. Written and directed by Joshua Marston (R, 101 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles. It's painfully understandable why the 17-year-old title character of this gripping Colombian film would risk her freedom and even her life to be a drug mule. The movie follows the desperate plunge of Maria (Catalina Sandino Moreno) from a dead-end job as an assembly-line worker in a Colombian flower factory into the drug-smuggling underworld. Her dangerous undertaking is her last resort when she finds herself unemployed and pregnant. Before the story zeroes in on the harrowing details of drug running and its dangers, it details Maria's hopelessly circumscribed life in a rural village. If her story is a template for countless others like it, what keeps your heart in your throat is Maria herself. In a performance that feels more lived in than acted, Ms. Moreno's Maria is an attractive, smart, spirited young woman who faces the challenge of fending for herself with a fierce determination and ingenuity that compromise but never undermine her essential decency and morality. The movie sustains a documentary authenticity that is as astonishing as it is off-handed. Even while keeping you on the edge of your seat, it never sacrifices a calm, clear-sighted humanity for the sake of melodrama or cheap moralizing (Holden).

* ''METALLICA: SOME KIND OF MONSTER,'' directed by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky (not rated, 139 minutes). Mr. Berlinger and Mr. Sinofsky, who begin filming the mighty heavy-metal band Metallica in early 2001, turn what might have been a conventional behind-the-scenes rockumentary into a riveting, intricate pyschodrama. After nearly 20 years together, Metallica was in something of a funk, and the band members hired Phil Towle, a therapist, to help them through their artistic and interpersonal struggles. At its core, ''Some Kind of Monster'' is the portrait of a marriage: the angry, sustaining partnership between James Hetfield, the lead singer, and Lars Ulrich, the drummer, who founded the band as teenagers and must figure out how to keep it going now that they're in their 40's (Scott).

''THE NOTEBOOK,'' starring Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner and Gena Rowlands. Directed by Nick Cassavetes (PG-3, 115 minutes). Young love -- the old-fashioned kind that flourished before the age of the hookup -- has always been one of the most challenging emotions to portray on the screen with any specificity. Beyond the smooches, sighs and adoring glances, how do you convey the reality of a shared, private paradise? In the strongest scenes of this screen adaptation of Nicholas Sparks's treacly best seller, Mr. Gosling and Ms. McAdams break through the barrier to evoke high-strung, slightly crazed teenagers plunging headlong into first love. Against your better judgment, you root for them to beat the odds against them. The romantic drama, which spans six decades, is told in flashback as Duke (Mr. Garner), a garrulous, ailing old codger in a comfortable nursing home, reads aloud excerpts of a love story to a woman (Ms. Rowlands) with Alzheimer's disease. As the movie seesaws between Seabrook, N.C., in the summer of 1940, when the young lovers in the story meet, and the present, it is deliberately (and annoyingly) coy as to who these oldsters might be. Gosh, could they be the same young couple, still in love, six decades later? (Holden).

''SHE HATE ME,'' starring Anthony Mackie and Kerry Washington. Directed by Spike Lee (R, 138 minutes). In his flailingly angry new comedy, Mr. Lee carries his political exasperation beyond outrage into chaos. The carelessness with which the director hurls his feelings about hot-button topics onto the screen is the filmmaking equivalent of last-ditch marketing: grab everything in sight, roll it up into a big messy mud ball and hurl it against the wall, hoping that something sticks. Lashing out in all directions, the director addresses white-collar crime, the Bush administration, AIDS in Africa, the Mafia, Watergate, sex and reproduction, lesbianism and the meaning of family in a disoriented rant that lurches from one subject to the next with little to tie it together. A sex farce one minute, a crude political skit the next, an imitation ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' harangue the next, ''She Hate Me'' can't maintain its focus long enough to say anything fresh. The boilerplate polemics mouthed by stick-figure characters sound like the beery 3 a.m. debates of a college bull session (Holden).

''SHREK 2,'' with the voices of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas and Jennifer Saunders. Directed by Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon (PG, 93 minutes). This sequel revives the raucous high spirits of its predecessor, with some new characters, jokes and satiric targets to compensate for the loss of novelty. Shrek (Mr. Myers) and Fiona (Ms. Diaz), now married, travel with Donkey (Mr. Murphy) to meet Shrek's in-laws, the king and queen of Far Far Away, which is to Hollywood what Duloc was to Disney in the first ''Shrek.'' There they contend with a scheming fairy godmother (Ms. Saunders) and a swashbuckling, scene-stealing Puss in Boots (Mr. Banderas). The animation has improved, and the cross-generational appeal -- slapstick and moralizing for the kids, cheekiness and pop music for the grown-ups -- is precisely calibrated and jauntily executed. Still, the cynicism of the enterprise leaves a bit of a sour taste. The movie is too timid to risk genuine ugliness, and too crude to try for real beauty (Scott).

* ''SPIDER-MAN 2,'' starring Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco and Alfred Molina. Directed by Sam Raimi (PG-13, 110 minutes). This wonderfully vibrant entertainment -- surely one of the best comic-book movies ever -- reminds us that being a superhero is not all fun and games. The first hour is a pop art chronicle of suffering and indignity, as poor Peter Parker (Mr. Maguire) struggles with the loneliness and frustration of being an anonymous urban crime fighter. His powers are waning, he has lost the respect of the woman he loves, and even Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) seems a little disappointed in him. Meanwhile, a new supervillain, the tragic and terrifying Doc Ock (Mr. Molina), rampages through New York on mechanical arms with minds of their own. There is plenty of noise and color, and some so-so special effects, but the real thrill comes from Mr. Raimi's devotion to his hero's complex, conflicted emotional life, and to the melancholy, grown-up love story that develops between Peter and M. J. (Ms. Dunst), who comes into her own as a strong and decisive character, while still fulfilling the traditional comic-book girlfriend duties of screaming, getting kidnapped and being rescued (Scott).

* ''THE TERMINAL,'' starring Tom Hanks. Directed by Steven Spielberg (PG-13, 128 minutes). Mr. Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a traveler from a fictitious Eastern European country who spends a year stranded in the International Arrivals terminal at Kennedy Airport. What sounds like a nightmare turns out to be a soothing comic dream, thanks to Mr. Spielberg's playful virtuosity, and also to the talents of the cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, who infuses the neutral, unwelcoming architecture of the airport with soft, radiant light. The story is a bit soft: Viktor is befriended by a motley group of airport workers, bedeviled by a Homeland Security apparatchik (Stanley Tucci) and beguiled by an unhappy flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones). There is a bit too much easy sentiment and artificial sweetness, and Ms. Zeta-Jones's character is woefully underwritten. But these flaws cannot dispel the film's deep enchantment. Mr. Hanks, like Mr. Spielberg, has nothing left to prove, and the nuances lurking in his sly, genial performance emerge only in retrospect. Similarly, the movie's deepest engagement with some of the central anxieties of modern life can be found not in its plot but in its ambience. It is a visual tour de force that turns fear into optimism, loneliness into solidarity, and frustration into resourcefulness (Scott).

HEADLINE: Supporting Players in Summer's Big Show

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
EVERY summer, hundreds of thousands of people visit Woods Hole, Mass., a Cape Cod port town with secluded beaches, warm Gulf Stream waters, prime fishing and a charming main street. Typical length of stay: about half an hour.
 Some (the ones who race into town, tires screeching, lurch to a stop and jump out of their cars in a panic) are gone in five minutes.
 It's not that lovers of summer are recoiling from Woods Hole -- house prices there now average $700,000, and one opulent place on the water sold last year for more than $10 million. It's simply that most people are on the way to the pricier, higher-cachet Martha's Vineyard. Woods Hole is where they park the car and catch the ferry. 
 For years, as suburbs have pushed outward and modems have boosted bandwidth, the old appeal of getting away from it all on a far-off island has grown steadily stronger. To meet the demand, ferry operators at harbors around the country have added new services, from extra evening boats to luxury high-speed catamarans. In some places, bridges and causeways have leaped distances once conquerable only by boat.
 Through it all, those who live in the portal towns where the mainland journey ends -- like Woods Hole; St. Ignace, Mich., near Mackinac Island; Bay Shore, N.Y., where ferries leave for Fire Island; or Brunswick, Ga., gateway to the Golden Isles -- have held firm, not letting their joined-at-the-hip more glittery brethren, with their well-publicized popularity, leave them with any homeowner inferiority complex.
 Woods Hole has been a vacation destination since the mid-1800's; the property that went for $10 million last year was a 70-year-old Italian-style villa on exclusive Penzance Point. More recently, a house built in 1941 on a half-acre with three bedrooms and two bathrooms, though not near the water, was listed at $600,000. 
 The renowned Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and five other science centers impart a cosmopolitan air to the town. ''I can walk down the street and see a geologist from Japan or a zooplankton specialist from Sri Lanka,'' said Judy Fenwick, who has lived in town for four years and works as a research associate at the Woods Hole Research Center, which studies land use and global forests. ''Sure, this is a gateway community, but I've always seen it as an intellectual gateway.''
 Francesca Parkinson, the owner of Ermine Lovell Real Estate, who first came to Woods Hole 40 years ago, also touts the town's privacy. ''People can wear their Nobel Prizes around their neck to the beach without any clothes on,'' she said.
 That beach had better not be too close to the docks. Last summer, ferries carried 991,989 passengers between Woods Hole and Martha's Vineyard, according to the Steamship Authority, which operates them. The boats also carried 141,059 cars and 21,084 trucks. This translates into parking lots and harborside streets chockablock with tourists and their vehicles, putting a heavy strain on a town with just 9,000 residents even at its summer peak.
 Of course, the traffic also brings economic benefit -- jobs with the ferry company and purchases of beer or sandwiches in local eateries -- but for some, that's not enough to cancel out the annoyance.
 In the late 1990's, when President Bill Clinton was vacationing in Martha's Vineyard, hordes of tourists remorselessly parked their cars in Woods Hole driveways, on front lawns and, according to a summer resident named Dorothea Mautner, on her husband's grave. (She refused to name the cemetery, fearing that would be ''an advertisement for where to park.'') The village outlawed street parking for nonresidents, and the ban seems to be successfully shuttling the cars into approved parking lots.
 ''People here want to see very little of the Vineyarders,'' said Ms. Mautner, who winters in Newtown, Mass. She goes to the Vineyard only a couple of times a year, usually when entertaining out-of-towners. ''In Woods Hole, we care more about history than chic, whereas the Vineyard has tipped the other way,'' she said.
 SOME portal towns can't afford Woods Hole's standoffish attitude.
 In St. Ignace, Mich., a city of 2,800, about 350,000 visitors pass through each year on their way to and from Mackinac Island, a high-toned resort in the Mackinac Straits between Lakes Huron and Michigan. Millions more drive straight through town and onto the Mackinac Bridge, which soars up out of St. Ignace to connect the state's Upper and Lower Peninsulas.
 In the face of this steady stream of rejection, St. Ignace carves out its own modest living from summer tourism. The three companies running ferries to the island are critical to the economy -- most of the town's income is from ferry jobs and island hoppers' spending on State Street, where the docks are located next to rows of renovated turn-of-the-century storefronts housing bookstores, cafes and, of course, ubiquitous fudge shops. (A casino and winter snowmobilers are the other mainstays.)
 St. Ignace wouldn't mind inducing more of the pass-through travelers to stop and stay a while.
 ''We are in the middle of the Great Lakes, surrounded by federal forests and natural resources, with friendly people who say hi to each other,'' said Cheryl Schlehuber, the owner of Mackinac Properties, a real estate agency in town. ''We are trying to get beyond the fudge shops.''
 People in St. Ignace emphasize its affordability. A three-bedroom, two-bath house built in 2002 with nine-foot ceilings and a patio off the dining room is listed for $199,500, while a four-bedroom ranch-style house with a basketball court and within walking distance of town costs $195,000. In contrast, on Mackinac Island, the cheapest condos start at $200,000 while some houses cost nearly $1 million.
 Proximity, however, isn't the same as being inside the gate. Americans tend to choose a vacation destination by the social cachet of its name, according to Jon Sterngass, who has a doctorate in history and wrote the book ''First Resorts,'' which examines leisure-time activities in America in the 19th century. ''In this country,'' he said, ''you don't have titles or inherited nobility, so people want to be associated with geographic locations for prestige.'' 
 Wistful as St. Ignace may be as it looks across the water to Mackinac Island, residents are quick to defend the little town.
 ''People do come in and ask what it's like to live in a Podunk,'' said Tom Della-Moretta, who owns jewelry and furniture stores in St. Ignace and whose family has lived there for three generations. ''I say it's great.''
 BRUNSWICK, Ga., is a portal with a different problem. Never a resort in its own right, it not only watched the islands off its shores grow into prosperous destinations over the last several decades but was cut off from the main road to get to them. Highways that skirt town now connect to causeways whisking travelers to upscale beach communities like St. Simons Island.
 For the most part, Brunswick soldiers on, sustained by its deep-water cargo port, active paper mill and traditional commercial economy, as the BMW's loaded with golf clubs and Hermes luggage surge by. 
 Bruce Faircloth, a retired interior designer who has lived in Brunswick since 1962, misses the days when there was little distinction between St. Simons and Brunswick. One was simply the place where the other went to use the beach. Even though there is now a sharp divide in wealth, Mr. Faircloth wants no part of the new arrivals.
 ''We know about the materialistic attitude behind those S.U.V.'s,'' he said. ''We don't care that we're missing the party.''
 Those who linger in Brunswick can discover a shabbier, smaller version of Savannah, where Queen Anne homes clustered around live-oak-shaded squares suggest a genteel history -- a sharp contrast to the boxy luxury condos rapidly replacing the humbler cottages, made of a shell-and-cement material called tabby, that were once common on St. Simons.
 ''This is a gritty port city, a real working town,'' said Alix Kenagy, the owner of the Cargo Portside Grill, which she opened after moving to Brunswick from Atlanta in 1998. ''I will tell you, my dear, there is not a T-shirt or fudge shop in town, and I like that.''
 The historic homes in Brunswick's south end of town don't come on the market that often. That said, a Victorian on Union Street with four bedrooms, two baths, six fireplaces, and a large columned porch is listed for $234,900. For something more modern, a four-bedroom, three-bathroom home built in 1992 on Troupe Creek, with its own floating dock, is priced at $459,000.
 Ms. Kenagy spent 17 years vacationing on the old St. Simons. The atmosphere at her restaurant hearkens back to that era, and some island visitors come back across the water to experience it. ''We get younger people who think St. Simons restaurants are a little fussy,'' she said. ''Here, they can kick back and relax.''
 Far up the East Coast, in Bay Shore, N.Y., on the South Shore of Long Island, another portal town is less comfortable with its second-fiddle fate. Last year a fleet of 14 ferries took 400,000 people through Bay Shore on their way to and from Fire Island. For most of them, Bay Shore, with its colorful rambling Victorian houses, was a blur outside the car window.
 ''People who live here get annoyed,'' said Kate Hanley, a painter who lives in next-door East Islip, by ferry passengers ''speeding and throwing beer bottles on their lawns.'' At the same time, she added, ''they aren't putting fences in front of their houses just yet.''
 Residents are willing to forgive the islanders if they start spending more time and money on West Main Street, once the linchpin of a bustling shopping district but, by the early 1990's, had yielded to an adult movie theater and crack houses.
 George S. K. Rider Jr., who moved back to his childhood town of Bay Shore in 1964 and still calls it home, hopes that the restored Boulton Center for the Performing Arts, which opened in April, can lure theater fans from Fire Island for the evening. Also, one new restaurant opened in Bay Shore this summer and three more could soon as well. ''There is very little cross-pollination because the town went to hell in a handbasket when the malls came in,'' Mr. Rider said. ''But we woke it up, and the old girl is shaking her fanny a bit.''
 Currently, there is a range of homes on the market, like a seven-bedroom, four-bathroom brown-shingled not-near-the-water house on 2.2 acres for $1.5 million. Or a two-story canal-side house built in the 1960's but renovated since then, with four bedrooms, two and a half bathrooms, a two-car attached garage and its own dock, which is listed for $1.95 million.
 Some homeowners in these portal towns say they don't want to give up the practicality of being close to mainstream conveniences like stores and offices -- no matter how passed-over or pedestrian their communities may seem.
 ''There are more amenities on the mainland -- like restaurants, a mall -- and I prefer that,'' said Lenny Jaworowski, who owns the Milk & Sugar Cafe in Bay Shore. ''I would never want to live on Fire Island. It's just too much headache to get on and off.''

HEADLINE: Shares Edge Upward, as Some See Buying Opportunity

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday after better-than-expected profit at Aetna Inc. and a higher sales forecast by JDS Uniphase eased some of the pessimism that was driving the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index toward its biggest monthly decline since December 2002.
 The S. &P. 500 added 5.01 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,100.43, while the Dow Jones industrial average increased 12.17 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,129.24; a decline in General Motors stock limited the gains. The S. &P. 500 and the Dow average rose for the third straight day. The Nasdaq composite index advanced 22.80 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,881.06. 
 ''We're getting a great buying opportunity'' after the decline in stocks over the last few weeks, said Jessica Caie, who helps manage $2 billion at Cohen, Klingenstein & Marks in New York. ''The economy is in decent shape.''
 About 12 stocks climbed for every five that fell on the New York Stock Exchange, the broadest advance since June 30. Some 1.53 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 9.5 percent more than the three-month daily average.
 With one trading day left in July, the S.&P. 500 has shed 3.5 percent, while the Nasdaq has tumbled 8.1 percent after reports showed retail sales and industrial production fell in June. The Dow average has lost 2.9 percent.
 An economic report today is expected to show that the gross domestic product grew at an inflation-adjusted 3.7 percent annual rate last quarter, after a 3.9 percent pace in the first quarter, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.
 Aetna gained $5.27 to $84.25. Aetna's second-quarter profit would have been $1.70 a share excluding the release of reserves that were not needed to cover medical costs, it said. On that basis, Aetna was expected to earn $1.66 according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Thomson Financial.
 Aetna, the nation's No.3 health insurer, increased its full-year profit forecast, excluding some items, to $6.75 to $6.85 a share, from $6.60 to $6.75.
 JDS Uniphase climbed 44 cents, or 15 percent, to $3.44, for the biggest advance in the S.&P. 500. The company, the world's largest maker of parts for fiber optic networks, forecast sales this quarter of as much as $197 million, topping the average analyst estimate of $171.4 million, according to Thomson.
 All but seven of the S.&P. 500's 33 technology hardware and equipment makers gained. Cisco Systems Inc., the No.1 maker of equipment to link computers, added 30 cents to $20.80. The Ciena Corporation, the fourth-largest maker of fiber optic equipment in the United States, advanced 12 cents to $2.80.
 The Brunswick Corporation, the maker of Sea Ray and Bayliner fiberglass boats, gained $3.74 to $38.68. The company forecast 2004 profit of $2.60 to $2.68 a share, more than its earlier estimate of $2.45 to $2.65.
 ''The underlying fundamentals of companies are overlooked and are still very good,'' said Martha Pomerantz, who helps manage $6 billion at Lowry Hill in Minneapolis. ''There is a lot of buying opportunity now.'' Of the 400 companies in the S.&P. 500 that have reported quarterly results, 69 percent have exceeded analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Financial. Second-quarter profits jumped 27.4 percent, Thomson said.
 The S.&P. 500 trades at 16.7 times estimated annual earnings, down from 20 times forecast earnings in January and the lowest since May 2003.
 General Motors fell $1.37 to $42.75. The 3.1 percent drop was the biggest in the Dow average. The world's largest automaker may fall short of its 2004 profit target because of rising vehicle inventories and falling United States market share, analysts at Lehman Brothers and Goldman, Sachs said.
 United States 10-year Treasury notes rose as investors speculated that a surge in oil prices would cool the economy. The price of the 10-year note rose 2/32 to 101 12/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 4.57 percent, from 4.58 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Geneva Talks Move Toward Farm Pact

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 29 

 BODY:
Working into the early hours of Thursday, five crucial players, including the United States and the European Union, reached an informal agreement on agriculture that has put global trade talks back on track, although behind schedule.
 Supachai Panitchpakdi, the director general of the World Trade Organization, released a statement Thursday afternoon saying he welcomed the incipient agreement on agriculture, which he said gives momentum to the talks.
 With less than two days remaining, delegates and officials said that the United States in particular had made significant compromises on Wednesday night, inspiring optimism that the talks would lead to an agreement and advance the Doha round of trade for the developing nations.
 ''I think it looks good,'' said Arancha Gonzalez, spokeswoman for Pascal Lamy, the top trade official for the European Union. 
 While officials were reluctant to disclose specifics on the discussions or even describe them as an agreement, they did say that the United States seemed willing to put off some of its more contentious demands on agricultural subsidies and, instead, offer to make cuts in other areas.
 The United States had been the focus of attacks on Wednesday by some poor countries for failing to make specific compromises in agriculture. Agriculture has been so crucial to this round of talks that the World Bank has said that an agreement could add $3 trillion in benefits to the global market place.
 Attempts to reach an agreement last year in Cancun, Mexico, ended in failure. Rich countries were accused of catering to their largest commercial farmers who receive $300 billion in subsidies and supports every year to the detriment of farmers in poor countries who cannot compete against the subsidized commodities.
 However, in talks Wednesday through the early Thursday, the European Union's offer of eliminating its export subsidies was matched by an American proposal that was described as a cut in trade-distorting domestic subsidies in the first year of a new trade accord, according to officials close to the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
 If that holds, the likelihood of an agreement improves, particularly because it could satisfy the poor West African nations that have been demanding that the United States end its cotton subsidy.
 Richard Mills, the spokesman for Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, refused to comment on details of the talks, but said they were very useful.
 ''We're being realistic,'' he said after the talks that lasted until nearly 2 a.m. Thursday. ''We're not pessimistic, and we're not optimistic.''
 Australia, Brazil and India were the other three countries meeting with the United States and the European Union in a group known as the Five Interested Parties. Together they are the crucial factions that must agree if the entire 147-member party is to reach an accord this week.
 Now top officials at the World Trade Organization must assemble the compromises suggested by this group, and a handful of other blocs representing the richest and the poorest farmers of the world, and publish a text of an accord. Officials were expecting that text by midnight on Thursday.
 With an agreement on agriculture close, new questions were raised about efforts to lower trade barriers to industrial goods, especially in the poorer, developing countries. Wealthy countries argued that since they were overhauling their agricultural programs, the developing world should further open their markets to industrial goods. 
 But African delegates said that further negotiations were necessary to make this an equal trade-off.
 While most delegates met behind closed doors, several African officials held a news briefing on Wednesday singling out the United States as a barrier to a trade accord because of its cotton subsidies.
 ''Thousands and thousands of small farmers are being destroyed, their families going hungry because of the unfair subsidies of American cotton,'' said Ousmane Ngom, Senegal's minister of trade, who represents one of the four African nations that have pressed for emergency relief from what they call unfair trading practices on cotton.
 For its part, the United States has offered some development assistance from its existing aid programs. But it has been reluctant to single out cotton for deeper subsidy cuts than other basic commodity programs, which include corn, wheat, soybeans and rice, to avoid an unsettling precedent.
 The African ministers agreed to put cotton back into overall agriculture talks, but called the news conference to warn they had reached their bottom line and were waiting for a response from Mr. Zoellick and the American delegation.
 Then later Wednesday night, at least 27 countries registered their complaints that the group negotiating behind closed doors was being accorded too great a role in the talks. China, Malaysia, Chile and Japan were among the countries voicing concerns.
 China and Chile are powerful members of the Group of 20 developing nations that was formed in Cancun last year to push the wealthy nations to cut their agricultural supports.
 Japan, which puts a 490 percent tariff on rice, is an outspoken member of the Group of 10 wealthy countries that includes Norway and Switzerland. They have joined with the European Union in asking for continued protections on what they call sensitive products, a proposition that has been criticized by developing nations.
 Mr. Lamy was under pressure, as well, with European ministers gathering in Geneva to meet and assess whatever new draft text is produced. Led by President Jacques Chirac of France, several European countries including Hungary, Italy and Poland -- allies of the United States in Iraq -- were concerned that Europe had made greater concessions than the United States on agriculture and that their farmers would suffer as a result.
 But Mr. Zoellick has promised that the United States would be a leader in this round of talks and has traveled around the world to wring out a compromise, however vague, on agriculture.
 ''Although we won't unilaterally disarm,'' Mr. Mills, the American spokesman, said, ''we are committed to global reform in the W.T.O. and the United States has stated its willingness to cut subsidies and tariffs if others will.''
 Phil Bloomer, the director of Oxfam International's Make Trade Fair Campaign that has focused on European and American farm subsidies, said that the United States had to make a serious concession immediately.
 ''The European Union has said it will eliminate export subsidies and give an end date,'' Mr. Bloomer said. ''The West African nations made the concession of putting cotton inside agricultural talks. Now its up to the United States to make a similar concession.''

HEADLINE: Pataki Vetoes Bill to Raise Minimum Wage

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 29 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki vetoed a bill on Thursday that would have given a pay raise to thousands of New York's lowest-paid workers by gradually increasing the minimum wage to $7.15 from $5.15 an hour by January 2007.
 Several business groups and the state's Conservative Party chairman, Michael R. Long, urged the governor to veto the bill, which was passed last week, arguing that it would drive up employers' expenses and could cost the state jobs.
 Supporters of the measure, including labor unions, the Working Families Party, and Roman Catholic bishops, said it would help lift families out of poverty and improve the state's overall economy. New York would become one of 13 states with a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum of $5.15, the supporters said. 
 Those proponents had easily gained allies in the Democratic-led State Assembly but were blocked in the Republican-led Senate until Joseph L. Bruno, the majority leader, dropped his opposition weeks ago since his party was threatened with the loss of two seats in New York City, where raising the wage is a popular position. In doing so, Mr. Bruno bucked the wishes of Mr. Long, lost the Conservative Party endorsement, and ran counter to the eventual position of the governor, also a Republican.
 In his veto message, Governor Pataki reiterated his support for a higher minimum wage but said he would prefer that the federal minimum be raised, so that New York businesses not be put at a competitive disadvantage with those in nearby states. He suggested that state businesses would have to close or cut back, and their workers would leave for other jobs in nearby states. 
 His staff members later gave reporters a copy of a letter his budget director had sent to all 31 members of the state's Congressional delegation urging them to take up the matter.
 Mr. Pataki said in his veto message: ''All of us want to assist hard-working lower-income New Yorkers, and I believe the supporters of this legislation are undoubtedly well-intentioned. But I can think of nothing more compassionate than giving someone a new job opportunity or working to protect someone from losing their existing job.''
 But Democrats, union leaders and those who have studied the issue and come to support an increase in the minimum wage in New York, where there has not been one in more than four years, said the governor's veto was misguided and cruel to workers.
 ''This is a disgrace,'' said Dan Cantor, the executive director of the Working Families Party, which has long made a higher minimum a priority. ''The governor has revealed himself to be heartless.''
 The governor's veto returned the focus to the Legislature, where the measure passed by seemingly veto-proof margins -- 57 to 7 in the Senate and 116 to 19 in the Assembly. While Democrats, including Assembly speaker Sheldon Silver, insisted that overriding the veto would be their No. 1 priority when they return to Albany on Monday, Mr. Bruno sidestepped in a written statement, saying he would review the veto and focus on the budget impasse.
 ''I think we override,'' said Senator Eric T. Schneiderman, a Democrat from Manhattan, who said pressure would build on the Senate. ''If we don't override this, then this is an unbelievably cruel game that they are playing with hundreds of thousands of working people's lives.''
 Frank Mauro, the executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a union-backed research group, said that on its merits, the governor's argument about the loss of jobs did not hold up. He said the more than 700,000 New Yorkers who earn $5.15 to $7.10 an hour were not inclined to move to another state just for another job washing dishes, pumping gas, bagging groceries or cutting hair, which are the chief jobs that are paid less than $7 an hour.
 Assemblywoman Susan John, a Democrat from Rochester, who pushed for the increase this year, said, ''These jobs don't go anywhere.''
 Equally forcefully, opponents of the increase hailed the governor's action. Robert B. Ward, the director of research for the Business Council of New York, a lobbying group, called it a victory for struggling small businesses that would have been forced to pay additional Social Security and unemployment taxes. He said workers would actually be hurt by an increase in the minimum wage because it would endanger their eligibility for earned income tax credits, food stamps and, in some case, health benefits.
 Mr. Long said that the governor showed courage in vetoing the bill and that increasing the minimum ''hurts the people who need the help the most.'' 
 The governor struggled with the matter from the moment lawmakers sent him their bill on July 22, one aide to Mr. Pataki said. ''The governor was tortured over the decision on the bill,'' the aide said. ''He thought long and hard about it.'' 
 The governor sent a message of necessity allowing the lawmakers to act immediately on the measure, and all sorts of views were swirling about why he vetoed the bill. 
 Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky said it was a ''warning shot'' for the Senate to rein in its spending in the ongoing budget talks. Others said he was trying to add to his fiscally conservative credentials just when national Republicans are set to converge on New York for their national convention.
 Ms. John said that during the convention, the governor should take the opportunity to tell President Bush and other Republicans in person that the federal minimum should be raised. 
 In an e-mail message in response to a reporter's inquiry, an aide to Senator Charles E. Schumer noted that Democrats in Washington had been pushing for a federal minimum wage bill this year, ''but it's been held back by the Republican leadership and the president.'' He added: ''The governor ought to convince Majority Leader Frist and the president to let it pass. Otherwise he should have signed the state bill.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: August 3, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about Gov. George E. Pataki's veto of a bill to raise the minimum wage in New York State misstated the vote it received in the State Senate. The bill passed 51 to 7, not 57 to 7.

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Proposes Increase in Fares and Tolls

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

 BODY:
Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials yesterday proposed a sweeping list of fare and toll increases and cutbacks that would affect nearly everyone who drives or takes mass transit in the region.
 Most prominent among the proposed increases were changes in the price of unlimited ride MetroCards. Ending months of speculation, the authority's executive director, Katherine N. Lapp, outlined plans for a $6 increase to the $70 monthly MetroCards for subways and buses and a $3 jump in the $21 weekly passes.
 Drivers who use the transportation authority's major bridges and tunnels, like the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, the Triborough, Throgs Neck and Bronx-Whitestone Bridges, and the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, would see tolls jump 50 cents from the current price of $4. Tolls on the authority's smaller bridges, which are now $2, would rise 25 cents. Also, all E-ZPass users would be assessed a $1 a month maintenance fee. 
 Riders of Metro-North Railroad in New York and the Long Island Rail Road would see ticket prices rise an average of five percent. The cost of riding express buses, mainly between Staten Island and Manhattan, would rise to $6 from $4. 
 The measures are needed to close an anticipated $436 million deficit in 2005, Ms. Lapp said during a meeting of the authority's board. But the worst might be yet to come, she said, hinting at what could be in store in 2006, when the authority's deficit is projected to grow to over $1 billion, unless the state or the city step in to help. Riders could see the reduction of subway service during evenings and weekends, the elimination of overnight bus service on many routes and the abandonment of entire branch lines of the Long Island Rail Road.
 For 2005, the authority plans to significantly reduce off-peak bus service on three-quarters of its routes throughout the city and eliminate 164 token booths in the subways. The G line, which runs during evenings and weekends between Smith Street in Brooklyn to Forest Hills, Queens, would end at Court Square in Long Island City, Queens. Car and station cleaning will be reduced on the Long Island Rail Road and service will be cut back on less popular routes. Metro-North riders will also see reductions in cleaning and a postponing of increased service on the Mid-Harlem line after a third track is added to that line. 
 ''Quantity will be sacrificed before quality will be sacrificed,'' Ms. Lapp said. ''That is to say, we will not erode the quality of service that we're providing our riders, that they deserve and they've counted upon. If we have to make reductions, they will be in the area of quantity, not quality.'' 
 The authority will hold public hearings on the proposed budget probably in the fall, officials said. The authority's board will then vote on the budget in December, and the changes would occur some time in 2005. It is possible that the mix of proposed increases and cutbacks could change, though officials say belt-tightening will be needed. 
 While in previous years, authority officials have predicted major deficits that never materialized, several fiscal observers said yesterday that this time, the situation appears to be different, as some of the biggest costs facing the authority are built inextricably into the authority's $8.4 billion budget and are less prone to inaccurate projections.
 The authority's problems are largely being brought on by payments coming due on mountains of debt the authority issued to pay for its most recent five-year capital program, which has paid for upgrading and expanding the system. The authority had to borrow more than it ever did before in part because the state, which once contributed heavily to the capital program, offered nothing the last time around. 
 ''You can see that there are some fundamental issues, particularly in terms of growing debt service,'' said David Neustadt, a spokesman for state comptroller Alan G. Hevesi. ''It's clear they can't really count on something to magically come along and solve the problem.''
 Mr. Hevesi tried to stop the authority's last subway and bus fare increase, which took place in May 2003, accusing the authority of essentially maintaining two sets of books to justify it. It was in part because of the fallout from those accusations that the authority began releasing its budgets in July, several months earlier than before, to allow for more public scrutiny. 
 The authority also unveiled yesterday a new $27.8 billion five-year capital program, the most expensive it has proposed since its rebuilding programs began in the 1980's. The program, which would stretch from 2005 to 2009, includes $17.4 billion for simply upgrading the authority's existing network to a state of good repair. Transit advocates are united in their support for this investment, which pays for things like new subway cars and station renovations.
 ''The highest priority must be the capital maintenance of the existing system,'' said Richard Ravitch, a former chairman of the authority's board. It was under Mr. Ravitch, when the aging system was verging on collapse, that the authority first began a capital rebuilding program. ''Otherwise, the subway system and commuter rail system are going to start down the slippery slope again.''
 The new proposed capital program also includes $500 million for security upgrades and money for several major expansion projects that the authority has decided to push ahead with. They include a link that would carry Long Island Rail Road riders to Grand Central Terminal, the first phase of the long-awaited Second Avenue subway and a rail link between Lower Manhattan and John F. Kennedy International Airport and beyond. The program also includes the extension of the No. 7 line to the far West Side, a plan pushed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, but the city has promised to pay its $2 billion cost. 
 Explaining the need for the new projects, Ms. Lapp said yesterday that the transit system had remained largely stagnant for decades, even as the city had substantially changed. Many politicians have said that the projects are needed to spur economic growth in the region.
 The proposed capital program must now go to Albany for consideration by state lawmakers. A crucial question looms, however, over how the authority will pay for the program. The authority clearly cannot afford to borrow much more, officials said.
 ''The great debate will be how this need is met,'' Ms. Lapp said.

HEADLINE: Shell to Pay $150 Million In Settlement On Reserves

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, July 29 

 BODY:
The Royal Dutch/Shell Group said on Thursday that it had agreed to pay a total of $150 million in fines to settle investigations by American and British securities regulators into its reporting of crude oil and natural gas reserves. The company said in January that it had substantially overstated those reserves. 
 The agreement eases some of the pressure on Shell, the world's third-largest publicly held oil company. But Shell still faces a separate criminal investigation into the matter by the United States Justice Department, a continuing regulatory investigation in the Netherlands and several shareholder lawsuits. 
 Reserves are a closely watched indicator of an energy's company ability to produce in the future. Since January, Shell has reduced its estimate of proven reserves four times, by a total of about 23 percent, or the equivalent of 4.47 billion barrels. The uproar from investors over the reductions, and over disclosures that senior management knew about the overstatements in 2002 but tried to disguise them, led to the ouster of three of Shell's top executives. 
 The company's second-quarter results, also reported on Thursday, show a company that is struggling to improve the fundamentals of its business, analysts said. High oil prices helped the company increase net income to $4 billion, 54 percent more than the comparable quarter of 2003, but production fell 5 percent to the equivalent of 3.58 million barrels of oil a day. Shell said it expected its production to stay in the range of 3.5 billion to 3.8 billion barrels a day through 2006. 
 The underlying numbers are ''pretty horrendous,'' said Neil McMahon, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein in London, citing declining production and a low rate of reserve replacement despite record-high capital spending. Costs are also climbing: Shell said on Thursday that it expected to pay $1 more to extract each barrel of oil in 2004 than it did in 2003. 
 ''Clearly we have major challenges to address,'' said Malcolm Brinded, Shell's head of exploration and production, in a presentation to analysts. 
 Mr. Brinded laid out what he called an aggressive plan to revamp Shell's exploration and production business, generally considered an oil company's most important asset, and to cut costs. 
 Isaac Xenitides, an analyst at Fitch Ratings, said it was fortunate for Shell that its recent problems have come at a flush time for the industry. ''The high oil-price cycle gives this company enormous financial flexibility,'' Mr. Xenitides said. ''This doesn't create value for shareholders, but it does allow Shell to buy into any project that they think makes sense.'' 
 But Shell's chairman, Jeroen van der Veer, speaking at The Hague on Thursday, cautioned against pinning too many hopes on dealmaking. Shell ''will keep looking at suitable acquisitions along the way,'' Mr. van der Veer said, ''but we do not expect this to be the silver bullet when oil prices are so high.'' 
 Mr. Van der Veer said Shell was considering selling some assets, including its half-interest in Basell, a joint venture with BASF that makes polypropylene. Analysts estimated that Shell's stake could fetch more than 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion). 
 The fine that Shell agreed to pay in Britain, $:17 million ($31 million), is the largest that the Financial Services Authority, the chief British market regulator, has ever levied. The company agreed to accept the authority's conclusion that Shell ''breached market abuse provisions'' of British securities law. 
 Shell also agreed to accept a Securities and Exchange Commission finding that it had violated United States laws in its reporting, record-keeping and internal controls, and to pay the agency $120 million in fines. 
 Mr. van der Veer said Shell saw the settlements as a hopeful step toward putting the reserve issues behind it by the end of the year. 
 Legal experts said that executives involved could still be fined separately by regulators in both the United States and Britain. 
 Shell's former chairman, Sir Philip Watts, and its head of exploration and production, Walter van de Vijver, left the company after the reserve shortfall became public. Internal company memorandums indicated that the two men and other managers were aware of the problem long before investors were told. 
 ''It's entirely possible there will be fines for individuals,'' said John B. Wade III, a lawyer at Dorsey & Whitney in New York. If so, Mr. Wade said, regulators would probably try to make sure that Shell did not pay the fines on the executives' behalf. 
 Separately, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Thursday that Shell's energy trading unit, Coral Energy Resources, had agreed to pay $30 million to settle accusations that it submitted false price data to publishers. The case is part of the commission's industrywide investigation into suspected manipulation of the energy markets.

HEADLINE: With 20 Electoral Votes Up for Grabs, Ohio Gets Its Dessert First

BYLINE: By R. W. Apple Jr.

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
These are heady days for Ohio, and for your scribe, who grew up in Akron and learned his first political lessons there at the knee of Ray C. Bliss, a storied political string-puller who went on to head the Republican National Committee.
 Politics is a game of reward and punishment, and the Buckeye State has been reaping rewards at the Democratic convention this week, not after delivering the goods but for having the goods to deliver: 20 electoral votes that both parties believe are crucial -- not just important, indispensable -- to electoral victory. Something similar will no doubt happen late next month when the Republicans assemble in New York.
 Location, location? Ohio delegates are staying at a choice hotel (the Sheraton Boston, where the Democratic National Committee is housed). Ohio delegates are sitting in choice seats (right at the front of the hall, immediately to the orators' left). 
 Never mind that both Ohio senators and all the top state officers are Republicans. The convention managers gave speaking slots to three Ohio mayors; a representative; a retired senator, John Glenn; and Ohio's very own long-long-shot 2004 presidential candidate, Representative Dennis J. Kucinich. They brought on Sarah Bender of Medina, at 17 the youngest delegate at the convention, to lead the pledge of allegiance.
 A live satellite feed showing steelworkers in Canton was worked into Monday night's program. Another showing working mothers in Columbus appeared Thursday night. And Ohio was given the coveted if ceremonial honor of casting the roll-call votes that officially sealed Senator John Kerry's nomination.
 Topping it all off was a three-hour breakfast pep rally barely 12 hours before the candidate's climactic acceptance speech, replete with celebrity cheerleaders.
 Mr. Kerry's younger sister, Diana, was there. Shouting and barely pausing for breath, Mr. Kucinich made a five-minute speech in two minutes, telling the crowd, ''Ohio always makes the difference!'' Representative Sherrod Brown of Lorain, near Cleveland, said the North American Free Trade Agreement, supported by President Bush (and in 1993 by Mr. Kerry), had been ''a disaster for Ohio,'' which has lost 200,000 jobs in the last four years. Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, the convention's permanent chairman, praised Ohio as the nation's ''ethnic and economic barometer.''
 Richard C. Holbrooke, who might well serve as secretary of state in a Kerry administration, stopped by to remind the Ohioans that he had negotiated the Bosnian peace accords in Dayton, to contrast Mr. Kerry's record on Iraq, favorably, with Mr. Bush's and to put into so many words what the entire room was thinking: ''Everyone knows the winner of Ohio will be the next president of the United States.''
 Finally Senator John Edwards, the vice-presidential nominee, arrived to promise with a big smile that ''John Kerry and I will spend an enormous time in Ohio.'' But he also warned: ''We need you. We need you out working, we need you out organizing, because we can't do it without you.''
 No other delegation has attracted nearly that much star power, and the big Ohio contingent and their families, rookies and veterans alike, were all agog.
 ''It's absolutely overwhelming,'' said Marie Harf, 23, of Granville, near Columbus. ''It's like Camp Democrat -- nobody sleeps, we're all up early. We all feel like Ohio is going to determine the election.''
 Chris Redfern of Port Clinton, near Toledo, the Democratic leader in the Ohio House of Representatives, called the convention ''the spring break of politics'' and said, ''It's great to be a state that's in play.''
 In play, yes, but can the Democrats win? Bill Burga of Columbus, president of the state labor federation and a longtime power in Ohio politics, said the party was better positioned for the fall than in many a year. A new state chairman, Denny White, as well as Mr. Kerry's organizational efforts, Mr. Bush's policies and improved fund-raising have all helped pull things together, he said, ''and frankly, so has Jerry Springer.''
 Mr. Springer, the host of an often-raunchy television program, has contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the party in the last few years and raised a lot more, as an overture to a possible race for its nomination for governor in 2005.
 The Republicans, so dominant only a year or so ago, are in trouble, with federal and state investigations of financial irregularities under way. Gov. Bob Taft is so unpopular -- his approval rating in the Ohio Poll stood at 47 percent in February -- that Democratic pols are talking gleefully here about running Mr. Kerry and Mr. Edwards against a make-believe Bush-Taft ticket instead of the Bush-Cheney ticket.
 Current polls are mixed. Jerry Austin, a leading Ohio political consultant, said he expected Mr. Kerry to get ''a little bump from this convention'' and Mr. Bush to make up for that at the Republican convention. The result, Mr. Austin predicted, will be an even-steven race in the state going into the fall campaign, with the decision in the hands of the swing voters who supported Richard Celeste for governor and Bill Clinton for president but backed Ronald Reagan for president and George V. Voinovich for senator.
 One thing is sure: Mr. Kerry will not pull his ads and leave the state early, the way Al Gore did in 2000, when he lost the state by a mere 175,000 votes.
 ''No botches this time,'' vowed Allen Schulman, a Canton delegate.

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS; THE CONVENTION IN BOSTON: POINTS AND COUNTERPOINTS; THE PRESIDENT; As Democratic Gathering Wraps Up, Bush Is Raring to Go

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., July 29 

 BODY:
President Bush will begin a vigorous new phase of his re-election campaign on Friday, racing through the Midwest arguing that the nation has turned the corner in dealing with its problems and promising policy initiatives to help Americans deal with the strains of the 21st-century economy, his aides said Thursday.
 In a jab at his Democratic opponent, Senator John Kerry, Mr. Bush will call this phase of the campaign his ''Heart and Soul of America'' tour. The phrase alludes to Mr. Kerry's statement at a recent New York fund-raiser that the Hollywood entertainers who appeared there, some of whom made lewd or disparaging comments about Mr. Bush, represented the country's heart and soul. 
 Officials at the White House and in Mr. Bush's campaign headquarters said the president would deliver a new stump speech as he traveled to Missouri, Michigan and Ohio on Friday, carrying the message that the nation has made considerable progress at home and abroad and that now is no time to turn back. 
 The swing is part of the next phase of the Bush campaign after months in which it has concentrated its political efforts on trying to define Mr. Kerry as a liberal flip-flopper who cannot be trusted with the nation's security or prosperity. Mr. Bush's strategists say they now plan to set out a positive vision of where Mr. Bush wants to take the country if he wins another four years in office, though there is no indication that they intend to let up on Mr. Kerry.
 For the next two weeks, they said, Mr. Bush will emphasize domestic issues as he and Vice President Dick Cheney keep up a heavy schedule in states likely to decide the election. In the last two weeks of August, they said, Mr. Bush will pivot to national security issues, making a case that Americans are safer at home and that the United States is succeeding at spreading democracy abroad.
 After a break during the Democratic convention, the Bush campaign will begin advertising again within the next few days, campaign officials said. Mr. Bush taped two commercials while here at his vacation home this week.
 Mr. Bush has been an enthusiastic and hard-punching campaigner this year, and his heavy travel schedule for the next few days -- he will be on the road soon after dawn on Friday -- suggests that he can hardly wait to engage Mr. Kerry once the Democrats complete their convention. With the contest so tight, both sides see this as the beginning of the general election race, saying they cannot afford to view August as merely a prelude to the traditional post-Labor Day final push.
 Mr. Bush will begin talking about the economy, education, job training and other issues, calling his ideas part of a package to prepare workers for an economy that has changed tremendously and will continue to put new burdens on people, a senior White House official said.
 ''Our global economy and our economy here have changed,'' the official said. ''But our programs and our policies are from a different era.'' The goal, the official said, is to put ''institutions and programs in place that reflect the 21st-century economy.''
 To highlight its message that the economy is improving, the White House scheduled for Friday the release of its annual summer update on the budget, which will show that the deficit is now projected to be considerably lower than the administration forecast earlier this year, reflecting improved tax revenues. Democrats said the deficit was still likely to be a record, driving up the national debt and leaving future generations with the bill for Mr. Bush's tax cuts.
 Mr. Bush will put his support behind efforts in Congress to make it easier for employers to offer their workers flexible schedules as a way to address the strains on two-income families, the officials said.
 He will talk about the importance of job training and will again promote his vision of an ''ownership society'' that relies more on private initiative than government programs and promotes ownership of homes and retirement and health savings accounts, among other things, and greater personal control over health insurance, they said. Down the road, they said, Mr. Bush will again focus on his call for creating private investment accounts within the Social Security system. 
 Mr. Bush, the officials said, will use some issues to draw a contrast with Mr. Kerry. On education, he will assert that the bipartisan overhaul of federal policy for elementary education that he signed into law in early 2002 is showing results in improved test scores. 
 But the president will argue that Mr. Kerry's opposition to parts of the law, which has been criticized by many teachers and state officials as putting too much emphasis on testing and not enough on teaching, would risk giving up that progress. His aides said Mr. Bush would also suggest that now was the time to extend the same principles of clear standards and accountability being applied to the education of young children to high school students, laying the groundwork for a more detailed proposal under which states would be required to set standards for high school graduation.
 Mr. Bush has been under pressure even from within his own party to begin setting out a positive agenda. The initial ideas he is putting forward appear not to include any single bold stroke that would redefine the campaign, and they suggest that the budget deficit may have limited White House options in coming up with big or expensive new proposals.

HEADLINE: A War Against the Cities

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT. 
E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Amid all the muscle-flexing in Boston this week (''my homeland security platform is bigger than yours''), it was impossible to hear more than the merest hint or offhand whisper about the demoralizing decline in the fortunes of America's cities over the past few years.
 Paralyzed by a war in Iraq that we don't know how to end or win, we're in danger of forgetting completely about the struggling cities here at home.
 Bill Clinton mentioned the 300,000 poor children being cut out of after-school programs and the increases in gang violence across the country. And he gave cheering delegates a devastating riff on the impending lapse of the ban on assault weapons and White House plans to scrap federal funds for tens of thousands of police officers: 
 ''Our policy,'' he said, ''was to put more police on the street and to take assault weapons off the street -- and it gave you eight years of declining crime and eight years of declining violence. Their policy is the reverse. They're taking police off the streets while they put assault weapons back on the street.''
 But those brief comments were the exception. A clearer sense of the rot that's starting to reestablish itself in America's cities was offered in an article out of Cleveland by The Times's Fox Butterfield on Tuesday. ''Many cities with budget shortfalls,'' he wrote, ''are cutting their police forces and closing innovative law enforcement units that helped reduce crime in the 1990's, police chiefs and city officials say.''
 Cleveland has laid off 15 percent of its cops -- 250 officers. Pittsburgh has lost a quarter of its officers, and Saginaw, Mich., a third. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has waved goodbye to 1,200 deputies, closed several jails and released some inmates early. In Houston, police officers are taking up the duties of 190 jail guards who were let go.
 This is nuts. We know that low levels of crime and violence are essential if cities are to thrive. Tremendous progress -- in some places, like New York, almost miraculous progress -- has been made in reducing crime since the crack-crazed, gun-blazing days of the late 80's and early 90's. To even begin rewinding the clock to that time of madness would in itself be an act of madness.
 Yet that's what we're doing.
 Mayor Martin O'Malley of Baltimore, who co-chairs the Task Force on Homeland Security for the U.S. Conference of Mayors, told me in an interview that budgetary horror stories are coming in from police officials all over the country. There are many reasons, he said, including the recession and the weak recovery that followed, the antiterror obligations that have fallen to the police since Sept. 11, and ''the cascading effect'' of enormous federal tax cuts at a time when the nation is at war. Local taxes have gone up sharply, and services have had to be cut back even as federal taxes have decreased.
 ''This is all compounded,'' Mayor O'Malley said, ''by the fact that there is just less money coming in from Washington'' for traditional crime-fighting efforts.
 Local police, fire and other agencies have also been affected by the call-up of thousands of military reservists and members of the National Guard. In addition to losing their services, most cities pay the difference between the municipal salaries of these men and women and the substantially lower pay they receive from the military.
 In an address to the Democratic convention Wednesday night, Mayor O'Malley echoed many other municipal officials when he said police and fire departments are not even getting sufficient help from the federal government to maintain their antiterror efforts. The first responders, he said, cannot continue to finance their homeland security responsibilities ''with increased property taxes and fire hall bingos.''
 The crime-fighting difficulties and underfunded homeland security responsibilities are part of a parade of very serious problems that have descended on cities in recent years. Tax cuts for the wealthy and the administration's hard-right ideology have removed much of the social safety net that we managed to weave over the past several decades, leaving us with a swelling population of vulnerable men, women and children. This has had a disproportionate impact on cities, and the outlook, both short- and long-term, is bleak at best.
 These are important issues that could be wrestled with if cities were on anybody's agenda.
 But they're not.

HEADLINE: Islamic Leader to Plead Guilty in Libya Plot

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU; Christopher Marquis contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29 

 BODY:
Abdurahman Alamoudi, a prominent American Muslim leader implicated in an alleged plot by the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, to assassinate the leader of Saudi Arabia, has acknowledged his role in the plot and agreed to plead guilty to having illegal business dealings with Libya, officials said Thursday.
 Mr. Alamoudi, who is president of the American Muslim Foundation and has had access to senior officials in the Bush and Clinton administrations over the years, is expected to enter his guilty plea on Friday in federal court in Alexandria, Va., his lawyers said. He faces a maximum of 23 years in prison, but his sentence could be reduced significantly because he has cooperated extensively with the American authorities in some 100 hours of interviews about his Libyan dealings, officials said. 
 The plea agreement lays out extensive new details about the Libyan plot, including Mr. Alamoudi's recruitment by Libyan intelligence officials last year as an intermediary who funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars to anti-Saudi dissidents in London and elsewhere, officials said. A classified version also identifies Libyan officials thought to have acted at the behest of Colonel Qaddafi in seeking to assassinate Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, said officials familiar with the report.
 Some American officials remain skeptical about whether Libya ever pursued a serious plot to kill Prince Abdullah, regarding it more as a fanciful scheme. 
 The United States this year lifted economic sanctions against Libya that had been imposed because of its longtime support of terrorism. A senior State Department official said Thursday that the reported plot against the Saudis in the Alamoudi case is unlikely to disrupt the United States' delicate relations with Libya unless it is further corroborated. ''Obviously, if it were true, it would be a problem, but we haven't been able to verify the charges on our own,'' the official said.
 But the plea agreement reached with Mr. Alamoudi, of Falls Church, Va., makes it clear that American law enforcement officials regarded the plot as a serious one, officials said.
 In the past, Mr. Alamoudi and his supporters insisted that he operated strictly within the law in seeking to promote improved relations between the United States and Libya and in raising substantial amounts of money in the Middle East for American Muslim charitable causes. 
 But in his extensive interviews in recent months with American investigators, including agents from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service, Mr. Alamoudi has admitted to a more nefarious role, including his participation in the plot against Saudi Arabia, officials said.
 Officials said Mr. Alamoudi was summoned to meet with Colonel Qaddafi and other Libyan officials last August because the Libyans were upset by how Prince Abdullah treated Colonel Qaddafi at a conference a few months earlier. Mr. Alamoudi was recruited in part because he had contacts with anti-Saudi dissidents in London as part of his fund-raising work, and he was told to distribute at least a half-million dollars to them as part of a plot against Saudi Arabia, the officials said.
 In the interviews, he has admitted that he worked to enlist the anti-Saudi dissidents to disrupt activities in Saudi Arabia and to ''create headaches'' for Prince Abdullah, officials said, but he has insisted that he had no knowledge of any assassination plot. Law enforcement officials, however, said they believed that Mr. Alamoudi knew that the aim of the plot was to kill the prince.
 Mr. Alamoudi was arrested last September and charged with illegally accepting money from Libya -- in violation of American sanctions -- after he was stopped in London with $340,000 in cash. Prosecutors brought an 18-count indictment the next month and also accused him of having financial ties to Al Qaeda, Hamas and other terrorist groups. He had faced 105 years in prison if convicted on the original charges.
 Instead, Mr. Alamoudi plans to plead guilty on Friday to three charges related to illegal business dealings with Libya, failure to disclose past international contacts when he became a naturalized citizen and a tax-related offense, his lawyers say. Mr. Alamoudi was born in Eritrea and moved to the United States from Yemen in 1979.
 One of his lawyers, Stanley Cohen, said Thursday, ''The bottom line is that Abdurahman acknowledges that he was involved in a situation that was very harmful to Saudi interests, and he is extraordinarily contrite and ashamed about it, and he's conflicted and confused as to how this all came to pass.''
 Mr. Alamoudi has been criticized by some outside groups for what they saw as virulently anti-Israeli rhetoric, but embraced by many Muslims for the political inroads he has made among high-level American officials. Even now, he appears to have significant support among American Muslims, including dozens who have packed the Alexandria courtroom. 
 ''The people who know Abdurahman are definitely behind him under all circumstances,'' said Ashraf Nubani, a Washington-area lawyer who is a close friend of Mr. Alamoudi's. ''There's no doubt that this was a selective prosecution. That doesn't excuse what people may or may not have done, whether it was Abdurahman Alamoudi or anyone else, but Muslims are being targeted by law enforcement all levels of society.''

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS; THE CONVENTION IN BOSTON; ADDRESSING THE CROWDS; Political Points

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:

He Just Wanted To Have Fun
 IF the secret to a successful convention speech is lowering expectations, then the Kerry campaign performed with diabolical brilliance Thursday. 
 Robert Shrum, Mr. Kerry's chief image guru, emerged from an undisclosed secure location -- just where has the usually quotable Mr. Shrum been these last few months? -- accompanied by Terry Edmonds, the chief speechwriter, supposedly to talk up Mr. Kerry's address. But they struck terror into the hearts of Democrats with the following revelations:
 1) The candidate had written his own speech.
 2) The candidate would try to be funny.
 Mr. Kerry ''wants to have fun with it,'' Mr. Edmonds said. ''He wants to have a few moments of humor in it and lightness. So I think you will see a different John Kerry tonight.'' 
 To anyone who has listened to Mr. Kerry extemporize at length -- who among us can forget his ''Who among us doesn't like Nascar?'' remark? -- the thought of the Brahmin from Boston disdaining speechwriters and trying humor seemed odd, shall we say, for the most important address of his career. And the notion of Mr. Shrum, known as much for his rhetorical brilliance as for his managerial firmness, ceding control seemed just as odd. 
 But Mr. Shrum persisted. ''It really is his speech,'' he said, over breakfast with 60 hungry (and we don't mean for bacon and eggs) reporters. ''He wrote it longhand. He wrote it on a yellow pad. Terry and I share the capacity to read his handwriting, which is not always easy. But he wrote the speech.''
 It was easy to suspect that Mr. Shrum was simply being modest and following the speechwriter's tradition of giving the client credit. The test, of course, was in the speech.
 Sure enough, Mr. Kerry made an attempt at humor early in the speech, as he recounted his birth at a hospital in Colorado.
 ''Now, I am not one to read into things,'' Mr. Kerry told the crowd, ''but guess which wing of the hospital the maternity was in. I'm not kidding. I was born in the West Wing!''
 No, he wasn't kidding.
 Then Mr. Kerry went on to describe his mother. ''She sat by my bed when I was sick,'' he said. ''She answered the questions of a child who, like all children, found the world full of wonders and mysteries.'' He elaborated: ''She taught me to see trees as the cathedrals of nature.''
 Who among us could not suspect he did write it after all?

The Movie Star As Policy Wonk
 POOR Ben Affleck. It's so hard to be taken seriously when you're young, rich, beautiful and famous.
 The ubiquitous Mr. Affleck, by Thursday the most over-exposed John Kerry supporter in Boston, fancies himself a serious guy, someone who likes nothing more than to sit at the knee of the Democratic presidential nominee and soak up policy lessons on everything from health care to tax cuts to the war in Iraq.
 ''I have talked to him about policy,'' Mr. Affleck told us Thursday, after yet another day of chatting up delegates (including the gay, lesbian and transgender caucus -- a group Democrats did not exactly take pains to feature under their big tent during prime time) and appearing on political talk shows.
 ''Mostly,'' the star said, in that endearingly earnest voice Hollywood people adopt when they discover Washington, ''I listen to what he has to say, and I find him extremely compelling and interesting. He's the kind of guy where I say, 'Hey, Senator Kerry, I wasn't feeling very well and I had to go to the hospital a couple of weeks ago,' and he launches into this long, very well-thought-out, almost feels prepared but you know it isn't, extemporaneous talk about problems with health care and doctors being afraid of malpractice insurance and why that in the aggregate actually costs more ...'' 
 Sounds like John Kerry to us. 
 Unfortunately for Mr. Affleck, who is said to be considering his own career in politics, the Boston press is not particularly intrigued by his thoughts on health care economics. Instead, the tabloids are killing off trees by the thousands to report on the ''Afflecktion,'' as The Boston Herald put it Friday, of the would-be first daughters Vanessa and Alexandra Kerry. The paper, owned by the conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch, claims the sisters have dueling designs on the 6-foot-3, 31-year-old Hollywood hunk.
 Mr. Affleck sees a conservative conspiracy -- a take-home lesson from the convention, he said, about the convoluted nexus between media and politics. ''It's just embarrassing to me, and disheartening on a personal level, that if I get the chance to become friends with people who are interesting and whom I admire and they happen to be women, that immediately it is turned into some embarrassing prurient story full of bad puns in a tabloid.''
 He was sounding more Kerry-like by the minute. Quick, somebody call Bob Shrum!

The Best of Boston: The Honor Roll
 Best John Kerry Story: Alexandra Kerry's recounting of how her father jumped in to save her drowning pet hamster, Licorice, pulling it out of the drink and administering C.P.R. ''There were some reports of mouth-to-mouth,'' she said, ''but I admit that's probably a trick of memory.''
 Most Strategic Seat assignment: Robert Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, placed next to Teresa Heinz Kerry. Message to Wall Street: We care.
 Civil Disobedience Award: The Rev. Al Sharpton, who promised convention planners he would keep his speech to 7 minutes and then went on for 20.
 Best Red-Meat Riff: Mr. Sharpton. ''You said the Republican Party was the party of Lincoln and Frederick Douglass,'' he declared, addressing President Bush. ''It is true that Mr. Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, after which there was a commitment to give 40 acres and a mule. That's where the argument, to this day, of reparations starts. We never got the 40 acres. We went all the way to Herbert Hoover, and we never got the 40 acres. We didn't get the mule. So we decided we'd ride this donkey as far as it would take us.''
 Cruel and Unusual Punishment Award: Senator Bob Graham of Florida, who drew the assignment of following Mr. Sharpton. At least he didn't read from his diary.
 Most Relentless Self-Promotion: Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, for bringing bottles of his own brand of salsa into the hall to give to delegates, despite security regulations barring glass containers. He got special Secret Service approval.
 Worst Special Effects: The flubbed finale, when some of the red, white and blue balloons failed to drop on cue. Viewers of CNN got a special earful, when the convention's executive producer, Don Mischer, broke through, announcing, ''What's happening with the balloons, we need more balloons, we need all of them coming down.'' After Mr. Mischer uttered an epithet recently employed by the vice president, the anchor Wolf Blitzer apologized. Hundreds of balloons remained stuck.
 Best Patriotic Malaprop: Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who referred to ''the shirt heard 'round the world.''
 Best Passive-Aggressive Attack on President Bush: Former President Bill Clinton, who declared, ''Strength and wisdom are not opposing values.''
 Official Fast Food of the Democratic Party: Wendy's. Twenty years after Walter Mondale asked ''Where's the beef?,'' Elizabeth Edwards plugged it again, announcing that she and her husband would once again celebrate their anniversary there today.
 Most Creative Alibi: The Kerry campaign, for insisting that Teresa Heinz Kerry actually meant to say, ''Shove off.''
 Most Improved Performance: John Kerry, more pumped up than ever after his triumphal entrance through the crowd. Who needed a speechwriter?


CORRECTION-DATE: August 27, 2004

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Political Points column on July 30 about the actor Ben Affleck and his interest in pursuing a career in politics included an outdated reference to the ownership of The Boston Herald, which focused on Mr. Affleck's personal life -- as opposed to his policy positions -- when he attended the Democratic National Convention. Rupert Murdoch sold the newspaper to Patrick J. Purcell in 1994.

HEADLINE: Yankees Propose New Stadium, and Would Pay

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI; Dave Caldwell contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The New York Yankees will soon unveil plans to build a new $700 million, open-air stadium across 161st Street from its present home in the Bronx, according to team executives and elected officials, and the team is willing to pay much of the cost of construction.
 The team's willingness to put up so much cash reflects a significant change from the team's earlier proposals for a new stadium during the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, when the Yankees offered to pay half the construction cost, and appears to have enhanced its prospects with the Bloomberg administration. At a City Hall meeting two weeks ago, the Yankees got a relatively positive reception from members of the Bloomberg administration. 
 The team continues to tinker with the plan but intends to present a final proposal to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Governor George E. Pataki in the coming weeks. The new, slightly smaller ballpark, with about 50,000 seats and 50 luxury boxes, would be built in Macombs Dam Park, just to the north of the existing stadium, an American sports shrine. 
 The city and state would probably have to spend around $100 million, officials said. Primarily, the city would be asked to create a string of ball fields and parks nearby that would lead down to the Harlem River, north of the Bronx Terminal Market, to offset the loss of parkland in the neighborhood. The state would be asked to build a Metro-North train stop along its tracks adjacent to the field.
 The existing stadium, which opened in 1923 and has been the site of 33 World Series, would not be demolished, at least not most of it. It would be converted, possibly, to a multilevel parking garage with a soccer field on top, while retaining the ball field and the most recognizable elements of the structure. 
 The Yankees now lead the major leagues by drawing nearly 3.5 million fans a year at their aging, outmoded home, with ticket prices ranging from $8 to $95. The team's principal owner, George Steinbrenner, has long wanted a modern stadium with wider concourses, restaurants, more luxury boxes and club seating that would generate millions more in revenue and increase the value of the team. The efforts to get a new stadium go back at least 18 years. 
 The new stadium would have about 6,000 fewer seats but 39 more luxury boxes and far better sight lines, according to executives who have seen the plans. The team also saved money from an earlier proposal by eliminating a retractable roof, a feature that could cost $200 million. The proposal dovetails with a redevelopment plan for the neighborhood sponsored by the Bronx borough president, Adolfo Carrion, which includes a site for a hotel, retail shops, commercial development, a Metro-North station, an improved ferry terminal on the Harlem River and a shopping mall at the Bronx Terminal Market.
 Neither the Yankees nor city officials were willing to comment publicly yesterday on the details of the proposal, but the Yankees showed their plans to city officials earlier this month, and the team conceded that a proposal was in the works.
 ''The Yankees are continuing to plan for a new stadium,'' said Randy Levine, president of the Yankees. ''We're speaking with many people in government and in the community, but we don't have anything to present yet.''
 Mr. Carrion, who was in Boston for the Democratic National Convention, said he would soon release a comprehensive plan for the area surrounding Yankee Stadium.
 ''We've been talking to the Yankees for two years,'' he said. ''There's some pretty serious planning brewing here. We'll be able to give a full-blown presentation pretty soon.''
 The Yankees' latest proposal is a remarkable turnabout for a legendary ball club that once threatened to abandon the Bronx for New Jersey unless the city and state helped it build a $1 billion stadium on the West Side of Manhattan. It seems to take into account new political realities and the public's distaste for government subsidies for sports buildings. 
 At the same time, the team's plan is likely to provoke greater scrutiny of plans for the city and state to provide a $600 million subsidy for a $1.4 billion, 75,000-seat football stadium for the Jets and to do $187.7 million in road and rail yard work for the proposed $435 million Nets basketball arena in Brooklyn. 
 ''The most recent proposal from the Yankees indicates a sea change in their thinking, recognizing that the public doesn't want to subsidize stadiums given the city's other more pressing needs,'' said Harvey Robins, a former aide to Mayors Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins. ''As the Yankees put more on the table, I'd like to see comparable concessions from the Jets and the Nets.''
 If the Yankees proposal is adopted, the team's $700 million investment in the stadium would make it both the most expensive baseball park and the largest such investment by a professional baseball team. In recent years, as economists questioned the wisdom of public investment in stadiums that mostly enrich the owners, sports teams have increasingly been forced to pay a larger share of the stadium costs once borne gladly by cities and counties.
 Four years ago, for example, the San Francisco Giants became the first team in recent years to finance its stadium privately. The St. Louis Cardinals are building a $400 million stadium that is almost entirely privately financed. 
 Given New York's recent fiscal constraints, the Bloomberg and Pataki administrations declared that they would not pay for sports buildings themselves, although they would be willing to consider infrastructure improvements like roadwork and public transportation.
 At the end of his term in 2001, Mr. Giuliani tried to seal a deal to build new $800 million stadiums for both the Yankees and the Mets, in which the teams would pay half the cost. The Yankees would have built a new 47,000-seat stadium with a retractable roof in Macombs Dam Park and demolished the old stadium. Under that deal, the state was expected to spend $390 million on parking garages, highway improvements and public transportation for the stadiums. 
 After Mayor Bloomberg succeeded Mr. Giuliani, inheriting a recession and a city wounded by the attack on the World Trade Center, he quickly said there was no money for stadiums.
 Since then, the city backed the plan for a Jets stadium, which would also serve as an Olympic stadium if New York wins its bid for the 2012 summer Olympic Games, and the arena proposal.
 Like the Jets and the Nets, the Yankees may also ask the city to issue tax-exempt bonds for the project. The team, however, would make the annual payments on the bonds.
 Still, the state would probably have to spend tens of millions to build the Metro-North station and extend subway platforms for the new stadium, as well as make a number of highway improvements. The team's plan envisions a large, multilevel parking garage, which could be built by the state or a private owner. The Metro-North station could, however, reduce the total number of parking spaces.
 The team has also worked with Bronx officials to map out a series of parks and ball fields to replace Macombs Dam Park and sidestep potential community opposition.
 One executive who was briefed by the Yankees said the whole project was made possible by the team's financial plan. One of the most valuable sports franchises in the world, the Yankees paid about $60 million in revenue-sharing money to Major League Baseball. The league's rules allow teams to subtract annual stadium costs from their revenue-sharing obligations. So the Yankees would pay, say, $40 million a year to repay the bonds, rather than handing it over to Major League Baseball. 
 ''The team can shoulder most of the costs,'' said one person who has seen the Yankees' plan. ''The beauty of this transaction is the fact that money spent towards stadium construction is viewed as an operating cost and isn't subject to revenue sharing.''
 How would the Yankees' public react to quitting the old stadium? One fan, Paul Cisco of Long Island City, Queens, was in line for a sausage sandwich in the fourth inning when he was asked. ''I don't think it's a problem,'' he said. ''It's the times. You need to have more luxury seats, and you need to have more income. George can do it, too, even though he only paid $10 million for the team.''

HEADLINE: KERRY ACCEPTS NOMINATION, TELLING PARTY THAT HE'LL 'RESTORE TRUST AND CREDIBILITY'

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 29 

 BODY:
John Forbes Kerry accepted the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday night, pledging to ''restore trust and credibility to the White House'' as he accused President Bush of misleading the nation into war and pursuing policies that he described as a threat to the economy, the Constitution and the nation's standing in the world.
 Mr. Kerry, speaking in a convention hall that was packed shoulder-to-shoulder with delegates and other Democrats two and a half hours before he strode in, promised to take charge of ''a nation at war.'' He invoked his service in Vietnam 35 years ago as he vowed to protect Americans from terrorism in the 21st century.
 ''I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as president,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''Let there be no mistake: I will never hesitate to use force when it is required. Any attack will be met with a swift and a certain response.'' [Transcript, Page P6.] 
 But more than reinforcing his own credentials as a wartime president, Mr. Kerry used this speech on Thursday -- to what was certainly the largest audience the four-term senator from Massachusetts has ever faced -- to offer a blistering critique of Mr. Bush's 42 months in office, going so far as to echo one of the signature attacks Mr. Bush used against Bill Clinton when he ran in 2000 by challenging Mr. Bush's honesty.
 ''We have it in our power to change the world, but only if we're true to our ideals -- and that starts by telling the truth to the American people,'' Mr. Kerry said, speaking rapidly over repeated cheers from his audience. ''As president, that is my first pledge to you tonight. As president, I will restore trust and credibility to the White House.
 ''I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war. I will have a vice president who will not conduct secret meetings with polluters to rewrite our environmental laws. I will have a secretary of defense who will listen to the advice of the military leaders. And I will appoint an attorney general who upholds the Constitution of the United States.''
 For anyone watching the proceedings on this last night of the 44th Democratic convention, there could be little doubt about the urgent and complicated tasks Mr. Kerry faced as he walked into the FleetCenter: to convince the nation's voters that he could match Mr. Bush's credentials as a wartime president, that he was tough enough to use force when needed and that they should turn out a president in the middle of the war. In fact, the entire speech was built around the idea that Mr. Kerry is a more trustworthy custodian of American security than the president he wants to replace.
 In striking contrast to Democratic acceptance speeches going back a generation, Mr. Kerry's was from start to finish heavily weighted toward foreign affairs and national security, underlining the urgency Mr. Kerry sees in trying to compete with Mr. Bush on that terrain as the men fight a political campaign against the backdrop of a war in Iraq and the threat of another terrorist attack.
 Mr. Kerry saluted his audience when he walked in, and took in a hall fluttering with Kerry placards affixed with American flags, as Democrats sought with this convention to appropriate what is typically Republican imagery.
 And the gauzy introductions leading up to his arrival -- folksy and personal tributes from his two daughters, a Hollywood biographic video, war stories from one of his buddies from Vietnam -- signaled another goal of his convention: to provide a softer view of a politician whose own friends describe him as cool and distant. As Mr. Kerry came here to accept his party's nomination, he confronted polls that showed him and Mr. Bush locked in a tie, but with signs that Americans, while unhappy with Mr. Bush, were not prepared to turn the White House over to a man that Mr. Bush has sought to diminish as liberal and unprincipled.
 The speech brought an end to one of the most peaceful and united Democratic conventions in 50 years and ushered in what will be an extraordinarily busy month of politicking before the Republican National Convention in New York. Mr. Kerry heads out of Boston on Friday for a two-week cross-country bus trip.
 Mr. Bush, not wasting a moment, is heading out on his own trip to the Midwest on Friday; aides said he would use the trip to unveil proposals to help the nation adjust to the economic strains of this new century.
 Mr. Kerry strode into the convention hall just past 10 p.m., to the Bruce Springsteen song ''No Surrender,'' coming not from backstage but across the teeming convention hall itself, slapping hands with delegates before bounding up onstage on steps that had been built overnight..
 ''I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty!'' Mr. Kerry said with a crisp salute.
 He spoke for 45 minutes, at an unusually quick pace, often talking over the applause. By the end, he was perspiring, but the senator -- not known as one of his party's most accomplished speakers -- seemed relaxed and invigorated by the often ecstatic reaction of delegates.
 Mr. Bush's campaign chairman, Marc Racicot, issued a statement saying that Mr. Kerry had failed to offer ''an explanation of his inconsistencies and contradictions on the central front in the war on terror. 
 ''John Kerry missed an opportunity to help the American people understand his vote for the war in Iraq based on the same intelligence that the president viewed,'' he said. Mr. Kerry, who said on the eve of the convention that he did not want the weeklong gathering to dissolve into a forum of attacks on Mr. Bush, barely mentioned Mr. Bush by name. 
 Yet with every sentence, he sought to set out differences between the men on critical issues, and pre-empt attacks on him by the White House, and he tried to use the opportunity provided by having the first convention to set the framework for the campaign. In the process, Mr. Kerry borrowed the words of Vice President Dick Cheney; Ron Reagan, son of the late president; and even Mr. Bush himself.
 ''I want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush: In the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents,'' Mr. Kerry said.
 ''Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division.'' 
 He added: ''The high road may be harder, but it leads to a better place. And that's why Republicans and Democrats must make this election a contest of big ideas, not small-minded attacks.'' 
 Mr. Kerry borrowed from Mr. Reagan's eulogy at his father's funeral in confronting what he suggested was Mr. Bush's attempt to draw differences between the senator and the president on values and religion.
 ''In this campaign, we welcome people of faith: America is not us and them,'' he said. ''I think of what Ron Reagan said of his father a few weeks ago, and I want to say this to you tonight: I don't wear my religion on my sleeve.
 ''But faith has given me values and hope to live by, from Vietnam to this day, from Sunday to Sunday,'' he said. ''I don't want to claim that God is on our side.'' 
 He even invoked one of Mr. Cheney's favorite lines from the 2000 campaign in drawing a contrast with Mr. Bush. ''America can do better: So tonight we say, help is on the way,'' he said.
 Mr. Kerry surrounded himself on stage with symbols of military might and reminders of his own service in war. There was grainy videotape showing him, gun in hand, on the fields of Vietnam. The nation met 14 crewmates -- members of his ''band of brothers'' -- who accompanied him as he commanded Swift boats down the bullet-ridden Mekong Delta, and they heard Mr. Kerry argue that he could fight terrorism better than Mr. Bush. 
 Gen. Wesley K. Clark implored his audience to embrace Mr. Kerry. ''America,'' he said, ''hear this soldier.''
 And Mr. Kerry said that he could do a better job fighting terrorism than Mr. Bush. ''We need a strong military and we need to lead strong alliances,'' Mr. Kerry said, when it came time for him to speak. ''And then, with confidence and determination, we will be able to tell the terrorists: 'You will lose and we will win.' The future doesn't belong to fear; it belongs to freedom.''
 While foreign policy dominated much of Mr. Kerry's address, it was far from his only theme of the speech, and reflected the calculation of Mr. Kerry's advisers that he needed to at least neutralize the issue of terrorism in order to move the election debate to issues that might play better for the Democrats.
 Mr. Kerry presented himself as a the candidate of ''the middle class who deserve a champion, and those struggling to join it.'' Even as he took pains to say he had an optimistic view of the future -- again, responding to Mr. Bush's effort to portray him as dour and pessimistic -- he spoke of a nation that was suffering because of Mr. Bush's policies.
 ''We are a nation at war -- a global war on terror against an enemy unlike any we have ever known before,'' he said. ''And here at home, wages are falling, health care costs are rising, and our great middle class is shrinking. People are working weekends; they're working two jobs, three jobs, and they're still not getting ahead.''
 ''We can do better and we will,'' he said. ''We're the optimists.''
 Again and again, Mr. Kerry used his speech to try to push back on lines of attack that the White House had launched against him, such as its portrayal of him as inconsistent.
 ''Now I know there are those who criticize me for seeing complexities -- and I do -- because some issues just aren't all that simple,'' he said. ''Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so. Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesn't make it so. 
 ''And proclaiming mission accomplished certainly doesn't make it so.''
 Picking up on what had been a line of attack General Clark had used when the two were competing for the nomination, Mr. Kerry challenged the White House for trying to portray criticism of the war as unpatriotic.
 ''Tonight, we have an important message for those who question the patriotism of Americans who offer a better direction for our country,'' he said. ''Before wrapping themselves in the flag and shutting their eyes and ears to the truth, they should remember what America is really all about.'' ''You see that flag up there?'' he continued, adding, ''I fought under that flag, as did so many of you here and all across our country. That flag flew from the gun turret right behind my head..''
 ''That flag doesn't belong to any president,'' he said. ''It doesn't belong to any ideology and it doesn't belong to any political party. It belongs to all the American people. ''
 Mr. Kerry's performance drew , not surprisingly, positive reviews from an audience that was looking for him to have a good night. 
 "I think John F. Kerry is giving the best speech he has ever given, -- a true reflection of his patriotism and his life,'' said Jay C. Stoddard, 74, a delegate from Nebraska.

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS; THE CONVENTION IN BOSTON: ADDRESSING THE CROWDS; ECONOMIC POLICY; Democrats Tag Bush, Not Them, as Reckless Spender

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 29 

 BODY:
Night after night at the convention, speaker after speaker, the Democrats -- a group traditionally bearing the label ''big spenders'' -- have sought to turn the tables on President Bush by accusing him of being fiscally irresponsible. 
 In his acceptance speech on Thursday, Senator John Kerry hammered this theme, asserting that the large budget deficits that have sprouted under Mr. Bush are a symbol of economic mismanagement. Mr. Kerry contrasted the vastly improved budgetary picture under Bill Clinton with the deficits under Mr. Bush and said, ''We can do better.'' 
 ''Let's not forget what we did in the 1990's,'' Mr. Kerry said in remarks prepared for delivery. ''We balanced the budget. We paid down the debt. We created 23 million new jobs. We lifted millions out of poverty and we lifted the standard of living for the middle class. We just need to believe in ourselves -- and we can do it again.'' 
 The pounding shows that the Democrats see the mushrooming deficits, as well as the loss of a million jobs under Mr. Bush, as a major political liability that they can exploit.
 Mr. Clinton, whose budget surpluses helped undo the Democrats' reputation for fiscal irresponsibility, said of Mr. Bush's policies in his address on Monday, ''These policies have turned a projected $5.8 trillion surplus that we left -- enough to pay for the baby-boomer retirement -- into a projected debt of almost $5 trillion, with over $400 billion in deficit this year and for years to come.''
 On Wednesday night, the Democrats again hit the issue, with Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico complaining that ''the deficit is ballooning,'' pushed higher and higher by the cost of the war in Iraq.
 With some economists forecasting a deficit of nearly $5 trillion over the next decade, the Kerry strategists said they intended to hit a theme last played up in a presidential campaign in 1992, when Ross Perot used it against Mr. Bush's father, and Mr. Clinton won the White House. 
 ''Certainly Senator Kerry will continue to hammer on it,'' said Roger Altman, a senior Kerry economic adviser and a deputy Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration. ''Giant deficits like these crowd out private investment, push up interest rates and therefore suppress economic growth.''
 The issue also plays well with voters. In a New York Times/CBS News poll of 955 households in mid-July, 51 percent of the respondents said the deficit was a very serious problem, while 35 percent said it was somewhat serious. Asked which is a better way to improve the economy, 59 percent replied cutting the deficit and 33 percent said reducing taxes.
 The Democrats repeatedly say that Mr. Bush's ''reckless tax cuts'' caused the deficit, but the Bush camp says they were caused by recession, war and national emergency, specifically the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Mr. Bush has promised to cut the deficit in half within four years, but Mr. Kerry has mocked that promise. 
 ''In the last three years, the federal budget has gone from record surpluses to record deficits,'' Mr. Kerry said in a major speech at Georgetown University in April, titled, ''A Return to Fiscal Responsibility.'' He added, ''George Bush now promises to reduce the deficit -- the same promise of fiscal responsibility he has made and broken in every year, every budget.''
 He also said: ''He made long-term mistakes that exploded the deficit. He lavished tax cuts we couldn't afford on those who didn't need them. He made a clean choice: to pass the bucks to the privileged while passing the buck to our children.''
 Mr. Clinton, with the help of a tax increase and a boom, eliminated the budget deficit, going from a $290 billion shortfall in 1992 to a $236 billion surplus in 2000, the year before Mr. Bush took office. The Congressional Budget Office projects a $478 billion deficit for the fiscal year that ended last June 30 and a $358 billion deficit for the current fiscal year. 
 Mr. Kerry's advisers insist that he will do better than the president in reducing the deficit, pointing to Mr. Kerry's promise to cut the deficit in half within four years. They say his plans to eliminate tax cuts for Americans earning more than $200,000 a year will raise $860 billion over 10 years and help cut the deficit.
 Mr. Kerry also said he would bring a new seriousness to deficit reduction. He said he would adopt the pay-as-you-go policy that existed under the first President Bush, promising not to increase spending unless he proposed ways to pay for new programs. 
 But he also spoke Thursday of expensive new initiatives -- new resources for domestic security, better prescription drug coverage, new investments for education.
 The Bush campaign insists that Mr. Kerry's spending proposals would be extravagantly expensive. They point to ambitious plans like those that Senator John Edwards, the vice-presidential nominee, outlined on Wednesday, including a proposal to provide health insurance to millions without coverage. 
 Steve Schmidt, a Bush campaign spokesman, said Mr. Kerry's plan to expand health coverage would cost nearly $1 trillion over 10 years -- far more than the Kerry campaign has said it would. Mr. Schmidt said Mr. Kerry had not explained where he would find all the savings to offset such increased spending. 
 ''John Kerry is traveling around the country talking up elaborate spending proposals that he can't possibly afford to pay for,'' Mr. Schmidt said. ''We estimate that his spending plans come to over $2 trillion. He has no real plan to reduce the budget deficit, and he's not put out any type of detailed budget.'' 
 ''John Kerry's profligate spending promises will be an issue this fall,'' Mr. Schmidt said. 
 Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan advocacy group that supports a balanced budget, said Mr. Kerry's proposals to increase health and education spending would cost more than any savings that could be achieved by repealing tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. 
 ''The proposals he's making I don't think add up to deficit reduction,'' Mr. Bixby said. ''At best, it tries to keep the deficit from growing much worse. It's just deficit reduction rhetoric.''
 Mr. Altman said Mr. Kerry envisaged ways to pay for spending increases, among them reducing corporate tax breaks and raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans.
 Meanwhile, many independent economists fault both Mr. Kerry and Mr. Bush as failing to spell out how they will solve the huge financial problems expected for Medicare and Social Security in the decades to come. And Robert Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, questioned the seriousness of both candidates' plans. 
 ''Both Bush and Kerry have put forward plans that would halve the deficit in four or five years, but this is what happens under the Congressional Budget Office's baseline projections anyway,'' Mr. Reischauer said.

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS; THE CONVENTION IN BOSTON: THE CANDIDATE: VOTERS; Two Undecided on Voting For Kerry, or Even Anyone

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD, Mo., July 29 

 BODY:
Deborah Bitner, 53, and her 29-year-old daughter, Laura Dillingham, are exactly the people John Kerry was trying to talk to Thursday night.
 They are undecided about whom they will support for president in November. As middle class women, they are ripe targets for the Democratic Party. They live in a narrowly divided swing state, and they are certain they will not support President Bush. But they are not sure about John Kerry, either. 
 ''I think I've come not to trust any politician,'' Ms. Bitner said. ''I'd like to see one of them tell the truth for a change. I'd like to see one of them keep a promise for a change. And I'd like to see someone focus some interest on the quality of life in the United States.''
 They sat on a flowery sofa in the living room of their home on a narrow street of ranch houses on Springfield's South Side Thursday night. It was raining hard and the reception was a little fuzzy, the colors flickering in and out, but the sound was crisp and they had it turned up high.
 They moved from Texas two months ago to Springfield, where Ms. Bitner has a job with a hospital records company. Her daughter is having trouble finding work and hopes to hear the Democrats talk about how to help turn that around.
 They have not felt neglected since moving to Missouri. Since the state is one of this year's battlegrounds, they have been called by both parties.
 ''I've been a registered Republican my whole life, so I don't even know why the Democrats are calling me,'' Ms. Bitner said. They keep calling, though, because of what she tells them: ''I am adamantly undecided.'' 
 Perhaps they are psychic. Although she has voted for a Republican in every presidential election save one -- Jimmy Carter in 1976 -- she will not support President Bush this year, blaming him for the state of the economy and a war she considers unnecessary.
 ''I voted for George Bush in 2000, and I'll always regret it,'' she said.
 She was attracted to him, in part, for the same reason she switched parties for President Carter. ''Because they were such strong Christians,'' she said. ''I fell for that one twice, but I'm through.''
 On the face of it, the two women are prime candidates for the Republican Party. They are conservative and religious and think that most of what is wrong with this country can be traced to the liberalism and permissiveness of the 1960's.
 Ms. Bitner shook her head grimly when Mr. Kerry talked about how the 60's generation had changed America. ''That wasn't a good point,'' she said. ''They changed the world, all right. For the worse.''
 But something about the state of the country, and the flavor of this war, is altering their view. 
 ''George Bush wanted Iraq, and he got it,'' Ms. Bitner said. ''There is no connection between Iraq and 9/11, no connection between Saddam Hussein and 9/11. I know I'm not voting for him.''
 Ms. Dillingham agreed. ''Quite frankly, President Bush scares me,'' she said. ''Because of the way he's handling the so-called war on terrorism and not going after who is really involved in 9/11.''
 The problem is, they are not sure about Mr. Kerry, either.
 ''I really don't know very much about him,'' Ms. Dillingham said. 
 Ms. Bitner said, ''I'm not convinced that he's telling the truth.''.
 And she has reservations about Mr. Kerry's running mate, John Edwards. ''I'm not getting much out of Edwards,'' she said. ''He's too much like he's putting on a show.''
 But she does like one member of the Kerry team. ''There's that Teresa Heinz Kerry,'' Ms. Bitner said as Mr. Kerry's wife came on screen. ''I really like her. She speaks her mind. It just tickled me when she told that reporter to shove it.''
 Ms. Dillingham sat on the sofa, legs crossed beneath her. ''Thank you,'' she said when Mr. Kerry promised to ease the middle-class tax burden. She has not registered to vote in Missouri, but said she intended to. 
 They both nodded vigorously at one of Mr. Kerry's signature campaign lines, ''We should never go to war because we want to; we should only go to war because we have to.''
 When Mr. Kerry talked about trimming the deficit, Ms. Bitner said, ''Now, that's what I want to hear.''
 Ms. Dillingham liked what she heard. ''On everything he's saying, I'm like, I hope so, I hope so,'' she said. ''But where the rubber hits the road is when he gets in there and we find out whether he can get any of it done.''
 The question, they said before the speech began, was whether they decided they could trust Mr. Kerry enough to give him a chance.
 Ms. Bitner thought about it as Mr. Kerry's speech drew to a close. 
 ''I don't know that I trust any of them,'' she said. ''But I guess at this point, I'm thinking that I distrust Bush enough to give Kerry a shot.''

HEADLINE: India Hopes for Growth in Textile Exports

BYLINE: By SARITHA RAI

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, July 29 

 BODY:
Business is good for Dinesh J. Hinduja. In the last three months, he has added four garment units, for a total of 41 factories. And in the next few months, he says, he will add another three.
 But at a recent interview in his downtown office, surrounded by designs, swaths of fabric and clothing, Mr. Hinduja was anxious. Despite the expansion frenzy, Mr. Hinduja, the director of marketing and production for the family-owned Gokaldas Exports and two sister companies -- India's top garment exporters -- cannot cope with the escalating demand.
 ''My buyers are pushing me like crazy to grow, grow, grow,'' he said, ''but I have to draw the line somewhere, or my business will go totally out of control.'' 
 Mr. Hinduja's Bangalore-based company, which runs dedicated units for major American customers like the Gap Inc. and Tommy Hilfiger, is one of dozens of textile and garment exporters racing to prepare for the end of the global textile and apparel quota system on Dec. 31. 
 The quota system, whose ending was devised nearly a decade ago by the World Trade Organization's predecessor, has protected the textile and garment industry in the United States and Europe by limiting imports from low-cost manufacturing countries like India. 
 Under the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, the restrictions were subject to elimination in several stages over the 10-year period but the biggest impact has been left for last, and the impending end has unleashed great expectations on both sides of the Atlantic.
 ''Many U.S. companies had to move production away from India due to quota restrictions, despite strong relations with some Indian firms,'' said Marshal Cohen, chief garment and footwear industry analyst at the NPD Group, a market research company in Port Washington, N.Y. ''The end of the quota system will create an unlimited relationship.''
 The United States and the European Union have officially notified the W.T.O. that they are moving ahead with the final phase-out by the end of this year, and a coalition of American and European Union retailers has campaigned enthusiastically for the scheduled ending. 
 It continues, however, to be opposed by some powerful groups. The Bush administration just rejected a petition signed by more than 100 Republican and Democratic members of Congress, including John F. Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee, asking that the phase-out be delayed. An end to the quotas, they said, would be disastrous for the textile and apparel industry in the United States, one of the country's largest manufacturing industries, employing 702,000 people.Though Indian garment and textile makers are crossing their fingers for all to go as planned, recognition of the stiff competition from China and the fragmented state of India's textile and garment industry is tempering the optimism a bit.
 Still, it is hard for Indians not to hope too much when the prospects seem so grand. Under the current W.T.O. agreement, annual quotas to the United States and the European Union fill up months in advance, with limits on clothing like jeans, T-shirts and sweaters as well as on fabrics.
 ''Quotas have been the biggest hurdle for growth,'' said A. Sakthivel, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council, India's government-sponsored trade body, and chairman of the Poppys Group, companies with interests in spinning, dyeing and knitwear exports. 
 According to a recent study by the McKinsey & Company consulting firm, India's $15 billion garment and textile exports industry could increase its global market share from the current 4 percent to 6.5 percent by 2008. The study said India could be the biggest winner after China, whose textile exports are four times that of India's, in the $248 billion global market. 
 Currently, the Indian textile and garment industry -- some 20,000 garment makers and thousands of textile units employing 35 million people -- accounts for nearly 4 percent of India's gross domestic product and about one-quarter of the country's total export earnings.
 The end of the quota system may prompt large global brands to look at countries like India as markets as well as sources. Such changes ''open new market opportunities for our products,'' said Peggy Carter, vice president for corporate affairs at the Sara Lee Corporation's Branded Apparel unit, whose brands include Hanes and Playtex. ''We are watching with interest as India develops and its commercial potential grows.''
 India's garment and textile exporters are hoping to grab new opportunities right away. ''Quotas prevented us from expanding our markets,'' said Mr. Hinduja of Gokaldas Exports, ''but now the floodgates are open.'' Gokaldas Exports and its two sister companies recorded combined exports worth $140 million in the year that ended in March, and is expecting that to grow 30 percent annually in the next few years.
 Arvind Mills, the world's fourth-largest denim maker, is also in major expansion mode. The company, based in the southwestern city of Ahmedabad, has $350 million in annual revenues and customers like Levi's and Eddie Bauer. It is setting up a factory in Bangalore that will manufacture for export, almost entirely to the United States, six million pairs of jeans and 1.5 million other pairs of pants a year, the company's first foray into such garments.
 Until now, the total number of these garments -- known in the trade as jeans and bottom wear -- that India could export to the United States was nine million pieces.
 Arvind Mills, the flagship company of the Lalbhai Group, has also increased its export capacity for woven tops, a category that includes shirts, from 1.7 million pieces to 4.5 million pieces this year. 
 ''In 2005, we expect to grow further, as the market potential is enormous,'' said V. Sridhar, head of garment exports at Arvind Mills.
 Smaller companies are consolidating, upgrading their plants and building capacities. ''Everybody wants to scale up,'' said R. Krishna Kumar, managing director of Integra Apparels, the new apparel export division of Piramal Enterprises, a $500 million Mumbai-based industrial group that is seeking to expand its textile making business by branching out into apparel exports.
 In fact, said Arvind K. Singhal, chairman of the retail consultancy KSA Technopak, ''We are beginning to see big investments at all stages of the textile supply chain, starting from fabric manufacturing to fabric processing to apparel making.''
 Even as they grow and shift, though, many Indian garment exporters fear that China, their highly competitive neighbor, will grab an even bigger share of the market. Both countries have abundant raw materials, cheap labor and entrepreneurial skills. But for buyers looking for large runs and economies of scale, China's huge factories and sheer volume of low-cost production are unmatched.
 ''China might well become the monopoly, if we don't ramp up speedily,'' said Kannan Ramachandran, managing director of the Bangalore-based Fashion Fabricators, a buyer for global retailers, after a visit to China's textile hub, Guangzhou, to size up the competition. 
 China's range of products is much bigger than India's. According to Mr. Singhal, the consultant, ''India's product basket for exports is rather narrow, and the supply base highly fragmented, so that scaling up to supply larger volumes can be a challenge for most exporters.''
 The Indian government had long been a stumbling block to the expansion of India's textile and garment industry. Until four years ago, it provided incentives like tax exemptions and special interest rates to small apparel units, thus discouraging investment in large machinery and the creation of more capacity. 
 ''Some companies had separate little shacks for cutting, sewing, and finishing,'' said Mr. Kumar of Integra Apparels.
 Labor laws remain unfavorable. Garment makers are not permitted to hire and fire according to seasonal needs, and in most parts of the country, women are not allowed to work the overnight shift.
 Still, India's factories offer the flexibility of short runs and quick turnarounds. The country's strength is in cotton, with surplus production and a large, vertically integrated industry, from yarn making to garment making. 
 But there is a lot of catching up to do. The federal government has set a textile and apparel export goal of $50 billion annually by 2010, though some industry experts say the gains for Indian exporters may become obvious only after a couple of years. 
 Several states are setting up apparel export parks and providing incentives to garment makers. In Tirupur, a knitwear production hub in southern India, a 200-acre apparel park to house more than 50 knitwear exporters has arisen. 
 ''Once we get our act together, there is no stopping India,'' said Mr. Sakthivel, whose company, Poppys Knit Wear, has customers like Sara Lee and Polo Ralph Lauren.

HEADLINE: Kerry's Acceptance: 'There Is a Right Way and a Wrong Way to Be Strong'

 BODY:
Following is Senator John Kerry's speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination last night in Boston, as recorded by The New York Times:
 I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty.
 We are here tonight because we love our country. We're proud of what America is and what it can become. 
 My fellow Americans, we're here tonight united in one purpose: to make America stronger at home and respected in the world. 
 A great American novelist wrote that you can't go home again. He could not have imagined this evening. Tonight, I am home. Home where my public life began and those who made it possible live. Home where our nation's history was written in blood, idealism and hope. Home where my parents showed me the values of family, faith and country. Thank you. Thank you, all of you, for a welcome home I will never forget. 
 I wish my parents could share this moment. They went to their rest in the last few years. But their example, their inspiration, their gift of open eyes, and open mind, and endless heart, and world that doesn't have an end are bigger and more lasting than any words.
 I was born, as some of you saw in the film, in Fitzsimmons Army Hospital in Colorado, when my dad was a pilot in World War II. Now, I'm not one to read into things, but guess which wing of the hospital the maternity ward was in? I'm not kidding. I was born in the West Wing.
 My mother was the rock of our family as so many mothers are. She stayed up late to help me with my homework. She sat by my bed when I was sick. She answered the questions of a child who, like all children, found the world full of wonders and mysteries.
 She was my den mother when I was a Cub Scout and she was so proud of her 50-year pin as a Girl Scout leader. She gave me her passion for the environment. She taught me to see trees as the cathedrals of nature. And by the power of her example, she showed me that we can and must complete the march towards full equality for all women in the United States of America.
 My dad did the things that a boy remembers. He gave me my first model airplane, my first baseball mitt, my first bicycle. He also taught me that we are here for something bigger than ourselves. He lived out the responsibilities and sacrifices of the greatest generation to whom we owe so much.
 And when I was a young man, he was in the State Department, stationed in Berlin when it and the world were divided between democracy and communism. I have unforgettable memories of being a kid mesmerized by the British, French and American troops, each of them guarding their own part of the city -- and Russians standing guard on that stark line separating East from West. On one occasion, I rode my bike into Soviet East Berlin. And when I proudly told my dad, he promptly grounded me.
 But what I learned has stayed with me for a lifetime. I saw how different life was on different sides of the same city. I saw the fear in the eyes of people who were not free. I saw the gratitude of people towards the United States for all that we had done. I felt goose bumps as I got off a military train and I heard the Army band strike up ''Stars and Stripes Forever.'' I learned what it meant to be America at our best. I learned the pride of our freedom. And I am determined now to restore that pride to all who look to America.
 Mine were ''greatest generation'' parents. And as I thank them, we all join together to thank a whole generation for making America strong, for winning World War II, winning the cold war, and for the great gift of service which brought America 50 years of peace and prosperity.
 My parents inspired me to serve. And when I was in high school, a junior, John Kennedy called my generation to service. It was the beginning of a great journey -- a time to march for civil rights, for voting rights, for the environment, for women, for peace. We believed we could change the world. And you know what? We did.
 But we're not finished. The journey isn't complete. The march isn't over. The promise isn't perfected. Tonight, we're setting out again. And together, we're going to write the next great chapter of America's story.
 We have it in our power to change the world. But only if we're true to our ideals -- and that starts by telling the truth to the American people. As president, that is my first pledge to you tonight. As president, I will restore trust and credibility to the White House.
 I ask you to judge me by my record. As a young prosecutor, I fought for victim's rights and made prosecuting violence against women a priority. When I came to the Senate, I broke with many in my own party to vote for a balanced budget because I thought it was the right thing to do. I fought to put 100,000 police officers on the streets of America.
 And then I reached out across the aisle with John McCain to work to find the truth about our P.O.W.'s and missing in action and to finally make peace in Vietnam.
 I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war. I will have a vice president who will not conduct secret meetings with polluters to rewrite our environmental laws. I will have a secretary of defense who will listen to the advice of the military leaders. And I will appoint an attorney general who will uphold the Constitution of the United States.
 My fellow Americans, this is the most important election of our lifetime. The stakes are high. We are a nation at war -- a global war on terror against an enemy unlike we've ever known before. And here at home, wages are falling, health care costs are rising and our great middle class is shrinking. People are working weekends, two jobs, three jobs -- and they're still not getting ahead.
 We're told that outsourcing jobs is good for America. We're told that jobs that pay $9,000 less than the jobs that have been lost is the best that we can do. They say this is the best economy that we've ever had. And they say anyone who thinks otherwise is a pessimist. Well, here is our answer: There is nothing more pessimistic than saying that America can't do better.
 We can do better. We can do better and we will. We're the optimists. For us, this is a country of the future. We're the can-do people. And let's not forget what we did in the 1990's. We balanced the budget. We paid down the debt. We created 23 million new jobs. We lifted millions out of poverty and we lifted the standard of living for the middle class. We just need to believe in ourselves and we can do it again.
 So tonight, in the city where America's freedom began -- only a few blocks from where the sons and daughters of liberty gave birth to our nation -- here tonight, on behalf of a new birth of freedom, on behalf of the middle class who deserve a champion and those struggling to join it who deserve a fair shot, for the brave men and women in uniform who risk their lives and for their families who pray for their return, for all those who believe that our best days are ahead of us, with great faith in the American people, I accept your nomination for president of the United States.
 I am proud that at my side will be a running mate whose life is the story of the American dream and who's worked every day to make that dream real for all Americans, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina and his wife Elizabeth and their family. Thank you. This son of a millworker is ready to lead and next January, Americans will be proud to have a fighter for the middle class to succeed Dick Cheney as vice president of the United States.
 And what can I say about Teresa? She has the strongest moral compass of anyone I know. She's down to earth, nurturing, courageous, wise and smart. She speaks her mind and she speaks the truth, and I love her for that, too. And that's why America will embrace her as the next first lady of the United States.
 For Teresa and me, no matter what the future holds or the past has given us, nothing will ever mean as much as our children, as you could sense listening to them. We love them not just for who they are and what they've become, but for being themselves, making us laugh, holding our feet to the fire and never letting me get away with anything. Thank you, Andre, Alex, Chris, Vanessa and John.
 And in this journey, I am accompanied by an extraordinary band of brothers led by that American hero, a patriot called Max Cleland. Our band of brothers doesn't march because of who we are as veterans, but because of what we learned as soldiers. We fought for this nation because we loved it and we came back with the deep belief that every day is extra. We may be a little older, we may be a little grayer, but we still know how to fight for our country.
 And standing with us in that fight are those who shared with me the long season of the primary campaign: Carol Moseley Braun, Gen. Wesley Clark, Howard Dean, Dick Gephardt, Bob Graham, Dennis Kucinich, Joe Lieberman, Al Sharpton. To all of you, I say thank you for teaching me and testing me, but mostly, we say thank you for standing up for our country and for giving us the unity to move America forward.
 My fellow Americans, the world tonight is very different from the world of four years ago. But I believe the American people are more than equal to the challenge. Remember the hours after Sept. 11, when we came together as one to answer the attack against our homeland. We drew strength when our firefighters ran up stairs and risked their lives, so that others might live. When rescuers rushed into smoke and fire at the Pentagon. When the men and women of Flight 93 sacrificed themselves to save our nation's capital. When flags were hanging from front porches all across America, and strangers became friends. It was the worst day we have ever seen, but it brought out the best in all of us.
 I am proud that after Sept. 11 all our people rallied to President Bush's call for unity to meet the danger. There were no Democrats. There were no Republicans. There were only Americans. And how we wish it had stayed that way.
 Now I know that there are those who criticize me for seeing complexities, and I do, because some issues just aren't all that simple. Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so. Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesn't make it so. And proclaiming mission accomplished certainly doesn't make it so.
 As president, I will ask the hard questions and demand hard evidence. I will immediately reform the intelligence system so policy is guided by facts, and facts are never distorted by politics. And as president, I will bring back this nation's time-honored tradition: The United States of America never goes to war because we want to, we only go to war because we have to. That is the standard of our nation.
 I know what kids go through when they are carrying an M-16 in a dangerous place and they can't tell friend from foe. I know what they go through when they're out on patrol at night and they don't know what's coming around the next bend. I know what it's like to write letters home telling your family that everything's all right when you're just not sure that that's true.
 As president, I will wage this war with the lessons I learned in war. Before you go to battle, you have to be able to look a parent in the eye and truthfully say: ''I tried everything possible to avoid sending your son or daughter into harm's way. But we had no choice. We had to protect the American people, fundamental American values against a threat that was real and imminent.'' So lesson number one, this is the only justification for going to war.
 And on my first day in office, I will send a message to every man and woman in our armed forces: You will never be asked to fight a war without a plan to win the peace.
 I know what we have to do in Iraq. I know what we have to do in Iraq. We need a president who has the credibility to bring our allies to our side and share the burden, reduce the cost to American taxpayers, reduce the risk to American soldiers. That's the right way to get the job done and bring our troops home.
 Here is the reality: That won't happen until we have a president who restores America's respect and leadership so we don't have to go it alone in the world. 
 And we need to rebuild our alliances, so we can get the terrorists before they get us. 
 I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as president. Let there be no mistake: I will never hesitate to use force when it is required. Any attack will be met with a swift and a certain response. I will never give any nation or any institution a veto over our national security. And I will build a stronger military. We will add 40,000 active duty troops -- not in Iraq, but to strengthen American forces that are now overstretched, overextended and under pressure. We will double our special forces to conduct antiterrorist operations. And we will provide our troops with the newest weapons and technology to save their lives and win the battle. And we will end the backdoor draft of the National Guard and reservists.
 To all who serve in our armed forces today I say help is on the way.
 As president I will fight a smarter, more effective war on terror. We will deploy every tool in our arsenal -- our economic as well as our military might; our principles as well as our firepower. 
 In these dangerous days, there is a right way and a wrong way to be strong. Strength is more than tough words. After decades of experience in national security I know the reach of our power and I know the power of our ideals.
 We need to make America once again a beacon in the world. We need to be looked up to, not just feared. 
 We need to lead a global effort against nuclear proliferation, to keep the most dangerous weapons in the world out of the most dangerous hands in the world. 
 We need a strong military. And we need to lead strong alliances. And then, with confidence and determination, we will be able to tell the terrorists: You will lose and we will win. The future doesn't belong to fear; it belongs to freedom. 
 And the front lines of this battle are not just far away, they're right here on our shores. They're at our airports and potentially in any city or town. Today our national security begins with homeland security. The 9/11 Commission has given us a path to follow, endorsed by Democrats, Republicans and the 9/11 families. As president, I will not evade or equivocate, I will immediately implement all the recommendations of that commission. We shouldn't be letting 95 percent of our container ships come into our ports without ever being physically inspected. We shouldn't be leaving nuclear and chemical plants without enough protection. And we shouldn't be opening firehouses in Baghdad and shutting them in the United States of America. 
 And tonight we have an important message for those who question the patriotism of Americans who offer a better direction for our country. Before wrapping themselves in the flag and shutting their eyes to the truth and their ears, they should remember what America is really all about. They should remember the great idea of freedom for which so many have given their lives. Our purpose now is to reclaim our democracy itself. We are here to affirm that when Americans stand up and speak their minds and say America can do better, that is not a challenge to patriotism, it is the heart and soul of patriotism. 
 You see that flag up there. We call her Old Glory. The Stars and Stripes forever. I fought under that flag, as did so many of those people who are here tonight and all across the country. That flag flew from the gun turret right behind my head. And it was shot through and through and tattered, but it never ceased to wave in the wind. It draped the caskets of men that I served with and friends I grew up with. For us that flag is the most powerful symbol of who we are and what we believe in. Our strength. Our diversity. Our love of country. All that makes America both great and good. 
 That flag doesn't belong to any president. It doesn't belong to any ideology. It doesn't belong to any party. It belongs to all the American people. 
 My fellow citizens, elections are about choices. And choices are about values. In the end it's not just policies and programs that matter. The president who sits at that desk must be guided by principle. 
 For four years we've heard a lot of talk about values. But values spoken without actions taken are just slogans. Values are not just words. Values are what we live by. They're about the causes that we champion and the people that we fight for. And it's time for those who talk about family values to start valuing families. 
 You don't value families by kicking kids out of after-school programs and taking cops off the streets so that Enron can get another tax break. 
 We believe in the family value of caring for our children and protecting the neighborhoods where they walk and they play. 
 And that is the choice in this election. 
 You don't value families by denying real prescription-drug coverage to seniors so big drug companies can get another windfall profit. 
 We believe in the family value expressed in one of the oldest commandments: ''Honor thy father and thy mother.'' As president, I will not privatize Social Security. I will not cut benefits. And together we will make sure that senior citizens never have to cut their pills in half because they can't afford life-saving medicine. 
 And that is the choice in this election.
 You don't value families if you force them to take up a collection to buy body armor for a son or daughter in the service, if you deny veterans health care or if you tell middle-class families to wait for a tax cut so the wealthiest among us can get even more.
 We believe in the value of doing what's right for everyone in the American family. 
 And that is the choice in this election. 
 We believe that what matters most is not narrow appeals masquerading as values, but the shared values that show the true face of America. Not narrow values that divide us, but the shared values that unite us -- family, faith, hard work, opportunity and responsibility for all -- so that every child, every adult, every parent, every worker in America has an equal shot at living up to their God-given potential. That is the American dream and the American value.
 What does it mean in America today when Dave McCune, a steel worker that I met in Canton, Ohio, saw his job sent overseas and the equipment in his factory was literally unbolted, crated up, and shipped thousands of miles away along with that job? What does it mean when workers I've met have had to train their foreign replacements? America can do better. And tonight we say: Help is on the way.
 What does it mean when Mary Ann Knowles, a woman with breast cancer that I met in New Hampshire, had to keep working day after day through her chemotherapy, no matter how sick she felt, because she was terrified of losing her family's health insurance. America can do better. And help is on the way.
 What does it mean when Deborah Kromins from Philadelphia, Pa., works and she saves all her life and finds out that her pension has disappeared into thin air and the executive who looted it has bailed out on a golden parachute? America can do better. And help is on the way.
 What does it mean when 25 percent of our children in Harlem have asthma because of air pollution? We can do better. America can do better. And help is on the way.
 What does it mean when people are huddled in blankets in the cold, sleeping in Lafayette Park on the doorstep of the White House itself, and the number of families living in poverty has risen by three million in the last four years? America can do better. And help is on the way.
 And so we come here tonight to ask: Where is the conscience of our country? I'll tell you where it is. I'll tell you where it is. It's in rural and small-town America; it's in urban neighborhoods and the suburban main streets; it's alive in the people that I've met in every single part of this land. It's bursting in the hearts of Americans who are determined to give our values and our truth back to our country. 
 We value jobs that actually pay you more than the job that you lost. We value jobs where, when you put in a week's work, you can actually pay your bills, provide for your children, lift up the quality of your life. We value an America where the middle class is not being squeezed, but doing better. 
 So here is our economic plan to build a stronger America: 
 First, new incentives to revitalize manufacturing. 
 Second, investment in technology and innovation that will create the good-paying jobs of the future. 
 Third, close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas. Instead, we will reward companies that create and keep good paying jobs where they belong, in the good old U.S.A. We value an America that exports products, not jobs. And we believe American workers should never have to subsidize the loss of their own job. 
 Next, we will trade and we will compete in the world. But our plan calls for a fair playing field. Because if you give the American worker a fair playing field, there's no one in the world that the American worker can't compete against. 
 And we're going to return to fiscal responsibility because it is the foundation of our economic strength. Our plan will cut the deficit in half in four years by ending tax giveaways that are nothing more than corporate welfare. And will make government live by the rule that every family has to live by: Pay as you go. 
 And let me tell you what we won't do. We won't raise taxes on the middle class. You've heard a lot of false charges about this in recent months. So let me say straight out what I will do as president: I will cut middle-class taxes. I will reduce the tax burden on small business. And I will roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals who make over $200,000 a year, so we can invest in health care, education and job creation. 
 Our education plan for a stronger America sets high standards and it demands accountability from parents, teachers and schools. It provides for smaller class sizes and it treats teachers like the professionals that they are. And it gives a tax credit to families for each and every year of college.
 When I was a prosecutor, I met young kids who were in trouble, abandoned, all of them, by adults. And as president, I am determined that we stop being a nation content to spend $50,000 a year to send a young person to prison for the rest of their life when we could invest $10,000 a year in Head Start, Early Start, Smart Start, a real start to the lives of our children. 
 And we value health care that's affordable and accessible for all Americans. Since 2000, four million people have lost their health insurance. Millions more are struggling to afford it. You know what's happening. Your premiums, your co-payments, your deductibles have all gone through the roof.
 Our health care plan for a stronger America cracks down on the waste and the greed and the abuse in our health care system. And it will save families $1,000 a year on premiums. You'll get to pick your own doctor. And patients and doctors, not insurance company bureaucrats, will make medical decisions. Under our health care plan, Medicare will negotiate lower drug prices for seniors. And all Americans will be able to buy less expensive prescription drugs from countries like Canada. 
 The story of people struggling for health care is the story of so many Americans. But you know what, it's not the story of senators and members of Congress. Because we give ourselves great health care and you get the bill. Well, I'm here to say tonight, your family's health care is just as important as any politician's in Washington, D.C.
 And when I am president, we will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy and the connected and the elected -- it is a right for all Americans. And we will make it so.
 We value an America that controls its own destiny because it's finally and forever independent of Mideast oil. What does it mean for our economy and our national security when we have only 3 percent of the world's oil reserves, yet we rely on foreign countries for 53 percent of what we consume? 
 I want an America that relies on its ingenuity and innovation, not the Saudi royal family. 
 And our energy plan for a stronger America, our energy plan will invest in new technologies and alternative fuels and the cars of the future, so that no young American in uniform will ever be held hostage to our dependence on oil from the Middle East.
 I've told you about our plans for the economy, for education, for health care, for energy independence. I want you to know more about them. So now I'm going to say something that Franklin Roosevelt could never have said in his acceptance speech: Go to johnkerry.com.
 I want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush. In the weeks ahead let's be optimists, not just opponents. Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division. Let's honor this nation's diversity. Let's respect one another. And let's never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in American history, the Constitution of the United States. 
 My friends, the high road may be harder but it leads to a better place. And that's why Republicans and Democrats must make this election a contest of big ideas, not small-minded attacks. This is our time to reject the kind of politics calculated to divide race from race, region from region, group from group. Maybe some just see us divided into those red states and blue states, but I see us as one America -- red, white and blue. And when I am president, the government I will lead will enlist people of talent, Republicans as well as Democrats, to find the common ground, so that no one who has something to contribute to our nation will be left on the sidelines.
 And let me say it plainly: In that cause, and in this campaign, we welcome people of faith. America is not us and them. I think of what Ron Reagan said of his father a few weeks ago and I want to say this to you tonight: I don't wear my religion on my sleeve. But faith has given me values and hope to live by, from Vietnam to this day, from Sunday to Sunday. I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side. 
 And whatever our faith, one belief should bind us all: The measure of our character is our willingness to give of ourselves for others and for our country.
 These aren't Democratic values. These aren't Republican values. They're American values. We believe in them. They're who we are. And if we honor them, if we believe in ourselves, we can build an America that is stronger at home and respected in the world. 
 So much promise stretches before us. Americans have always reached for the impossible, looked to the next horizon and asked: What if? 
 Two young bicycle mechanics from Dayton asked, what if this airplane could take off at Kitty Hawk? It did that and changed the world forever. A young president asked, what if we could go to the moon in 10 years? And now we're exploring the stars and the solar system themselves. A young generation of entrepreneurs asked, what if we could take all the information in a library and put it on a chip the size of a fingernail? We did that and that too changed the world.
 And now it's our time to ask: What if? 
 What if we find a breakthrough to Parkinson's, diabetes, Alzheimer's and AIDS? What if we have a president who believes in science so we can unleash the wonders of discovery like stem-cell research and treat illness for millions of lives? 
 What if we do what adults should do and make sure that all of our children are safe in the afternoons after school? What if we have a leadership that's as good as the American dream, so that bigotry and hatred never again steal the hope or future of any American?
 I learned a lot about these values on that gunboat patrolling the Mekong Delta with Americans, you saw them, who come from places as different as Iowa and Oregon, Arkansas, Florida, California. No one cared where we went to school. No one cared about our race or our backgrounds. We were literally all in the same boat. We looked out, one for the other. And we still do. 
 That is the kind of America that I will lead as president, an America where we are all in the same boat. 
 Never has there been a moment more urgent for Americans to step up and define ourselves. I will work my heart out. But my fellow citizens, the outcome is in your hands more than mine. 
 It is time to reach for the next dream. It is time to look to the next horizon. For America, the hope is there, the sun is rising. Our best days are still to come. 
 Thank you. Goodnight. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.

HEADLINE: Losses Increase as Cash Decreases, Straining Trump's Casinos

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts Inc., the flagship of Donald J. Trump's debt-laden casino holdings, reported increased losses for the second quarter and a dwindling supply of cash yesterday, leaving the struggling company in an increasingly perilous financial position.
 Beginning with Memorial Day weekend, the summer season typically is the most lucrative for casino companies because more people are on vacation and looking to gamble. But Trump Hotels lost $17.6 million, or 59 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $10 million, or 46 cents a share, in the same quarter last year.
 More ominously, Trump Hotels' cash reserves -- which it needs to help reduce its $1.8 billion in debts -- are shrinking. The company says it has $81.1 million on hand, down from $124.3 million in the first quarter of the year. 
 Trump Hotels had $106 million in cash on hand at the end of the second quarter last year.
 Although Mr. Trump enjoyed a star turn as a business guru on the hit television show ''The Apprentice,'' his casino company has never been profitable since going public in 1995. Trump Hotels, with casinos concentrated in Atlantic City, has been flirting with bankruptcy protection this year, scrambling to make a last-minute, $73.1 million debt payment in May. A similar payment is due in November.
 Trump Hotels is talking with its bondholders about restructuring its debts, two people briefed on the negotiations say. One plan under consideration involves a $400 million cash infusion from the Credit Suisse Group that would greatly reduce Mr. Trump's equity stake in the company and force him to step aside as chief executive.
 Bondholders would also have to accept a loss for the deal to go through. 
 ''It's been a multidimensional chess game,'' said one of the people who had been briefed on the talks. ''If you think about the complexities, with all the different groups, pulling them all together hasn't been quick.''
 Addressing his company's slumping profits, Mr. Trump said in an interview that rising gas prices had cut into gamblers' budgets in the second quarter. ''Maybe the high rollers won't use their jets,'' he said. ''For people who drive their automobiles, it certainly has a an impact on the amount of money they have when they reach their destinations.''
 More important, he said that his company's earnings were hurt by gamblers who were winning more money than usual. Trump Hotels said in a news release that the ''hold percentage'' at its table games, a measure of how much money a casino rakes in from losing gamblers, fell substantially in the quarter.
 ''We consider ourselves to be very open to having people win,'' Mr. Trump said. ''It's bad for me but it brings other people. It can even out over the course of a year.''
 Scott C. Butera, executive vice president of Trump Hotels, said that unusually lucky gamblers, combined with broader economic factors, ''all played a role'' in undermining the company's performance, particularly in May and June. He said he was surprised by the downturn in those months but declined to comment on the company's performance so far in July. While noting that other Atlantic City casinos were also experiencing a weaker summer, Mr. Butera acknowledged that Trump Hotels' challenges remain greater than most because of its anemic finances.
 ''Other companies have more capital and a better ability to market,'' he said. ''It's a question of how many resources you have to work with.''
 Mr. Trump said that he expected his casinos to perform better in July and August because late summer is typically Atlantic City's busiest season. But the long-term prospects of Trump Hotels remain doubtful. Pennsylvania recently legalized slot machine gambling in 14 locations in the state, and that could drain gamblers from Atlantic City. Trump Hotels may face better-financed casino rivals if recently announced mergers of Harrah's Entertainment Inc. with Caesars Entertainment Inc., and MGM Mirage with the Mandalay Resort Group, are completed. Mr. Trump's company said it had already lost business to the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa, a high-end enterprise that opened in Atlantic City last summer and is co-owned by MGM Mirage and the Boyd Gaming Corporation.
 Trump Hotels said that it lost $66.4 million, or $2.22 a share, for the six-month period ended June 30, compared with a loss of $34.0 million, or $1.55 a share, for the same period last year. Trump Hotels' shares are very thinly traded and investors had a muted response to the company's earnings announcement. The shares closed at $2.06, down a penny, on lower than usual trading volume yesterday.
 Mr. Trump, whose personal net worth is notoriously difficult to evaluate, voiced some confusion yesterday about his stake in Trump Hotels, part of which he holds directly and part of which he controls through a limited partnership. He initially said yesterday that he had a 41 percent stake in Trump Hotels. In March, he said in an interview that he had a 49 percent stake. Asked whether he had sold stock in the interim, he said he had not. After revisiting the topic with his advisers, he said he actually holds about 56 percent of Trump Hotels' shares -- a stake worth about $34.5 million.
 Mr. Trump said that the Republican convention, which might draw fresh crowds into the New York region next month, should have a ''big impact'' on his company's bottom line in the next quarter.

HEADLINE: An Opening Grand Slam Bid: It Works Here, but It's Risky

BYLINE: By Alan Truscott

 BODY:
The earliest movie about bridge was ''Grand Slam,'' made in 1933. It was given a rare presentation on Tuesday on Turner Classic Movies and is an entertaining spoof of the Culbertson-Lenz match played two years earlier.
 Paul Lukas plays Peter Stanislavsky, a handsome intellectual waiter. Like Ely Culbertson, he is a Russian who is interested in political economy but takes up bridge. He persuades the nation to adopt the Stanislavsky System, claiming that it will prevent marital discord. 
 Stanislavsky is married to a beautiful American, played by Loretta Young. She comes to the rescue when he is losing a highly publicized match against representatives of the Old Guard of experts, and America's bridge sweethearts duly win. They immediately give up the game, as Culbertson did in real life six years after his match.
 Culbertson advocated a slow approach to bidding, with many forcing bids. His opponent, Sidney Lenz, held the opposite view, favoring direct action with hardly any forcing bids. In the movie, the roles are reversed, and Stanislavsky frequently opens with a seven-bid. This does not seem a recipe for success in match play, nor for domestic harmony in a husband-and-wife partnership. But it must be admitted that it would have hit the target on the diagramed deal.
 In real life, Lenz held the South cards and was fixated on the possibility of collecting 150 for four aces. He insisted on no-trump, in the face of a series of heart bids by his partner. When Lenz made a dreadful bid six no-trump and was doubled, his partner, Oswald Jacoby, retreated to seven hearts. This was doubled and failed by a trick.
 Stanislavsky, using his bizarre system, would no doubt have done better by an antiapproach opening of seven spades. That would have rolled home, since the hearts in the North hand could have been established by ruffing out East's king. The system thus finds a desirable strain in one bid that Lenz and Jacoby did not uncover in seven bids.
 The fascinating question, which must remain unanswered, is this: In the original match, what would West have led against six no-trump doubled? It would have taken a club lead to destroy the contract, and that would have resulted in a two- or three-trick defeat. After any other lead Lenz would have been able to establish and run dummy's hearts, using North's spade honors as the crucial entries. He would have had an enormous score, and recorded the 150 for four aces in one hand that had so influenced his primitive bidding. It was not, however, as primitive as that favored by Stanislavsky.

HEADLINE: U.N. Council Threatens to Punish Sudan Over Militia Killings

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 30 

 BODY:
The Security Council passed a resolution on Friday that threatens the Sudanese government with punitive measures if it does not disarm and prosecute Arab militias that have forced black Africans off their land in the Darfur region of western Sudan through a campaign of killing, rape and pillage.
 The vote on the United States-drafted resolution was 13 to 0, with China and Pakistan abstaining.
 Passage was achieved after the United States on Thursday revised the measure to drop the word sanctions and substitute a reference to an article of the United Nations Charter that in effect lays out economic and diplomatic sanctions as the likely consequence of noncompliance with the resolution's demands. 
 Principal among those demands is the call on the government in Khartoum to show tangible progress in disarming and bringing to justice the marauding militias in 30 days. Under the terms of the measure, the Security Council will receive reports every month on whether Sudan is fulfilling its commitments or should be subject to international sanctions. 
 The Arab militias, known as Janjaweed and equipped by the Sudanese government, are accused of killing up to 30,000 darker-skinned Africans, raping women and girls, destroying crops and polluting water supplies in a campaign that United Nations officials say constitutes ethnic cleansing and Congress has called genocide. More than one million people have fled to refugee camps in Sudan and Chad.
 John C. Danforth, the American ambassador to the United Nations and a former Bush administration special envoy to Sudan, told the Council that it had long been his hope to see Sudan emerge as a ''model of ethnic reconciliation.''
 ''The last thing we wanted to do was lay the groundwork for sanctions,'' he said. ''But the government of Sudan has left us no choice.''
 ''It has done the unthinkable,'' he continued. ''It has fostered an armed attack on its own civilian population. It has created a humanitarian disaster. So the resolution we have just adopted is our necessary response if we are to save the people of Darfur.''
 The measure -- co-sponsored by Britain, Chile, France, Germany, Romania and Spain -- also places an immediate embargo on supplying arms to fighters in Darfur and calls on the government to end all restrictions on aid workers and relief equipment.
 Pakistan and China said they had abstained out of concern that Sudan was not given enough time to live up to its commitments and that outside action would be complicating rather than helpful.
 The Sudanese ambassador, Elfatih Mohamed Ahmed Erwa, said that he was ''overwhelmed with sorrow and sadness over the hasty resolution'' and that it came at a time when his government ''is in a race for time to implement its agreement with the United Nations.''
 In Khartoum, Information Minister Al-Zahawi Ibrahim Malik was more explicit in expressing the government's displeasure. ''Sudan announces its rejection of the Security Council's misguided resolution,'' he said, according to Reuters. 
 Sudan signed a joint communique in Khartoum with Secretary General Kofi Annan on July 3 pledging to rein in the violence in Darfur, and Mr. Erwa complained Friday that the accord was now being used as a ''Trojan horse'' by ''some activists within the U.S. administration'' to bring military pressure on the Islamic government in Khartoum.
 He said that his government had responded immediately to the terms of the communique, deploying police officers and arresting militia members, but that the United States and its allies on the Security Council had acted in a ''colonial'' fashion.
 ''Aren't these the very same states that we see daily on TV monitors and their massive military machine while they are practicing the occupation of nations, pouring their fire on innocent civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan?'' he asked.
 In Cairo, Hossam Zaki, a spokesman for the Arab League, asked, ''How come the Security Council and those with a humanitarian agenda are so active when it comes to such a situation, when they turn a blind eye to the miserable situation in the Palestinian territories?''
 Rights groups had been hoping for a stronger resolution, and Adotei Akwei, a spokesman for Amnesty International in Washington, said the organization was ''extremely disappointed'' with the weakened language on sanctions. ''It represents the abandonment of the people of Darfur and an abdication of the Security Council's role as a human rights enforcing agent,'' he said.
 France announced Friday that it was ordering its troops stationed in Chad to provide security along the border and to help with the supply of relief aid. 
 In Accra, Ghana, the African Union said Sudan must act now to protect its citizens, after a fact-finding mission reported back that the security situation in the Darfur area had worsened.
 The African Union has 96 military observers monitoring a cease-fire between the Sudanese government and rebel groups in Darfur and plans to send 270 troops from Nigeria, South Africa and Rwanda next week.

HEADLINE: All Things To All People

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
There were so many military men at the Democratic convention I almost expected John Kerry to mount the stage in full body armor and recite the war speech from ''Henry V.'' As it is, he called for bulking up the military, doubling the size of the Special Forces and crushing the terrorists. He hit Bush from the right, and when he got around to bashing the Saudis, I thought I'd wandered into a big meeting of The Weekly Standard editorial board. 
 Not only that, Kerry's speech followed an all-hawk medley. Gen. John Shalikashvili called for appreciably increasing the size of the Army. Joe Lieberman called for muscular and idealistic internationalism. Joe Biden said we must ''win the death struggle between freedom and radical fundamentalism.'' Gen. Wesley Clark said we're in ''a life or death struggle'' against terrorists seeking nuclear weapons. 
 John Edwards gave a speech that eschewed talk about Halliburton, W.M.D., misleading the country into war -- the entire liberal catechism. Instead he talked about defeating ''every enemy in this new world'' and confronting Syria and Iran so they don't interfere with the emergence of a democratic Iraq. 
 Around the arena I spotted some of the people most often talked about as senior officials in a Kerry administration: Richard Holbrooke, Biden, Rand Beers and Dick Gephardt. On the international economy side: Roger Altman, Steve Rattner, John Spratt. On Thursday night I saw Mr. Sober and Serious himself, Robert Rubin, sitting next to Teresa. These are tough centrists from the Washington-Wall Street axis who would be heroes in any crisis.
 And so I dared to dream. Maybe the Democratic Party is going to recapture the security policy credibility it had during the Truman and Kennedy years. Maybe this display of McCainiac muscular moderation is not just a costume drama, but the real deal. Maybe hope is really on the way!
 I should never have gone back and read the speech again. I should never have gone back on Friday morning, in the unforgiving light of day, and re-examined the words Kerry had so forcefully uttered the night before. 
 What an incoherent disaster. When you actually read for content, you see that the speech skirts almost every tough issue and comes out on both sides of every major concern. The Iraq section is shamefully evasive. He can't even bring himself to use the word ''democratic'' or to contemplate any future for Iraq, democratic or otherwise. He can't bring himself to say whether the war was a mistake or to lay out even the most meager plan for moving forward. For every gesture in the direction of greater defense spending, there are opposing hints about reducing our commitments and bringing the troops home.
 He proves in the speech that he can pronounce the word ''alliances,'' and alliances are important, but alliances for what? You can't base an entire foreign policy on process. 
 Then I remembered that, of course, the Great Co-opter has to try gauzily to please everyone. He has to play to the 86 percent of the delegates who say the U.S. should have stayed out of Iraq, as well as the Clintonite foreign policy elites who supported the war. He has to play to the Sharptons as well as the Liebermans. 
 And it all brings back the memories of Kerry the senator. For though convention viewers may not be aware of it, Kerry has actually had a career since his four months in Vietnam -- mostly in the Senate. It's not true that Kerry is a flaming lefty (he's a genuine budget hawk and he voted for welfare reform), but he was wrong about just about every major foreign policy judgment of the last two decades. He voted against the first gulf war, against many major weapons systems. He fought to reduce the defense budget. He opposed the deployment of intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe in the early 1980's. He supported the nuclear freeze. His decision to authorize war in Iraq but vote against financing the occupation is the least intellectually coherent position of all possible alternatives. 
 So now I'm disillusioned. What the Democratic Party is going through is not yet a genuine muscular centrist revival. As a friend joked, from the voters of Iowa to the delegates in Boston, there's been a vast left-wing conspiracy to present a candidate who looks like a muscular moderate, but they picked someone who is not in his heart of hearts a muscular moderate, or anything else.

Nicholas D. Kristof is on vacation.

HEADLINE: Citing Success In Policy, Bush Re-enters Fray

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and JIM RUTENBERG; Richard W. Stevenson reported from Grand Rapids for this article and Jim Rutenberg from Boston.

DATELINE: GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., July 30 

 BODY:
President Bush opened a new campaign offensive on Friday by saying that he had delivered results in education, health care, the economy and national security, and by attacking Senator John Kerry for what he characterized as a 19-year Senate record lacking significant accomplishment.
 After largely ceding the spotlight to Democrats for the week of their convention, Mr. Bush stumped through Missouri, Michigan and Ohio with a retooled speech emphasizing that his policies had helped the nation through a time of trial and that staying the course was the best way to assure continued improvement.
 For their part, Mr. Kerry and his running mate, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, rode what Democrats said was the success of their convention and swept out of Boston to campaign in Pennsylvania, where they emphasized themes of hope and unity and promises to strengthen the United States and restore the world's respect. [Page A8.] 
 Mr. Bush ticked off one area after another in which he said he had helped the United States move forward, including overhauling Medicare, making schools more accountable, ending a drought in job creation and ridding the world of the threat that Iraq might provide terrorists with chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. On each issue, he said, ''we are turning the corner, and we're not turning back.''
 A day after Mr. Kerry accepted his party's nomination, and 95 days before Election Day, the presidential race took on an all-out feel, with both sides rushing to the swing states likely to decide the outcome and introducing television commercials for an advertising onslaught likely to remain intense until the end.
 Responding to Mr. Bush's criticism, Mr. Kerry's campaign said Friday that the White House was trying to distract attention from Mr. Bush's record, including a net loss of jobs during his presidency. Aides to Mr. Kerry on Friday both cited a new report that the economy had slowed in the second quarter from the first three months of the year and a revised White House projection that the budget deficit this year would be lower than previously forecast -- but still a record.
 ''A brand new shiny speech won't cover up Bush's failure to help middle-class families,'' said Phil Singer, a spokesman for Mr. Kerry.
 As Mr. Bush began setting out some specific ideas he would support if re-elected, including legislation encouraging employers to give their workers more flexible schedules and plans to improve high school education, he continued to draw sharp contrasts between himself and Mr. Kerry, whom he referred to throughout the day only as ''my opponent.'' 
 ''My opponent has good intentions, but intentions do not always translate to results,'' Mr. Bush said. ''After 19 years in the United States Senate, my opponent has had thousands of votes, but very few signature achievements. During eight years on the Senate Intelligence Committee, he voted to cut the intelligence budget. And he had no record of reforming America's intelligence-gathering capability. He had no significant record for reforming education and health care.''
 Mr. Bush suggested that Mr. Kerry would raise taxes to pay for his domestic programs and had so equivocated on the war in Iraq that Americans could not count on his mettle as commander in chief.
 ''If America shows uncertainty and weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy,'' Mr. Bush said, implicitly but clearly comparing himself with Mr. Kerry. ''This will not happen on my watch.''
 Brushing off Mr. Kerry's assertion in his address to the Democratic convention on Thursday night that he should not be criticized for seeing complexities in the world, Mr. Bush again mocked Mr. Kerry's statement that he had voted for an $87 billion supplemental spending bill to pay for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan before he voted against it. 
 ''There is nothing complicated about supporting our troops in combat,'' Mr. Bush said to a roar of approval from a crowd at his first stop of the day, in Springfield, Mo.
 Parrying Mr. Kerry's vow to rebuild foreign alliances and make the United States respected in the world as it battles terrorists, Mr. Bush said the war in Iraq had been waged with the backing of a broad international coalition. But the president said he would never wait for other governments when it came to protecting the United States.
 ''I'll continue to build alliances and work with our friends for the cause of security and peace,'' he said here. ''But I will never turn America's national security decisions over to leaders of other nations.''
 Mr. Kerry, who has made the White House's handling of intelligence an issue following the release of the Sept. 11 commission's report, has disputed Mr. Bush's statement that he supported cutting the intelligence budget. Mr. Kerry's campaign said he had backed a 50 percent increase in spending for intelligence since 1996.
 Before the Democratic convention this week, polls showed that the presidential race was too close to call, and both parties are busily polling now to see whether Mr. Kerry carried any advantage out of Boston. Mr. Bush's approval ratings have hovered at less than 50 percent for months, a level that has historically spelled trouble for incumbents, and public sentiment on the war in Iraq, among other issues, has turned against him.
 But Mr. Kerry has so far been unable to turn the president's vulnerabilities into a lead. And even as Mr. Bush's aides credited Mr. Kerry with having given a good speech on Thursday night, the White House stepped up its efforts to cast Mr. Bush as a steady, accomplished leader at home and abroad.
 Mr. Bush's advisers have in recent days described him as champing at the bit to get back into the fight. On Thursday one strategist said, ''There's not an ounce of Rose Garden in this president; he's ready to get out there.''
 Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry will both campaign in Pennsylvania and Ohio this weekend, and they and their parties are also clashing in television advertising, focusing in particular on national security.
 Mr. Bush's new commercial was met immediately with one from the Democratic National Committee. The Democratic commercial sought to build on Mr. Kerry's efforts at the convention to convince Americans that he can be trusted as commander in chief, while Mr. Bush's team portrayed him as a steady hand during what he referred to in his speeches as ''dangerous times.''
 The Bush commercial shows a child peering out a door that opens onto a video montage including images that shift from those of a female scientist and the president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, to those of tanks and a masked man shooting a machine gun, apparently in Iraq. The announcer says: ''The world is changing, sometimes in ways that astound. And others that terrify.''
 But as the images shift to schoolchildren, families and Mr. Bush, the announcer says, ''We need a sense of purpose, a vision for the future, the conviction to do what's right.''
 The Democrats' commercial seemed to answer Mr. Bush directly, building off Mr. Kerry's speech on Thursday in which he promoted his national security credentials. Set to inspirational string music, it features sweeping shots of Mr. Kerry addressing the FleetCenter, packed with Kerry placards, saying, ''I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as president,'' and then, after calling for ''a strong military'' and ''strong alliances,'' declaring, ''And then we will be able to tell the terrorists: 'You will lose, and we will win.'''
 The commercial was the first to come from the Democratic National Committee, which said it had spent $6.5 million to show it through next week as part of an advertising drive that could cost at least $40 million before Election Day. Mr. Bush's campaign is spending $14 million on advertising for the next two weeks.
 In his speech here, to several thousand people in the field house at Grand Rapids Community College, Mr. Bush repeated that ''results matter,'' and he made a case that he had a rich record of grappling with difficult issues and coming up with tangible solutions.
 In setting out his agenda, Mr. Bush highlighted his call for an ''ownership society,'' a phrase he uses to cover his proposals to create private investment accounts within Social Security, to expand health savings accounts and to encourage homeownership. He said he would seek more emphasis in high school on math and science to prepare young people for jobs in a high-tech world and encourage greater use of the Internet in the classroom.
 He said he would seek to make regulation of business ''reasonable and fair.'' But he said he would encourage legislation giving more workers the ability to use compensatory time or flexible schedules so they could have ''time to go to the Little League games, time to care for elderly parents or time to go to class themselves.''

HEADLINE: Cheney Criticizes Democratic Ticket on War and Taxes

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: YAKIMA, Wash., July 30 

 BODY:
Vice President Dick Cheney sketched out the Bush campaign's counterattack against the newly nominated Democratic ticket on Friday, saying that both Senators John Kerry and John Edwards had failed to support the troops they helped send to war and that the Democrats' convention promised only increased taxes.
 The critique began as Mr. Cheney's wife, Lynne, introduced him at a rally here with a jab at the Democrats' convention in Boston. ''Some politicians can't help themselves -- they think they know better than the rest of us,'' she said, arguing that arrogance led the Democrats to turn more taxes over to the government. ''They think the greatness of this country resides in Washington, D.C., and we know better,'' she said. 
 In a speech listing what he said were the Bush administration's achievements, including ''a strong economy,'' Mr. Cheney emphasized that Mr. Bush had cut taxes ''not once, not twice, but three times.'' As for the Democrats' convention, he said: ''They opposed our tax relief package, and now they are proposing massive increases in federal spending.'' He added, ''Their big idea for the economy: raise taxes.''
 Mr. Cheney also criticized Mr. Edwards, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, with the Republicans' favorite attack on Mr. Kerry, for first voting for the war in Iraq and later voting against one of the bills to finance it. He said only four senators voted for the war and against that financing bill, and both members of the Democratic ticket were among them. ''Funding American troops in combat should never be a complicated matter,'' Mr. Cheney said. 
 On another front, Mr. Cheney invoked the recent court battle over the phrase ''under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance. He noted to applause that the Bush administration supported the reference to God, and he criticized the Senate Democrats, including Senators Kerry and Edwards, for blocking Mr. Bush's ''sensible, mainstream'' judicial appointments, including one to the circuit court that ruled the phrase unconstitutional. That verdict, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, was overturned by the Supreme Court. 
 Phil Singer, a Kerry spokesman, said of the vote on war financing, ''Both the president and the vice president know full well that that vote was about their failed policies in Iraq and getting the administration to change the course that it has pursued.'' He added that, as a veteran, Mr. Kerry was ''fully committed'' to supporting American troops.
 Mr. Singer dismissed the Cheneys' contentions about the Democrats' tax plans as ''a typical scare tactic.'' He said, ''The fact is that John Kerry and John Edwards are going to cut taxes for 98 percent of Americans.''
 As for the Pledge of Allegiance, Mr. Singer said that Mr. Kerry favored the inclusion of ''under God.''
 Another theme that has emerged on the campaign trail this week is a steady drumbeat of Republican attacks on Senator Edwards's youthful appearance and full head of hair. Contrasting his own bald head with Mr. Edwards's head is a staple of Mr. Cheney's stump speech, and on Friday another bald speaker, former Senator Alan K. Simpson, got into the act. ''Everybody is given a certain amount of hormones. If you want to waste yours growing hair, that is your business,'' Mr. Simpson said.
 Mr. Singer responded, ''It is not surprising they are somewhat envious.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Will Cut Farm Subsidies In Trade Deal

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 30 

 BODY:
The United States yielded to pressure from developing countries on Friday and agreed to make a 20 percent cut in some of the $19 billion in subsidies it pays to American farmers each year, as members of the World Trade Organization met round the clock here to win approval for a new deal governing world trade. 
 Working until 4:00 a.m. on Friday, Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, reached an agreement to cut subsidies for such crops as corn, rice, wheat and soybeans. He also reached an accord with four cotton-producing countries in West Africa for eventual cutbacks in subsidies paid to American cotton growers. These countries -- Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali -- have waged an emotional campaign against American cotton subsidies that they say have left tens of thousands of their farmers destitute. 
 The American concessions appeared to brighten the prospects that negotiators would complete a framework for further talks on revamping rules for global trade over the weekend. 
 The latest round of trade talks began in 2001 in Doha, Qatar, but foundered last year in Cancun, Mexico, primarily over the American farm subsidies and the European Union's $3 billion in annual export subsidies.
 If the agreements are approved, the subsidy cuts would go into effect at a successful conclusion of this round of talks, probably sometime in 2006. 
 Helping the developing world by reducing or eliminating the $300 billion in agriculture subsidies and supports given to farmers in the world's wealthiest nations was the top goal of the latest round of talks at the 147-member trade organization. 
 The World Bank, the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and private charities like Oxfam International have all argued against the subsidies. They say they are one of the worst injustices in the global economic system, allowing rich countries to flood the global market with inexpensive food and commodities that make it impossible for largely rural, poor countries to trade their way out of poverty, much less improve their own farmers' livelihoods.
 Pressure on the United States has increased since the European Union announced that it was eliminating its export subsidies. The concessions made by the Bush Administration on Friday on agricultural subsidies were seen as an important response to the European action.
 In exchange for reducing agricultural supports, the wealthy nations are asking the developing nations to reduce their tariffs on manufactured goods. That issue was left in general terms for more precise negotiations in later talks. Mr. Zoellick so far has failed to get significant concessions to open up new markets for American agricultural and industrial goods.
 Still, as delegates racked up successive compromises here, the prospect for an agreement was improving, and delegates said uniformly that they were committed to making the negotiations succeed. But talks could run aground on such issues as how much Japan can protect its rice or Norway its dairy products. Celso Amorim, the top trade negotiator for Brazil and an important negotiator here, said there were still several disputes to be resolved. 
 If the talks succeed, they are expected to lead to as much as a $3 trillion gain in the world economy. 
 ''What I'm hearing is not at all like Cancun -- none of the extravagant rhetoric of what is unacceptable,'' said Jim Sutton, a delegate from New Zealand. 
 This time the United States and other nations agreed that cotton subsidies and other supports and tariffs covering cotton should be treated on a separate fast track. 
 Matthew Nwagwu, chief delegate from Nigeria, said, ''So far, the cotton language is good, it's looking very good.'' He added, ''I think we are going to finalize the agreement.'' 
 The American delegation was just as positive. ''We think this cotton agreement provides a shot in the arm to these talks,'' said an American trade official who asked not to be identified as the discussions continued. ''We were very pleased to work with the Africans.''
 The four African nations that brought the original cotton complaint also won an agreement that the global trade body would work with the World Bank and the I.M.F. to get them more money for development assistance. 
 Since the failure of the talks in Cancun, the United States lost a case brought by Brazil that challenged its cotton subsidies as illegal. That case, before the World Trade Organization's dispute body, could force the United States to lower its cotton subsidies even without these negotiations.
 Poorer nations have also complained that the United States often used food aid as a way to dump surplus food grown by American farmers. In response, the United States largely agreed to follow international rules that encourage giving money and credit to buy food in the region where aid is needed. The United States also agreed to limit the use of its export credits, which have amounted to an export subsidy.
 Not everyone was satisfied with the concessions. A delegate from the Dominican Republic said the proposed framework agreement was still a betrayal of developing countries. And Celine Charveriat, head of Oxfam International in Geneva, said that the rich countries could create new subsidies by using loopholes in the agreement.
 Laurens Jan Brinkhorst, the Dutch economy minister and chairman of a delegation of ministers from the European Union, disagreed. He argued that the proposed agreement reflected the growing muscle of the developing world, especially of countries like Brazil, China and India.
 ''The world has changed; we now live in a truly global world,'' he said, adding that these developing nations had changed the geopolitical boundaries of the talks and forced the new agreement.
 Pascal Lamy, the European Union's top trade official, agreed that talks were going well. ''I'm not sure if I'm happy, but we are working very well,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Lifted Libyan Sanctions Despite Plot on Saudi Leader

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30 

 BODY:
The Bush administration acknowledged on Friday that it had information last spring about a Libyan plot to assassinate the leader of Saudi Arabia, even as the United States was lifting longtime economic sanctions against Libya.
 The acknowledgement, raising new questions about the administration's decision to resume diplomatic relations with Libya, came as one participant in the plot, a prominent Muslim-American named Abdurahman Alamoudi, pleaded guilty in federal court to three criminal counts in connection with his Libyan dealings. As part of the plea, Mr. Alamoudi, 52, who lives in suburban Washington, acknowledged that he took part in an unsuccessful scheme to assassinate Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. 
 The State Department became aware in April of specific accusations involving Mr. Alamoudi and the Libyan plot, and it had had more general information about the allegations before that, a State Department spokesman, Adam Ereli, told reporters on Friday.
 On April 23, President Bush lifted most remaining restrictions on Libya and authorized the establishment of an American diplomatic mission in Tripoli, the capital. 
 Mr. Ereli said that while the Libyans had fulfilled many of the promises they made in negotiating the end of economic sanctions, the State Department was continuing to examine Mr. Alamoudi's case and the plot. 
 ''The issue that we're talking about today on Alamoudi is an important concern, and it's troubling,'' Mr. Ereli said. ''And it obviously has an impact on our overall calculations.''
 Lawyers for Mr. Alamoudi said they believed that the administration had credible information about the Libyan plot as far back as last November, when a Libyan intelligence officer implicated in it was jailed in Saudi Arabia. They questioned why the United States moved ahead with diplomatic relations.
 Mr. Alamoudi pleaded guilty on Friday in federal court in Alexandria, Va., to three counts related to illegal business dealings with Libya, his failure to disclose past contacts with suspected terrorists during his naturalization proceedings, and hiding money he raised overseas from the Internal Revenue Service. He now faces a maximum of 23 years in prison, but his extensive cooperation in the case -- he has spent more than 100 hours with American investigators -- ''could result in a significant reduction'' in the sentence, said Stanley Cohen, one of his defense lawyers. 
 Mr. Alamoudi, who is president of the American Muslim Foundation and has had access to senior government officials for years in promoting Islamic causes, is to be sentenced on Oct. 15.
 Mr. Alamoudi's lawyers maintained that he became involved in the plot only as a way to cause problems for Prince Abdullah and to disrupt life in Saudi Arabia. But in the facts agreed upon by both Mr. Alamoudi and the government in his plea, he acknowledged that the goal of the plot was to assassinate the prince.
 In the spring of 2003, Mr. Alamoudi was directed to tell two associates ''to arrange the assassination of Crown Prince Abdullah,'' the agreement says.
 But, Mr. Cohen said of his client: ''When he agreed to participate in a conspiracy, he had no idea it was a conspiracy to kill Abdullah. But he did agree in the statement of facts in the case that there did come a point in time where he knew the stated goal of the plot was to kill Prince Abdullah.''

HEADLINE: The Faulty Premise of Pre-emption

BYLINE: By Geoff D. Porter. 
Geoff D. Porter is the North Africa analyst at the Eurasia Group, a research and consulting firm.

 BODY:
The Bush administration took a new approach to North Korea this month: it suggested that Kim Jong Il follow the example set by Muammar el-Qaddafi. John R. Bolton, undersecretary of state for arms control, urged North Korea to follow Libya's "strategic choice" and voluntarily dismantle its nuclear weapons programs.
 But if this approach is based on the assumption that Libya acted to avoid a pre-emptive attack, then its premise is flawed. The United States' pre-emptive invasion of Iraq did not play a large role in bringing about Libya's rapprochement. Contrary to the Bush administration's assertions, Libya's dismantled weapons program is not evidence that a policy of pre-emptive strikes works, and it is disingenuous to argue that it will produce the same results in North Korea. 
 There are several problems with the notion that Colonel Qaddafi's decision to come clean was a direct result of an aggressive United States foreign policy. For one, the history of Colonel Qaddafi's turnaround does not bear out the administration's assertion. Second is the disproportionate weight the administration gives to its foreign policy's influence on Libyan decision makers. Libya has its own social, economic and political concerns and these concerns have always been uppermost in Colonel Qaddafi's efforts to maintain hold on power. 
 It is possible that the Bush administration's policy did nudge Colonel Qaddafi forward, but discussions for Libya's return to the international community began under the Clinton administration. In 1999, Libya extradited two men implicated in the Pan Am 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, a decade earlier. The same year, it agreed to pay compensation for the victims of the bombing of a French airliner, UTA Flight 772, whose destruction over Niger was traced back to Libya. Discussions between the United States and Libya about its weapons of mass destruction programs also began that year. These discussions finally bore fruit last fall with Colonel Qaddafi's decision to renounce these weapons. It is true that this announcement came after Saddam Hussein's regime collapsed, but is a mistake to link these two events.
 Why? For one, history argues against it: Colonel Qaddafi did not respond to direct military strikes ordered by President Ronald Reagan in 1986, even when they cost the life of his adopted daughter. It would be misleading to suggest that this time around he was brought to heel by the mere specter of military action. Instead, Colonel Qaddafi's decision to abandon his weapons programs was motivated by domestic concerns.
 For 35 years Colonel Qaddafi has used oil to buy allegiance from Libyans. In exchange for their turning a blind eye to the lack of representative government and human rights abuses, Colonel Qaddafi is openhanded in distributing Libya's oil proceeds, sometimes as direct gifts to influential people and tribal leaders, but also in the form of state-financed health care, huge urban development projects and universal free education. But two decades of American and United Nations sanctions diminished Libyan oil revenues. The country's oil fields were declining, exploration was all but halted, and Libya was forbidden to import new oil extraction technology.
 At the same time, Libya's population was booming. In 1982 there were slightly fewer than three million people in Libya. By 2002, there were more than five million. In some cities, the annual growth rate topped an astronomical (and problematic) 7 percent. The mixture of population growth and declining oil revenues endangered Colonel Qaddafi's ability to hold on to power.
 Starting in the mid-1990's a younger generation of reformers, led by Prime Minister Shukri Ghanem, began to convince Colonel Qaddafi that he could not maintain his rule without more income. With virtually no other resources, increasing oil revenue was the only option, but to do this Colonel Qaddafi needed sanctions lifted. The steps that he took in regard to the Lockerbie bombing, the UTA flight and finally the renunciation of weapons of mass destruction were all aimed at removing sanctions. They have now been lifted, energy companies are jockeying to get into Libya, and the first shipments of Libyan oil arrived in the United States last month.
 By citing Libya's reform as the outcome of a threatening foreign policy stance, the Bush administration is substantiating a foreign policy doctrine on false premises. Colonel Qaddafi brought Libya in from the cold not because he was afraid that the United States might topple him, but because he was afraid of losing his grip on power domestically. The Bush administration should then not express surprise that Kim Jong Il dismissed the United States' most recent overtures as a ''sham.'' Pre-emptive policy did not work in Libya and it is unlikely to work in North Korea either.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Says City Will Help The Franchise That Helps Itself

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU and CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg expressed support yesterday for the New York Yankees' plan to pay for a new stadium in the Bronx, saying that he would also like to replace the city's other aging sports arenas, Shea Stadium and Madison Square Garden.
 But the mayor made clear that those sports projects would also have to be paid for primarily by the teams themselves, or through other private investments. Reiterating his earlier position on the issue, he said that city money could be counted on only for smaller improvements in infrastructure.
 ''We just don't have a lot of money to pay for it,'' the mayor said on his weekly radio program on WABC-AM. ''And so what we said from Day 1 was to build these things, it's got to be done with private money, and if there needs to be a public investment for infrastructure, there has to be a return for the city.'' 
 Officials with the Yankees and the city said on Wednesday that the team planned to pay for much of the $700 million cost of a new open-air stadium, which would rise across 161st Street from its current home. According to the team's latest proposal, the city and state share would total roughly $300 million, which would be used in part to create public ball fields and parks to offset the loss of parkland in the neighborhood.
 Yankees' executives, who have hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to do an economic impact analysis, said they were confident that it will show that additional tax revenues from a new stadium would more than offset the cost of the infrastructure work by the state and the city.
 ''We're appreciative of the mayor's views and we look forward to working with him as we finalize our plans,'' Randy Levine, president of the Yankees, said yesterday.
 In contrast, the city and state would pay substantially more --about $600 million in public funds --for a proposed $1.4 billion stadium for the New York Jets on the far West Side of Manhattan. The Jets would invest about $800 million in the stadium, or what the mayor calls ''the biggest private contribution ever.'' It would also be most the expensive football stadium in the country, by far.
 In recent months, the Jets stadium has been opposed by community groups and businesses, including Cablevision, the publicly traded company that owns Madison Square Garden, the New York Knicks and the New York Rangers. But the Jets stadium remains a central part of the Bloomberg administration's $6.5 billion plan to transform the West Side: it would double as an exhibition hall and as an Olympic stadium if the city succeeds in its bid for the 2012 summer Olympics.
 Mayor Bloomberg defended the Jets proposal yesterday by pointing out that it would be used mostly as a convention center, not as a sports stadium, and that it would create a large number of jobs in the city. The Jets, the state and the city contend that the stadium will generate more than $65 million annually in state and city taxes, or $23 million more than they believe it will cost the city and state in annual debt payments.
 ''Baseball stadiums are different,'' the mayor said. ''They're basically used for baseball and not a lot else. They're open stadiums, so they can't be used in the winter, and in the summer, when you would like to use them for a concert or something, there's either a baseball game there or you can't tear up the field. So you know, you say, 'Well, it's sitting there empty.' Yeah, but you can't use it, so that's the problem.''
 The mayor said a proposed $435 million arena in Brooklyn for the New Jersey Nets was part of a residential and commercial complex that would generate ''enormous returns because it will bring a lot of jobs and housing to that neighborhood.''
 The developer is also asking for more than $300 million in tax breaks and road and rail yard work.
 Even so, Mayor Bloomberg said that city officials were working closely with the Yankees to move ahead with the stadium proposal. In a thinly veiled swipe at Cablevision, which has financed ads against the Jets stadium, the mayor also praised the Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner, for trying to find a way to pay for the stadium without relying on the city.
 ''The Steinbrenner organization, they're smart, they're aggressive, and rather than just go out and yell and scream and try to stop other projects, their whole focus is in trying to get something that's viable and that works,'' he said. ''I'm a big fan.''
 Mayor Bloomberg said that he would also like to see a new Madison Square Garden built on the West Side, along with the Jets stadium. Other possibilities, he said, included building a new arena as part of the refurbishment of Penn Station, or on a vacant parcel of land on Eighth Avenue. 
 Cablevision, in turn, has pointedly announced that it would renovate the Garden without asking for additional city subsidies. Officials in the Bloomberg administration say they hope Cablevision will cease its war against the Jets' project and seek the city's help in building a new Garden at another location.
 The mayor, who attended a Yankees game on Thursday night, said that he would not play favorites when it came to the city's two baseball teams. He added that city officials were also working with Fred Wilpon, the principal owner of the Mets, to come up with a way to pay for a new Shea Stadium. But the Mets, whose officials could not be reached for comment, generate far less revenue than the Yankees, the most valuable sports franchise in the country, and may not be able to offer to pay for a $700 million stadium, said one baseball official.
 ''If the Steinbrenner organization comes up with money, we'll look at that; if it's right for the city, the city will help them,'' the mayor said. ''If the Wilpon organization comes up with money for a new Shea stadium, and it's right for the city, the city will help them. I mean, I'd love to see both.''

HEADLINE: White House Says $445 Billion Deficit Forecast Isn't as Bad as It Looks

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30 

 BODY:
The White House projected on Friday that the budget deficit would reach $445 billion in this fiscal year.
 That would make it by far the largest shortfall ever in the dollar amount, though it would be well below the record for a deficit as a percentage of the gross domestic product and well below the amount forecast six months ago.
 Joshua B. Bolten, President Bush's budget director, presented the new forecast as good news, saying ''the improved budget outlook is the direct result of the strong economic growth the president's tax relief has fueled.''
 But Democrats said the revised forecast for the 2004 fiscal year, still almost 20 percent higher than the record $375 billion deficit in the previous year, showed just how much the government's fiscal health had deteriorated under Mr. Bush. 
 ''They're claiming improvement?'' said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee. ''That is utterly preposterous.''
 In the 2001 fiscal year, the last time the budget was prepared by the Clinton administration, there was a surplus of $127 billion. Soon after Mr. Bush took office in January 2001, his staff projected a 2004 surplus of $262 billion.
 In early February, the White House predicted that the deficit in this fiscal year would be $521 billion. The lower number announced on Friday in what is called the mid-session review resulted from larger tax receipts than had been expected. Mr. Bolten said that was a consequence of ''the broad-based and sustained economic recovery.''
 The administration is predicting that the economy in this calendar year will grow by 4.7 percent, slightly more than the 4.5 percent growth that is the average projection of the top private economic forecasters.
 The government's announcement on Friday that the economy had grown at an annual rate of 3 percent in the second quarter of this year, after growth of 4.5 percent in the first quarter, could make the White House's projection for the year hard to meet. To reach it, the economy would have to grow by more than 5.6 percent in the year's last six months.
 Mr. Bolten discounted the importance of the second-quarter numbers and said the budget was still on track to meet Mr. Bush's deficit-reduction goals. The White House projects the deficit will fall to $331 billion in the 2005 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, and drop steadily until it is $229 billion in the 2009 fiscal year, when the next presidential term ends. These deficits are somewhat lower than were forecast in February.
 The calculations do not include any additional spending in Iraq and Afghanistan after early next year, when current appropriations will run out. 
 ''We will need additional money,'' Mr. Bolten said, but he added it would not be enough to jeopardize the objective of reducing the deficit by half. 
 Senator John Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee, also promises to cut the deficit in half in four years. But Mr. Kerry said he would repeal the tax cuts for people with incomes above $200,000 a year and spend the additional revenue mainly to expand health insurance coverage.
 Mr. Bolten acknowledged ''today's deficits remain unwelcome,'' but he said the situation was not serious. ''The most relevant perspective on the deficit is in relation to the size of the nation's economy,'' he said, and the figure projected on Friday is 3.8 percent of the gross domestic product, ''well within historical range'' and much lower than the record 6 percent reached in 1983.
 Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, challenged that, saying that if the surplus in the Social Security trust fund was discounted, the deficit would be more than $600 billion in this fiscal year, 5.2 percent of the economy.
 Mr. Bolten attributed the worsened government balance sheet to ''an extraordinary confluence of adversity: the stock market downturn that began in 2000, and the subsequent recession that the president inherited as he took office; the terrorist attacks on America, and subsequent spending for homeland security and the war on terror; and the crisis in confidence produced by corporate scandals years in the making.''
 He did not mention the effects of Mr. Bush's tax cuts. But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has calculated that about half of the budget turnaround was caused by the weaker economy, about a quarter by higher spending and about a quarter by lower revenue because of the tax reductions.
 In September, the budget office, which uses a method of calculation different from the White House's, will publish its own revised deficit forecast for the fiscal year.
 Although the deadline is often missed, the mid-session review is supposed to be completed by July 15 under the budget law. Democrats accused the White House of stalling so the new numbers could not be criticized during their party's convention this week. Mr. Bolten said the delay was necessary to make sure the numbers were accurate.

HEADLINE: Economy Slowed In 2nd Quarter, U.S. Report Says

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
The pace of economic growth slowed abruptly in the second quarter of the year as consumers forced to pay higher energy bills curbed their spending on just about everything else, the government reported yesterday.
 The Commerce Department estimated that the nation's gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of economic activity -- expanded at an annual rate of 3 percent in the April-to-June quarter, sharply below the 4.5 percent growth achieved in the first quarter of the year and less than the expectations of Wall Street analysts.
 Many economists, mostly blaming the surge in energy prices for the slowdown, still expect growth to pick up in the second half of the year. But the downshift heightened broader concerns about whether American consumers -- no longer enjoying big windfalls from tax cuts and mortgage refinancing -- can continue to push the economy forward as strongly as in the past.
 ''The message is that growth in the second half should do better,'' said Nigel Gault, United States economist at Global Insight, a research firm. ''But the consumer can't carry the burden of supporting growth'' alone much longer. 
 The slowdown was a setback to efforts by President Bush to point to solid growth as a validation of his administration's economic policies, and played into the hands of his Democratic challenger, Senator John Kerry, who has criticized the White House's economic approach.
 In a speech at a campaign stop in Springfield, Mo., Mr. Bush did not mention the latest snapshot of the nation's economic performance. Instead, he urged support for his policies by stressing that the economy has grown relatively briskly for about a year, adding more than 1.5 million jobs since last August. 
 ''We have more to do to make America's economy stronger,'' Mr. Bush said.
 Treasury Secretary John Snow portrayed the gross domestic product report as evidence of ''an economy growing at a steady pace.''
 By contrast, Jason Furman, an economic adviser in Senator Kerry's campaign, said that the slowdown in growth ''makes it harder for them to make the argument that Bush's economic strategy is working.''
 Mr. Furman added that the latest evidence ''rebuts their argument that the economy is getting better and better.''
 The stock market barely reacted to the new statistics, but long-term interest rates fell and bond prices rose markedly, as slower growth indicated to investors that the Federal Reserve was less likely to push up its benchmark interest rate in an aggressive fashion.
 Beyond the political positioning, the data painted a mixed scenario. Changes in consumer spending -- which counts for roughly two-thirds of economic output -- caused virtually all of the deceleration in the second quarter.
 Personal consumption spending slowed to a 1 percent annual growth rate, the most sluggish pace since the second quarter of 2001, when the economy was in the midst of a recession, down from a rate of 4.1 percent in the first three months of the year. Sales of durable goods -- things like cars, furniture and appliances -- actually fell slightly. 
 ''The consumer is overextended,'' said Charles Dumas, chief international economist at Lombard Street Research in London.
 Other parts of the economy, however, fared much better. 
 Residential construction continued at a sizzling pace, growing by 10 percent compared with the first quarter of the year as still-low interest rates continued to fuel the housing market. 
 Companies also stepped up their investment in new equipment, with business spending growing by 8.9 percent -- almost double the rate of the previous quarter. They built up inventories by a small amount in anticipation of a renewal of healthier consumer spending. Exports also grew at a much faster pace, benefiting from a weaker dollar.
 These sources of growth were insufficient, however, to make up for the slowing pace of consumer purchases. 
 Some businesses still focused on reducing bloated stocks from past periods of disappointing sales. ''We haven't won the battle with inventories yet,'' said George Pippis, sales analysis manager at Ford Motor. Indeed, the diminished output of motor vehicles alone subtracted a full percent of growth from the quarterly expansion. 
 The government contribution to the economy waned, too, constrained by a budget deficit that is now predicted to reach $445 billion by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Federal spending slowed to a 2.7 percent growth rate from 7.1 percent in the preceding three months.
 The economic data did provide a mild dose of good news for President Bush. In part because an earlier revision of initial estimates found that the economy shrank slightly in the third quarter of 2000, administration officials have argued that Mr. Bush inherited the recession (officially dated from March to November 2001) from his predecessor, President Clinton.
 Now, according to fresh revisions presented yesterday by the Commerce Department, the downturn of 2001 looks even spottier and lighter then previously estimated, with gross domestic product contracting by 0.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2001, instead of 0.7 percent.
 Yet even as the downturn was milder than first reported, so the recovery was weaker. The average annual rate of gross domestic product growth from the fourth quarter of 2001 to the first quarter of 2004 remained unchanged at 2.5 percent.
 For the economic expansion to return to brisker growth, businesses will need to pick up the baton from consumers -- investing more in capital equipment and adding more jobs so that income growth from wages and salaries can in turn refuel spending.
 Job growth, however, took a dip in June, expanding by barely 112,000, less than necessary to absorb the natural growth of the labor force. Wages, adjusted for inflation, declined and the average number of hours in the work week fell. 
 ''The negative factors are building up,'' Mr. Dumas said. 
 Some economists suggested, however, that the soft patch in the second quarter is more likely to be temporary than a serious roadblock to sustained growth. Higher inflation -- which pushed the gross domestic product price index up by 3.2 percent in the quarter -- was mostly due to energy price increases. Indeed, the so-called core inflation rate, which excludes the effects of food and energy, rose only 2.4 percent, lower than in the previous quarter. 
 Robert Barbera, chief economist at IG Hoenig, argued that with oil prices currently hovering around $40 a barrel, they were unlikely to go much higher. ''The energy price effect,'' he said, is ''a one-time squeeze on purchasing power.''
 Mr. Barbera further added that current low inventories bode well for the future. They would allow businesses to react quickly to signs of increasing demand, immediately ramping up production, investing in capital equipment and hiring more workers.
 Several other signs also point to a rebound in economic growth. Weekly jobless claims stayed comfortably under 350,000 in July, a level that often suggests robust employment gains. Recent indicators suggest the pace of manufacturing is picking up again.
 Even auto sales bounced back in July after a bout of weakness in June. ''In the second half,'' Mr. Pippis at Ford predicted, ''we will start seeing the impact of job growth.''
 Mr. Gault, the economist, agreed -- to a point. ''I don't think this is the start of the big consumer pullback yet,'' he said. ''But the underlying force is that consumer spending growth will slow.''
