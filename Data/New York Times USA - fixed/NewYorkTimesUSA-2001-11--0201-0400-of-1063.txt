HEADLINE: The Heartland Hunkers Down; 
Cincinnati Area Is Taking Job Losses in Stride, for Now

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: CINCINNATI 

 BODY:
Even as the economy worsens, the giant Procter & Gamble, the most prominent corporation with headquarters here, is still relying on a softer approach to shrinking its work force, offering early retirement packages and other incentives instead of handing out pink slips.
 Across the Ohio River near the airport, tiny Pilot Air Freight is struggling to cope with the downturn in business and the added costs of increased security. But it has not yet laid off any of its 15 employees. Instead, it cut costs by requiring each of them to take off a week without pay on a rotating basis. 
 "Businesses have been crawling into a shell across the country and their behavior is just beginning to affect the broader community," said Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, a data-gathering and consulting firm in West Chester, Pa. That is certainly the case in the Cincinnati metropolitan area, a sprawling 13-county area in Ohio and Kentucky with 1.7 million people where the median income and the mix of companies roughly mirror the nation as a whole. 
Indeed, for all the growing economic distress here and elsewhere, so far the deterioration has been gradual and few among the newly unemployed express desperation -- yet -- about finding work. Despite the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 and the sudden acceleration nationally in job cuts and unemployment, the downturn here resembles a slowly leaking tire rather than a blowout.
That could change. The air is beginning to leak more rapidly. With layoffs piling up and many companies increasingly reluctant to hire, the nation is clearly in a recession and wages are going up more slowly, on average, than six months ago, according to government data.
But the surge in unemployment, to a rate of 5.4 percent last month, is still well below the peak of 7.5 percent in 1992, when the United States was struggling out of its last recession. During the long expansion of the 1980's, for that matter, the unemployment rate was rarely as low as it still is today. 
That shows here in Cincinnati. Even among the well-dressed unemployed men and women who filled the basement assembly hall of a suburban church on a recent Monday morning, the mood was remarkably sanguine. A year ago almost no one showed up at these spirit-lifting weekly sessions of the Job Search Focus Group, and it nearly disbanded. With the surge in layoffs, attendance has surged, too.
Yet being laid off has not yet turned into a particularly frightening experience for Agnes Hudak, a 41-year-old nurse and hospital administrator, or for many of the 85 others gathered at the Community United Methodist Church in the northern suburb of Hyde Park. The conversation and testimonials were all about how to behave in an interview, how to display just the right amount of eagerness, how to follow up without seeming pushy -- how, in sum, to land a new job that has close to the same status and pay as the lost one.
"I could go out today and get work as a floor nurse and earn $45,000," Ms. Hudak said. She had earned $63,000 a year as the manager of patient support services at Mercy Hospital, until Mercy, seeking to cut costs, combined her operation with two others, dropping two of the managers. Her last day was Sept. 10. 
The terrorist attacks hit some parts of the economy harder than others, of course. Over the last 15 years, Cincinnati's big hub airport -- it is Delta Air Lines' second largest -- gave rise to an outsized hotel and convention industry that today provides nearly 10 percent of the metropolitan area's 890,000 jobs. Hotel occupancy rates were falling before the terrorist attacks, and they fell again in response. A few restaurants have closed. Layoffs in the travel industry have passed the 1,500 mark.
A mid-October convention of the Electrical Manufacturing and Coil Winding Association, scheduled to draw 5,000 delegates, drew only 3,000. And in a joint e-mail to thousands of local companies, the Chamber of Commerce and the Convention and Visitors Bureau urged them to hold their meetings and conferences in local hotels, not out-of-town.
Less noticeably, the many small companies in the new commercial neighborhoods around the airport are struggling to regain their stride. Pilot Air Freight, for example, is once again sending freight in Delta cargo bays, but its growth has been hampered in a different way -- by the complicated security procedures required to get clearance for the shipments of new customers.
"In the past, you might sign a new client, throw the first shipment in the car and come rushing back, excited that you had hooked one," said Michael Schwartz, Pilot's president. "We can't do that anymore and it is slowing our growth."
Because of the terrorism, revenues plunged in September, to $2.1 million from $2.7 million in August, and are only now recovering, Mr. Schwartz said. But he can only hold on for so long. "I think we can overcome the security issues faster than we can overcome the downturn in the economy," he said. "Ultimately we may have to adjust head count."
Empower MediaMarketing, an advertising agency, has delivered pink slips to 30 of its 140 employees. But Brian McHale, the president, speaks of a pickup in business lately. "We expect to be in a position to rehire early next year," he said.
Whether he is right or wrong about that, Empower's departed employees were among the 49 percent of Greater Cincinnati's work force averaging $20 an hour in pay. From the ranks of this large group come the laid off workers crowding into the Hyde Park church on Monday mornings. But for all the step-up in job losses, the unemployment rate in Greater Cincinnati has only recently approached 4 percent from 3.4 percent on average last year.
By historical standards, 4 percent is low, close to what would have been considered full employment even in the 1960's. So is the national unemployment rate, despite the jump to 5.4 percent in October from 4.9 percent in September, reported by the Labor Department last Friday. 
That helps to explain why Ms. Hudak is holding out and why Matt Guye, 34, a salesman laid off on Aug. 2 from a $45,000-a-year job, also resisted accepting a substantial pay cut. Encouraged by others at the job group, he recently turned down $30,000 a year to sell insurance, although Mr. Guye has four children and a stay-at-home wife. Last week he finally took a job selling forklifts and similar equipment for $39,000 a year, plus commissions and the promise of future promotions.
"If I took a lesser job, I would be selling myself short," he said. "I did that once, after an earlier layoff. I don't want to do it again. I've made commitments based on a certain lifestyle."
While Mr. Guye scrambles, the downturn is hardly visible among the 1,400 members of the New Prospect Baptist Church, in a low-income black neighborhood where underemployment and low wages are always a problem. Most of the parishioners work as post office clerks, or in similar civil service jobs, or in the private sector where there is still a demand for hospital orderlies, fast food servers, physical therapists, security guards and warehouse workers, at $6 to $10 an hour.
"Only one member of my congregation has told me that he was laid off, and he worked at a hotel," said the Rev. Damon Lynch III, New Prospect's pastor and the leader of the Cincinnati Black United Front. "Middle class people are getting laid off, but they have not fallen far enough to bump the people below them. If the downturn continues, that may happen."
The downturn is particularly noticeable in the sudden reluctance of business to expand, after five years of booming, sometimes reckless expansion. "There is a lot of wait and see," said Stephen J. Schrantz, an executive vice president of Fifth Third Bank, who reports that lending activity for capital investment is sluggish. "They are not borrowing to add capacity when they do not need more capacity."
The pullback has cut deeply into a strategy that Cincinnati had counted on for new jobs and economic growth. Like many cities, Cincinnati has been lavish in offering tax breaks and other subsidies to companies willing to expand, whether they were outsiders seeking a new site or companies already here and planning to put up a warehouse, expand a factory or build a new office complex. Japanese auto parts makers were willing to set up shop in the Cincinnati area to supply several auto assembly plants in Kentucky, Ohio and southeastern Indiana. 
Today, though, postponement is the rule. Fidelity Investments, a unit of FMR, has put off an expansion of its telephone customer service center on the Kentucky side of the river. DHL Worldwide Express, the air freight company, has delayed the construction of a new package sorting facility near the airport. Four Japanese projects are on hold "while Japanese executives wait for their companies to decide that it is O.K. to travel again," said Joseph Kramer, vice president for economic development of the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce.
The damage is evident in the chamber's scorecard for 2001. Through the first 10 months, there were only 148 projects involving $1.4 billion in capital spending in the metropolitan area, well off the pace of 255 projects and $2.4 billion last year. And even that exaggerates the growth: several of this year's major projects represented consolidations rather than expansions. Sara Lee, for example, consolidated its food division headquarters in a new office building in suburban Blue Ash, closing facilities in Memphis and Chicago. That added 200 jobs in Cincinnati, but for the national economy as a whole, the consolidation represented a net job loss.
With business expansion on hold, consumers and government are being called on to step into the breach. There is evidence of erosion on those fronts as well, although the evidence is more mixed. Sales tax revenue, an indicator of consumer spending, is falling in central Cincinnati, but holding steady or rising in outlying, wealthier neighborhoods. Credit card debt and home equity loans are rising, Fifth Third Bank reports, but savings account balances are rising faster. "People are telling us," Robert P. Niehaus, an executive vice president, said, that "they want cash readily available just in case."

HEADLINE: OPEC Says Oil Quotas Could Drop Up to 6.5% 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The secretary general of OPEC said yesterday that it might reduce oil production as much as 1.5 million barrels a day, or 6.5 percent, since prices have fallen to a two-year low.
 There is the probability of a million-barrel-a-day to a 1.5-million-barrel-a-day cut, the agency reported, citing the secretary general, Ali Rodriguez Araque, who spoke at a news conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, during the three-day Council on Petroleum Conference of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. 
 Ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are scheduled to meet on Nov. 14 in Vienna. OPEC wants oil prices to be $22 to $28 a barrel and has lowered production quotas three times this year, by a total of 3.5 million barrels a day. 
OPEC has been lobbying with independent producers like Russia, Norway and Mexico to join a new round of supply curbs. Only Oman, a Persian Gulf state that pumps about one million barrels of oil a day, has said it supports another reduction. The group will need support from outside nations to succeed, Mr. Rodriguez said.
In New York, crude oil for December delivery fell 16 cents yesterday, to $20.02 a barrel, a two-year low. In London, Brent crude oil for December delivery fell 33 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $19.44 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.
"OPEC is in a very tough situation," said John Cairns, an oil and gas economist in Singapore at IDEAglobal, a research firm. "Demand has gone down to such an extent, and they have to react.
"But the size of the cuts they are going to have to do is very large, and they will be very difficult to enforce."
The International Energy Agency said last month that world oil demand would rise at the slowest pace in 17 years because the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks had reduced travel and undermined an already slowing world economy.
Oil analysts have been skeptical that OPEC will succeed with a new reduction, given that members exceeded their official production quotas by 850,000 barrels a day last month, according to PetroLogistics, a consulting company.
Compliance with quotas is now at 90 percent within OPEC, Mr. Rodriguez said, but he gave no details. "The first issue is full compliance of our commitments," he said.
Indonesia will ask OPEC at the meeting next week to lower output by 500,000 barrels a day, Baihaki Hakim, president director of the state oil and gas company, Pertamina, said on Oct. 26. Mr. Rodriguez said last month that production cuts would be 700,000 to one million barrels a day.

HEADLINE: Nicaragua Voters Reject Ortega's Bid for the Presidency 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
Enrique Bolanos, a businessman who was arrested and stripped of property in the 1980's for his outspoken opposition to Sandinista rule, was elected president of Nicaragua today, defeating his nemesis, Daniel Ortega, by a surprisingly wide margin.
 Strong voter turnout led Mr. Bolanos's Liberal Party to capture an estimated 53.7 percent of the vote compared with 44.7 percent for Mr. Ortega, the Sandinista leader, after 13 percent of the nation's precincts had been tallied. 
 Political analysts said the margin of victory, which defied opinion polls showing the two candidates in a statistical tie, resulted both from fear of the Sandinistas' past and declarations by American officials who doubted the sincerity of Mr. Ortega's statements that he had moderated his political views and wanted a national reconciliation. 
Campaign workers were carried triumphantly atop shoulders to Mr. Bolanos's headquarters as the crowd screamed "Strikeout! Strikeout!" in celebration of Mr. Ortega's third defeat at the polls since the Sandinistas were voted out of office in 1990.
"Yesterday we made long lines and stood in the sun and rain to show our commitment to the country," Mr. Bolanos told the cheering crowd. "We are making history in this great civic journey. Nicaragua won, and we have made another step to consolidating democracy."
Mr. Bolanos's campaign had focused heavily in recent weeks on what he termed the Sandinistas' responsibility for an economic and social disaster as well as their leader's ties to nations that supported terrorists. By contrast, Mr. Bolanos today struck a conciliatory tone, describing the Sandinistas as a "modern" political party. "I congratulate the Sandinista Party and their candidate, Daniel Ortega," he said. "I congratulate them with all my heart. Nicaraguan brothers, I invite you to accompany me in building a new Nicaragua."
Mr. Ortega, addressing supporters at midday at party headquarters, where the word "President" had been painted out over his name, appeared subdued and gracious in conceding defeat. He said that members of his political coalition, the National Convergence, which included former enemies, would continue to work together.
"The economic situation in which the nation finds itself is so grave that the Convergence will support the governability of the country," he said. "We are going to support the democracy which should go to strengthen the independence of our institutions." 
Mr. Ortega's supporters and advisers criticized the United States for what they saw as its meddling in internal affairs, likening it to the American effort to support the contra resistance army.
"We must congratulate Washington because their intimidation tactics worked," said the Rev. Miguel D'Escoto, a former Sandinista foreign minister. "They are now into electoral terrorism among a people here where the wounds are still open. We did not lose 5,000 people like in New York, we lost 50,000 in a war that was invented, organized, armed and financed by the United States."
Mr. Bolanos faces an economy that has been battered in recent years by falling coffee prices and a debilitating drought. Investor confidence had plummeted this year, with business owners nervous about both a possible Sandinista victory and rampant corruption under the current administration of President Arnoldo Aleman. Foreign reserves have fallen and several banks have failed.
Both voters and analysts suggested that Mr. Bolanos's background in business and with civic groups, as well as the support of Washington, might help repair the economy.
Political analysts said his margin of victory might help to counter the continued influence of Mr. Aleman, who as a former president will assume a leadership post in the National Assembly. The position gives Mr. Aleman immunity from prosecution, although Mr. Bolanos has vowed that no one will be above the law.
Mr. Bolanos, 73, was born in Masaya, a community southeast of Managua famous as the cradle of the country's best artisans. He studied industrial engineering at St. Louis University in Missouri, and owned many agricultural businesses, including cotton plantations and coffee processing plants.
In the 1980's, when domestic political groups were powerless to confront the Sandinista government, Mr. Bolanos was the vocal president of the Superior Council of Private Enterprise of Nicaragua, a business coalition. He refused to go into exile or stop criticizing Sandinista confiscations of businesses and land.
"He has been a successful businessman with a definite character and impeccable honor," said Dr. Anastasio Somaribba, the current president of the private enterprise council. "He has the determination of a man with a clear idea of where he wants to go."
Mr. Bolanos was detained several times during Sandinista rule, including one arrest for six days in 1989 with other leaders of his business group. In 1986, he and his wife returned from church to find a masked man going through his files. The couple's cries for help scared him away. Three times during the 1980's, various businesses and properties were confiscated by the government, costing him a total of $9 million, for which Mr. Bolanos says he has yet to be fully compensated.
Although he is low key in public, acquaintances say he is warm and open in private. 
The election on Sunday took place with hardly any glitches, and fears of violence or fraud failed to materialize. The only tumult in the streets today were joyful Liberals dancing, cheering and letting off fireworks.
"The country has clearly demonstrated its political maturity," said Jannis Sakellariou, the chief of the European Union's electoral observation mission.
The country also demonstrated that it was still unwilling to accept Mr. Ortega's repeated insistence that he had changed, even as he waged a largely positive campaign that focused on helping the poorest. 
It was not clear if Mr. Ortega's third unsuccessful presidential run would lead the Sandinistas to select a new leader. 
Mr. Ortega would not speculate. "Let the oven get cold," he said. "It is premature for that talk."

HEADLINE: Some New Talents Gain as Stores Buy American 

BYLINE:  By GINIA BELLAFANTE 

 BODY:
A few days after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Hattie Carnegie, the shopkeeper, dress manufacturer and employer of personages as varied as Norman Norell and Lucille Ball, received a frantic phone call in her Manhattan workroom. It came from a friend in San Francisco, one of the Magnin brothers, proprietors of the department store that bore the family name.
 "The Japanese are at our door, close up," is how Pauline Trigere, who then worked as a designer for Ms. Carnegie, remembered Mr. Magnin's announcement. Ms. Carnegie, fearing fabric shortages and a diminished interest in shopping, temporarily shut down her operation. Ms. Trigere, stunned and unemployed, went to Boston to visit friends. "I slept for 24 hours straight," she remembered. She soon returned to New York, rented part of the Carnegie studio herself and got into business. By February, she had a line of 11 dresses. 
 As the fashion world wonders what will become of itself in an America beset by terrorism, it may serve as some inspiration to be reminded that the World War II years conferred upon New York its status as a pre-eminent disseminator of style. "American couture became what it was in 1942, '43," Ms. Trigere said. "The minute Americans couldn't get to Paris anymore." 
During the early 40's, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia organized committees to explore ways to lure editors and buyers to Manhattan. Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and the publicist Eleanor Lambert, who established the Coty Awards in 1943, worked in consort promoting American design. By the late 40's, names like Trigere, Norell and Claire McCardell had become essential to anyone's understanding of fashion.
Though the current geopolitical crisis is unlikely to leave American enterprise isolated to such a point, it could boost novice designers here who might otherwise have gone overlooked in favor of the young Belgian or the renegade Dutchman. Vogue's November issue already seems a harbinger of a fomenting spirit of Americana. 
Fear of traveling left empty seats at the spring 2002 shows in Milan and Paris last month -- seats that would have been filled by American buyers who use time abroad not only to evaluate runway collections, but also to traipse back alleys and fire escapes for the undiscovered talent crocheting the most glorious bell-sleeved vicuna cardigan known to man or woman.
Large and well-financed European labels have brought their collections to buyers in New York, meaning there will be no shortage of Prada next spring. But that buyers at Henri Bendel, say, spent one-third less time in Europe than in recent seasons means that independent European designers lost out on attention that was directed instead at their American counterparts.
Bendel's has added seven new, young American designers to its roster, said Ed Burstell, the store's fashion director. Among them are Zac Posen, 20, a New Yorker, and another downtown designer, Jess Holzworth. Michael Soheil's order at Bendel's doubled over last season. Mr. Soheil's career got a jump-start when he was asked to participate in a group show sponsored by Vogue in September -- a show for young designers whose presentations were canceled after Sept. 11.
"Every retailer is looking for news, and if it is not coming from Europe it has got to come from somewhere," Mr. Burstell said. Sarah Hailes and Beth Buccini, owners of Kirna Zabete in SoHo, usually spend over two weeks in Europe each season. This time out, their trip lasted only four days and was limited to Paris. They've dropped the Londoner Jessica Ogden for next season and added three young New Yorkers to the mix: the team of Lutz & Patmos, Behnaz Sarafpour and Alvin Valley. 
Bendel's has also increased orders from other young Americans already represented. "Someone like Alice Roi has become more important for us," Mr. Burstell said. Another designer, a Chicago native, Alicia Bell, was surprised to discover that Bendel's wanted more from her for next spring.
Eliminated by Nordstrom for next season, Ms. Bell, whose clothes fall under the category of romantically tweedy, said that her business won't suffer despite the gloom she had anticipated. "I picked up a lot of new boutiques in places like Houston, North Carolina -- places I never thought I'd reach. Frankly, I'm shocked."
Someone like Tess Giberson, a designer who makes all her pieces herself in her West 14th Street studio, is also oddly poised to do well at a time when buyers want to place small orders. 
Indeed, it is small boutique owners who don't necessarily have the budgets or inclination to travel who will turn to such producers more readily now. Last year, Delia Seaman, the owner of Curve, an innovative shop in Beverly Hills, decided that the way she could compete with the Barneys of the world was to venture off to unchartered fashion territories like Argentina. Ms. Seaman said she will now concentrate on Los Angeles design. "I don't feel as if it is safe to be an American anywhere anymore," said Ms. Seaman, who dreads even flying to New York. Also, "retail is awful, the economy is terrible, and when you go to Europe for a buy it's a $25,000 minimum order," she said. 
Marisa Hartington got the idea to increase her representation of American designers when she received a call from Gianfranco Ferre's office in Italy shortly after Sept. 11. The owner of Marissa Collections, a boutique in Naples, Fla., Ms. Hartington had planned to present a Ferre runway and trunk show in November. But Mr. Ferre decided not to fly, and Ms. Hartington chose to be host to a show of Americans only. 
A purveyor of labels like Jil Sander and John Galliano, Ms. Hartington said her store is 70 percent European, but that by next spring it would be 50 percent American. "The American designers offer what we want right now," Ms. Hartington said. "Because costumy clothes are really over." 
Complications that might arise from shipping across the Atlantic could also move some to reconsider Europeans. "I'm worried about deliveries and what might get held up at customs," said Lynwood Holmberg, the women's wear buyer at Mario's, a store that caters to the monied technocrats of Seattle. Another concern, she said, is that shipping companies are already increasing their fees because of greater security costs.
Of course, there is another reason to traffic in American fashion, namely, patriotism. "There was a woman in the store recently, a former Microsoft executive, who was going to a wedding in France," Ms. Holmberg said. It was important to her that she wear something American. She bought a gown by Robert Danes.

HEADLINE: Triton Reports Bigger Loss 

DATELINE: BERWYN, Pa., Nov. 5 

 BODY:
Triton PCS, the wireless telephone company, said today that its third-quarter loss widened from the similar quarter last year and it added fewer subscribers than expected but revenue rose 50 percent as customer turnover remained low. 
 "Even under challenging economic conditions, we continued to exceed expectations," Michael Kalogris, chairman and chief executive of Triton said, for many crucial operating and financial measurements, like average monthly revenue per subscriber. 
 Triton sells wireless service in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and Kentucky under the name SunCom.
Shares of Triton closed down 85 cents, or about 2.6 percent, at $31.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company reported its results after regular trading hours.

Fed Is Facing a Challenge In Rate-Cutting Campaign
After nine interest rate cuts this year, the Federal Reserve may be preparing to temper its campaign to revive the economy, analysts said. The Fed is all but certain to lower its benchmark rate today. But economists and investors are divided over whether the cut will be a half-percentage point or a quarter-point.
 Whichever choice it makes, the Fed faces a series of tricky trade-offs. It is under pressure to bolster consumer confidence, support stock prices and be seen as responding aggressively to the surge in unemployment. At the same time, Fed officials are clearly concerned about overdoing their rate cuts. Page C2. 

Cisco Results Beat Expectations
Cisco Systems posted a first-quarter loss as sales fell 32 percent from those in the period a year earlier. But the results exceeded Wall Street's expectations and signaled that the company's steep, yearlong slide has apparently stopped. For the first time this calendar year, Cisco's revenue increased from the previous quarter, surpassing the company's projections of flat to slightly weaker sales. Before Cisco announced its results, its shares closed at $17.90, up 64 cents. Market Place. C6.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE LIABILITY; 
Insurance Companies Favor a Plan to Limit Terrorism Losses

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
With time running short for Congress to adopt a plan that would help the insurance industry deal with losses from future terrorist attacks, the insurers say they strongly favor a Senate plan that would require them to pay for the first $10 billion in damage.
 While they would prefer to shoulder less than $10 billion initially, they say a House plan, which provides long-term loans, is less appealing because it sets no limits on how big their losses might eventually be. 
 Without some measure of their potential losses, the insurers say, they cannot set prices and provide coverage against terrorist attacks. The Bush administration and banking and real estate executives have said that such coverage is crucial for the economy. Bankers, for example, say they would not make loans on projects unless they were insured against terrorist attacks. 
Despite their dissatisfaction, the insurers are reluctant to criticize either proposal because they would rather have some assistance than none. If debate over the plan bogs down, the insurers could be left without a decision by Congress when it recesses for Thanksgiving on Nov. 16. It is unclear whether Congress will go back into session before the end of the year. 
About 70 percent of the commercial insurance policies are renewed annually in January, and insurers are saying they will not include terrorism coverage unless some way is found to limit their risks. 
The insurers now expect the Senate and the House to pass their respective bills and try to work out the differences in joint conferences. The House Financial Services Committee is expected to vote on its measure on Wednesday; the Senate Banking Committee is expected to act within a few days.
So far, the insurers have no compromise plan that would meld the two approaches, but the White House initially offered a plan similar to the one being advanced by the Senate, and its influence may break the deadlock.
Another aspect of the Senate plan, similar to the White House's proposal, is that the government would pay for 90 percent of the losses from a terrorist attack after the insurers paid the first $10 billion. 
Over the next several days, insurance executives and lobbyists plan to try to convince legislators of the benefits of the Senate plan.
One adjustment they are seeking is to find a way to apply the $10 billion deductible to insurance companies in proportion to their market size. 
"We don't do business as a group," said Julie A. Rochman, a senior vice president of the American Insurance Association, a trade group. "We do business as individual companies."
The House plan, which makes insurers eligible for long-term loans after $100 million in losses, addresses the losses of companies individually and may, in part, serve as a guide for adjusting the Senate plan, the insurers say. 
The insurance industry rarely manages to present a united front. But several trade groups say they have forged an alliance with the goal of at least getting the limits of potential losses in an attack defined. 
"If the industry splits," said Joseph Annotti, a spokesman for the National Association of Independent Insurers, "the chances increase of something bad getting enacted."

HEADLINE: Rate Reduction Expected, but How Big? 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
After nine interest rate cuts this year, the Federal Reserve may be preparing to temper its campaign to revive the economy, analysts said today.
 The Fed is all but certain to cut its benchmark federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks for a 10th time when it meets on Tuesday. But economists and investors are divided over whether the central bank will cut the rate by half a percentage point, as it has done on seven of nine occasions this year, or hold the reduction to a quarter of a percentage point. 
 The rate now stands at 2.5 percent, its lowest level since the early 1960's and four percentage points lower than where it was at the beginning of the year. 
Whichever choice it makes, the Fed faces a series of tricky trade-offs. It is under pressure to bolster consumer confidence heading into the holiday shopping season, support stock prices at a time when Wall Street is still getting its legs back and be seen as responding aggressively to the surge in unemployment last month.
With interest rates on mortgages and other long-term borrowing having fallen last week, economists said more cuts in the Fed's short-term rates would help lock in the lower long-term rates set in the bond market, helping the economy substantially.
At the same time, Fed officials are clearly concerned about overdoing their rate cuts. Failing to be patient about giving this year's rate cuts time to work could lead to the economy overheating next year.
And continuing to cut rates in coming months -- especially in half-point increments -- could leave the United States approaching the bind that is bedeviling Japan, where official interest rates are close to zero, leaving Japan's central bank severely constrained in its ability to fight a continuing recession.
As a result, some economists said, the Fed is likely to hold a rate cut to a quarter point on Tuesday. Those economists who are forecasting a half-point cut said it might well be the last of that magnitude, with any further cuts likely limited to a quarter point.
Diane C. Swonk, chief economist at Bank One in Chicago, said the Fed is likely to have a vigorous debate on Tuesday, but to come down on the side of a quarter-point cut.
"There are those at the Fed who are going to be less willing to ease further despite market expectations for additional easing," she said. "There will be those who want to appear awake at the wheel and keep investor confidence buoyed. It nets out to something a little more conservative than the markets are actually expecting."
The Fed and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, try to avoid the impression that they are responding to any single economic indicator or even to one month's data. But the news last week that the unemployment rate shot up in October by half a percentage point, to 5.4 percent, plus a raft of other gloomy statistics have clearly put pressure on Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues to be responsive to the mounting evidence that the economy continues to deteriorate.
In another sign of spreading trouble, the National Association of Purchasing Management reported today that its its index of business activity outside of the manufacturing sector fell to 40.6 in October from 50.2 in September, a much steeper downturn that economists had anticipated. 
The figures suggested that the service sector had joined manufacturing in suffering through a deep retreat following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
At the same time, the Fed is always concerned about getting into big pendulumlike swings in policy. Should the central bank ease too much this year and ignite inflation pressures next year, it would be forced to reverse course and begin raising rates.
Economists seem relatively evenly divided about whether the Fed will choose to cut rates on Tuesday by half a point or a quarter of a point.
Kurt Karl, the chief United States economist at Swiss Re, the insurance company, said he thinks a half-point is more likely. But the Fed will soon have to start signaling that it will limit any further rate reductions to a quarter point, he said.
"They have to bring sentiment around from these bigger cuts to smaller cuts," Mr. Karl said. Continuing to cut rates aggressively in coming months, he said, might please investors "but not do much for the economy in the short run and do some harm at the end of next year."
Wayne M. Ayers, chief economist at FleetBoston Financial, said the Fed would probably limit its rate cut on Tuesday to a quarter point because of the likelihood that Congress and the Bush administration will ultimately agree on a fiscal stimulus package of new tax cuts and government spending that would give the economy a boost next year.
Mr. Ayers said the Fed might keep cutting rates for some time to push the federal funds rate down to around 1.5 percent, where it would be roughly equal to Mr. Greenspan's favored measure of inflation, the core personal consumption deflator.
When inflation and the federal funds rate are equal, the so-called real interest rate is zero, meaning that banks are essentially able to borrow money for nothing. The Fed only tends to push rates that low when it is acting aggressively to bring the economy out of recession. By other measures, including the Consumer Price Index, the real rate is already at zero or below.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE UNEMPLOYED; 
Attacks Hit Low-Pay Jobs The Hardest

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON and EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The terrorists who attacked the World Trade Center may have been trying to crush American capitalism and its masters of the universe on Wall Street. But the economic impact of the attack is felling a very different group of people: cooks, cabdrivers, sales clerks and seamstresses.
 Workers in traditionally low-wage industries, like restaurants and hotels, retailing and transportation, have been hit hard in the fallout from Sept. 11, according to a new analysis from the New York State Department of Labor. 
 And a report released yesterday by the labor-backed Fiscal Policy Institute forecasts that almost 80,000 people will have lost their jobs by the end of the year and that 60 percent of these positions paid an average of $23,000 a year. That is far below the citywide average salary of roughly $58,000. 
"The spillover effects hit the retail and service industries very hard in New York City," said James Parrott, the chief economist for the institute. "And those tend to be lower-wage jobs."
The sudden decline in these jobs marks a sea change in the economy since Sept. 11. Earlier this year, while the job market was softening, the losses were concentrated among white-collar workers like dot-com programmers, stockbrokers and advertising executives.
Now, they are concentrated among people like Kim Daily. A single mother of two, Ms. Daily worked her way up from a $6-an-hour-job picking up room-service trays to a $15-an-hour job stocking minibars at the World Trade Center Marriott.
When the hotel was destroyed on Sept. 11, so was her job. And she has not been able to find another one.
It is not for lack of trying; she stood in line for four hours outside a city-sponsored job fair but never even made it in the door. She has been talking to her union, but the only position available so far was so tip-dependent that she worried it would not cover her $700-a-month rent. A job bank had only a few hotel positions, and none paid anywhere near the $25,000 she earned at the Marriott last year.
"I don't want to go for less money," she said.
The changed job market raises huge challenges for the city at a time when hundreds of thousands of families have moved off the welfare rolls. The most successful of these former welfare recipients, as well as many newcomers to this country, found jobs at hotels and restaurants, as cleaners at office buildings and as messengers in Lower Manhattan.
"Now that the economy has exploded along with the World Trade Center, their prospects of staying in the world of work have diminished," said David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society of New York, which has been helping workers who lost their jobs after Sept. 11.
His group is recommending a government-financed jobs program, he said. "Otherwise, we'll have people sitting on stoops, getting a little check and doing nothing," he said.
How many New Yorkers are unemployed is unclear. In a government survey taken in the week of Sept. 11, in which anyone who worked at all was counted as employed, 223,100 people in New York City were looking for work (after adjustments for seasonal factors). That was an increase of almost 20,000 people in a month. The unemployment rate hit 6.3 percent. 
The October survey will not be released for several weeks, but its results are included in federal figures, released Friday, that showed a surge in national unemployment, which rose by half a percentage point, to 5.4 percent. Unemployment insurance covers only about a third of unemployed workers, but the number of people applying for benefits in the city has soared. In the last month, an average of 12,745 people a week has applied; a year ago, that figure was 5,616.
A special program, Disaster Unemployment Assistance, is supposed to help those who are not eligible for unemployment insurance (usually because they worked part time or were self-employed). But only 2,350 people are now getting those benefits.
Almost 25,000 people told the New York State Department of Labor that they lost their jobs because of the trade center disaster. An analysis of the first 22,000 of those claims found that about 16 percent worked at bars and restaurants, 14 percent worked at hotels and 5 percent worked in air transportation. Only 4 percent worked at Wall Street brokerage firms (many of which simply relocated workers to Midtown or New Jersey).
The largest group of people -- 21 percent -- worked in a category called business services. Many of them were temporary workers, like Lisa Mendes, a single mother who lost her job as an accounting clerk on Sept. 12. In years past, when one temporary job ended, she could pick and choose among the offerings at the agencies. Now, "there's just nothing there," she said. "It's scary."
Ms. Mendes is typical of the unemployed in another way -- she lives in Brooklyn. The Labor Department analysis found that almost 26 percent of those who said they were jobless because of the twin towers collapse live in Brooklyn; 24 percent live in Queens, and 12 percent live in the Bronx. Just 18 percent live in Manhattan.
But Ms. Mendes, who is from Jamaica, is luckier than many of the unemployed because she speaks English and can use a computer. The Consortium for Worker Education, which runs a special program for people unemployed because of the disaster (and has already counseled more than 3,200 of them) has 5,000 jobs in its special job bank.
"Most of them are back-office jobs, data entry, word processing, administrative assistants," said Saul Rosen, associate executive director of the group.
Hotel and restaurant employment has been devastated by the destruction of the trade center and the steep drop in tourism that followed. Most restaurants are not unionized, but Local 100 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, which represents about 6,000 restaurant workers, says that 10 percent of its membership lost jobs immediately after Sept. 11. About 200 of those 600 have since found work, but not necessarily restaurant work.
John Haynes has a short-term job at the Immigrant Workers Assistance Alliance, helping undocumented workers. Until Sept. 11, he cooked meals on the 106th floor of the World Trade Center for the 250 employees of Windows on the World. He said he earned $488.80 a week before taxes, or about $25,400 a year, and he lives in public housing in the Bronx.
He does not think he will be able to go back into restaurant work, he says. "They are not hiring right now," he said. 'So I'm going to go for job training, either in computers or photo imaging."
The tourist and travel drought has hit many businesses in Queens, according to a new report by the Center for an Urban Future, a public policy group. Airline workers, freight forwarders, truckers and limousine drivers are all hurting.
Listen to Greg Buttle, who operates valet parking lots at the three major New York area airports: You park at these lots and workers will shuttle you to and from the terminal for about $13 a day plus tax. (They will also wash your car, change the oil, rotate or replace the tires, even pick up your dry cleaning.) Before, he normally had more than 150 cars in the lots; now, there are about 50, he said.
Mr. Buttle said he employed 45 people before Sept. 11; now he employs 30. "I tried to make sure that the part-timers who have come in most recently are the first ones to go," he said. "But some of our employees have worked for us for eight or nine years."
For more evidence of the spillover effect, look at Chinatown. Business has plunged at many of the more than 200 sewing shops below Houston Street and at least 20 went out of business in October, said May Chen, a vice president of Unite, the garment workers' union. At least a thousand of her 10,000 members have lost their jobs as stores and clothing companies have canceled orders. Others are working reduced hours.
Their job prospects are not good. "Because of the language barrier, sewing is about the only skill they have," said Susan Cowell, another union official.
Unite also represents workers at commercial laundries; because of the declines at many restaurants, about 600 of these workers have also been laid off.
With the public's attention riveted to the sad stories of the dead and the heroism of the rescuers, some workers fear that their plights will be ignored.
"No one wants to hear our stories," said Asmat M. Ali, a former captain at Windows on the World. "About a busboy or the dishwasher making $250 a week and raising three kids in an apartment in the Bronx or Brooklyn. But 80 percent of the people who worked in the World Trade Center fell in that category."

Peres and Arafat Meet At European Gathering
The Israeli foreign minister, Shimon Peres, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, met for the second time in three days, joining European Union officials for an informal evening gathering in Brussels. While the men discussed Middle East issues, Mr. Peres is under instructions from the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, to refrain from substantive negotiations with Mr. Arafat for now. In the absence of high-level American engagement in the Middle East, the European Union is seeking to provide the Arab world with at least an impression of movement in the peace process. A8

Mr. Sharon said he was postponing a trip to the United States this week because he had to stay in Israel to cope with a possible surge of terrorism. A8

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: AIRLINE SECURITY; 
F.B.I. Says Man Carried Knives Past Screeners

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
A Nepalese man was indicted today on a federal charge of trying to carry weapons onto an airplane, after the authorities said airline workers caught him boarding a flight to Omaha this weekend with several knives, a stun gun and a can of pepper spray.
 Eight employees of a private security company have been suspended for failing to detect the weapons in the man's carry-on bags at an earlier security checkpoint, although they did find two other knives in his pockets. 
 Norman Y. Mineta, secretary of transportation, called the incident at O'Hare International Airport a "failure of dramatic dimensions," and threatened to levy a "substantial fine" against the carrier that hired the security company, United Airlines. United, in turn, said it had hired an auditor to monitor the private companies that handle screening of luggage and passengers, and stationed United managers at all security checkpoints at airports across the country. 
The security company, Argenbright, issued a new policy today requiring an immediate search of carry-on bags for anyone caught with suspicious items, a measure it said went beyond federal regulations. 
"Customers should know and feel comforted in the fact that there are many levels of security at the airport," said a United spokeswoman, Susana A. Leyva. "There are many cross-checks and many backup procedures in place. No weapon was ever carried on board."
But Monique Bond, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Department of Aviation, said the suspension, rather than dismissal, of the Argenbright employees was "unacceptable."
"Since we don't have control over the company or the workers, there's nothing more we can do," Ms. Bond said. "The issue needs to be addressed and it clearly is not being addressed."
The man, Subash Bahadur Gurung, 27, was arrested by the F.B.I. on Sunday evening at the airport while retrieving his luggage; he had been released by the Chicago Police Department the previous night.
The authorities do not suspect any connection with the Sept. 11 attacks. Officials said Mr. Gurung, who was headed to Omaha to visit a friend, is unemployed and itinerant and in the United States illegally. Now being held without bond, Mr. Gurung faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine on the weapons charge.
"The investigation does not seem to reveal any illicit, nefarious, suspicious reason for his trip," said Randall Samborn, a spokesman for the United States attorney's office here. But the case is the latest to raise questions about airport security.
An affidavit filed today said Mr. Gurung was stripped of two knives at a security checkpoint on Saturday at about 5:30 p.m., yet arrived at his gate with weapons.
At Gate C-5, the affidavit says, United workers doing a spot search looked into Mr. Gurung's duffel bag, fanny pack and a white plastic shopping bag, finding seven folding knives with blades up to four inches, along with a stun gun and a small container labeled tear gas/pepper spray.
In an interview with a television station here, Mr. Gurung said he had meant to put the knives, which he said he carried for his protection, in his checked baggage.
"It was all a mistake," he said. "What the police are doing is the right thing."
The authorities said Mr. Gurung had recently lived in two apartments in the Rogers Park neighborhood on the North Side of Chicago. The superintendent at one of the buildings said Mr. Gurung and his brother moved out in October 2000 after about a year, but returned last Thursday to ask about a vacancy.
"He didn't seem crazy or weird, just quiet," said the superintendent, Adam Colfax.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE CHARITIES; 
DEBATE OVER RULES FOR VICTIMS FUND

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARSTOW and DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
Six weeks after Congress created an unlimited fund to compensate the victims of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, the federal government is still wrestling with an emotionally charged question that could reduce payments to victims' families by hundreds of thousands of dollars and affect how more than $1 billion in charitable donations is spent.
 The question is: Should awards from the fund be reduced by the amount of charity a victim's family accepts? 
 For some taxpayer watchdog groups, and some powerful Congressional leaders, the answer is a resounding yes. The point of the federal fund, they say, is to make victims' families financially whole, not to enrich them at the expense of American taxpayers, millions of whom have already made donations.
But for victims' rights groups, and other powerful Congressional leaders, the answer is an equally resounding no. 
Americans, they say, pledged donations to help victims, not the government's balance sheet. And if fund awards are reduced by the amount of charity that is accepted, what incentive will Americans have to provide charity to future victims of terrorism?
The September 11th Victims Compensation Fund, included in a bill to bail out the airlines, is without precedent in the level of government compensation offered to victims of crime. Families of those killed or injured are entitled to collect awards for a range of losses, like future wages, and pain and suffering. There is no cap on awards and no need to prove blame. Final decisions on awards are required within 120 days. The trade-off is that those who make claims waive their right to sue to collect potentially huge punitive damages. 
Yet, at a time when grieving families are scrambling to pay bills and navigate a maze of public and private aid, the unresolved question of how the federal fund will treat charitable income is complicating, and even slowing, the distribution of donations.
For the families, the uncertainty poses practical concerns: will accepting donations now reduce how much they collect from the fund later? Do they have to keep painstaking records of every charitable penny they receive?
"In my humble opinion, I don't believe that people who gave money donated with that intention," said Elliott Scheinberg, whose wife, Angela, died in the attack on the World Trade Center.
For charities, there are different problems. If charitable donations will be used, in effect, to subsidize government awards to those eligible for the fund, should more of that charity be directed instead toward those not eligible -- those who lost their jobs or homes, or suffered severe mental trauma?
"In my view, it is essential to understand how the fund will help families in order for us to figure out how we should help victims," said Joshua Gotbaum, chief executive of the September 11th Fund, the second-largest charity, with more than $320 million in pledges.
The question of how to treat charitable donations, he said, is of fundamental importance -- so important that it was the only topic he declined to address during a lengthy recent interview. "There are powerful issues strongly felt on both sides," he said cautiously, explaining that he intended to take the matter to his board.
The extreme fragility of the issue is also reflected in the shifting positions of New York's senators, Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Initially, both senators said that as a matter of fairness -- and pragmatism, given the expected concern about the fund's price tag -- families that had received substantial charitable aid should not get the same amount from the fund as families that receive little from charities. 
"The issue should be that everyone should be made whole," Mr. Schumer said last week.
Mrs. Clinton has proposed that while modest amounts of charity might be ignored, awards could be decreased for those who accepted charity above a certain threshold. "I could agree to a cap," she said several weeks ago.
They have since backed off that position, aides said, in part because sentiment in Washington appears to be shifting toward those who oppose reducing awards to reflect charitable donations received. Mrs. Clinton has now joined Tom Daschle, the Senate majority leader, and Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, in asking that victim awards be made without regard to how much a family had collected in donations.
Within weeks, the question will be resolved by Attorney General John Ashcroft, who is charged with writing the regulations that will govern the fund.
The law clearly requires that fund awards, which could easily exceed $1 million, must be reduced by any collateral sources of compensation received by the families. But while the law specifies life insurance and pension benefits as collateral sources, it makes no mention of charity.
During negotiations with Democratic leaders, three powerful Republicans -- Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas and Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri -- objected strongly to the fund's creation, questioning its cost and warning of potential abuse. Mr. Blunt, for one, has argued that at the very least the fund should be structured to protect taxpayers from "double dipping" by families seeking to be reimbursed for expenses already covered by charities.
"If families are concerned about maximizing their potential dollars, they can always go to court," Mr. Blunt, the chief deputy whip, said.
Whether awards from the fund are reduced to reflect the charitable gifts families receive will be an important factor in its ultimate cost to American taxpayers, budget analysts said. Early estimates by the Congressional Budget Office put the fund's potential price tag at $11 billion, but the budget office has not made that estimate official yet, in part because of the uncertainty surrounding the role of charity, legislative analysts said.
Justice Department officials are clearly aware that this is a difficult issue. For weeks, Mr. Ashcroft's aides have been quietly soliciting opinions from a range of parties, including victims' rights groups, leading Democrats on Capitol Hill, officials in New York City and companies that lost employees in the attacks.
But the officials have not clearly indicated where they stand. In fact, some who have been consulted came away with opposite impressions of the department's inclinations. One person who was consulted recently quoted a senior official as saying, "Well, there appears to be a consensus inside Justice that charitable contributions should not be considered a collateral source."
Yet Bob Monetti, a victims' advocate whose son was killed in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland in 1988, said that the officials he met seemed to favor reducing awards by the amount of charity that victims' families collected. "They're certainly inclined to say that if somebody pays your funeral expenses, nobody else will, including them," he said.
The Justice Department has until Dec. 21 to draft rules for the fund. On Friday, its struggle with the issue surfaced in a statement seeking public comment on how the fund should operate.
The statement said that while the department appreciated the strong policy reasons for making awards without regard to what a family had accepted in charity, it also invited public comment on whether the law indeed permitted it to do so. Comments, which must be submitted by Nov. 26, can be sent by e-mail to victimcomp.comments@usdoj.gov.
The department also asked for comment on other issues, many of which reflect a concern over how to balance the competing demands for speed and fairness. The more important questions focus on how to define and verify eligibility, how to calculate economic and noneconomic losses and how to determine which relative will be entitled to submit a claim as the "personal representative" of a victim. The department asks how the fund should respond when there are disputes among relatives over filing a claim.
Also unresolved is whom Mr. Ashcroft will choose as the special master to oversee the fund. The master will hold immense power over the finances of thousands of families, interpreting and enforcing the fund's rules and deciding final awards, without any appeal.
Ever since Magna Carta, no king has ever had the power that this master has, said Aaron J. Broder, a New York trial lawyer who said he believed many families would be better served by filing lawsuits.
The department's statement on Friday said that Mr. Ashcroft was interviewing "highly credentialed" candidates for the post. Among those mentioned is Kenneth R. Feinberg, a former chief of staff for Senator Edward M. Kennedy and the court-appointed mediator for several high-profile disputes, including claims involving Agent Orange.
Mr. Feinberg's supporters include Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Schumer and Senator Orrin Hatch. But he has run into opposition from the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, which is lobbying for the appointment of Robert C. Zampano, a retired federal judge from Connecticut.
In a recent interview, Judge Zampano confirmed his interest in the post. "I think we all have to make a contribution," he said.
But so far, Mr. Ashcroft's aides have not tipped their hand, although they have promised to consult with leaders in Congress before making a choice, and have emphasized that their choice will be someone who can command strong bipartisan support.

U.S. and India Map Path To Military Cooperation; More Arms Sales Are Seen

BYLINE:  By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told India's defense minister, George Fernandes, today that the United States is committed to building closer military ties between their two countries, and the two men discussed possible sales of American military equipment to India.
 Mr. Rumsfeld's quick visit here at the end of four-day tour of five nations seemed meant to reassure India that the intense American partnership with Pakistan, India's archrival, will not come at India's expense, and to remind India that it has a long-term interest in staying on America's good side. 
 India is an ally of the United States in the global campaign against terrorism. But expanding military cooperation between the two, the world's most populous democracies, is also part of a broader American strategy, predating the Sept. 11 attacks, to deepen relations with India on issues that include trade, antiterrorism and scientific cooperation. 
At a joint news conference today, Mr. Rumsfeld said his aim was "to strengthen the military-to-military and defense ties between our two countries, which I think are so important."
Mr. Fernandes, who has been testy and skeptical in his recent comments about the United States, was full of warm words, declaring himself "very happy with the discussions."
The two men -- Mr. Fernandes, the aging socialist in sandals and a crumpled kurta pajama, and Mr. Rumsfeld, the aging cold warrior in a pressed gray suit -- made an odd couple, but both said they wanted what Mr. Fernandes called "a relationship of mutual support and cooperation."
Mr. Fernandes has in the past expressed serious doubts about America's resolve to help India fight terrorism on its own soil and the effectiveness of the American bombing of Afghanistan.
Attorney General John Ashcroft has recommended that two Pakistan-based Islamic militant groups active in an anti-India insurgency, Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-iMuhammad, be put on Washington's list of terrorist organizations. 
India had long sought this step and officials here welcomed the move. Lashkar, in particular, is one of the most dangerous groups operating in Kashmir, a land that both India and Pakistan claim, often sending suicide bombers to attack Indian security forces there.
Mr. Rumsfeld said antiterrorism would not stop with Afghanistan, and "we will be pursuing terrorist networks wherever we find them." 
When asked what he thought of the American military strategy, Mr. Fernandes, known as an undiplomatic maverick, said tactfully, "I think it's the military men who decide the military tactics. One should accept what is happening now."
Mr. Rumsfeld himself said he believes that the bombing campaign is getting more effective by the day now that the Americans have personnel on the ground helping them identify targets for the bombs. 
Asked if the Afghan war could last for years, Mr. Rumsfeld said: "Do I think Afghanistan will take years? No, I don't. I think it is something that is being very aggressively addressed at the present time. How long it will take, one can't guess."
Mr. Fernandes's temperate remarks signaled that India's pique about the American alliance with Pakistan, which India regards as the prime sponsor of terrorism against India, may be balanced by India's desire for a strategic relationship with the United States.
The mere fact that the American secretary of defense called on India was a measure of how dramatically United States policies have changed in recent months. After India conducted nuclear tests in May 1998, the United States imposed economic and military sanctions that derailed earlier efforts by the Clinton administration to bring the two nations closer together. No American defense secretary had come to India since January 1995. 
Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Fernandes also discussed India's need for military supplies, including General Electric engines for its light combat aircraft.
By early next month, Indian and American military officials are to begin to meet as a Defense Policy Group to discuss ways that the two militaries can cooperate. Douglas J. Feith, undersecretary of defense for policy, will lead the American side.
The members of the group will consider increased training of officers in each others' academies and joint military exercises. And in another indication of American interest, Adm. Dennis C. Blair, commander in chief of the Pacific region, will soon be coming to New Delhi.
American officials hope India's interest in a broader relationship, after decades when India was a leader of nonaligned nations and close to the Soviet Union and then Russia, will give India an extra incentive to act with restraint when it comes to Pakistan.
American officials have worried that the conflict between India and Pakistan, nuclear-armed enemies, could flare into war if there were a major terrorist attack on India by an Islamic militant group based in Pakistan. President Bush asked the two countries to "stand down" last month after intense fighting broke out in Kashmir.
Mr. Rumsfeld today made no mention of the desire for military restraint, nor did he need to. That point has been made clearly at the highest levels, including during Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's visit to New Delhi three weeks ago.
Even as senior Indian officials, including Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, have continued making bellicose remarks almost daily about Pakistan's sponsorship of Islamic militants in Kashmir, they have also said just as frequently that they have no plans to initiate military attacks across the line that divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan -- at least not for now.

Shares Rise on Expectations That Fed Will Cut a Rate

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday in a broad rally led by technology issues as investors followed a familiar pattern of showing optimism just before a regular meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers.
 Investors expect the Fed to reduce the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks by a half-percentage point, to 2 percent, when they meet today, according to trading in futures contracts on the rate. Some economists are expecting a smaller quarter-point decrease. 
 Traders have had ample opportunity to detect the pattern. The Fed has reduced rates nine times this year, with six of those cuts coming at regularly scheduled meetings. Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst for Jefferies & Company, described yesterday's market movement as the routine "day-before ramp-up." 
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained 47.92 points, or 2.7 percent, to 1,793.65. Technology shares also helped lift the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by 15.64 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,102.84.
The Dow Jones industrial average was held to a slightly smaller gain, climbing 117.49 points, or 1.3 percent, to 9,441.03. Twenty-four of the 30 Dow stocks rose, but by smaller percentages than the stocks of some technology companies.
The only thing that should seem more familiar to investors, Mr. Hogan said, is anticipation of what he called "the day-after sell-off" -- the likelihood that stocks would retreat after the Fed makes its decision on interest rates.
Optimism about the Fed was not the only factor driving the market yesterday.
Many mutual funds end their fiscal years in October, and the managers of those funds sell many of their losing bets at the end of October and begin a round of fresh buying in November. This can contribute to what analysts call a liquidity-driven market, or one affected by the new investment of free cash.
"The portfolio managers have had such a tough year," said Ned Collins, a trader at Daiwa Securities America. "Every one of them is so terrified to miss a 5 or 10 percent uptick."
Adding to that effect, potentially, the Fed reported last week that the amount of money available in currency, traveler's checks, deposit accounts and money-market funds increased by $110 billion in September. It is difficult to know whether individual investors are putting new money into the market, but recent increases in the savings rate cast doubt on that possibility.
"The names that are really moving aren't moving because fundamentals have improved," said Brett Gallagher, vice president of Julius Baer Investment Management. "Investors seem to be very willing to look beyond the current quarter and next quarter and into the new year."
The blue-chip stocks that benefited from the day's optimism included General Motors, up $1.53, to $43.78; Home Depot, up $1.23, to $41.55; and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, up $2.30, to $110.50.
The biggest and most concentrated gains were in the technology sector. Microsoft rose $1.87, to $63.27, though the proposed settlement of its antitrust case in the United States was still in doubt and prosecutors in Europe indicated that they were still pursuing an antitrust case. Siebel Systems jumped $3.52, to $20.81; Intel gained 68 cents, to $26.96; and Oracle rose 51 cents, to $14.96.
Cisco Systems reported after the market closed that its profit excluding one-time items and revenue fell, but not as much as analysts had expected. The stock rose 64 cents, to $17.90, in anticipation of the report, then surged to $18.57 after hours.
P.G.& E. said its quarterly earnings tripled, to $771 million, as energy costs fell at its bankrupt Northern California utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, and its stock rose 43 cents, to $18.36. 
Still, investors seemed focused on the progress of the war against terrorism, and the gains in the stock market seemed to reflect bets that the government's efforts to stimulate the economy, with rate cuts and a package of tax breaks and spending, would bolster the economy.
"We've dismissed the economic data points, we've dismissed the corporate profits, we know they're lousy," said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chairman of investment policy for Gruntal & Company.
Even with the war on terrorism as an ever-looming wild card, analysts are still frustrated by the same factors that frustrated them before September -- "the real lack of any quality earnings that we've seen so far and real lack of any visibility to tell us when the economy's going to bottom," Mr. Collins said.
"I'm still a skeptic," he added, "but, boy, would I love to be wrong."

HEADLINE: Global Slump Is Blurring Line At Bank Units for Junk Bonds 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
To cope better with an increasing number of companies whose investment-grade debts have been reduced to junk status, J. P. Morgan Chase said today that it would combine certain parts of its European corporate bond operations.
 European high-grade trading and research will be rolled into one unit with high-yield trading and research, the bank said. Sales and syndication will still be handled separately. 
 High grade refers to companies with the best credit ratings, while high yield refers to those with poor credit ratings, whose bonds are known as junk bonds.
Investment banks have tended to segregate the two types of bonds because they attract different investors and require different analyses. But with a global economic slowdown making lending risks harder to quantify, banks have been experimenting with different approaches. Some Merrill Lynch credit analysts in the United States now cover both investment-grade and junk bonds. And Salomon Smith Barney is looking at ways to integrate the two more closely, a spokesman said.
Standard & Poor's is forecasting that companies with investment-grade debt will be unable to repay about $100 billion in loans in 2001, more than double the amount defaulted on last year and the highest rate since the agency began tracking the figure in the 1920's.
So far this year, Moody's Investors Service has downgraded the credit ratings of 49 companies to junk from investment grade, including the Dole Food Company, Hasbro and AMR, the American Airlines parent.
Tim Frost, J. P. Morgan Chase's head of European credit trading, said he expected the number of downgrades to rise. "With the cold winds of recession blowing through the world economy," he said, "there likely will be other companies falling on hard times."
The junk bond market in Europe is newer than that in the United States. But it is growing rapidly as the debt of former rising stars -- like Marconi, a British telecommunications equipment maker -- is reduced to junk status. For that reason, Mr. Frost said, he will still need to hire analysts and traders, even after combining the high-grade and high-yield operations, a restructuring that, for now, is limited to Europe.
Typically, companies with strong cash flows that analysts considered likely to repay loans were granted investment-grade status and able to borrow at close to current interest rates. The junk bond market, pioneered in the 1980's by Drexel Burnham Lambert's Michael R. Milken, affords companies with shakier credit profiles a way to raise money by paying higher returns to investors willing to assume higher risks.
Chris Francis, global head of credit research for Merrill Lynch, said the blurring line between investment-grade and junk bonds had led his firm to require some credit analysts to cover both.
"We are going into a more challenging environment for corporate credit," Mr. Francis said. "There is nothing to suggest that this trend has finished."

The Mayor Was There For the Yanks

BYLINE:  By GEORGE VECSEY 

DATELINE: PHOENIX 

 BODY:
HE has had worse duties. The smile on the face of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani told everybody he knew the difference between a funeral and a losing clubhouse.
 This was late Sunday night. It had drizzled in Phoenix and Mariano Rivera had lost the seventh game of the World Series, which was even more shocking. 
 The mayor displayed the same state of grace that has emanated from him since the awful events of Sept. 11. After staring down prostate cancer, he experienced the World Trade Center falling down on his constituents and his friends and very nearly on him.
So the Yankees lost a seventh game.
"They gave us a great October," the mayor kept saying.
Now it was November and the Yankees had inexplicably faltered in the final inning of one of the great World Series anybody has witnessed. Giuliani knew it was no crime to lose to a team with two stalwarts like Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson.
There was a celebration going on in the middle of the field as a new baseball city celebrated its first world championship. The Yankees, of course, have 26.
"I like their team," the mayor said. "You could see why they got to the World Series."
The mayor's time clock was probably somewhere over Kansas. He had flown to Phoenix for Game 6 on Saturday night, sitting with Senator John McCain of Arizona, a kindred spirit.
"I appreciate the way we were treated," the mayor said. "And if you have to lose, it's better to lose to a city like this. These people sent us search-and-rescue crews." 
When the team of his heart could not clinch the World Series on Saturday, the mayor had flown back to make sure his city was functioning during the marathon, always the most joyous day of the year.
Then he got on a plane to Phoenix for Game 7, joining a group of family members of some of the victims of the disaster. He has ministered to people since Sept. 11, and if he wanted to be a surrogate fan, with access to good seats, he more than earned it. 
"This was a great World Series, like we had when I was younger," he was saying. "The Yankees against the Braves. The Yankees against the Dodgers. It seemed like they always went seven games. We got spoiled."
"I kept thinking we'd do it," he added. "Even with runners on base, I thought Mo would get a double play. Baseball is a game of inches."
He also praised Steve Finley's acrobatic catch in right-center field. This was fan talk, but the mayor was also seeing a much bigger picture.
"Let's keep the focus on what it meant to our October," he kept saying. "It was great for our economy, great for our spirit. It brought people and money into the city.
"I'm not that disappointed. The Yankees did everything they could. They were a symbol. They never gave up. They were out of it, and they came back. They are still champions."
He even saw some value in losing the seventh game of an epic World Series.
"It gives the city a sense of reality, what you can accomplish," he said. "This is a city that just got hit with the worst attack in the history of our country, but the people hung in there."
The players were dressing and heading for the bus that would take them into a winter of roster changes.
By now the mayor's aides were trying to rush him toward the charter back home. Today is Election Day. The new mayor must be confident enough to allow Rudolph Giuliani to help in the recovery of the city. But for now, the mayor still has the power to authorize a parade.
There had been speculation whether it was appropriate to stage a traditional ticker-tape parade for the Yankees. "Whatever they want," the mayor said. "I'll be talking to them tomorrow. Most teams don't want to celebrate if they finish second, but I'll do whatever they want."
The mayor spotted Rivera, carrying his overnight bag toward the doorway. He stepped closer and whispered things in Rivera's ear.
"You did great," was all one eavesdropper could hear.
Rivera, a stable man with a religious core, is not about to grieve all winter for a few pitches that got away. He smiled gracefully and moved out into the night. The mayor stayed a few more minutes, despite his watchful aides. These were his Yankees, and their clubhouse was a reassuring place for a fan who has been to too many funerals.

HEADLINE: FURIOUS LOBBYING IS SET OFF BY BILL ON MENTAL HEALTH 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
A plan newly passed by the Senate to broaden health insurance coverage for mental illness has touched off an intense lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill as advocates for the mentally ill try to eliminate restrictions on care.
 The goal of the legislation is what the advocates describe as parity in insurance: the elimination of widespread limits on treatment for various forms of mental illness. 
 The measure, approved by the Senate last week and now headed for a conference with the House, would outlaw disparities in coverage between mental and physical illness under all group health plans sponsored by employers with more than 50 employees.
"All too often insurance discriminates against illnesses of the brain," said Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, who offered the proposal with Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota. 
Employers, insurance companies and some health maintenance organizations are lobbying against the proposal, saying it would drive up costs. 
"Health care inflation is back, and it's surging out of control," even without the proposed new requirement, said Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, which represents H.M.O.'s.
Supporters and opponents of "mental health parity" say the lobbying is intense because the proposal stands a greater chance of enactment now than at any other time in the last decade. The drive for parity has gained momentum with the discovery that many mental illnesses have a biological basis and can be treated with drugs.
At present, people who are treated for mental illnesses like schizophrenia or depression often face higher co-payments and deductibles than they would have to pay if they were being treated for physical ailments, like diabetes or cancer. Likewise, many insurance plans cover fewer visits to a doctor, and fewer days of hospital care, when patients are treated for mental illness.
The Senate proposal was adopted by voice vote as an amendment to a bill providing money to the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services for the current fiscal year.
Mr. Domenici, who has a daughter with schizophrenia, and Mr. Wellstone, whose brother has severe mental illness, have been tenacious advocates, lining up 65 senators as co-sponsors of their proposal. The two authors have also worked with lobbyists from groups like the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the National Mental Health Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Medical Association.
After meeting with advocates for the mentally ill, Mr. Domenici sounded confident. "We're on our way now," he said in an interview. "There's a real opportunity to change the entire landscape with reference to mental illness and to put more money into research, more money into facilities. If there's insurance coverage, there's going to be a lot of assets following these sick people around, just as there have been over time huge amounts of resources for other diseases because insurance companies covered them."
Nearly three dozen states and the federal government have experimented with various types of parity for their own employees, and they say the costs have not been significant, with premiums typically rising less than 1 percent.
Benefits for employees of private companies are regulated by a 1974 federal law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or Erisa. The Erisa Industry Committee, a coalition of large employers, has told Congress that the Domenici-Wellstone proposal would "lead to the misuse and overuse of mental health benefits." Moreover, it says, "many employers are likely to comply with the parity mandate by reducing coverage for other medical and surgical benefits, rather than by increasing coverage for mental health benefits."
The House recently passed legislation to extend a 1996 law that provided a very limited form of mental health parity. That law, which expired on Sept. 30, said health plans could not set more restrictive annual or lifetime dollar limits on mental health care than they set for the treatment of physical illnesses.
The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, estimated last year that 14 percent of employers were not complying with the 1996 law. Most of those companies, by their own account, had lifetime limits of $100,000 or less on mental health benefits and set higher ceilings for medical and surgical benefits. 
In addition, many health plans did what they were free to do under the 1996 law, setting higher co-payments and deductibles, and lower limits on outpatient visits and days of hospital care, for mental illness.
In a study on the new Senate legislation, the Congressional Budget Office reported these findings:
*Health insurance premiums would rise an average of 0.9 percent as a result of the bill.
*The bill would impose a mandate costing the private sector $23 billion over five years.
*The federal government would lose $2.2 billion of revenue in the next five years, and a total of $5.4 billion from 2002 to 2011, because workers would receive less of their compensation in taxable wages and more in tax-free fringe benefits.
Advocates for the mentally ill said they believed that the costs could be lower, based on the experience of states with mental-health-parity laws. The Senate bill specifically allows employers and health plans to use managed care techniques to help control costs.
Further, Senator Wellstone said broader coverage of mental health care would save money in the long run, by increasing the productivity of workers, reducing their absenteeism and lowering the level of crime committed by people with mental illness.
Ms. Ignagni, the lobbyist for H.M.O.'s, said, "We believe in the importance of mental health benefits, but we oppose the Senate bill because it would interfere with the ability of employers to design and customize health benefits for their employees."
Senator Debbie Stabenow, however, said there was no reason for insurers to discriminate against people with mental problems.
"Mental illness is as physical as any disease that is now covered by our insurance system," said Ms. Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan. "If you are a manic-depressive, that means you have chemicals in your brain that are off balance."

HEADLINE: Local Elections to Test the Nation's Mood 

BYLINE:  By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

 BODY:
In the first broad test of the nation's political mood since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, voters will go to the polls today to elect governors and legislatures in New Jersey and Virginia and mayors in a dozen or so major cities, including New York, Detroit, Houston, Seattle and Miami.
 The campaigning has been all over the election spectrum, with some contests focusing mainly on local issues like traffic congestion and property taxes, some on corruption and some on personalities. 
 But a subtext in many campaigns, and the main text in a few, has been the deteriorating economy and the need for strong security and strong leaders in the attacks' aftermath.
It was not clear heading into today's balloting how the economic, security and leadership issues would play out, whether they might end up being the deciding issues and a harbinger of the 2002 Congressional elections or end up as minor factors. For that matter, because so many issues were at play, there seemed to be a good possibility that hardly any voting trends would emerge. 
The governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey are partisan affairs, so they will provide bragging rights. But many of the mayoral contests are nonpartisan, and clear victories will be harder to claim.
Final polls in the governors' races give the edge to the Democrats. In Virginia, Mark R. Warner, a millionaire businessman, is running ahead of Mark L. Earley, a former attorney general. In New Jersey, James E. McGreevey, mayor of Woodbridge, was favored over Bret D. Schundler, a former mayor of Jersey City, in a race that wound down with a focus on terrorism.
In both contests, the Democratic candidates have outspent their Republican opponents, and in both states Republican ranks have been somewhat divided.
Democrats in New Jersey hold out more hope for gains in the Legislature than their counterparts in Virginia, one of the most Republican states in the nation.
The Virginia governor's race has been notable for the inroads Mr. Warner has made in Republican ranks by portraying himself as a conservative, despite Mr. Earley's bid to portray him as just another tax-and-spend liberal Democrat. Mr. Warner has courted conservative constituencies ranging from stock-car fans to gun owners, and since Sept. 11, he has sought out groups of police officers and other public safety officials, as has Mr. Earley.
Mr. Earley's biggest struggle has been to energize his base. There have been defections, in part out of frustration with top Republican leaders, among them Gov. James S. Gilmore III. Those leaders have spent much of the campaign squabbling over next year's budget.
Mr. Earley has also been sorely disappointed by a decision by President Bush, hugely popular in Virginia, to forgo campaigning there. 
Among the mayors' races, most attention has been focused on New York, where Michael R. Bloomberg, a billionaire Republican businessman, is running against Mark Green, a veteran of numerous Democratic campaigns. But several other big-city races merit watching, even if the political implications do not seem as great or the issues as pressing.
In Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, Mayor Lee P. Brown is seeking a third two-year term and for a change is all but ignoring vexatious problems with traffic gridlock, air pollution and unbridled growth. Instead, he contends that what Houston most needs is an experienced mayor who knows how to lead and knows how to keep a city secure.
"Now is not the time for on-the-job-training in the mayor's office," Mr. Brown asserted, taking a dig at his two challengers in the nonpartisan contest, Orlando Sanchez and Chris Bell, City Council members who lack his 40 years in public service. Mr. Brown started as police rookie, rose to command the police departments of New York, Atlanta and Houston, then was drug czar in the Clinton administration before becoming Houston mayor in 1997.
Mr. Sanchez and Mr. Bell agree that leadership and security are a priority, but they contend that Mr. Brown has been inept.
Recent polls have Mr. Brown out front -- but not far enough to avoid a runoff, probably with Mr. Sanchez.
In Atlanta, a city with its fair share of budget, city services and safety problems, the big issue in the mayor's race is the scandal-plagued administration of Mayor Bill Campbell.
Mr. Campbell has not been charged with any crime but some of his associates have. The candidates seeking to succeed him -- Gloria Bromell-Tinubu, a former city councilwoman, Shirley Clarke Franklin, a former mayoral aide, and Robb Pitts, the City Council president -- are trying to outdo one another with boasts of ethical purity.
The contest, which is nonpartisan, looks tight. There could be a runoff.
In Detroit, where the contest also is nonpartisan and too close to call, the big issue is how to get the economy moving. The candidates are Gil Hill, the City Council president; and Kwame Kilpatrick, the minority leader of the Michigan House.
In Cincinnati, where there has been racial tension recently, Mayor Charles Luken, who is white, faces a strong challenge from a political newcomer, Courtis Fuller, who is black. Mr. Fuller is a former television news anchor, as is Mr. Luken.
In Seattle, a close, nonpartisan race for mayor between Greg Nickels, a county councilman, and Mark Sidran, the city attorney, focuses on what residents call the Seattle way.
As Mr. Nickels sees the "way," Seattle is at its best when it is governed by "inclusion." As Mr. Sidran sees it, inclusion is fine, but sometimes the only "way" to get things done is by confrontation.
In Miami, nine challengers are running against Mayor Joe Carollo, who was arrested on a domestic abuse charge that was later dropped. The race has focused on services, taxes and municipal scandals.

 International Opinion

THE PRESIDENT -- Worried that public opinion abroad has turned against the United States military campaign in Afghanistan, President Bush will give a speech on fighting terrorism on Tuesday that will be beamed by satellite to a conference of Central European leaders in Poland. A1

THE RAIDS -- Using better information from Russian intelligence and American forces on the ground, United States warplanes have escalated attacks against caves and tunnels in Afghanistan identified as Taliban arms depots and command centers. A1

THE REBELS -- Gen. Muhammad Fahim, the new chief of the Northern Alliance forces, had a rough time inspecting his troops. He tripped over rocks, made little eye contact and left the speeches to others. B3

NEW ENVOY -- Showing impatience over efforts to replace the Taliban, the White House named a veteran diplomat, James F. Dobbins, as ambassador to the Afghan opposition. B3

A Puzzling Death

QUESTIONS -- United States officials said they were trying to verify statements by the Taliban that a man identified as an American citizen who was taken into custody after crossing into Afghanistan two weeks ago had died in a hospital. B2

IN NEW DELHI -- Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told India's defense minister, George Fernandes, that the United States was committed to building closer military ties between the two countries. B2

RELIEF -- The Taliban embassy in Pakistan called on United Nations relief agencies to "help the people of Afghanistan" cope with American bombing and the severe Afghan winter. B2

A Seething Sacred Land

A GROWING THREAT -- Among those who met him a decade ago in Saudi Arabia, Osama bin Laden is remembered as a simple man who had trouble talking about Islamic law. Yet he now challenges a ruling family that built its very kingdom on defending the faith. B1

IN CAIRO -- Saudi Arabia said it would sign an international accord adopted nearly two years ago that called for choking off the money used by international terror organizations. B4

Security and Liability

IN SAN FRANCISCO -- Ferry and train ridership was up and bridge traffic was down as worried commuters heeded a warning that terrorists might strike the state's bridges. B5

IN CHICAGO -- Eight employees of a private security company were suspended for failing to detect several knives, a stun gun and a can of pepper spray in a passenger's carry-on bags at O'Hare International Airport. The passenger was charged with trying to carry weapons onto a plane. B5

IN COURT -- The government's chief witness in a recent terror trial failed to disclose that he had tried to rob a currency exchange store in Montreal to raise money for terrorists. The revelation prompted a judge in Manhattan to postpone the sentencing of an Algerian man convicted of conspiracy in terror attacks planned for millennium celebrations. B5

INSURANCE DEAL -- Insurers say they strongly favor a Senate plan that would require them to pay for the first $10 billion in damage from future terror attacks. The House version sets no limits on losses. B5

The Anthrax Threats

THE INVESTIGATION -- Convinced that unraveling the mystery of a New York hospital worker's final days offers the best chance of determining who is behind the anthrax attacks, investigators are seeking to recreate her encounters and routines. A1

THE FUNERAL -- Kathy T. Nguyen, the only New Yorker to die of anthrax, was remembered as a kindly and quiet woman who adored fancy hats and cooking for her friends. B6

THE LETTERS -- Three weeks after an envelope filled with anthrax spores was opened in Senator Tom Daschle's office, officials say it still too dangerous to examine millions of other letters to determine whether any of them also contain anthrax. B6

THE RESPONSE -- The anthrax assaults have set off a scramble to decontaminate places where bacterial spores were found and to prevent more infections by sterilizing the mail. F1

The Impact in New York

THE FUND -- A decision by the federal government on how the families of victims in the terror attacks will be compensated may cost the families hundreds of thousands of dollars. A1

THE ECONOMY -- Low-wage workers -- cooks, cabdrivers, sales clerks and seamstresses -- have been hit hard in the fallout from Sept. 11. B1

THE BENEFIT -- A rock concert held at Madison Square Garden last month raised $30 million for victims of the trade center attacks. B7

FALLOUT -- A total of eight firefighters and seven fire union officials have been charged in connection with a rally Friday in which firefighters tangled with the police. The firefighters were protesting a reduction in the number of rescue workers at the site. D3

Survival and Faith

THE SHIRT -- Alcoholism had cost him jobs and friends, but, newly sober, he grabbed his blue paramedic sweatshirt and hitched rides on ambulances to get there. Hours later, he helped rescue one of the last two survivors pulled from the ruins. A1

SITTING SHMIRA -- The three sealed trucks outside the morgue may or may not contain Jewish bodies. But Orthodox ritual demands that someone keep watch over the dead until burial. These days, the watcher is often a young woman. B1

THE PREACHER -- A man who survived the trade center attack now travels to churches around the country, sharing his story through a first-hand, fundamentalist Christian filter. B8

NEW BUSINESS -- A Korean immigrant is confident a takeout-food shop and cafeteria he plans to open a few blocks from the trade center ruins will be a success. D1

HEADLINE: General Musharraf's Visit 

 BODY:
Less than two months have passed since Pakistan's ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, shocked his country's military establishment and infuriated radical Islamic groups by disowning the Taliban and allying with the United States. Now he feels confident enough to travel to New York this week to speak at the United Nations, visit the World Trade Center site and meet with President Bush. 
 Americans have to hope General Musharraf's confidence is justified. Should his nationalist and fundamentalist enemies back home prevail, it will be immeasurably harder for Washington to defeat the Taliban and oust Osama bin Laden's terrorist network from Afghanistan. Even more important, Pakistan, with its 140 million people and more than a score of nuclear weapons, could fall into dangerous and unpredictable hands. 
 No Muslim political leader has risked as much for the United States as General Musharraf, and Washington has been right to reward him generously. Yet America's new embrace of Pakistan needs to be cautious, recognizing that many serious issues remain unaddressed. Islamabad has still not severed its ties to terrorist groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir, its commitment to restraining future weapons development is uncertain and General Musharraf's own promises of restoring democracy are hedged with ambiguities.
Mr. Bush's challenge is to find ways of supporting President Musharraf and helping him at home by channeling substantial development aid to Pakistan's impoverished people while encouraging further policy changes. The United States should also make clear that it will not repeat its mistake of the early 1990's and disengage itself from Pakistan's problems after American military objectives in Afghanistan are achieved. 
It makes sense for the United States to invest in the political and economic stability of Pakistan. It is also right to bolster General Musharraf's diplomatic prestige. The changes he has been engineering since Sept. 11 go well beyond allowing Washington to use Pakistani airspace and bases. If he succeeds in disentangling its military intelligence services from the Taliban, Al Qaeda and Kashmiri terrorism and limits foreign funding of violent Islamic extremist groups, Pakistan's chances for democratic development would be much improved. Mr. Bush should press him to persevere and promise to help him and his country if he does.

Despite a downturn and the terror attacks, Cisco manages a quarter-to-quarter sales increase.

BYLINE:  By Chris Gaither 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
THE steep year-long slide of Cisco Systems has apparently ended. For the first time this calendar year, Cisco's revenue increased from one quarter to the next, surpassing its own projections of flat-to-slightly-weaker sales.
 Officially, the company posted a loss yesterday in its first fiscal quarter, as sales fell 32 percent from a year ago, but the results exceeded Wall Street's expectations. 
 John T. Chambers, Cisco's president and chief executive, predicted similar results in the current quarter. "We remain cautiously optimistic about the quarter and a flat-to-low single-digit growth" in revenue, he said, adding, "It would not surprise us to see orders vary on either side of these projections." 
Suffering from belt-tightening at telecommunications providers and networking companies, Cisco, which sells Internet routers and switches to those companies and others, said it lost $268 million, or 4 cents a share, in the quarter. The results contrasted sharply with the corresponding period last year, when Cisco earned $798 million, or 11 cents a share.
Sales were $4.4 billion, compared with $6.5 billion in the first quarter last year. But revenue improved from $4.3 billion in the fourth quarter, a 3 percent increase.
Excluding special items like acquisition costs and an $858 million investment write-down, Cisco reported a profit of $332 million, or 4 cents a share, compared with $1.4 billion, or 18 cents a share, last year. Using that method, common among companies but not accepted by standard accounting practices, analysts had expected a profit of 2 cents a share. 
Cisco's shares have more than doubled in the last month, and in regular trading before the company reported results, the stock gained 64 cents, to $17.90. In after-hours trading, shares rose 90 cents, to $18.80.
In a conference call with analysts, Mr. Chambers said Cisco's book-to-bill ratio was better than 1 during the quarter, meaning the company took in more orders for products than it shipped -- a sign of a growing market. Orders grew in Japan, South America, Canada and Europe, but declined in Asia and the United States, the sources of 58 percent of Cisco's bookings in the quarter.
The federal government was the only sector in the United States that placed more orders than during the previous quarter.
The first-quarter results would have been stronger if not for the fallout from the terrorist attacks, Mr. Chambers said. Before Sept. 11, the United States had been showing relatively strong signs of improvement, he said, leaving him prepared to forecast single-digit growth for the current quarter. Instead, he estimated the attacks took 5 percent from the company's revenue during the first quarter and predicted they would take another 5 percent from the current quarter. 
"The U.S. economy continues to show weakness, and the events of Sept. 11 have magnified the economic uncertainty," Mr. Chambers said. The attacks came at the midway point of Cisco's quarter. Mr. Chambers said orders had been flowing smoothly in the June-August period, and then suffered a "modest disruption" after the attacks.
Cisco rose to glory in the 1990's, briefly becoming the world's most valuable company. But the bursting of the Internet bubble and subsequent slowdown in capital spending by service providers took a heavy toll on Cisco. It posted its first quarterly loss in May and took a $2.2 billion charge.
Revenue in its services division improved over the previous year, to $792 million from $608 million, but sales of networking products declined sharply, to $3.66 billion from $5.91 billion. 
Analysts praised Cisco's handling of its internal operations to contend with a weakening business environment. "What I would point out is the dichotomy between their ability to manage their internals -- which was absolutely first rate -- versus the exogenous factors that even Cisco can't control," said Tad LaFountain, a managing director with the investment bank Needham & Company. 
Paul Sagawa of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, one of the first analysts to predict a slowdown in technology investments, said Cisco performed better than he had predicted during several months of great economic uncertainty.
But he questioned whether that would continue. "It may be difficult for them to sustain this level of sequential increase for the next few quarters," Mr. Sagawa said.

U.S. and Some States Split on Microsoft, Risking New Delay

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON with STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
The 18 states involved in the Microsoft antitrust case appeared headed for a sharp split today, with one group of attorneys general planning to sign onto the proposed settlement between the software giant and the Bush administration and another group preparing to challenge it, saying it leaves loopholes that would undermine provisions intended to promote competition. 
 After three days of intensive deliberations, only one state attorney general, Thomas F. Reilly of Massachusetts, officially announced his position. He said Massachusetts would seek to block the deal, concluding that it "may prove to be more harmful than helpful to competition and consumers." 
 Officials of other states skeptical of the agreement, which included Connecticut and California, spent the afternoon in a late-stage effort to persuade Microsoft and the Justice Department to reopen the proposed settlement to eliminate a variety of ambiguities and provisions that the states viewed as too lenient, lawyers involved in the negotiations said.
The attorney general of Illinois, Jim Ryan, suggested he would support the agreement, while the attorney general of New York, Eliot L. Spitzer, postponed a planned announcement of his endorsement after his efforts to strike a separate deal with Microsoft collapsed, the lawyers said. 
The failure of the Justice Department to gain the endorsement of all 18 states throws the proposed consent decree into question and creates a situation that antitrust experts said is without legal precedent. At the least, the disapproval by some states is likely to delay the resolution of the case for many months.
Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of United States District Court in Washington has instructed the parties to outline their positions at a hearing here on Tuesday morning. She has suggested that she may conduct parallel proceedings to consider both the merits of the proposed consent decree and the objections raised by officials of some of the states. Her original schedule suggested that she would not decide what to do before late next spring at the earliest.
Career officials at the Justice Department who have spent years working on the antitrust suit were described today by the lawyers involved in the case as feeling deeply dissatisfied and betrayed by the proposed consent decree, which was negotiated and approved by political appointees of President Bush. 
Timothy Bresnahan, a Stanford University professor who was chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division in the Clinton administration, said, "This settlement amounts to the government taking a dive." Like some other people, Mr. Bresnahan criticized the settlement as very limited in its ambitions and backward-looking. The provisions, he said, would be useful mainly for the particular competitive circumstances of the case, which focused on the early commercialization of the Internet in the second half of the 1990's.
But Assistant Attorney General Charles A. James, the new head of the antitrust division, who led the Microsoft negotiations for the Bush administration, made clear last Friday that the terms of the deal were no longer negotiable. By early this evening, he appeared not to have changed his view that this was the best settlement the government could obtain.
Massachusetts became the first state to formally reject the proposed agreement and was expected to be joined by Connecticut, California and Wisconsin, people involved in the negotiations said. Lawyers from other states -- including Maryland, Michigan, Ohio and Iowa -- declined to comment, saying they would issue their decisions on Tuesday.
But the strongest criticism today came from Mr. Reilly of Massachusetts. "There's no question in my mind that Microsoft will use this agreement to crush competition," he said, "and they would have the imprimatur of the U.S. government to do it." He said that the Justice Department's news release describing the agreement as a substantial victory for consumers and competition "is not reflected by this agreement."
"They may think they nailed this down, but they didn't," Mr. Reilly said. He asserted that the states' study of the proposed settlement found flaws that made his decision to oppose it "a no-brainer," particularly in light of "Microsoft's repeated history of violating court orders and rules."
Officials of other states disagreed, and found the consent decree a positive step toward resolving the case.
Mr. Ryan, who is facing a tough Republican gubernatorial primary battle in Illinois, said he was likely to support the deal. "I am inclined to sign on," he said. "I am pleased that the Microsoft case appears headed for resolution and that Illinois consumers will have gained a freer and more competitive marketplace as a result."
Today's decision shifts the fragile federal-state alliance in a remarkable way. Some states and Washington, which had worked more or less together for the last three years, will now become adversaries in the remedy phase of the proceedings. 
Microsoft now has a warm new relationship with the Justice Department. Together, they will defend the proposed deal from the criticism of some states, other technology companies and consumer groups.
For both the dissenting states and the Justice Department, the procedural framework of the case has legal and political pitfalls. If the judge ultimately agrees with the states and toughens the consent decree, it would prove embarrassing for the Justice Department, whose senior officials have hailed the deal as a tough, landmark agreement in the face of a barrage of criticism.
But if the dissenters fail to obtain any major modifications to the deal, they would look foolish, particularly as they go about spending millions of dollars more from state treasuries that no longer enjoy surpluses.
The proposed settlement, according to some industry executives and experts who are advising the states, leans too much toward Microsoft in its details, phrasing and general approach. 
In the requirement that Microsoft disclose technical information, one of these people said, the document is riddled with exceptions that seem to give Microsoft continuing control. For example, he said, the release of technical information is set in motion during the beta, or test, phase of Windows system development, but that may be too late to ensure competition.
"I would prefer that it simply embrace the principle that competitors will get equal treatment with the Microsoft developers making software products that run on Windows," the person said. "The decree should say outside firms will be treated equally instead of giving Microsoft a head start."
Another provision of the settlement says Microsoft can refuse to disclose technical information if a company does not meet reasonable, objective standards established by Microsoft for qualifying as a viable business. That provision, an industry executive said, could be a loophole for Microsoft to keep information from a start-up with no track record, but whose technology could challenge one of Microsoft's products.
Still another provision, according to an expert advising the states, could be interpreted as protecting Microsoft's advantage in new markets by stipulating that Microsoft does not have to share technical information if doing so might "compromise the security" of its products. Specifically, the security exception applies to Microsoft's technology in digital rights management and online identification.
These are crucial technologies in the emerging markets for online media and Internet commerce, where Microsoft, not yet dominant, has many rivals.
"It appears that Microsoft has carved out exemptions to protect itself in the fields it deems important for its future," an industry executive said.

Treasuries Increase as Nonmanufacturing Business Slumps

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday after a survey showed that nonmanufacturing business slumped in October more than forecast, bolstering expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut the benchmark lending rate half a percentage point at its policy meeting today.
 Ten-year notes have gained in seven of the last nine sessions, as signs of a worsening economic slowdown have prompted investors to increase their Fed rate-cut forecasts to a half-point from a quarter-point. 
 The decline in the survey, the National Association of Purchasing Management's nonmanufacturing index, added to the evidence that the economy has fallen into a recession. 
"The weak economic data we've seen should push the Fed over the top," said Michael Cloherty, government bond strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. He forecast a half-point cut in the overnight interbank rate, known as federal funds, to a 40-year low of 2 percent.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 16/32 , to a price of 105 19/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.29 percent from 4.35 percent on Friday. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 19/32 , to 108 3/32 . The bond's yield fell to 4.85 percent from 4.95 percent on Friday.
On Friday, 15 of the 24 economists surveyed at institutions that trade directly with the Fed forecast a half-point cut at today's meeting. A month ago, none of the primary dealer economists surveyed expected more than a quarter-point cut. Forty-seven of 84 economists polled in another Bloomberg survey also expected a half-point cut.
"Investors can expect a sub-2 percent Fed funds rate to be a feature of financial markets through 2002," said Rory Robertson, interest-rate strategist at Macquarie Equities. "The 10-year Treasury note is not as expensive as many perceive."
The gain in bonds followed Friday's tumble and a surge on Wednesday and Thursday, after the government said it would stop selling them.
"People who missed the rally of last week" are buying 30-year bonds, said Jim Claire, director of bond trading at the Evergreen Investment Management Company in Charlotte, N.C., which has $250 billion in stocks and bonds under management.

HEADLINE: Swissair Makes Deal With E.D.S. 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
The beleaguered Swissair Group said today that it had agreed to sell its ticketing and reservations unit, Atraxis, to Electronic Data Systems as it begins shedding its profitable subsidiaries.
 E.D.S., the American computer services company, must still receive regulatory approval to acquire Atraxis, which has 1,400 employees and specializes in airline reservations, airport management and air transport information services. 
 Terms of the sale were not disclosed.
The Atraxis Group is one of three Swissair subsidiaries that have been struggling with their finances recently because they have not been paid by the parent company. The information technology service, which serves 60 airlines and 40 airports around the world, had $400 million in revenue last year. But the booking company, based in Zurich, had become mired in the continuing financial difficulties of its parent group, Swissair, which filed for protection from creditors last month after piling up more than $10 billion in debt as its strategy to expand by taking stakes in regional European carriers failed. 
Its wobbly finances were pushed over the edge by the slump in international travel that followed the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. Switzerland's government, banks and leading industries patched together a $2.5 billion rescue plan that still faces challenges.
A big challenge came last week when the Swiss government announced that it would refuse to release the first installment of its cash assistance to Swissair without financial guarantees for the continued running of Atraxis as well as Swissair's ground handling company, Swissport, and its maintenance firm, SR Technics.
The refusal to provide cash to keep Swissair's long-haul flights running threatened a second grounding of the fleet. Swissair was grounded for two days last month when it ran out of money and the government-industry package was negotiated. The cash crunch also threatened the effort to merge Swissair's long-haul operations with its former regional subsidiary, Crossair, to create a new, slimmed-down national airline.
In a bit of brinkmanship, the Swiss government last week set a deadline for the regional government authorities -- especially in Zurich, where Swissair's hub is located -- and the banks to kick in more cash to make up the subsidiaries' shortfall. Atraxis received $21 million to keep it running until the end of the month.
Its sale had been touch and go with Lufthansa of Germany and I.B.M. pulling out of the bidding, leaving E.D.S. to scoop up the ticketing service.
SR Technics received a $61.3 million loan to keep it running, and bidders are negotiating for the baggage and freight handler Swissport.
The government bailout package still faces challenges from disgruntled employees, however, who are demanding that officials provide a benefits package that would provide assistance beyond the unemployment benefits they would normally be entitled to receive. Over the weekend, the Swiss president, Moritz Leuenberger, rejected such assistance. 
Indicating the continuing political sensitivity of the Swissair debacle, Mr. Leuenberger also said that the government planned an inquiry into the airline's collapse. The investigation, which may take up to a year, is expected to pinpoint blame in the debacle, and perhaps make former Swissair officials liable for at least some damages.
The Belgian airline Sabena, which is partly owned by Swissair, also said today that it would be suspending flights on Wednesday. There was no announcement on how long the suspension would last.
According to Reuters, trade unions reported that management had told them on Friday that since no new investors had been found, there was a big chance that the Sabena holding company would be put into liquidation this week.
Burdened by its own debts, Swissair reneged on its pledges to provide Sabena with financing. It took a 49.5 percent stake in the carrier as part of its expansion plan.

HEADLINE: Terror Follows Immigrants to America 

BYLINE:  By ABBY ELLIN 

 BODY:
Immigrants who came to America to escape strife-torn nations and start businesses in the homeland of entrepreneurship are suddenly facing some of the same fears they had fled. They came here from the Middle East, from the former Soviet bloc, from Africa, from Latin America. They left so they would never again have to worry about governments regulating their every move or bombs exploding in the streets or mustard missiles slamming into their homes.
 And that is precisely what has made the last two months so painful for so many of them: it is as if terror has followed them around the world. 
 In 1979, after the shah was ousted and Islamic militants seized American hostages, Jeniette Melamed fled Iran for the United States. Ms. Melamed, then the 20-year-old daughter of a Tehran tailor, objected to the new regime's harsh religious rhetoric and its curbs on freedom and yearned for a country that would let her pursue her entrepreneurial instincts. Even more, she longed for a stable and free society in which to live.
She got both. Arriving in New York with little money and even less English, she moved to Los Angeles and became a hostess at an International House of Pancakes, working her way through school. In 1982, she and her new husband, Hamid, moved back to New York and she opened a beauty salon with four employees on Fourth Avenue. The business has since grown into a day spa on East 13th Street with 25 employees, most of them recent immigrants. "I could not have had this business in Iran," she said.
Like untold millions of other Americans, Ms. Melamed, 43, has also discovered the serenity of suburbia. She lives in a three-bedroom home on a tree-lined street in Brookfield, N.Y., with Hamid, a grocer and owner of a Middle Eastern restaurant in Roslyn, and her two children, aged 14 and 10. She drives a Mercedes and the family takes an annual vacation in February, usually in Puerto Rico.
For more than two decades, Ms. Melamed could not read about the warfare and political upheavals of the Middle East without shuddering -- and thanking God that she had escaped it all, even though she says she still loves and misses her homeland.
Then came Sept. 11 -- and suddenly she brushed up against the horror that she thought she had left behind forever. She was on the Long Island Rail Road commuting to work when she heard about the planes that hit the World Trade Center; she arrived at her shop in time to see the second building collapse. She sent her staff home and waited to make sure they were safe before she left. Since then, she has been gripped by crying jags and smoke-filled nightmares.
"For many years I told my kids: 'This is the best country. We are free. We are wonderful; anyone can be president. In the United States, if you're not lazy, you'll never go hungry.' "
"Now, though, it's tough," Ms. Melamed said. "I'm afraid for my kids, for their futures. It's not fair. They took the flavor out of New York."
Her sister, Rosa Melamed, 46, who like Jeniette, uses her maiden name, has made the same emotional journey. She moved to New York in 1988 with her husband and young daughter after Iraqi missiles shattered her country. "America was the house of hope, the land of promise," she said.
Then, for a few minutes on Sept. 11, she thought she was back home in Iran. "Everyone was going crazy and I said, 'Don't cry, it's normal,' " she recalled. "Then I realized for me it was normal, it was normal in Iran, but for everyone else it wasn't."
John Ivanac experienced a similar role reversal. Mr. Ivanac made his way to the United States in 1966 at 26 to escape the communism and economic stagnation of his native Croatia, then part of communist-ruled Yugoslavia. Ten years ago, Mr. Ivanac was frantically telephoning his relatives in Croatia during the war with Serbia, not knowing if the calls would get through or even if anyone was alive to pick them up.
But on Sept. 11, the calls flooded in the opposite direction from his relatives to his two Midtown Manhattan restaurants, Villa Berulia and Trio.
"For three weeks, I've been so depressed," Mr. Ivanac said. The attacks on the World Trade Center, he said, "affected me more than the war in Croatia.
"I knew there was a war there, and when there is a war, whether you like it or not, someone's going to die," he added. "But this wasn't a war; this was a regular working day." Since then, he said, his business is down 30 percent.
Some visitors from troubled foreign lands are even wondering if it would be safer to go back home. Wahila Alam, a 28-year-old Pakistani physician, came to New York a year ago to work as an H.I.V.-treatment project researcher with Doctors of the World, a humanitarian organization that deploys medical professionals both here and abroad.
When she arrived, Dr. Alam thought she had left behind the fears and uncertainties endemic in countries like Pakistan that are in perpetual political turmoil. But for eight hours on Sept. 11, she was unable to locate her husband, who worked as a transportation engineer three blocks from the trade center.
"I was terrified," she said. "When I found out he was safe I thanked God, but afterward you're scared. What's next? Is it safe to be here? Is it really worth staying here?"
She has decided to do so. And other long-time immigrants who have taken American citizenship say they are not plagued by such doubts and trumpet their patriotism.
"This is by far the greatest country in the world," said George Feldenkreis, the chairman and chief executive of Perry Ellis International, the Miami-based maker of men's clothing. Mr. Feldenkreis, a Cuban Jew, came to Florida in February 1961, two months before the Bay of Pigs invasion. He remembers a world where bombs exploded in Havana restaurants, friends were arrested for speaking out against the government and soldiers gripped machine guns while standing guard. And that was the country his parents had chosen as a haven after they fled persecution in the Ukraine.
"The Americans have been very lucky that we have been able to have a very free country with unlimited movement," he said. "The U.S. is one of the few countries in the world that has never been touched. We are all very concerned that our way of life will be changed forever. But I've lived through situations in life and I tell my son, 'This too shall pass. We'll get used to it.' "

HEADLINE: Japanese Drug Makers' Profits Are Strong 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Japanese pharmaceutical companies, long derided overseas as copycat drug makers, are booking better-than-expected profits this fiscal year, providing one of the few highlights in an otherwise bleak earnings landscape.
 The country's largest pharmaceutical company, Takeda Chemical Industries, said today that its net income jumped 45 percent in the six months ended Sept. 30. The results, which beat the company's estimates by 17 percent, were helped by strong sales of two drugs that fight high blood pressure and ulcers. 
 In a rare display of confidence in Japan's weakened market, Takeda, whose best-selling product is Blopress, a drug that helps reduce blood pressure, raised its full-year profit forecast nearly 8 percent to 232 billion yen ($1.9 billion) for the year ending March 2002. 
Takeda expects domestic sales of Blopress to increase 50 percent in the full year and sales of Takepron, which treats ulcers, to gain 70 percent from a year earlier, Yuzuru Takagi, a Takeda corporate planning official, told Bloomberg News.
The brighter outlook contrasts with the stream of bad news from the country's electronics companies, steel makers and banks, which are cutting thousands of jobs and shutting factories.
Takeda and other drug makers, on the other hand, are benefiting from greater deregulation of Japan's $20 billion prescription drug market, a series of well-received products and, statistically, the fastest-aging population in the world. They are also shedding their image as copiers of drugs developed overseas.
"In the past five years, we've seen an emergence of a handful of Japanese companies developing some world-class research," said Jean-Pascal Rolandez, a strategist at BNP Paribas Securities in Tokyo.
The Sankyo Company, one of Japan's largest pharmaceutical businesses, will also probably beat its first-half earnings estimates when it reports on Nov. 14. The company's best-selling drug, Mevalotin, combats cholesterol and was helped when Takeda had to pull its anticholesterol offering, Baycol, off the shelves in August.
The Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Company, another of the industry's biggest players, raised its half-year profit forecast 17 percent on Oct. 25.
Takeda's growth is more striking because it overcame several setbacks in recent months. The company, based in Osaka, recalled not only Baycol, which is made by Bayer, but also Calan, which fights strokes.
Takeda also ran afoul of the United States Justice Department, which accused TAP Pharmaceutical Products, a joint venture of Takeda and Abbott Laboratories of Abbott Park, Ill., of defrauding the Medicare and Medicaid system. TAP Pharmaceutical settled the case by paying a record $875 million in fines.
Regardless, pharmaceutical companies are benefiting as the Japanese people spend more on medicine. On average, each person pays 235,800 yen ($1,940) a year for medicine, doctor visits and other care, 42 percent more than a decade ago. Nearly 8 percent of that money is spent on medicine, two-and-a-half times the level a decade ago.
Spending on medicine has increased even as prices have declined. The government has loosened the rules that govern the sale of prescription drugs, making it easier for retailers to sell generic varieties. The Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry, which sets base prices for drugs every two years, will probably cut minimum targets again next year to reduce the burden on the debt-laden national health care system.
The cuts, however, will not severely hurt profit margins at Japanese drug makers because sales increases will continue to outpace the price declines. The government is careful to trim prices only gradually so as not to undercut the domestic manufacturers, analysts said.
Investors, too, do not appear concerned about the probable decline in drug prices. Shares in drug companies have gained 10.6 percent since the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, which increased fears of a recession in Japan. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Index has gained just 3.3 percent over the same period.

A Cross of Dollars

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
When Franklin Roosevelt took the United States off the gold standard in 1933, his budget director was aghast. "This is the end of Western civilization!" he declared. In fact, the real threat to civilization was the Depression and its political consequences, and one shudders to think what might have happened if Roosevelt hadn't defied monetary orthodoxy.
 Unfortunately, that old-time economic religion, with its narrow-minded insistence on monetary rectitude at the expense of every other consideration, has had a revival in recent years, thanks largely to the promotional efforts of right-wing think tanks. And that ideology, more than anything else, is responsible for Argentina's looming catastrophe. 
 As little as three years ago Argentina's "currency board" monetary system was the subject of extravagant praise in publications like Forbes and The Wall Street Journal, and economists at the Cato Institute established lucrative consulting practices advising other countries to mimic Argentina's approach. 
Why this enthusiasm on the right? Basically, the currency board -- introduced in 1991 to reassure investors -- returned the country to the gold standard, except that greenbacks took the place of ingots. To prevent future inflation, the system rigidly pegged the value of the peso at one dollar, and left very little discretion in monetary policy.
So what went wrong? You might think, given all the talk of debt default, that the problem was government profligacy. But Argentina's budget deficit has ranged between 1 and 3 percent of G.D.P., not bad for a depressed economy, and its government debt is only about half of G.D.P., better than many European countries. By the numbers, Argentina's fiscal picture looks better than America's did a decade ago.
The real problem with Argentina isn't fiscal, it's economic. The country is now in its fourth year of grinding recession. But the rigidity of its monetary system, designed to protect against inflation, precludes any of the actions that countries normally take to fight deflation, such as cutting interest rates or letting the currency depreciate. Instead, Argentina has gone through wave after wave of fiscal austerity, each time with the promise that the latest round of wage and job cuts would restore confidence and produce economic recovery. But austerity has not brought recovery. On the contrary, it has worsened the recession, increased social tension and further reduced confidence.
The natural answer is to remove the straitjacket: let the peso float, and do what is necessary to save the economy. That's what Britain did in 1931 and again in 1992, both times to its advantage; even Brazil, forced off its currency peg in 1999, found that floating its currency greatly improved its economic position. 
Admittedly, the fact that much private debt in Argentina is indexed to the dollar means that a peso devaluation might create financial problems. But as Ricardo Haussman, former chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank (and a strong advocate of sound money), has pointed out, there is an answer: Simply issue a decree canceling the indexation. It's a radical solution, but the situation is desperate, and there is precedent: it's more or less what Roosevelt did in 1933. And some investment bankers have privately supported such a plan for months. 
But since last spring conservative economists in the U.S. have been urging Argentina to preserve its dollar peg and default on its debt instead. And that's what's happening. 
I've written before about an apparent double standard for economic policy in the third world, but this is truly bizarre. Advanced countries often devalue their currencies -- but Argentina is being told that it can't. On the other hand, advanced countries never default on their debt -- but Argentina is being told that it must. And this even though Argentina isn't heavily in debt by normal standards, and default -- which won't let Argentina cut interest rates, won't make its goods more competitive and won't end the need for draconian fiscal austerity -- will do nothing to end the economic crisis. 
It's hard to believe that Argentina will sacrifice not just its economy but its credit rating on the altar of a discredited monetary theology. But as you read this, Argentine officials are crucifying their long-suffering nation on a cross of dollars.

Politics and Curriculum: How History Is Taught

BYLINE:  By Richard Rothstein 

 BODY:
IN 1954, my eighth-grade history teacher in Queens said we could not use the term "Civil War" but must adopt a textbook phrase, "War Between the States."
 Her instruction was not really about history, but about the controversies of her own day. By saying that the war a century earlier had mostly concerned states' rights, teachers and textbooks minimized the role of slavery and dampened support for a nascent civil rights struggle. 
 Today's texts again call it the Civil War. 
I was reminded of this by recent Asian protests over how schools in Japan teach about World War II. Koreans, for instance, have denounced a new Japanese text that says Japanese troops "advanced on," rather than "invaded," the Asian mainland. The book also ignores the "comfort women," Koreans used as sex slaves by Japanese soldiers.
This, too, is not only about history. It reflects debates about Japan's current policy toward Asia.
The interplay of politics and curriculum is the subject of "Censoring History" (M. E. Sharpe, 2000), edited by Laura Hein and Mark Selden. The book recalls a slogan from Orwell's "1984": "Who controls the past controls the future." That is true not only of totalitarians; every nation tries to shape the future when it teaches history.
In Germany, war crimes in World War II are acknowledged more forthrightly than in Japan, partly because German policy now favors European unity. Remorse for aggression and genocide was needed to win the confidence of former victims.
But German texts give little attention to how the country's big businesses participated in forced labor and extermination policies. Many of those companies are still important, and so it is not surprising that the curriculum papers over their wartime roles. In contrast, corporate collaboration with the Nazis was emphasized in East German texts before reunification.
Curriculum controversies have also flared elsewhere. A decade ago, when a Mideast peace seemed more feasible, Israeli texts described the many Palestinians who were forced from their homes in the 1948 war. Now that peace prospects have receded, books focus on the Palestinians, also numerous, who left voluntarily.
Asia provides several examples of the interplay.
After Japan's surrender in 1945, officers of the American occupation force and Japanese democratic leaders blamed the schools there, saying they had inculcated blind obedience. Early postwar texts encouraged the questioning of authority in general and the emperor in particular -- even 19th-century peasant rebellions got attention -- and did not mince words about Japanese aggression. 
But when the cold war took hold, occupation leaders wanted Japan to remilitarize against the Soviet Union. Criticism of wartime policy was muted as textbooks aimed to stir patriotism.
The pendulum swung back in the 1970's. Books again mentioned World War II atrocities, like Japan's massacre of civilians in the Chinese city of Nanjing. This textbook shift occurred at a time when Japan wanted other Asians to feel less threatened by Japanese economic leadership.
The protests this year about Japanese aggression and use of comfort women in World War II stem from a new text by Nobukatsu Fujioka. Mr. Fujioka, leader of a conservative group, was angered by what he deemed slights to Japanese honor -- for example, the United States' blocking Japan from leading a bailout of East Asian nations in the 1997 currency crisis. He aimed to write a text that instilled national pride. 
In South Korea today, students learn that World War II began in 1895, when Japan invaded their country. Leaders hoping to discourage future Japanese influence want to portray the war as a reflection of continuing Japanese imperialism.
But Korean texts gloss over collaboration by the nation's elite with Japanese colonial authorities in the first half of the 20th century. Telling that story could tarnish some leaders' present legitimacy. For similar reasons, historians in France also argue about what children should learn of their country's collaboration with the Nazis.
American texts once described slaves as content with their lot, and slave masters as benevolent. Books today describe both the inhumanity of American slavery and the genocide practiced against Indians.
But many textbooks still tiptoe around causes and conduct of the Vietnam War, to avoid stirring up political divisions dating from that era. For example, many historians say President Lyndon B. Johnson escalated the war for fear of domestic political accusations that he had lost a nation to communism, not only for national security reasons. Most texts don't discuss that. 
Arguments about textbooks only partly concern what is true. From the many facts to teach, we often select those that support adult goals. Because a democracy must argue about goals, we also argue about how to teach history. The fights will not end, and should not.

E-mail won't soon replace regular mail in the direct marketer's reach for new customers.

BYLINE:  By Bernard Stamler 

 BODY:
PITY the poor direct marketer.
 The generally sour economy is one problem. And the continuing crisis in the nation's mail system is another, making people wary of opening unsolicited or strange-looking letters. 
 Unfortunately, those letters are the lifeblood of many a direct marketer's customer-acquisition campaign. As a result, an industry that was already hurting before Sept. 11 is in deepening trouble. 
In response, some in the industry have been holding back on their mailings, at least temporarily. At the suggestion of the Direct Marketing Association, which held its 84th annual convention last week in Chicago, others have announced plans to alter their mail packaging to make it appear less threatening -- by using windowed envelopes, for example, and including clear return addresses. Still others wonder whether they should, at last, turn from regular mail to e-mail as a means to obtain new customers.
The answer is probably not, at least not yet.
"I don't see people switching to e-mail," said H. Robert Wientzen, the chief executive of the Direct Marketing Association. "I tell people that it's coming, but nothing is as ubiquitous as the regular mail. It's still the most effective medium we have."
Mr. Wientzen's comment reflects the consensus among direct marketers. E-mail has its advantages -- incredibly low costs, for one, since it requires no postage or paper or printing to pay for. And e-mail works well for retaining and marketing to existing customers who have given permission to be reached electronically (logically enough, this is called permission e-mail).
But e-mail remains relatively ineffective as a way to generate new sales leads, which are traditionally garnered from mass mailings to consumers whose names appear on mailing lists that marketers rent from list brokers or other sources.
Why doesn't cold e-mail work? Many people dislike direct mail of any kind, routinely discarding it unopened. But an even greater percentage of recipients seem to loathe its Internet equivalent, disparagingly called spam. These consumers routinely delete unsolicited messages without even reading them. Add to that a relative paucity of available e-mail address lists, containing far fewer names than do traditional mailing lists.
As a result, e-mail acquisition mailings yield relatively low response rates compared with regular mail and can actually cost much more for each lead generated.
Jim Nail, online marketing and advertising analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., says e-mail lists are often priced unrealistically high. "People who own e-mail lists have this delusion that their lists are worth $100 to $150" for 1,000 names, he said. "They should be charging $30 to $40."
Rates vary, of course, both online and off, depending on a number of variables like the nature and cost of the product to be promoted. Sellers of higher-priced products are able to pay far more to acquire customers than vendors of cheaper wares can justify. Still, list costs are higher for e-mail than for regular mail across the board, according to Jared Blank, an analyst for Jupiter Media Metrix. Though market realities have lately pushed rates downward, they "are still too high," he said.
In a recent report, Jupiter found that although the average cost of renting an e-mail list has declined to $125 for 1,000 names from $200 last year, the response rate was such that the total cost of acquiring one customer through e-mail rose to $125 from $114.
That is much more than the average industrywide cost through ordinary mail -- $66 a customer last year, according to Jupiter, including production and postage as well as the cost of renting the mailing list, which averaged $110 for 1,000 names.
The trend is directly traceable to jaded consumers who delete unsolicited e-mail messages with more dispatch now than before, Mr. Blank said, a trend that most people say will only accelerate.
So, beyond the obvious -- better lists at lower rates -- what can the industry do to make e-mail marketing work better?
Some believe that the answer is to transform acquisition e-mail into permission e-mail. In a technical sense this is already happening: when consumers agree to receive e-mail from one company, they are often agreeing to accept it from others who may rent a list with their names on it as well. That does not mean, though, that consumers will read what they get, since e-mail from unfamiliar companies still looks like spam in the in box, with or without permission.
Better to get direct permission from people who are not yet customers. To do that, marketers have to "incentivize them," said Jonathan Jackson, senior analyst for online marketing at eMarketer Inc. That means giving them something they want, he said, and advertising it in banners, in other Internet ads and even in print ads with a company's Internet address prominently displayed. Prospects will then presumably go to the site and opt in to receive e-mail.
According to Gideon Sasson, executive vice president of the active trader group at Charles Schwab Inc., the technique works. His company does "a bunch of things" to generate leads, including buying lists, but also "introducing offers to prospects" on its Web site. To entice noncustomers who view the site, Schwab also offers a number of features, including a daily e-mail summary sent to customers that tells them exactly what happened to their stocks that day.
"People love it," he said of the feature, called My Closing Summary. And it gets them in as customers, ready to receive more e-mail from Schwab.
Which, of course, is exactly the point.

HEADLINE: Text of Federal Reserve's Statement 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement issued yesterday by the Federal Reserve after its monetary policy-making panel announced that it had decided to reduce interest rates:
 The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 2 percent. 
In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 1.5 percent. 
 Heightened uncertainty and concerns about a deterioration in business conditions both here and abroad are damping economic activity. For the foreseeable future, then, the committee continues to believe that, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness.
Although the necessary reallocation of resources to enhance security may restrain advances in productivity for a time, the long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favorable and should become evident once the unusual forces restraining demand abate.
In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved the request submitted by the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.

Sky Falls In on the Swiss: Tranquillity Is a Victim

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: NYON, Switzerland, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Switzerland's image is that of an orderly country, smooth as its fabled chocolate, whose trains run as precisely as its watches and where crime does not exist, companies are profitable, and even the president takes public transport to work.
 But all that has been battered during the last six weeks by a string of crises unlike any in recent Swiss memory. 
 In late September, the tranquillity and security for which Switzerland is famed were shattered when a disgruntled gunman walked into the regional parliament in a wealthy area not far from Zurich and shot dead 14 local officials.
Days later, the indecorous collapse of the national airline, Swissair, scarred Switzerland's reputation for efficiency and reliability. 
Next, on Oct. 24, Switzerland's engineering marvel, the St. Gotthard Tunnel linking northern and southern Europe through the Alps, turned into an inferno, killing 11 people when two trucks collided.
Now, bowing to the necessity and cost of heightened security, Switzerland has agreed to allow the prestigious gathering of world economic leaders held at the ski resort of Davos every year for 32 years to be moved to New York. 
The forum and its elite agents of global capitalism had come under siege in recent years by unruly hoards of antiglobalization protesters. Now, on top of all their other setbacks, the Swiss have been left to wonder whether Davos man is now extinct. 
"I feel very insecure now," said Cornelia Mayinger, a psychologist who works on integrating immigrants near Zurich. "A lot of things have happened and I'm asking myself, 'What will it be next week?' "
Coming in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks in America, which sent shudders around the globe, the cumulative effect of these discete disasters has been akin to an Alpine avalanche. 
There is a sense of gathering, swelling catastrophe, a "rude awakening," as Christof Wamister wrote in the daily Basel newspaper Basler Zeitung, for a country that always prided itself on being an exemplary, special place.
"These things have never happened here, not in my lifetime," said Annelies Klarer, 67, who runs a sewing shop on a side street of this old Roman town. 
The rapid collapse of the country's 70-year-old airline -- "it's something close to my age" -- staggered everyone, she said.
The bankruptcy, the slayings in the affluent town of Zug near Zurich and even the collapse of the tunnel stunned the country in part because they were inflicted by the Swiss on themselves, not by outsiders.
"The Swiss can't blame someone else," Mrs. Mayinger said. "But we believe we are very special, and that makes it very difficult to change." 
Unease stems too from the creeping realization that hard as the go-it-alone Swiss have tried, the outside world has intruded. 
Far from being an island, Switzerland's population of 7.2 million is today 20 percent foreign-born. Once mostly laborers, these people are today more likely to be professional workers drawn by the booming economy of recent years, employed on better terms and exercising a greater influence on society. 
Though the Swiss are virtually alone among Europeans in refusing to join the European Union, they have anyway become more and more dependent on foreign markets. Those tighter economic ties have also circumscribed their choices. 
The multibillion dollar bailout of Swissair by the government had to be drawn up with an eye on possible objections from the European Union, which frowns on government subsidies to airlines and could have deprived Swissair of vital landing rights.
At the same time, Switzerland's sacrosanct banking secrecy has once again come under increased scrutiny, this time not as a haven for dictators' money but as a possible cover for terrorists. 
Britain's treasury secretary, Gordon Brown, caused a furor here after Sept. 11 by labeling Switzerland a "weak link" in the drive to ferret out terrorist funds. 
Profitable as it is, government officials strenuously defend bank secrecy, but surveys suggest that the public is far less wedded to a practice that often seems to bring unwanted attention. 
As for the killings in Zug, they punctured national pride and practice, being carried out by a Swiss and with a type of gun issued to all men here, so that they can be prepared if called upon to defend the country.
The action was also seen as an assault on Switzerland's traditionally open, participatory democracy -- the mixture of referendums and accessible government devised to keep the country's three cultures and four languages bound together.
Within days of the killings, checkpoints sprang up at federal and cantonal office buildings, and officials, barely guarded normally, got more protection -- even against their will. 
Then, on the day of national mourning for Zug's victims, Swissair ran out of cash.
The airline was grounded for two days with scenes -- repeatedly broadcast on television -- of 40,000 passengers stranded without food or beds. Known nationally as Switzerland's ambassador to the world, Swissair had been more than a giant national enterprise.
"It's part of our blood," said Daniel Haener of the Swiss Foreign Ministry. "When I was a small boy, I didn't know what it was to be Swiss, but I knew what Swissair was." 
The quick succession of blows to the national psyche have prompted an outpouring of letters to the Geneva-based daily Le Temps and left Swiss to wonder whether their country is, after all, like anywhere else. 
"There's a fragility now," said a journalist there, Joelle Kuntz. "People are worried that some of these things that happened in America could happen here."

HEADLINE: Editors' Note 

 BODY:
An article in Money & Business on Oct. 7 headlined "Companies' Big Debts Now Carry Big Risks" discussed the falloff in consumer spending since Sept. 11. 
The article cited a cruise operator that had filed for bankruptcy protection, and then said that even companies that were not close to the edge were imperiled by consumers' cutback in spending. That passage gave several examples, including Ethan Allen Interiors. 
 The mention of Ethan Allen in a discussion of indebted companies was not warranted. Ethan Allen executives say the company is "virtually debt-free."

Technology Shares Lead Gains After Fed Cuts Rates

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks ended sharply higher yesterday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates a half a percentage point and hinted it might cut more to bolster the sagging economy.
 "The Fed is clearly on our side and will remain so until we've seen concrete evidence of a turn in economic activity," said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisers, referring to Wall Street's initial reaction. 
 The Fed cut its federal funds rate -- a benchmark for short-term interest rates -- for the 10th time so far this year to 2 percent, its lowest level in 40 years. Lower rates reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, pumping up spending. 
Major market indexes at first seesawed the unchanged mark after the Fed's announcement, but steadily racked up gains as investors put aside worries about an increasingly grim economic environment and, instead, focused on hopes the Fed's aggressive easing could ignite a recovery next year.
"Nothing's happened so far, and they've cut a lot, so that's bothering some people," said Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed, which oversees $35 billion.
"On the other hand," he added, "another 50 basis points can't be construed as not a constructive development for economic activity."
Technology stocks, bolstered early in the day by an upbeat outlook from the technology bellwether Cisco Systems, led the climb. Its shares rose 57 cents, to $18.47. The Nasdaq composite index rose 41.43 points, or 2.3 percent, to close at 1,835.08.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 150.09 points, or 1.6 percent, to 9,591.12, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 16.02 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,118.86. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
(By Bloomberg News)
Treasury bond prices rose after the Federal Reserve cut the benchmark lending rate by a half-percentage point and signaled it may lower it again to reverse an economic slowdown.
The Fed's rate reduction, the 10th this year, to 2 percent, added to a two-year-old rally in Treasuries that has pushed the yield on benchmark two-year notes to a 43-year low. The Fed said it is concerned the economic slump is deepening, which prompted investors to buy more Treasuries on the expectation of another cut in the overnight interbank rate next month.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 9/32 , to a price of 105 28/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, declined to 4.26 percent from 4.29 percent on Monday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/32 , to 108 4/32 . The bond's yield was unchanged at 4.85 percent.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Lifetime Caring for Father Leaves 2 Brothers Little for Themselves

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
Bill and Jeff Collins have just a little more than nothing in their four-room apartment in Rego Park, Queens.
 In the bedroom they share are two mattresses that rest on the wooden floor. In the living room are two metal chairs, a fan, a television hooked up to a rabbit ears antenna, and an empty hook where a picture used to hang. 
 The brothers, 48-year-old twins, threw out most of their furniture in May when they thought they were going to be evicted. They have since gotten help with the rent that they owed. 
"We thought we weren't going to be here anymore," Jeff said, shrugging his shoulders. "So what did we need it for?"
Their living room is devoid of creature comforts, but it's the kitchen where their poverty is most visible. In the refrigerator is a Tupperware container filled with tap water and a carton of soy milk. The cupboard has plates and bowls but no food, while the shelf underneath has only a dozen letters and bills, a plastic bag of Cheerios and a toothbrush.
Their mother died when the brothers were 8. They lived with their father, David, virtually all their lives. 
David Collins, a retired taxi driver, had Parkinson's disease, diabetes and congestive heart disease and died in May 2000. Because of his health problems and a compulsive gambling habit, he never had any savings, his sons said, and depended on them for financial support and personal care. 
"We had to help him take his insulin," Jeff said. "We had to cook his meals. Late in life we had to bathe him. He couldn't do it by himself."
Far from being liberated when their father died, the brothers were afraid to face the world at large without his guidance.
But Jeff had $8,000 in the bank from jobs he held before his father became severely ill, and the two began to look for work. After a year, the money had been exhausted on food and their $866-a-month rent.
"The rent has to be paid," Bill said. "You have to pay or get out and be homeless."
When they told their landlord about their financial problems, he gave them a list of charities that could help. "There must have been 25 of them," Bill said. "We called and called. Some of them gave us some other numbers to call."
Eventually they called Karen Norden, a social worker with the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services. Ms. Norden paid two months of their rent to tide them over as they looked for work, and told them about the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, which has been helping them with their rent since then.
Both agencies are beneficiaries of UJA-Federation of New York, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
The two brothers are searching for work. In the meantime, they survive on the money Bill earns picking up pieces of paper at parks in Forest Hills, Queens, for the city's Welfare Employment Program for $137 a month.
The brothers have a folder filled with job applications and rejection letters. They estimate that in the past few months they have applied for about 100 jobs. They have applied to be file clerks, mail handlers and janitors, so far without success.
Perhaps it is a slowing economy that keeps them out of work, or their limited work experience. The two worked as temporary file clerks in Queens for Chase Manhattan Bank for two years before the company merged with Chemical Bank in 1996 and they were laid off. Before that, they worked for a home health aide service in Queens, Jeff as a file clerk and Bill as a data-entry operator. 
But they never fully pursued careers, because they wanted to fulfill their father's request that they care for him. 
He told them that they would never be successful at anything, they said, and that has given them a low sense of self-esteem. "The dilemma is that they're too honest and good for the world that we live in," said their social worker from the council, Chana Rogalsky. "They were never taught to promote themselves."
Ms. Rogalsky has helped them get a grant that has paid for their rent since May, has helped them apply for jobs, and is searching for a way they can attend a vocational school, though they do not have enough money to pay for tuition.
Bill wants to become a bus driver, but does not have enough money to take a licensing class. Jeff wants to learn more about computers and get a job where he can work in an office.
Those are the ideals, anyway. "We would like to have a career in a way," Bill started to say before he was interrupted by his brother, who said, "We'd just like to a have a job right now."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE MAIL; 
Postal Service Is Expected To Ask U.S. For Bailout

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA with CLAUDIA DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
So many Americans have shied away from mailboxes and post offices since anthrax appeared that the volume of mail handled by the United States Postal Service has dropped about 10 percent, costing at least $500 million in lost revenues and pushing the battered postal system to the brink of financial crisis, officials said yesterday. 
 Tomorrow, the Postal Service is expected to ask Congress for a bailout, similar to the one given to the airline industry, to cover the billions of dollars postal authorities say it will cost to make the mails safe. 
 The diminishing volume of mail could not have come at a worse time for the postal system. Despite rate increases in January and July, the Postal Service closed the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 with a $1.65 billion shortfall, and it expects to lose at least an additional $1.35 billion this year. 
The financial situation was so bad that even before the first anthrax-laced letter was postmarked, postal authorities had filed a request to increase the cost of a first-class stamp again, this time by 3 cents, to 37 cents. Now adding to the postal system's current woes, authorities say, will be the billions of dollars it will cost to buy the new equipment needed to sanitize incoming mail against the anthrax bacteria and to protect postal workers who may come into contact with anthrax or other biohazards. 
At a meeting of the postal board of governors yesterday, the postmaster general, John E. Potter, called the weeks since the terrorist attacks on Washington and New York "one of the most difficult and sad times in postal history." 
Two postal employees died after contracting anthrax, three have been hospitalized and more than 16,000 have been put on medication as a precaution. 
Independent sources estimate that the total cost of reacting to the anthrax emergency and the terrorist attacks could be $8 billion. Postal authorities have not yet named a figure, but Mr. Potter has said that if a Congressional bailout does not cover the cost of responding to the anthrax attacks it might be necessary for the Postal Service to raise postal rates even higher than previously planned to make up any shortfall. 
The Postal Service has already received $175 million in federal assistance to buy 4.8 million respirator masks, 88 million pairs of industrial-grade plastic gloves and other quick-fix safety enhancements for its 800,000 employees. And yesterday, postal authorities said they had reached a $24 million deal in which Ion Beam Applications of Chicago would sanitize mail at Ion's Bridgeport, N.J., operation for three months starting this week or next.
The decline in mail volume since early October follows a similar dip in the weeks immediately after Sept. 11, when the airlines -- which carry some of the nation's mail -- were grounded and business came to a temporary halt.
The drain on postal revenues -- totaling about $800 million in the entire period since Sept. 11 -- extends a corrosive cycle that the Postal Service has been fighting for more than 20 years. As alternatives like FedEx, fax machines and the broad range of Internet services have emerged to steal away some of the first-class mail that is most profitable, the Postal Service has tried to cover lost revenues by continually raising rates.
Yet, each rate increase provides more incentive for businesses to switch to some other method of communicating with customers -- causing further decline in first-class volume and laying the groundwork for even more rate increases.
"The Postal Service is in a literal free fall at this point," said Dan Moll, deputy staff director of the House Committee on Government Reform, which has overseen the Postal Service since a reorganization at the beginning of the current session of Congress.
Concern is widespread in Washington that the Postal Service is headed toward a fiscal breakdown. The 1969 law that established it as a self-supporting corporation owned by the federal government imposed a $15 billion debt ceiling. Given current trends, Mr. Moll said, "the Postal Service could reach that debt limit sometime in the second or third quarter of 2002."
Despite new electronic technology and the Internet, an expansive range of American businesses remains dependent on the postal system to solicit orders and collect payments. Some, like banks and utility companies, already have tried to reduce their reliance on the Postal Service. For example, the Potomac Electric Power Company, which serves 700,000 customers in the Washington area, said that nearly 12,000 customers paid their October bills electronically, an increase of more than 30 percent over the previous month.
For other businesses that continue to rely more heavily on the Postal Service, like catalog companies and magazine publishers, the prospect of higher rates or an overburdened Postal Service that cannot maintain standards of service, is worrisome.
"The mail service is our lifeblood," said Nina B. Link, president of the Magazine Publishers of America, which represents the largest magazines in the United States. The publishers mail about 90 percent of their magazines -- roughly 850 million issues a month -- at a cost of nearly $200 million in postage.
The publishers want a Congressional bailout to ensure the safety of the mails, but they oppose the request for a 9 percent rate that was filed Sept. 11. "There needs to be a government appropriation that deals with the safety and financial issues of the Postal Service," Ms. Link said. "It cannot come on the backs of the mailing community."
Robert E. McLean, executive director of the Mailers Council, the largest organization representing companies that rely on the mail, predicts that the total cost to the postal system of responding to anthrax could be as high as $8 billion, "depending on how long it takes to find the person responsible."
Mr. McLean said his group supported a congressionally funded rescue. But critics say the entire structure of the Postal Service and its continuing links to government need to be examined before a bailout or future rate hikes are approved.
"The temptation is way too high for the Postal Service to unload its systemic fiscal problems on the backs of taxpayers," said Rick Marquette, executive director of PostalWatch, a citizens' group that monitors the postal system. Mr. Marquette said it might be time to privatize the system and allow other companies to fully compete in delivering the daily mail. 
"A quick bailout is not going to fix the systemic problems," Mr. Marquette said. "The Postal Service needs to get its financial act together."

B6) Chart: "On Shaky Footing"The United States Postal Service makes most of its money from firstclass mail. But, while the inflation-adjusted postal rate for first-class mail has not risen since the mid-1970's, the amount of first-class mail, both in volume terms and as a percentage of the postal service's revenue, has eroded. That has caused the Postal Service to run deficits in recent years and pushed the service closer to a total debt of $15 billion, the legal limit.

HEADLINE: Philadelphia Inquirer Editor Is Forced Out 

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
Robert J. Rosenthal, the editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer, was forced out of his job yesterday in an abrupt culmination of months of tensions brought on by disagreements with executives of its corporate parent, Knight Ridder, over the newspaper's journalistic and strategic ambitions.
 The move came after 18 months of cutbacks, buyouts and steep circulation declines at The Inquirer. Mr. Rosenthal resisted pressures to make coverage more consistently local at the expense of regional, national and international coverage. 
 Bob Hall, the publisher of The Inquirer, told a stunned and grim meeting of the news staff yesterday that Mr. Rosenthal was being replaced by Walker Lundy. Mr. Lundy is a respected longtime Knight-Ridder employee who for the last 11 years set the tone for both aggressive reporting and reader-friendly feature coverage at The St. Paul Pioneer Press. 
Mr. Lundy led The Pioneer Press, which has a daily circulation of 195,000, to a 2000 Pulitzer prize for articles revealing academic cheating by members of the University of Minnesota basketball team. The articles led to the suspension of four players just before a major tournament and enraged many readers. 
The sudden change of editors in Philadelphia marks the second time this year that a top executive at a Knight Ridder newspaper left in the midst of budget-driven disputes. It also marks a major transition in the life of a newspaper that three decades ago set itself a journalistic mission of covering the city, the region, the country and the world with as much depth and breadth as any newspaper in the country. 
In recent years, the newspaper struggled financially, and its parent company was increasingly eager to satisfy investor demands and bolster its stock price. Its sweeping and expensive journalistic vision, first articulated by The Inquirer's best-known former editor, Eugene L. Roberts Jr., became a source of perpetual friction. Similar frictions led to the resignation of Jay T. Harris, the publisher of The San Jose Mercury News earlier this year.
Over the last decade, the Philadelphia region's population and job growth has stagnated while strong suburban competitors cut into The Inquirer's circulation, advertising base and profitability. 
The Inquirer's daily and Sunday circulation declined more than 8 percent in the six months ending Sept. 30, compared with the similar period a year earlier. In the last five years, as The Inquirer's daily and Sunday circulation dropped nearly 15 percent, smaller competitors like The Bucks County Courier Times and The Delaware County Times lost little if any circulation in their wealthy and growing suburbs.
Asked what differences had led to Mr. Rosenthal's departure, Mr. Hall, the publisher, said yesterday, "If you had to summarize it, it would be the commitment to local and regional and the speed with which we were getting there." He added: "It sort of evolved. I can't overemphasize that Rosey's an incredible journalist. But it was time."
Reporters and editors at The Inquirer said yesterday that Mr. Rosenthal had been reluctant to divert resources from major regional, metropolitan or national beats to local suburban coverage.
Mr. Lundy, who was introduced to the newsroom yesterday morning, said in an interview yesterday that he needed to learn more about the staff and the region before setting priorities. But, he added, "The goal here is to continue to do the kind of journalism that the paper did first under Gene," and "also figure out some ways to address the circulation issues and ways to make even more people want to read The Inquirer. I don't think it's an either-or issue."
Mr. Lundy will be the first editor not promoted from within The Inquirer newsroom since Mr. Roberts took over the newspaper in 1972. The newspaper won 17 Pulitzer Prizes during Mr. Roberts's 18-year tenure.
After announcing his departure at 10 o'clock yesterday morning to the top editors, Mr. Rosenthal spent the rest of the morning writing notes to reporters and editors, and being hugged by his colleagues. As he walked out at lunchtime, the entire newsroom stood and applauded him.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Rosenthal said of his staff: "Pound for pound I'd match them against anybody. We've gone through a tremendous amount of upheaval, but the people who remained I'm extraordinarily proud of."
Asked about the mood in the newsroom yesterday, Gail Shister, the television critic, said, "It's like Dresden after the bombing." She added, "Rosey represented, in some ways, what was great about the Inquirer, because he is a total news guy."
The newsroom was rocked earlier this year when, during buyouts to satisfy the corporate goals of 10-percent cutbacks, the managing editor, William Ward, suddenly resigned. As of September, 2001, the news staff included the equivalent of 514 full-time journalists, down about 100 from January 2000, the peak of the dot-com economic boom.

B3

The Coalition

EUROPEAN ALLIES -- After ignoring European offers of military help against the Taliban and Al Qaeda terrorist network for several weeks, the Bush administration is taking steps toward expanding the role of coalition partners. A1

GERMANY'S TROOPS -- Germany announced that it will mobilize up to 3,900 specialized troops to support the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan. Chancellor Gerhard Schroder would not say where or when the troops would be used, and there was no indication that they would be sent into combat. B4

Security and Terrorism

A WARNING IS REVERSED -- The F.B.I. lifted a warning issued last week that terrorists might be planning to destroy bridges along the West Coast and said that its investigation showed that the threat was "not credible." B5

MONITORING AIRPORTS -- The F.A.A. has increased monitoring of security at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago after a man was allowed to pass through a United Airlines security station carrying weapons, including a stun gun. B5

SEAPORT SECURITY -- In Portland, Maine, and other seaports around the nation, fears about vulnerability to terrorist attack have increased. But unlike airports, which have received massive federal attention since Sept. 11, seaports' concerns have gone mostly unnoticed. B5

The Anthrax Crisis

A STRUGGLING INVESTIGATION -- A senior counterterrorism official for the F.B.I. told senators that a month into its bioterrorism investigation, the agency still cannot answer such basic questions as how many laboratories in the country handle the anthrax bacteria. A1

THE SENATE OFFICES -- A plan to fumigate the entire Hart Senate Office Building with a powerful gas to kill anthrax bacteria has been abandoned over safety concerns. B6

HOSPITAL REOPENS -- Seeking to reassure jittery employees and attract patients after a seven-day closure, the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital reopened and was declared free of the anthrax bacteria that killed an employee last week. B6

INQUIRY IN NEW YORK -- Investigators said they believed that Kathy T. Nguyen, a hospital worker from the Bronx who died of inhalation anthrax on Oct. 31, did not leave New York City in the weeks leading up to her puzzling death. B6

ANTHRAX AND ABORTION CLINICS -- The rest of the country is just now experiencing what abortion clinics already know about anthrax scares. Clinics have been at the receiving end of at least four separate waves of mailed anthrax threats since 1989. B7

Ripples From Sept. 11

POSTAL SERVICE CRISIS -- The volume of mail handled by the United States Postal Service has dropped by about 10 percent, costing at least $500 million in lost revenues and pushing the battered postal system to the brink of financial crisis, postal officials said. The Postal Service is expected to ask Congress for a bailout on Thursday. B1

CRITICISM OF RED CROSS -- Members of a House oversight committee criticized the American Red Cross over the agency's recent decision to withhold more than $200 million in charitable donations from the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks. B1

WATCHING THE MEDIA -- As television news networks cover the war, they are having to sort through reactions from media watchdog groups accusing them of being overly critical of the government. B2

LEGISLATIVE BATTLES -- Congressional Republicans stepped up their attacks on Senate Democrats over economic stimulus legislation, while Democrats argued it was time for President Bush to get directly involved to avoid a partisan breakdown. B5

SMALLPOX VACCINE -- Health Secretary Tommy G. Thompson warned that procuring 250 million doses of smallpox vaccine would cost more than the $509 million he had previously predicted, although he did not say how much. B6

COMPUTING THE COMPENSATION -- The Justice Department has provoked sharp debate among lawyers by asking whether it should use formulas to help determine awards from the federal fund for victims of the Sept. 11 terror attacks. B7

HEADLINE: Fed Reduces Short-Term Rates to Lowest Level Since 1961 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Struggling to reverse the slide in the American economy, the Federal Reserve cut its key short-term interest rate today for the 10th time this year, aggressively pushing it down to a level not seen since early in the presidency of John F. Kennedy.
 No one doubted that the Fed's policy makers, gathered here for one of their periodic meetings, would cut interest rates again. The only question was by how much. 
 The choice to cut by half a percentage point rather than a quarter-point -- lowering the rate to 2 percent -- reflected what some analysts described as a determination on the part of the Fed to start the economy growing again in case another shock causes more economic damage.
"They see an economy clearly in recession, and they decided that it makes sense to act aggressively now to get things going as quickly as possible," said Peter Hooper, chief domestic economist for Deutsche Bank North America. "We are not out of the woods yet in this war on terrorism." 
The Fed, in a brief statement, said that it had lowered rates once again because "heightened uncertainty and concerns about a deterioration in business conditions both here and abroad are damping economic activity."
Some analysts described the reference to deterioration abroad as an attempt to encourage the European Central Bank and the Bank of England to also cut rates when they meet on Thursday. Both have been reluctant to act as strongly as the Fed to counter a potential global recession.
The Fed's policy makers reduced the so-called federal funds rate, the interest rate that financial institutions charge each other for overnight loans. That lending rate, in turn, influences the borrowing cost for commercial loans and for a variety of consumer loans, including home equity lines and car loans. Mortgage rates, which respond closely to long-term borrowing costs set by traders in the government bond market, are less affected by the Fed actions.
With little fear of reviving inflation, the Fed's overriding goal this year has been to encourage people and business to borrow and spend more. But in a weakening economy suffering from layoffs, excess capacity and dwindling consumer confidence, the Fed has been only partly successful. With the future uncertain, businesses have curbed their investments despite the cheap credit and Americans have become more cautious spenders..
Still, the economy would have been even worse off without the Fed rate cuts. The housing market has remained generally healthy and mortgage refinancing has given households extra cash for spending and paying off high-interest debt. The stock market has also stopped nose diving and today stock prices surged after the Fed's mid-afternoon announcement.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been down before the mid-afternoon announcement, rose 150.09 points, while the Nasdaq advanced 41.43 points.
"The objective here is growth, growth, growth, as soon as possible, and everything else is out the window," said Ian Shepherdson, chief domestic economist at High Frequency Economics. Like many others on Wall Street, he expects the Fed to cut the Federal funds rate again by the end of the year, to 1.5 percent.
But there was a hint of resistance on the Fed's policy-making committee, which is made up of the seven governors based in Washington and bank presidents from each of the Fed's 12 regional districts. Five of the regional presidents, in rotating groups, vote at the meetings, which are held eight times a year. In the discussion today, some apparently held out for only a quarter-point cut.
The hint of this discord came in the announcement that the Fed had also cut its largely symbolic discount rate, which is the interest that the Fed charges banks on the rare occasions when they borrow directly from the Fed. In making the announcement that the discount rate would also fall by half a percentage point, to 1.5 percent, the Fed disclosed that only one of the 12 regional banks, the Bank of Richmond, had requested a half-point cut. The standard practice is for most of the Fed's 12 regional banks to endorse a discount rate cut.
The fact that only one signed on suggested to some analysts that the presidents of other banks argued at the meeting today for a smaller cut in both the Federal funds rate and the discount rate -- but finally went along with Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, in voting for the larger amount.
"It raises the possibility that some of the policy makers preferred to slow down the rate cuts, and Greenspan felt the risks were too great," said James Glassman, chief domestic economist for J. P. Morgan Chase. The vote tally will not be published until mid-December.
The half-point cut today matched in size the two other Fed cuts since Sept. 11.
But several competing arguments are now being advanced by Wall Street economists for slowing the rate-cutting process. One is that the Fed should leave more room for future cuts, in the event that the recession now under way worsens. Another is that the Fed should take into account the stimulus that is coming from tax cuts and stepped-up government spending.
And while inflation is not a problem now, bond traders might become nervous about a rising inflation rate from too much stimulus and push up long-term rates to help protect themselves against its consequences.
"They are using up their monetary medicine too fast," said Ethan Harris, a Lehman Brothers economist. 
But since Friday, when the Labor Department announced the largest job loss for a single month in more than two decades, other analysts have encouraged the Fed to remain aggressive in cutting rates. The job numbers and a contraction in the economy in the third quarter overcame resistance to a half-point cut, they said.
Few of the years since the Depression have been as eventful for the Fed as 2001. The fed funds rate is now at its lowest level since September 1961 -- an era when neither inflation nor interest rates ever got very high. The rate has come down by 4.5 percentage points since Jan. 1 -- mostly in half-point increments.
That is out of character for Mr. Greenspan, whose preference during his 14 years as Fed chairman has been for cautious quarter-point adjustments up or down.
The problem is that this recession is different than others since World War II. In the past, the Fed has usually brought on recessions by a deliberate campaign to raise interest rates to counteract inflation from too much demand. Once inflation has been tamed, lowering rates has typically revived the economy within a relatively short time.
This time, however, business provoked the downturn by sharply cutting back on investment once it became clear that companies had poured too much money into new technology and building capacity to meet a level of demand that failed to materialize. The sell-off in the stock market only added to the alarm.
"People will no doubt refinance mortgages like crazy and that will lower debt burdens and put more cash in households' pockets," Joel L. Naroff, an economic consultant, advised his clients after today's rate cut. "But having more cash in your pocket and spending it are two different issues and that is the crux of the problem."

HEADLINE: The Next Governor of New Jersey 

 BODY:
James McGreevey, who came close to pulling off an upset victory in the New Jersey governor's race four years ago, won the job easily last night. The state reconfirmed its reputation as a place that likes its Republicans moderate, something Mr. 
McGreevey's opponent, Bret Schundler, was not.
 Although New Jersey lost hundreds of its citizens when the World Trade Center was attacked, the issues that concerned voters were apparently not related to terrorism so much as a desire to see the next governor fix nuts-and-bolts problems like high property taxes and expensive auto insurance. The challenge for Mr. McGreevey is that there is no easy way to relieve either. Property taxes are used mainly for school funding, and the state cannot afford to take much more of the education burden without raising taxes itself. 
 The polls made it clear that voters are counting on Mr. McGreevey to look after the state's economy and employment. We hope he does that with an economic development plan in which New Jersey and New York City can cooperate, not compete. 
Mr. McGreevey enjoyed a clear lead throughout the race, which allowed him to refrain from making many extremely ambitious promises. He did, however, vow to make all his appointments on merit, and voters will be watching to make sure he follows through. New Jersey has seen too much of the ineptitude associated with the privatization of such programs as auto emissions testing and E-ZPass. One way Mr. McGreevey can declare war on cronyism is by taking a strong stand behind campaign finance reform for state legislative races.

HEADLINE: THE 2001 ELECTIONS: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
Trenton Democrats Are Out of Doghouse

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J., Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Nearly a decade after they were cast into exile for foisting a politically disastrous tax increase on an unsuspecting public, New Jersey Democrats finally completed their escape from the doghouse of state politics today.
 Buoyed by James E. McGreevey's comfortable margin of victory in the governor's race, Democrats wrested control of the Assembly from the Republicans, and achieved at least a 20-20 split in the State Senate. The new balance of power in Trenton will give Democrats the predominant role in setting the state's agenda for the first time since 1993. 
 Mr. McGreevey's win was so decisive that party leaders were quick to cast the victory as a mandate, and on Monday, Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was already proclaiming that the opinion polls were a "referendum on the Republicans' stale ideas." 
But many nonpartisan political analysts say the election results were less an indictment of Republican rule than a return to political equilibrium in New Jersey, a state that generally leans slightly Democratic.
"Most New Jersey voters no longer remember that it was Jim Florio and the Democrats who pushed the tax increase, but after 10 years of prosperity, people still have their two cars and their three television sets," said Gerald M. Pomper, a professor of political science at Rutgers University. "And after eight years of Republicans in power, I think it was natural for people to want to give the Democrats a chance again."
That return of the political pendulum was nudged along by a newly redrawn map of legislative districts that favored Democratic candidates, and the implosion of the state Republican Party after Christie Whitman stepped down as governor this year to join the Bush administration.
When New Jersey's tax revolt began to gather steam in 1991, it was hard to envision the day when the state's volatile electorate might be willing to forgive.
The revolt began in 1990, when the newly inaugurated governor, Jim Florio, rammed a $2.8 billion tax increase through the Legislature at a time when Democrats controlled both houses. Antitax groups and talk radio hosts harnessed the widespread public anger.
In 1991, the voters' wrath boiled over into an electoral disaster for Democrats, who lost control of both houses of the Legislature. In 1993, Mr. Florio himself was defeated by Mrs. Whitman, beginning an eight-year period of total Republican control in the State House. 
Mr. McGreevey's Republican opponent, Bret D. Schundler, tried to rekindle that anger during this fall's campaign, reminding voters that his opponent had voted for the tax increase and warning that Mr. McGreevey would "be worse than Jim Florio." But time appeared to have taken the sting from those words, and some polls showed that even many of Mr. Schundler's supporters expected a tax increase regardless of who won.
As an advocate of looser gun control laws and an opponent of abortion rights, Mr. Schundler was anathema to the moderates who have long made up New Jersey's Republican establishment. The party offered Mr. Schundler little financial support; it was already weakened by Mrs. Whitman's departure and Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco's abrupt withdrawal from the race after questions were raised about several of his business deals. 
And despite eight years of solid growth in the state's economy, Republicans did not solve its most enduring problems: school financing, suburban sprawl, high property taxes and the nation's most expensive auto insurance rates.
"I don't think there was much affection for Governor Whitman or the Republicans," said Prof. James W. Hughes, dean of the Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers. "There was no mourning or celebration or anything really. She was just gone. And Schundler came from a conservative wing of the party that even New Jersey Republicans never fully embraced."
Now that Democrats have returned to power, however, they inherit a daunting set of political challenges. After years of unparalleled prosperity, statistics from the State Labor Department show that the economic slowdown has cost New Jersey 27,000 jobs this year. Republicans increased the state debt in the past eight years, leaving the administration little room for new borrowing should tax revenues decline. 
The Sept. 11 terror attack and the high cost of increased security are also likely to drain the state budget, forcing the incoming administration to choose among tax increases, borrowing and deep cuts in services. 
"In some ways, the Democrats might be better off if the Republicans control at least one house of the Legislature," said David P. Rebovich, a political science professor at Rider University. "That way, if there are tax increases, they can share the blame and everyone walks the plank together."
But after 10 years as political outcasts, Democrats have vowed not to repeat the mistakes of 1990. While Mr. McGreevey would not join Mr. Schundler in pledging not to raise taxes, he made it clear that he would consider it only as a last resort.
Likewise, Assemblyman Joseph J. Roberts Jr., the state Democratic chairman, managed to discuss the subject at length this week without ever uttering the dreaded T-word. 
"I have absolutely no expectations that under any circumstances will Jim McGreevey have to take any such steps," he said. "The lesson of 10 years ago is that if, at some point in the future, there is a need to take those measures, it would be done only after every other alternative had been exhausted and if people were overwhelmingly in favor of it."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE SEAPORTS; 
On the Dock, Holes in the Security Net Are Gaping

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Me., Nov. 3 

 BODY:
The big cargo ships and ships with truck-size containers pull up to docks where no one inspects their contents. Brown tankers from the Middle East steam into the bay, slide under a drawbridge that bisects the Fore River and tie up by terminals, tanks and a pipeline that carries the oil that heats Montreal.
 In warmer weather, cruise ships like the QE2 and the Royal Empress with up to 3,000 tourists park at piers on busy Commercial Street, right next to Portland's lively downtown. 
 For Portland's officials, the scene, at least before Sept. 11, was a point of pride, the sign of a strong economy and a proud maritime heritage. Now it evokes fear and uncertainty. The unscrutinized containers, the bridge, the oil tanks, the dormant but still-radioactive nuclear power plant 20 miles north of the harbor -- all form a volatile mix in a time of terrorism. 
The usual barrier is chain-link fence. "It keeps out the honest people," said Paul D. Merrill, owner of a cargo terminal. "That's what it comes down to." The Port of Portland, Police Chief Michael Chitwood said, "is a tinderbox." 
Remote as it seems on the northeastern ear of the nation, Portland is not particularly exceptional among the nation's 361 seaports. The ports of New York and New Jersey, Miami, Long Beach, Calif., and Los Angeles are much bigger and busier. Yet like most ports, the one here is near a population center and it is packed with bridges, power plants, and combustible and hazardous materials.
All that makes ports among the country's greatest points of vulnerability. 
Even so, no national plan exists to thwart attacks against them, to respond if one happens or to organize a community afterward. No federal agency regulates seaports the way the Federal Aviation Administration manages airports. They are managed locally, often by the private businesses that use them. All are overseen by a patchwork of agencies, already stretched thin, some monitoring hundreds of ships a day. 
Compared with the attention being given to airline security, security at the ports has gone largely unnoticed, even though they handle 95 percent of the cargo that enters from places other than Canada and Mexico. A bill to tighten port security has passed a Senate committee. The full Senate could vote on the bill within two weeks, but the debate has yet to begin in the House of Representatives. 
"People in Congress don't have any idea it's a problem," said Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, who is chairman of the Commerce Committee and co-sponsor of the bill with Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida. "I've got folks who don't have ports in their states. It's hard to get it in front of their heads." 
Port officials are aware of various threats, like using a tanker or fuel-loaded cruise liner as a bomb, secreting weapons and explosives in containers, hijacking a ship and ramming it into a nuclear plant on the shores of a river, or infesting a cargo of grain or seeds with a biological weapon. 
Given the potential dangers, the security measures in place are far from adequate.
"We're looking for needles in a haystack," said Dean Boyd, a spokesman for the United States Customs Service. "And the haystack has doubled." International trade has doubled since 1995 while the number of people to handle inspections has remained roughly constant, he said.
The Coast Guard patrols coasts and harbors but little of the land or the cargo. It checks out ships coming in from the open sea but has no way of thoroughly searching everything that comes by.
The Customs Service says it can inspect only 2 percent of the 600,000 cargo containers that enter seaports each a day on more than 500 ships. Of the 2 percent, many are not inspected until they reach their final destination, sometimes on the opposite coast, where they travel unguarded by rail, barge and truck.
Last year, a government commission on crime and security at seaports found similar weaknesses. The commission surveyed 12 major ports including those of New York and New Jersey, Miami, Los Angeles, New Orleans and Charleston.
While withholding their identities for security reasons, the report found that only three of the ports tightly controlled access from the land and that access from the water was completely unprotected at nine of them. 
The report also emphasized the hazards posed by materials unloaded from ships. "The influx of goods through U.S. ports provides a venue for the introduction of a host of transnational threats into the nation's infrastructures," the report said. 
A tangled chain of authority further compromised security, the commission said, a point echoed by the authorities in Portland. 
"No one's in charge," said Jeffrey W. Monroe, director of transportation for the city. "There's no central guidance." 
And ports have a strong economic incentive to limit control. With the taxes that cruise ships, tankers and other businesses pay, ports are the lifeblood of their communities. Port authorities' principal constituencies are private industry and economic development offices, whose mission is growth, not security. "They win if they move more cargo," Senator Hollings said.
In Portland, the seaport has been a boon, generating millions of dollars a year in revenues. Mr. Monroe said that in the past year the bulk cargo business grew 10 percent, passenger traffic and oil imports both rose by 20 percent. But the stalling economy and now the cost of heightened security have wiped out nearly all that the seaport and airport contribute to the city budget.
In Congress, the Hollings-Graham legislation would help cities meet some of the cost of securing their ports. It would give the Coast Guard regulatory control over ports, require background checks of waterfront workers and provide for 1,500 new Customs agents. 
Before the September attacks, the seaport industry's principal lobby, the American Association of Port Authorities, fought the legislation, arguing that it would impose one-size-fits-all security systems for all seaports. 
Though the group now supports many provisions of the bill, it still has questions over the matter of who controls security. Meanwhile, ports have taken their own steps to improve security. In Florida, Gov. Jeb Bush announced he would deploy the National Guard to oversee four of the state's busiest ports. In California, Gov. Gray Davis tightened security around bridges. 
In Portland, officials and businesses have taken similar steps. Minutes before the drawbridge opens for a tanker, police officers arrive to monitor both sides of the bridge. Fences are being repaired and installed. 
At the city's International Marine Terminal, where from May to October the Scotia Prince carries 170,000 passengers on 11-hour cruises between Portland and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, visitors used to roam freely around the pier. Now only passengers are allowed there, and then only after they and their baggage are cleared by metal detectors and bomb dogs. The pilings below the pier are now illuminated at night.
For its part, the Coast Guard now focuses primarily on harbor security. It requires vessels weighing more than 300 tons to notify the port 96 hours before arrival. The big ships also must fax crew lists, said Lt. Cmdr. Wyman W. Briggs, executive officer of the guard's facilities in Portland. The crews of fishing boats must carry picture ID's.
For all this, much tighter seaport security may prove impossible. Seaports cannot be secured like airport, said Brian Nutter, administrator for the Maine Port Authority in Augusta. "You can't fence off the whole state of Maine," Mr. Nutter said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
10th Fed Rate Cut This Year Raises Hopes for a Recovery

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates again yesterday, pushing down short-term rates as far this year as it has usually done before the economy comes out of a recession. Stock market investors now seem to believe a recovery will begin by the middle of next year.
 Despite some hesitation after the announcement of the half-point reduction, share prices ended the day with a solid rally -- making it the most enthusiastic reaction of the year for any of the cuts that have come at regularly scheduled meetings of the central bank's policy making Federal Open Market Committee. 
 The cut leaves the rate on overnight loans between banks at 2 percent, the lowest since 1961. 
The three major market averages, the Dow Jones industrial average, the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite index, ended the day up 1.5 percent or more. They had been mixed to down after the first five expected moves this year, but rose, albeit not as strongly as yesterday, after the last move, on Oct. 2.
Lower interest rates are expected to stimulate the economy by making it less expensive for individuals and businesses to borrow money. One rate the Fed directly controls is now down more than two-thirds from where it began the year. That is about the same amount as rates fell before recent recessions ended.
In part, yesterday's market advance reflected more mystery than usual surrounding the Fed meeting. While all Fed forecasters expected a cut, they were split between factions that expected a quarter-point cut -- or 25 basis points -- and those that expected the cut to be twice as much.
"It means that the Fed is nervous about the economy," said William C. Dudley, the chief United States economist of Goldman, Sachs, after the Fed announced the bigger move. "I think there was probably a big debate about 25 or 50."
A possible sign of dissent in the Fed was the fact that only one of the 12 Fed regional banks, the one based in Richmond, Va., had asked for a half-point reduction in the discount rate, the interest on loans by the Fed to banks. On Oct. 2, eight of the 12 banks had requested cuts.
Under the Fed's rules, the Open Market Committee has complete discretion over the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight. But moves in the discount rate must be initiated by regional banks.
If there was substantial dissent, and that will only become clear when minutes of yesterday's meeting are released, that may make a large cut at the next meeting, on Dec. 11, less likely. Many economists expect a quarter-point cut at that meeting.
The Fed's only comment yesterday was a terse statement notable largely for two changes from its October statement. It mentioned that business is weak overseas and that increased security spending "may restrain advances in productivity for a time."
While neither point had been made before in the Fed's announcements of rate cuts, both were widely understood by investors and did not seem to bother traders. The stock market has rallied since it hit bottom on Sept. 21, a week after trading resumed following the Sept. 11 attacks, and those rising prices appear to have both reflected and reinforced hopes for an economic recovery.
Since those bottoms, the Dow and S.& P. 500 are up about 16 percent, while the Nasdaq index has leaped 29 percent.
With yesterday's cut, the federal funds rate has fallen from a cyclical peak of 6.5 percent to 2 percent. While previous recessions have often started when rates were far higher -- and therefore had more percentage points to fall, one way to compare cuts is by the percentage decline.
Comparing that to past recessions is a bit tricky, because the Fed did not always use the federal funds rate as a target, and it tended to be more volatile. But Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company, noted that this decline is generally in line with those of the past.
In the recessions that ended in 1970, 1975 and 1991, the declines from the peak monthly average of the federal funds rate to the low monthly average ranged from 64 percent to 70 percent, he said. The two exceptions were the mini-recession of 1980 and the longer one that ended in 1983, when the declines were 49 percent and 55 percent, respectively.
The Fed has now cut rates 10 times this year -- seven at regularly scheduled meetings and three between meetings. The first two surprise moves, in January and April, produced market surges that faded within weeks or months. The third, on Sept. 17, came the day the market reopened after the attacks, and may have limited the falls that day.
This recession -- assuming as most economists do that one has begun -- differs from previous downturns in several ways. Normally recessions begin with weakness in the housing and auto sectors, as higher interest rates lead to depressed sales. But this time it was the industrial economy that went first, and consumer spending held up surprisingly well for most of this year.
The Fed's aggressive cuts in rates have helped to support housing, which has only recently begun to weaken, and car sales are now strong -- although that is widely viewed as stemming from aggressive price cutting by automakers, which are losing money despite the strong sales.
Paradoxically, the strength of demand in those two sectors makes it less likely that they will be able to lead the recovery when it arrives, since there appears to be little pent-up demand. But, Mr. Dudley at Goldman, Sachs said, there are other areas that are likely to provide stimulus, starting with the effect of lower energy prices and additional production by companies after they finish reducing inventories that had been too large when the slowdown began. And, he added, there is the delayed, but still expected, fiscal stimulus package from Washington.
For now, anyway, the stock market seems to be confident that the economy will revive. And while yesterday's decision by the Fed to go for a bigger cut may be evidence of greater concern about economic weakness, investors believe it simply makes the eventual recovery that much more certain.

ALCOA TO BUY 8 PERCENT OF ALUMINUM CORP. OF CHINA

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminum maker, said yesterday that it would buy 8 percent of the Aluminum Corporation of China, the country's largest producer of the metal, to expand in China's growing economy while the United States economy slumps. The Chinese state-controlled company plans to offer a total of a 30 percent stake and raise about $350 million, the International Financing Review said yesterday, citing an unidentified banker. The shares, which will be sold starting Nov. 19, will trade in London and New York.

SONIC SHARES DROP 19 PERCENT ON PROFIT WARNING

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 Shares of the Sonic Corporation, which owns the largest chain of drive-restaurants in the United States, fell as much as 19 percent yesterday after it said its fiscal first-quarter earnings would be at the lower end of analysts' estimates. Sonic shares fell $5.52, to $29.73, in early afternoon trading of 1.49 million, seven times the three-month daily average. 
The stock, which traded as low as $28.45, reached a 52-week high yesterday of $35.25. It ended the day down $4.28, to $30.97. Profit in the quarter ending Nov. 30 will be at the lower end of the range of 33 to 36 cents a share because of worsening consumer confidence and economic conditions, the Oklahoma City-based company said. The average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call was 35 cents.

Back to Business: Baseball Votes to Drop 2 Teams

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: ROSEMONT, Ill., Nov. 6 

 BODY:
In a move that Commissioner Allan H. (Bud) Selig said was necessary for economic reasons, Major League Baseball owners voted overwhelmingly today to eliminate two of their 30 teams before next season. The two teams are to be determined, Selig said, but the strong feeling among team executives was that they would be the Montreal Expos and the Minnesota Twins.
 "No modern American sport has done this," Selig said at a news conference after the 28-2 vote. But, he said, the step was necessary as a significant way of dealing with the game's economic problems. 
 "It makes no sense for major league baseball to be in markets that generate insufficient local revenues to justify the investment in the franchise," Selig said. "The teams to be contracted have a long record of failing to generate enough revenues to operate a viable major league franchise." 
This will be the first time since the formation of the major leagues as they exist today that teams will be eliminated. The National League dropped four teams after the 1899 season, going from 12 to 8, but the American League did not come into existence until 1901.
With their action, the owners, in trying to solve one problem, created another one. Their unilateral decision, without consultation with the players' union, promises to make negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement more difficult than they were already going to be.
Donald M. Fehr, the executive director of the players' union, called the vote "most imprudent and unfortunate," adding in a statement: "Over this last season, and, especially, over the last several weeks, we have been reminded, vividly, of the special place baseball holds in America. This makes it all the more unfortunate that the clubs would choose this moment to dash the hopes of so many of its fans."
Commenting briefly on labor, Selig announced that the owners would not lock out the players nor would he impose a signing freeze "at the present time." The labor contract expires at midnight Wednesday.
By not identifying the teams that will be eliminated, Selig left off-season plans for some teams under a cloud. Free agents can begin signing new deals in two weeks, but they will not want to commit to a team that might not exist on April 1. Fans, too, will be reluctant to commit to buying season tickets without knowing if they will have a use for them.
The commissioner declined to say how many teams were candidates for elimination, but there appeared to be five, with the Montreal Expos and the Minnesota Twins the overwhelming favorites to be terminated before spring training next February. Those teams were the two "no" votes, but each owner had his reason for voting that way. Jeffrey H. Loria, the Expos' owner, had said that he would not vote for eliminating his own team, and Carl R. Pohlad, the Twins' owner, presumably wanted to be able to say that he voted against contraction.
Selig did not indicate how much baseball would pay the owners of the teams that were dropped, but it is expected to be from $125 million to $200 million. The commissioner did not provide details on how the process of contraction would be carried out, nor did he give a date for when the procedure would be completed.
The Expos, who joined the N.L. as an expansion team in 1969, are an obvious candidate. Interest in baseball in Montreal has waned considerably in recent years, and Loria had quietly hoped to be able to move the team, possibly to northern Virginia.
But Selig ruled out relocation for the moment "because there exists no prospective market that meets the desired requirements for fielding a stable, competitive and economically viable franchise for next season."
The Twins are next on the list because Pohlad has wanted to get out of baseball, and the money he would receive from Major League Baseball would almost certainly be more than he could get from the sale of the team. 
In addition, Selig and Pohlad have been close over the years, and some people in baseball believe Selig will present contraction as a going-away gift to Pohlad, who has been a strong and loyal supporter.
The other three teams that could be considered are the two Florida teams, the Florida Marlins and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, and the Oakland Athletics.
The Marlins and the Devil Rays are struggling to hold their fans but seem to be fighting a losing battle. Baseball would very likely face a stiffer legal challenge from the state of Florida than from Montreal, where no fight would be expected, and Minnesota, where the Twins have only a year left on their Metrodome lease.
A high-ranking baseball official confirmed that Loria, if he loses the Expos, would buy the Marlins, whose owner, John Henry, hopes to buy the Anaheim Angels, whom the Walt Disney Company wants to sell.
The Athletics at one time seemed to be as obvious a candidate for contraction as the Expos, but they have developed a highly attractive team and are taking steps to hold on to their good young players. Selig said many owners, possibly a majority, favored the elimination of four teams, but he said two would be the number for now. One owner said the Yankees and the Mets were among the teams that proposed four be eliminated. 
The owners acted without consulting the players association. Baseball officials maintain that they do not have to negotiate contraction, only the effects of contraction, meaning what happens with the players from the two teams. 
"We consider this action to be inconsistent with the law, our contract, and perhaps, most important, the long-term welfare of the sport," Fehr said. "This is the worst manner in which to begin the process of negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement. We had hoped that we were in a new era, one which would see a much better relationship between players and owners. Today's announcement is a severe blow to such hopes." 
Selig said his office would complete negotiations with the teams to be contracted and begin negotiating with the union on the effects of the action, including dispersal of the players from the contracted teams.
But when negotiations for a new labor agreement begin, the owners will seek major concessions from the union on economic issues, and the union will most likely be less willing to consider the changes the owners say they need. Interleague play could be a casualty of contraction. The union has yet to approve interleague play for next season and now may very well reject its continuation.
By eliminating two financially ailing teams, the owners will have two fewer teams to subsidize through their revenue-sharing plan and two fewer teams with which to share national revenue, such as television, licensing and Internet money. 
Furthermore, they will be able to divide playing talent among fewer teams, although that idea never seemed to intrigue them when they were expanding and taking in hundreds of millions of dollars from new franchises.
The elimination of two teams, assuming they are the Expos and the Twins, would leave the N.L. with 15 teams and the A.L. with 13. One N.L. team, very likely the Pittsburgh Pirates, would have to move from the Central to the East to replace the Expos. To maintain an even number of teams in each league, one N.L. team would have to move to the A.L.
Baseball officials have talked in the past about moving the Arizona Diamondbacks from the N.L. to the A.L., but the Diamondbacks have objected. Now that they have the added stature of being the World Series champions, the Diamondbacks could be even more difficult to dislodge.

Flexibility in Victory; James Edward McGreevey

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
He has been introducing himself to the New Jersey public for six straight years, but James Edward McGreevey has never really gotten past hello.
 In his 1997 campaign for governor, Mr. McGreevey told the voters that Christie Whitman was an out-of-touch aristocrat who had failed to lower property taxes, auto insurance rates and the state's debt. He lost by only 1 percent. 
 This year, Mr. McGreevey told the voters that Bret D. Schundler was an out-of-step extremist who wanted to undermine the public schools, curtail abortion rights and let people carry concealed weapons. He won handily by recent New Jersey standards.
Yet in all this time on the campaign trail, Mr. McGreevey, 44, has revealed precious little of himself. He coasted to victory this year without having made a single ambitious promise, offering instead only modest remedies for core middle-class concerns.
Those omissions, his advisers say, could prove enormous advantages as he prepares to take office as New Jersey's 51st governor. He will need all the flexibility he can muster in a state now facing an estimated $1.5 billion budget shortfall, a stalled economy and the daunting challenges to the public safety, health and mood that have arisen since Sept. 11.
What New Jerseyans do know about Mr. McGreevey is that he has worked toward this moment his entire adult life, and probably much longer than that. His second-grade classmates at St. Joseph elementary school in Carteret say they were sure he would run for governor someday.
New Jerseyans also know that he is a perpetual student and an inexhaustible worker. He was a notorious grind in college and graduate school, packing his semesters and summers with extra courses. When he lost to Mrs. Whitman, he embarked on a grueling course of self-instruction in the people, places and public policies of the Garden State, walking and talking through its major cities and countless hamlets. He led seminars on the mind-numbing but important arcana of land use and municipal functions as president of the state's Conference of Mayors.
"For the last four years, no one has studied more about this state and learned more about its people than Jim McGreevey," said Robert Sommer, a Democratic lobbyist and fund-raiser for Mr. McGreevey. "And I can't imagine anybody being more fully prepared to take over in such an incredibly difficult time."
He is also undeterred in defeat, magnanimous in victory, and adept at making friends of his adversaries no matter how their clashes end, supporters say. These are characteristics that could prove valuable in facing fiscal crises or other threats.
Mr. McGreevey did that in Woodbridge, where he was elected mayor in 1991, but had to win over Republicans who controlled the Township Council. More recently, even though Democrats hold every seat on the Council, he continued to reappoint one of his loudest and harshest Republican critics to a prominent position on the township's Library Board.
Last year, when Senator Robert G. Torricelli suddenly tried to hijack the Democratic nomination for governor that Mr. McGreevey had believed was his, Mr. McGreevey refused to say a critical word about the foe who had been his friend, even after he had dealt Mr. Torricelli's coup attempt a crushing blow.
"Politically, he's always been able to turn the other cheek, because he looks forward," said Gary Taffet, Mr. McGreevey's campaign manager and probable chief of staff. "He's not personally vindictive. It's just not his nature."
Mr. McGreevey's thick skin and consensus-building style could help him work with lawmakers in both parties better than any governor since Thomas H. Kean, said State Senator John Lynch, a political patron and adviser to Mr. McGreevey.
"It isn't so much that he wants peace as that he sees the benefits of building a team, of trying to make people feel more comfortable with his leadership," he said. "And he's right. It works."
James Edward McGreevey was born in Jersey City, the state's Democratic power center throughout much of the last century, on Aug. 6, 1957. He was named for an uncle who had died in the battle of Iwo Jima. His parents, Veronica and Jack McGreevey, a nurse and a trucking company salesman, raised their three children in Carteret, on a close-knit block with many other Jersey City natives.
Except for kindergarten, Mr. McGreevey was educated at two parochial schools: St. Joseph elementary school in Carteret, and St. Joseph High School in Metuchen. He spent three semesters at Catholic University in Washington before transferring to Columbia University, where he majored in political science and graduated in 1978. He received a law degree from Georgetown in 1981 and a master's in education from Harvard in 1982.
He entered politics immediately after returning from Cambridge, spending a year as a Middlesex County assistant prosecutor and two years as a lawyer for the Democrats who controlled the State Assembly. He was named executive director of the State Parole Board by Governor Kean in 1985, at 27. Two years later, he became a lobbyist for Merck & Company, the pharmaceutical manufacturer in Rahway.
Mr. McGreevey was elected to the Assembly from Woodbridge in 1989, but served only one term. In 1991, he was stripped of the nomination to his seat by Joseph DeMarino, the local Democratic leader. In return, Mr. McGreevey successfully challenged Mr. DeMarino's re-election as mayor of Woodbridge. He was re-elected easily in 1995 and 1999. He also served one term in the State Senate, from 1994 to 1997.
He has a 9-year-old daughter, Morag (Gaelic for Mary), who lives with her mother, Karen J. Schutz, in Vancouver, British Columbia. He and Ms. Schutz were married in 1991 and divorced in 1997. 
Mr. McGreevey was married on Oct. 7, 2000, to Dina Matos, an executive at Columbus Hospital in Newark, who turned 35 on Monday. Mrs. McGreevey is seven months pregnant; Mr. McGreevey joked along the campaign trail that their child was due just in time for his inauguration.
But Mrs. McGreevey went into early labor last weekend and has been hospitalized since Saturday. Her husband was at her side almost constantly until delivering his acceptance speech tonight.
While Mr. McGreevey's modest agenda leaves him room to move, it also may allow skeptics to question whether he is up to the job he has finally won. But those who know him best say Mr. McGreevey has often been misjudged in the past -- by Mr. Torricelli, by rivals in Woodbridge, by Mr. Schundler -- and it would be a mistake to do it again.
"So many people over the years have underestimated him," Mr. Lynch said. "Maybe that changes tomorrow. But I suspect that there are a lot of people who suspect that he's not as deep as he is, that he hasn't grown as much as he has, and that he's not as talented as he is." 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 8, 2001

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a Man in the News article yesterday about James E. McGreevey, the New Jersey governor-elect, used an erroneous given name in some copies for a state senator who said Mr. McGreevey was a consensus builder. He is John Lynch, not Robert.

Latino Mayor for Hartford; New Haven Incumbent Wins

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Hartford voters made history today by electing the city's first Latino mayor, while New Haven's longtime mayor, a fellow Democrat, won his race for a fifth term.
 In Waterbury, the endorsed Democrat, State Representative Michael J. Jarjura, won, according to unofficial results. He and two other candidates were competing to succeed Mayor Philip A. Giordano, who is serving the remainder of his term from prison, while he faces charges that he raped two girls. 
 In Hartford, Eddie A. Perez, the endorsed Democrat, defeated former City Councilman Robert F. Ludgin, a Democrat who petitioned to be on the ballot, by a vote of more than 4 to 1. 
At 9:30 last night, several supporters carried Mr. Perez on their shoulders into a victory celebration at Troutbrook Brewery, a Hartford bar. A band played salsa music and supporters chanted "Viva Eddie."
"It feels good to say Senor Alcalde," Mr. Perez said, as he addressed supporters who were calling him "Mr. Mayor."
Mr. Perez, 43, who moved to Hartford from his native Puerto Rico at age 14, made history not only in Hartford but also in New England, where he will be the first Hispanic mayor of a state capital. He is the president of a neighborhood group, Southside Institutions Neighborhood Alliance, and campaigned on a promise to build and renovate schools in a city where failing schools led to a state takeover of the Board of Education in 1997.
The job, however, is largely ceremonial because of Hartford's "weak mayor" form of government, which Mr. Perez's predecessor, Mike Peters, failed to change in a referendum last year.
Mr. Perez's supporters have said that they will push for another vote.
New Haven's mayor, John DeStefano Jr., a Democrat, won by a vote of nearly 3 to 1 over Joel Schiavone, a Republican real estate developer, according to unofficial results.
Two cornerstones of Mr. DeStefano's campaign were increasing home ownership and universal preschool for children.
Julio Gonzalez, the mayor's campaign chairman, said Mr. DiStefano, 46, promised to build more housing downtown and spur economic development there and at the harbor.
In Waterbury, Mr. Jarjura, 40, a lawyer and vice president of a family produce company who has served 10 years in the State Legislature, won with about 39 percent of the vote, according to unofficial results. He was challenged by Larry DePillo, 52, a Democrat who petitioned to be on the ballot, and Dennis Odle, 49, a Republican.
The new mayor will inherit the reins of a city whose finances and administration are under state control for the next four years in an effort to tackle a $50 million deficit.
Mr. Jarjura wanted to "restore dignity to city government," said his campaign manager, Garrett Casey.
Mr. Jarjura also vowed to seek a review of all city services and all nonincome-producing properties in an attempt to ease the burden of a 30 percent property tax increase imposed by the state oversight board, Mr. Casey said.
Elections were held in all but seven of the state's 169 towns, with races for mayor or first selectman in 132 towns. Problems with some voting machines complicated the balloting in two southeastern Connecticut towns. In New London, for a few minutes after the polls opened, voters were in some cases unable to choose candidates from more than one party because the machines had been prepared incorrectly. All votes cast during those few minutes will be counted in the regular tally, but a record of the number of votes cast will be retained as evidence should someone challenge the results.
In Waterford, all the pointers on four machines at two different polling places pointed to blank spaces from 6 a.m. until 9 a.m.
Officials said 225 people voted on these machines, and their votes would not be counted but kept aside for a record.

In Suburbia, Vouchers Sink Schundler's Campaign

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINERIP 

DATELINE: PLAINSBORO, N.J. 

 BODY:
IT almost seemed that in his run for New Jersey governor, Bret D. Schundler forgot he needed the suburban vote. New Jersey, the most suburban state, with the nation's highest annual income, $54,226 per household. In no other major industrial state do cities count so little, says James Hughes, a Rutgers public policy expert. Only 10 percent of New Jersey people live in its six biggest cities (compared to New York State, where 60 percent do.)
 So what did Mr. Schundler pick for a cornerstone of his campaign? A $1 billion school voucher/tax credit program that would provide public financing for mainly city children to attend private and parochial schools. Forget whether this is a violation of the separation of church and state. It was suicide for a New Jersey Republican. Vouchers have no appeal to suburban Republicans. Suburbanites have terrific public schools and pay high taxes for them. They're going to vote for a man who wants them to pay more taxes so that poor city kids can attend private school? 
 Yesterday, voters here miles from Mr. Schundler's headquarters at the Princeton Marriott were unanimous. "We moved to Plainsboro for the public schools," said Matt Poulter, a Merrill Lynch worker who voted for the Republican Christie Whitman two times, but for the Democrat James E. McGreevey yesterday. "Why give private schools our money?"
"If you want to send your kids to private school, pay for it yourself," said Shelley Marini, a professional service manager who voted for McGreevey. Even Republicans voting for Schundler, like Pat Luther, wife of the local Republican chairman, seemed miffed. "I never understood the voucher thing," she said. "We pay high property taxes for good public schools." 
Several years ago, I interviewed Mr. Schundler about vouchers. The Jersey City mayor seemed miffed that Governor Whitman hadn't passed a voucher plan in the Republican-controlled Legislature, and he was sure it was just a matter of time. He could not see that Governor Whitman, of Somerset County, was the quintessential soccer mom; that the Republican Senate leader at the time, Donald T. DiFrancesco of Scotch Plains, was a suburban soccer dad; and that mom and dad were never going to make a voucher plan for the Jersey City whiz kid.
Why didn't Mr. Schundler take the easy way out and drop it? He is an intellectual, a man who believes in ideas, making him a political rarity. At Harvard, he could be painfully intense whatever his cause was -- human rights or his Christian beliefs. In the 1980's, when he was still a Democrat, he wasn't a pragmatic Mondale Democrat; he was a Gary Hart Democrat. In the 1990's, when he took a stand against abortion, he didn't say he personally opposed it, but believed in a woman's right to choose; to Mr. Schundler, abortion was murder, and not even rape justified murder.
He often says school choice is today's civil rights issue. And yesterday, this conservative Republican suffered the same fate as those liberals from the 1970's who tried to use government to help promote racial integration through methods like school busing. At the Marriott, he sounded like a 70's liberal. As reporters asked if he was bracing for a loss, he seemed genuinely humble when he said: "A good life isn't about getting to someplace any way. A good life is doing anything you can to make the world a better place." 
THE main thing he did offer suburbanites -- a plan to ban tolls on the Garden State Parkway -- was not believable. "Cut the tolls?" said Mrs. Luther, a Republican. "Not with the way the economy is going." Or as David Koricki, 19, voting for the first time (and for Mr. McGreevey), said, "Not going to happen." After Sept. 11, Mr. Schundler's plans seemed even more out of step to suburbanites who would be happy to hold onto what they had. "Suburbanites are just hoping for the status quo," Mr. Hughes said.
Mr. McGreevey didn't feel pressure to come up with an ambitious education plan to help inner-city children; he just had to be Not Bret Schundler. At the end of their fifth debate, the two candidates made silly comparisons about which had done more to fight crime; Mr. Schundler of urban Jersey City or Mr. McGreevey of suburban Woodbridge. And Mr. Schundler let go one of his snide comments: "You're the mayor of Mayberry and you couldn't keep it safe."
Replied Mr. McGreevey, "I consider Mayberry a compliment." Every week, Andy and Aunt Bea and Opie had more than enough worries just with what was happening on Main Street, and because Mr. McGreevey was riveted on that one basic idea, he beat the idea man last night.

HEADLINE: THE 2001 ELECTIONS: GOVERNOR; 
Democrat Vows to Alter Way 'Business Is Done in Trenton'

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Wednesday, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
James E. McGreevey, the Democratic mayor of Woodbridge, easily won election Tuesday as New Jersey's 51st governor, defeating a fiery conservative Republican, Bret D. Schundler, who never gained the support of his party's moderate establishment.
 With 98 percent of the vote counted, Mr. McGreevey had 56 percent of the vote to Mr. Schundler's 42 percent, a landslide by recent standards: the last two governor's races were decided by margins of one percentage point or less. 
 Mr. McGreevey's victory came as a Democrat, Mark R. Warner, won the governor's post in Virginia, loosening the iron grip that Republicans have had on top offices in that state. Page A19. 
The entire New Jersey Legislature was up for re-election Tuesday as well, and Mr. McGreevey's coattails were lengthy enough for his party to recapture control of at least one house of the Legislature for the first time since 1991.
Democrats won control of the General Assembly, but the results of key races in the State Senate indicated that the upper house could be evenly divided for the first time in modern New Jersey history.
Indeed, Mr. McGreevey, in an exultant victory speech at 10:16 p.m., vowed that his administration would cross party lines to "change the way business is done in Trenton."
"The government that we build will be a government of Republicans, independents and, yes, Democrats -- a government for all the people," he shouted to a mobbed hotel ballroom in East Brunswick. "A government that is accountable to you, and only to you."
Mr. McGreevey, whose pregnant wife, Dina, remained hospitalized for pre-term labor, vowed to "work day and night, with the full fiber of my being, with every measure of my strength," to tackle soaring property taxes, failing public schools, vanishing open space and official corruption and mismanagement.
"Now let's get to work!" he cried.
Mr. McGreevey took the stage even before Mr. Schundler had wrapped up an extraordinary, rambling 23-minute concession speech, in which he acknowledged his defeat almost in passing -- and attributed it mainly to a lack of campaign money -- before issuing a warning that sounded like a demand for a rematch in four years.
"He has said he is committed to not raising taxes," Mr. Schundler said in one of several challenges he laid down before Mr. McGreevey. "We're going to hold him to that."
The finger-pointing in defeat started early this morning. And in a sign of how ugly the battle could soon get for control of the Republican Party, Bill Pascoe, Mr. Schundler's voluble campaign manager, assailed the acting governor, Donald T. DiFrancesco, for having undercut Mr. Schundler repeatedly since withdrawing from the primary last April.
"I think he's cut a deal, a long time ago, to sabotage the Republican gubernatorial campaign," Mr. Pascoe said.
Mr. DiFrancesco could not be reached early this morning to comment.
Mr. McGreevey, 44, nearly unseated Gov. Christie Whitman in 1997, then barely took a breath before resuming what would prove a six-year battle for the job. This time around, he enjoyed the overwhelming support of women, blacks, Democrats, independents, and poor and middle-class voters, according to a survey of voters leaving polling places.
Exit interviews with 1,718 voters found that taxes and the state's economy were foremost on people's minds. Those who said they were concerned about the economy tended to vote for Mr. McGreevey, while those who worried more about taxes tended to favor Mr. Schundler.
But education was the next most important issue cited by voters, who appeared to accept Mr. McGreevey's argument that Mr. Schundler's school choice proposals would threaten public schools: 70 percent of those concerned most about education said they voted for Mr. McGreevey.
If the result of the governor's race proved anticlimactic, it came at the end of what may well have been the most unpredictable political year in New Jersey history.
Mr. McGreevey, who fended off a surprise challenge last summer from another Democrat, United States Senator Robert G. Torricelli, had no rivals within his party when the year began.
But Mr. Schundler entered the Republican primary as a dark horse, a social conservative in a staunchly moderate state, who had never held a state office and who was unloved by the elite in his own party.
But Mr. Schundler's opponents proceeded to self-destruct in dramatic fashion. Mr. DiFrancesco, the president of the State Senate, was the early favorite to clinch the Republican nomination. But his ascension to the office as acting governor, following Mrs. Whitman's departure for Washington, subjected him to a new level of scrutiny. After an avalanche of reports about his past business dealings and allegations of ethical lapses, he withdrew from the race.
The Republican Party's moderate wing was still unwilling to embrace Mr. Schundler; instead, it drafted Bob Franks, a former congressman who had lost a close race for the United States Senate the previous November, and extended the primary by three weeks to give Mr. Franks extra time to raise money.
But Mr. Franks's hastily plotted campaign strategy proved catastrophically wrongheaded: he ran to the left of Mr. Schundler, painting him as an extremist on social issues. Mr. Franks seemed to succeed only in angering the party's right wing, however, and conservatives came out in force to give Mr. Schundler a 14-point margin of victory.
Mr. Schundler, for his part, had run a nearly perfect primary, even his detractors conceded. But in hindsight it appeared he had pushed so hard for conservatives' support that he found it hard to get back to the crucial political middle in the fall.
His flawless touch seemed to have deserted him soon after the June 26 primary, when Mr. Schundler tried to take the issues of abortion and guns off the table in the campaign. He stumbled badly in each case, digging himself a deeper hole. And he learned the hard way -- through devastating public opinion polls -- that supporting tighter firearms restrictions has become a prerequisite for statewide officeseekers.
Mr. McGreevey, meanwhile, quickly developed an effective, three-pronged campaign mantra to depict Mr. Schundler as an extremist. Mr. McGreevey said his opponent opposed abortion even in cases of rape and incest; favored a law making it easier for people to get permits to carry concealed weapons; and would drain the public schools of nearly $600 million. And to the welcome surprise of Mr. McGreevey's campaign aides, Mr. Schundler's heated efforts to rebut these charges -- in news conferences, television advertisements and debates -- often succeeded only in focusing greater public attention on them.
Mr. Schundler's challenges seemed to multiply by the hour. Mr. McGreevey and the Democratic Party built up a huge financial advantage, and Mr. Schundler never succeeded in plugging into the Republican fund-raising machine that had amply underwritten Mrs. Whitman and Mr. DiFrancesco for years.
Worse, while Mr. McGreevey had the entire Democratic Party rallying him on, Mr. Schundler faced a constant campaign of sabotage by Mr. DiFrancesco. The acting governor never hid his disdain for Mr. Schundler, whom he blamed for the news reports that had driven him to quit the race.
So as Mr. Schundler tried to cobble together a platform of popular pocketbook issues that would appeal to suburbanites, such as a vow to remove the tolls from the Garden State Parkway, Mr. DiFrancesco used the power of his office to denigrate Mr. Schundler's proposals as "intellectually dishonest."
Mr. Schundler also continued to hurt himself. His hopes of victory rested on winning over the blue-collar Democrats and independents in the broad middle of the New Jersey electorate. But he antagonized union members when it was reported that he favored laws that would curtail the rights of labor organizers.
Still, Mr. Schundler began the homestretch of the campaign after Labor Day assured that he would have the active support of President Bush and members of his cabinet; after all, an upset victory for a conservative in New Jersey would be viewed as a mighty validation for the new administration. And a surprise court ruling in New Jersey made it possible for Republicans in Washington to spend millions on TV commercials for Mr. Schundler without violating the state's campaign finance law.
Mr. Schundler, hoping to woo Jewish voters, then departed for a short trip to Israel. He was there on Sept. 11, when the hijacked airplanes struck their targets.
The terrorist attacks staggered both candidates. But it locked in, for several weeks, a sizable McGreevey lead in the polls. And it was Mr. McGreevey, cautious as ever, who benefited once politics resumed.
While Mr. McGreevey refrained from campaigning, Mr. Schundler, eager to demonstrate the leadership qualities he believed voters would seek in a time of crisis, sought out reporters to describe his many ideas for ways to improve New Jersey's defenses against terrorism and its readiness for emergencies. But he also spoke critically of some emergency workers who responded on Sept. 11, triggering criticism from members of both parties.
The episode, after which Mr. Schundler increasingly attacked the news media, struck even his own advisers as a turning point.
Mr. McGreevey, meanwhile, bathed in the adulation of every major police, fire and labor union, whose endorsements Mr. Schundler was left to dismiss as the tainted products of special interests.
But while Mr. Schundler was pouring forth with proposals for tax and toll cuts, a complicated overhaul of the public education system, and other ambitious measures, Mr. McGreevey said little that was specific and less that was controversial.
His reticence on the subject of taxes gave Mr. Schundler a huge opening, which he exploited during their televised debates. He pledged not to raise taxes, and lampooned Mr. McGreevey as the second coming of Jim Florio, the one-term governor who raised taxes by $2.8 billion in 1990.
In the final weeks of the campaign, Mr. Schundler finally seemed to have hit upon a resonant message: taxes, taxes, taxes. 
For Mr. Schundler, however, the most poignant effect of the Sept. 11 attacks may have been an indirect one. His friend in the White House, President Bush, saw his favorability ratings rise to historic levels. But Mr. Bush was busy prosecuting a war, securing the nation's defenses and rallying its morale. The promised trip to New Jersey to aid Mr. Schundler's campaign would never come to pass.

HEADLINE: British Chain Reports 20% Profit Surge 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Radical changes at Marks & Spencer, once a stalwart of British retailing, seemed to be paying off today when the company announced a 20 percent surge in six-month profit.
 Bucking a general economic slowdown, which has been worsened by the Sept. 11 attacks in New York and Washington, the company said net income in the six months to the end of September rose to $:144.2 million ($210 million), compared with $:120 million in the comparable period last year. 
 The rise, within analysts' expectations, was the biggest in four years, despite evidence that British shoppers are growing reluctant to spend as economic growth falters. But analysts and the company's management remained cautious that the good news after three years of gloom could all too easily evaporate if shoppers stayed away from Marks & Spencer during the critical Christmas shopping period. 
The improvements so far, said Luc Vandevelde, the chief executive, were "not representative for us to talk about recovery." He added, "We will have to wait until after Christmas."
The possible stirrings of a turnaround are the latest twist in a three-year story during which the company -- once an investor's favorite because of steady growth in profits that hit $:1 billion in 1997 -- has wrestled with setbacks as many younger female shoppers turned away from its lackluster, midprice clothes in favor of zippier offerings from rivals like Next and Matalan.
The chain, once a byword for British Main Street quality, dropped its home-grown management, turned away from relatively pricey British suppliers and, this year, reversed an ambitious overseas expansion program. It sold off stores in France, Spain and other parts of Europe while seeking to pull out of units in the United States, including Kings Supermarkets and the Brooks Brothers retail clothing chain.
Mr. Vandevelde said today that the Sept. 11 attacks had derailed the Brooks Brothers sale. "We were waiting for final confirmation of the bid. Then we had to stop and restart the process again," he said, without going into detail. But the company said that, despite the delay, it would proceed with plans to hand back some $:2 billion ($2.9 billion) at today's prices to shareholders next March. The share price rose today by as much as 7.9 percent, to 325 pence, the highest since January 2000. Hopes of a recovery have pushed the company's stock up by 60 percent this year. It ranks among the top performers on the London stock market.
Apart from revamping, the company has also been casting about for a new, less stodgy image. It hired George Davies, who founded its rival Next, to create a new women's wear range called Per Una, but those clothes began entering stores only two days before the end of the half-year reporting period.
As it struggles for a new identity, Marks & Spencer is also experimenting with food-only stores to wring profit from its high-end packaged foods and sandwiches. It said today that it would open 20 more Simply Food convenience stores.
Analysts questioned, however, whether the growth spurt could be sustained in a year-end quarter of unseasonably warm weather that may have hit October sales and undermined the company's ability to sustain its resurgence. The figures made "pretty confused reading," ABN Amro said in a research note, while the company is heading for a period of higher costs from refurbishing 100 of its 310 British stores.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Judge to Hear From 9 States On Microsoft

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON with STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
A federal district judge said today that she would hold a pair of separate but related proceedings early next year to consider the proposed antitrust settlement between the Bush administration and Microsoft and to hear arguments by a group of states that officially broke ranks with the federal government in search of tougher penalties.
 The order by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of United States District Court in Washington followed the announcement this afternoon that nine states involved in the case, led by New York, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio, had decided to join the Bush administration's settlement after it was slightly revised in negotiations that concluded at about 3:30 this morning. 
 The other states that agreed to the settlement are Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, North Carolina and Wisconsin. These nine supporting states will recoup their legal costs from Microsoft. 
Nine other states and the District of Columbia declined to sign the agreement. Officials from some of the states were still considering whether to join with the Justice Department. But lawyers involved in the case said they expected that a core group would challenge the proposed consent decree for failing to address the concerns of two federal courts that found Microsoft had abused its monopoly position in the software market. The dissenting states say the proposed settlement has too many loopholes and does not do enough to promote competition in the industry. 
The states that refused to sign included many that are home to Microsoft's biggest rivals and others in the technology industry that have complained about Microsoft's aggressive market tactics, including California, Massachusetts and Utah. The others that did not sign were Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota and West Virginia.
The decision by some of the states to dissent complicates, and could ultimately delay, the implementation of the proposed settlement decree. If those states prevail, however, it could lead to more restrictions imposed on Microsoft.
At a brief hearing this afternoon, Judge Kollar-Kotelly denied a request by Microsoft that she stop the dissenting states' proceedings until after she issued her ruling on the proposed consent decree. Microsoft's legal maneuver was an attempt to diminish the legal prospects of the opposing states. Those states have said that central elements of the agreement -- greater disclosure of software code, nondiscrimination against rivals and computer makers, and limits on the ability of Microsoft to leverage its monopoly in the server markets -- have overly broad exceptions that would make the proposed settlement largely ineffective.
Under the scheduling order issued today, Judge Kollar-Kotelly will be receiving a competitive analysis of the proposed settlement and a wide range of comments about the deal from supporters and critics over the next three months. All the evidence in that proceeding is expected to be submitted by the end of February, which is shortly before the judge will begin hearings on the remedies proposed by those states that have dissented. The states not backing the agreement have been ordered to file their list of proposed remedies next month.
Both the Justice Department and Microsoft applauded the states that decided to join in the agreement.
"The fact that so many states have joined the federal government in supporting this agreement is a very significant positive step toward resolving these issues once and for all," said Bill Gates, the co-founder and chairman of Microsoft. "While this decree will place significant restrictions on our business, we believe this is a fair and reasonable settlement that will be good for consumers, good for the high-tech industry and good for the economy."
Charles A. James, the assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division, said that "the Justice Department and the states that have settled have done the heavy lifting here."
"Our settlement is now the base line," Mr. James said. "Consumers in Massachusetts and California will get the benefit of this settlement. If they can get more, that's for them to determine. At the end of the day, the resolution set before the court today will be the resolution of the Microsoft antitrust litigation."
Mr. James dismissed criticism by some of Microsoft's competitors that the consent decree was the product of a back-room deal involving heavy political pressure from Microsoft and other administration officials outside of the Justice Department.
"There was no political influence whatsoever involved in this process," he said in an interview this afternoon. "This was an antitrust decision. We did a lot of good things. Even the states which have not signed on have not said we did anything improper. There is no intrigue here." 
Other officials said the consent decree was the product of a more narrow reading by the Bush administration than by Microsoft's critics as the parties considered last June's decision by the United States Court of Appeals here. That opinion, which overturned a lower court's order to break up Microsoft, found a variety of antitrust violations and ordered the case returned to the district court to consider appropriate remedy.
The eight late-night changes to the proposed consent decree would broaden the disclosures Microsoft must make to rivals about the operation of its powerful software for data-serving machines. By adding the phrase "or the Internet" to one section, lawyers for the states explicitly required Microsoft to reveal technical details about servers other than those used only for office networks. Experts said that change could expand the settlement to cover Microsoft's future business strategies of providing Internet services.
Much of the criticism of the Justice Department settlement and the efforts of some states to tighten the language has been prompted by skepticism that Microsoft will voluntarily live up to its terms. Indeed, the current antitrust suit against Microsoft grew out of allegations that the company had violated a consent decree it signed with the Justice Department in 1994.
For that reason, some experts believe that the sanctions against Microsoft, regardless of their precise final form, will prove highly regulatory, insuring that the three-person technical committee overseeing compliance will be busy. 
"Does anybody really trust Microsoft to comply?" said David Farber, a computer science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, who testified in the trial as an expert witness on the government's behalf. "There are going to endless marches to that three-person technical committee."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED -- AN OVERVIEW: NOV. 6, 2001; 
More Troops, More Accusations, More Economic Stimulus

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
 Naturally, the Bush administration has wanted international support for its war on terrorism, but only up to a point. British troops aside, the idea of foreign armies joining the actual fighting in Afghanistan has hardly thrilled the Pentagon, where the feeling is that more players mean more back-seat drivers. So Washington has for the most part ignored offers of help. Until now.

BUILDING THE MILITARY STAKES -- With European countries practically banging on the door, the United States took steps, however reluctantly, to expand the coalition's armed might. In Europe, public support for the war has weakened, and government leaders there sense that with a piece of the military action, their peoples will have a greater stake in seeing this campaign through to the end. France, Italy and Germany all want to send troops -- a significant development in particular for the Germans, who have not deployed soldiers beyond Europe since World War II.
 One possible leading role that NATO seeks for itself is delivering food to Afghanistan as winter nears. That task could prove vital. Despite American air drops of food packages, as many as six million Afghans are said to be on the brink of starvation, after two decades of war and four years of drought. The United Nations World Food Program is already trying to help. Its trucks are carrying about 250 million pounds of wheat across the Khyber Pass between Pakistan and Afghanistan. But they must travel some of the worst highways in the world, with drivers keeping one eye out for American bombs and the other for holes the size of refrigerators.
To encourage continued political support, President Bush spoke by satellite television to an antiterrorism conference of former Soviet bloc countries in Europe. In a sense, he was preaching to the choir when he compared Al Qaeda terrorists to the "fascists and totalitarians" of the mid-20th century. They had "the same mad, global ambitions," he said. 
For the first time, the president himself accused Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, of seeking to acquire chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. But other officials said there was no new evidence that Mr. bin Laden had in fact gotten his hands on weapons of mass destruction.

MAKING THE MILITARY MOVES -- On the ground in Afghanistan, the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance gave signs of finally going on the attack. Its commanders said their forces had captured three districts not far from Mazar-i-Sharif, a Taliban-held city at an important crossroad. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said he could not verify the claims. But if they prove true, it would be the biggest breakthrough to date for the Americans' proxy ground forces. They did it, alliance leaders said, with help from some 15 American advisers who organized troops and helped plan the attacks.
Back home, there was more than the usual assortment of good news and bad news.
The Postal Service said the anthrax scare had reduced the volume of mail by about 10 percent, for a revenue loss of at least $500 million. A bit of offsetting good news was that no new anthrax cases have been reported since Friday. And the Federal Bureau of Investigation in effect said "never mind" about that threat to bridges on the West Coast. It is "not deemed credible" any more, the bureau said.
That was fine. But then the F.B.I.'s senior official for counterterrorism told a Senate hearing that investigators remained clueless about the source of the anthrax that has killed 4 Americans and sickened 14 others. Not only that, the agency could not even say how many laboratories in this country handle the anthrax bacteria. Senators, as might be imagined, were not amused.

MASSAGING THE ECONOMY -- The economy, weakening rapidly since Sept. 11, got a boost when the Federal Reserve cut its most important short-term interest rate for the 10th time this year -- to 2 percent, a level not seen in 40 years. Some analysts saw that as auguring an economic turnaround, perhaps by the middle of 2002.
Among the places hit hard financially was New York City, where voters chose a new mayor to lead their recovery. The race was close: the Democrat Mark Green, the city's public advocate, vs. the Republican Michael R. Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire. The winner has a tough act to follow. Rudolph W. Giuliani's stewardship since Sept. 11 has given him virtually a walk-on-water reputation in New York and around the country.

HEADLINE: Seeking City Money, Lincoln Center Submits Its Renovation Plans 

BYLINE:  By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
After months of argument, Lincoln Center's powerful performing arts organizations agreed this week to send City Hall a redevelopment plan of nearly $1.2 billion, which does not include a proposed separate on-campus home for the New York City Opera but sets aside $240 million for a new opera house elsewhere if a site can be found.
 The plan also omits a hotly disputed glass-enclosed galleria connecting public spaces that the architect Frank Gehry had been commissioned to develop. 
 The consensus, reached at a meeting on Monday afternoon, was an effort to set aside lingering differences and secure a $24 million payment that had been pledged by the city, participants said. They said that even as the parties shook hands on the submission to the city, elements of the package were still in dispute and could change in the coming months and years. 
Any member organization can still veto the plan.
The payment would be the first installment of a 10-year commitment of $240 million made by the departing administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani before the events of Sept. 11 toward a sweeping redevelopment program originally estimated at $1.5 billion. The mayor's office said that Mr. Giuliani still believed that the Lincoln Center project and other plans central to the city's status as a cultural capital "should be encouraged." 
The bulk of the money -- the biggest single item is the reconstruction of Avery Fisher Hall -- would have to be raised privately.
Marshall Rose, the departing chairman of the redevelopment project, said that the 11 members of a Lincoln Center constituent committee, made up of organizations like the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera, the New York City Ballet and the City Opera, "unanimously agreed" to submit the preliminary plan to the city by the end of the week. He declined to discuss its contents until it was presented to the mayor. 
Participants cautioned, however, that elements of the final plan were far from settled in this fiercely divisive year, which included the recent resignation of Mr. Rose as redevelopment chairman. Monday was his last meeting. 
According to a confidential executive summary distributed to members and obtained by The New York Times, the plan lays out spending for a host of projects from the extensive redesign of Avery Fisher Hall, to new auditoriums for film, expanded catering facilities and a greening of Damrosch Park on the campus's southwest corner. 
Some of the expenditures may still fall out in the face of economics if they are determined to be more wish-list than vital. 
According to the summary, the preliminary master plan rules out a new home for the City Opera in Damrosch Park or elsewhere on the Lincoln Center campus but allocates $240 million for a 2,200-seat opera house if a site can be found someplace else. If the City Opera stays put, the plan calls for spending up to $87 million at the New York State Theater, which is shared with the New York City Ballet, to improve its operatic acoustics.
The plan also kills the proposed $100 million Gehry glass galleria. But it budgets about $150 million for the enhancement of other public spaces, including landscaping of Damrosch Park and a new centerpiece fountain in the plaza.
The proposals to build a new City Opera house in Damrosch Park, and the galleria, which would have connected various public spaces and would have vaulted over the Metropolitan Opera House, had been adamantly opposed by the Met and its general manager, Joseph Volpe, who was backed by Beverly Sills, Lincoln Center's chairwoman.
Although parts of Lincoln Center have been renovated and patched up many times over 40 years, officials saw the need in 1999 for a far more sweeping effort to modernize old halls with the latest technology and correct spatial compromises in the original design.
The plans for changes in the five and a half acres of outdoor space are what proved the most contentious. But most of the spending involves individual projects of the member groups within their existing buildings and is therefore of limited concern to their Lincoln Center neighbors.
The New York Philharmonic, for example, is down for the most expensive item, a $326 million total rebuilding of Avery Fisher Hall, whose acoustics have proved troublesome from Day 1. 
The new hall would have 2,400 seats, 338 fewer than now, to improve the sound, and there would be high-tech enclosed viewing booths, more backstage space and donor and food-service amenities. 
Another major allocation is $179 million for an expansion of the lobby and backstage areas at the Metropolitan Opera House. But Mr. Volpe has said in the past that the Met has not made a decision on proceeding with a project of that size and the fund-raising it would entail. 
The plan also sets aside $10.5 million for an expansion of the Film Society of Lincoln Center's quarters in the Samuel B. and David Rose Building on 65th Street, which includes the Walter Reade Theater. The society would get a new 150-seat theater to continue runs of films that prove unexpectedly popular -- a so-called "rollover house" -- and a screening room with up to 100 seats, along with a new marquee on the street.
The Rose building, completed in 1992 for $180 million, is itself down for $15 million in improvements, including new lighting and utilities in the Kaplan Penthouse, where Lincoln Center often entertains guests.
The plan also allocates $69 million to Alice Tully Hall for lobby expansion and refurbishment; $58 million to the Vivian Beaumont and Mitzi E. Newhouse theaters for redesign of entrances and lobbies; and $26 million to the Juilliard School for stage, classroom and office enhancements.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE CALIFORNIA ALERT; 
F.B.I. Lifts the Warning About West Coast Bridges

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
The Federal Bureau of Investigation today lifted a warning issued last week that terrorists might be planning to destroy bridges on the West Coast and said its investigation showed that the threat was "not credible."
 The announcement should ease some of the tension felt up and down the West Coast after Gov. Gray Davis of California made the warning public over the wishes of federal officials. 
 F.B.I. and Justice Department officials said a separate, nationwide alert of possibly imminent terrorist attacks remained in place, at least for a few more days. They said the broad warning, issued on Oct. 29, was prompted by intercepts of telephone conversations in which members of Osama bin Laden's terrorist network spoke urgently of an upcoming attack against American targets. 
The officials said the nationwide alert was still in effect even though the original time frame -- Oct. 29 through this Monday -- had expired, and even though there was no substantial new evidence this week of plans for a terrorist strike.
In a brief statement, the F.B.I. said today that it had issued the warning about West Coast bridges based on "uncorroborated information indicating the possibility of additional terrorist attacks targeting suspension bridges" from Nov. 2 to Nov. 7. But a subsequent investigation "has determined that the threat to suspension bridges is not deemed credible."
Law enforcement officials said the original tip about the bridges had come into the Customs Service from a source who had sometimes proved credible in the past.
On the basis of the tip, they said, the F.B.I. issued an advisory to law enforcement officials in six Western states last Wednesday night. "Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast," the advisory said.
But officials said a feverish investigation over the last week had determined that the source was mistaken, and that there was no special threat to West Coast bridges.
Federal and state law enforcement officials have criticized the decision by Governor Davis to make the warning public at a news conference on Thursday in which he described the threat as "credible." 
F.B.I. and Justice Department officials have said that they never intended the warning to be made public because it was unsubstantiated -- far less credible, they said, than the information that led to the nationwide warning on Oct. 29 -- but that they provided it to state officials to enable them to beef up security around bridges. The governors of the two other Pacific Coast states, Gary Locke of Washington and John Kitzhaber of Oregon, also received the F.B.I. warning. But they did not make it public.
Governor Davis's announcement startled Californians, dominated local newspaper and television coverage and led some commuters to find alternate ways of getting to work. Traffic on the state's two most famous bridges -- the Golden Gate and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge -- fell by about 3 percent during some rush-hour periods last week. Some commuters left their cars behind and took ferries across the bay.
Governor Davis defended his announcement again Monday night, saying: "My No. 1 job is to keep Californians safe. I'm going to err on the side of caution." 
But within minutes of the F.B.I.'s announcement withdrawing the threat, California lawmakers were accusing the governor of seizing the national spotlight at the expense of frightening the public and scaring tourists away from a state that has been seriously affected economically since Sept. 11.
"If you have credible evidence that there is going to be an attack, you have a duty to disclose it," said Dave Cox, head of the Republican caucus in the State Assembly. "But if it couldn't be corroborated, then in fact it's a publicity stunt that is disingenuous with the public."
Worried that the public will become desensitized to future threats, California Republicans called for a new system for handling warnings about potential attacks, so that residents will not assume their elected officials are simply "crying wolf," as Bill Jones, the California secretary of state, put it.
"We need to leave this to the professionals: the F.B.I., the attorney general," said Mr. Jones, who announced his intention to run against Governor Davis last March. "This whole experienced has not increased the public's confidence."
Despite the lifting of the threat, officials said that security on California bridges will remain at its current high level. National Guard troops, Coast Guard helicopters and extra California Highway Patrol officers are on duty.
"We will remain in our present state for the time being," said Mary Currie, a spokeswoman for the Golden Gate Bridge authority. The authority also plans to keep its current schedule of running two extra cross-bay ferries through Wednesday evening.
The most visible, and to many commuters, unsettling, reminder of security on the bridges, National Guard troops carrying M-16 rifles, wearing camouflage uniforms, and riding in Humvees, will remain for now, said Lt. Col. Terry Knight, a spokesman. 
"We're in place until further notice," Colonel Knight said. "We've been talking about bridges and infrastructures and roads and waterways since Sept. 11. So we'll keep the Guard in place for a little while longer."
The furor in California over the warning was more evidence of the challenges faced by the Bush administration in deciding how much intelligence information to release about potential terrorist threats after the Sept. 11 hijackings.
The administration has been criticized for its two nationwide public warnings -- on Oct. 11 and Oct. 29 -- of possibly imminent terrorist strikes.
In issuing the warning last week, Attorney General John Ashcroft said the threat of another large terrorist attack was "credible," but he acknowledged that the intelligence leading to the warning "does not contain specific information as to the type of attack or specific targets."
Many state and local law enforcement officials said such unspecific warnings served little purpose, since they had remained on high alert since Sept. 11, and tended to create panic in communities that were already under intense strain.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: ECONOMIC LEGISLATION; 
Amid Stimulus Wrangling, a Call for the President to Step In

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Congressional Republicans stepped up attacks on Senate Democrats over economic stimulus legislation today, while Democrats argued that it was time for President Bush to get directly involved to avoid a partisan breakdown.
 Democrats said they would push their $67 billion bill, which emphasizes temporary unemployment and health insurance benefits and short-term tax breaks, through the Finance Committee on Thursday. But as Senator John B. Breaux, a moderate Democrat from Louisiana, observed, neither party has the votes to pass a bill. 
 Republicans argued that Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and the chairman of the Finance Committee, should meet with Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, to work out a compromise with the $89 billion plan Mr. Grassley has put forward. Mr. Grassley, whose plan would speed up tax cuts passed earlier this year, told reporters that he and Mr. Baucus had worked well together on Mr. Bush's tax-cut proposal last spring. 
"If the kids in the Senate get out of the way and leave it to us professionals that know how to do this, we'll get the job done," Mr. Grassley said. 
Mr. Baucus said the Republicans were just trying to force Democrats to compromise twice, once in the Senate and then again with House Republicans, who passed a $110 billion bill nearly two weeks ago that was even more heavily tilted toward tax cuts for corporations and higher-income people than the Grassley bill.
"This is the time for the president to exercise presidential leadership and step in," Mr. Baucus said. Without such help, he said, "it's going to be partisan and unproductive."
The White House has said it would not get involved until after a Senate bill was passed and the measure went to a House-Senate conference.
The skirmishing began early in the day, when Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas and the House majority leader, said that Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota and the Senate majority leader, did not act as though the economy was a "front-burner issue."
Then, after it appeared that the Democrats had the votes in the Finance Committee to bring a bill to the floor, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the minority leader, accused them of "pursuing a totally partisan bill." Mr. Lott threatened to delay the bill with amendments and, if necessary, a filibuster.
In addition to its tax cuts and insurance provisions, the Senate Democratic economic plan also includes $20 billion in spending for additional measures to promote homeland defense, including bioterrorism and food safety defenses, and improved security at airports and federal establishments. But at a meeting today with Congressional leaders, President Bush said he was adamantly opposed to any spending for domestic security beyond the $40 billion in emergency appropriations approved by Congress in September.
Even Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee, including the chairman, Representative C. W. Bill Young of Florida, have sought additional spending. But the president would not discuss such proposals today, said Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the committee.
Mr. Daschle contended that Democrats had been the ones who reached out to discuss compromise, and he joined Mr. Baucus in appealing for administration involvement.
If that does not happen and Republicans filibuster, he said, Democrats will not back down.
"Our desire is to stay on this legislation until we succeed," Mr. Daschle said. "If it takes additional days or weeks of effort, we're going to do that."
Asked if he might extend the Senate schedule, which usually requires senators to be in town only from Tuesday through Thursday, to five days a week, Mr. Daschle replied, "We might even work six days a week."

HEADLINE: While Congress Argues, the Fed Acts 

 BODY:
Yesterday the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the 10th time this year in its campaign to revive the sluggish economy. The federal funds rate now stands at 2 percent, a 40-year low. The Fed offered no sign that it had reached the end of the rate cuts, yet there are powerful arguments against too many further reductions. Congress can save Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, some much-needed maneuvering room by taking over the job of supplying economic stimulus as soon as possible. 
 In the absence of a stimulus package, the markets have counted on Mr. Greenspan's rate cuts for succor. But the Fed cannot act solely as an economic engine. It must also guard against deflation today and high inflation in the future. Some prices are falling, which is normal in a recession. A wider decline in prices could stall a recovery by forcing more employers to shrink paychecks. The Fed has to leave some room between the federal funds rate and zero, in case a sudden flood of liquidity is needed to combat deflation. 
 There is also the danger of inflation. Though that looks remote now, inflation could be hard to restrain next year if the Fed goes too far. In several previous recessions, the Fed's last interest-rate cut was greeted by a jump in prices. The effects of rate cuts take six months or longer to percolate through the economy. At some point the Fed should sit back and wait to assess the effect of its moves.
Congress could take some of the pressure off Mr. Greenspan by drafting a reasonable stimulus package. Even in these extraordinary economic times, politics-as-usual has gotten in the way. Republicans fought hard to squeeze their plan, loaded with corporate bonuses that will do little to stimulate growth, through the House. Senate Democrats want extra spending, which the House is resisting.
The two parties' leaders met yesterday but failed to resolve their differences. For the moment, they should focus on the ideas they share: rebate checks for low-income tax filers, extended unemployment benefits and tax breaks linked directly to business investment. That would help to build consumers' confidence in the economy, and in their elected representatives.

HEADLINE: Mayor-Elect Michael Bloomberg 

 BODY:
In electing Michael Bloomberg mayor yesterday, New Yorkers were clearly hoping the man whom Rudolph Giuliani endorsed would turn out to be the kind of leader Mr. Giuliani has been during the weeks since Sept. 11. The choice of Mr. Bloomberg, a political novice, over Public Advocate Mark Green is in many ways a gamble, a leap into the unknown. But every resident of New York and every American who cares about the city will root for him to succeed. 
 The terror attack and its aftermath have overshadowed and befogged the campaign, and it seemed appropriate that when most New Yorkers went to bed last night, it was still impossible to predict who would be the victor. Mr. Green, who led the polls by double digits only a few weeks ago, suffered from the defection of many Latino voters who were angry at the defeat of Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer in the Democratic runoff. He was also overwhelmed by money. Mr. Bloomberg invested what is believed to be over $50 million into a campaign in which voters came to know him almost exclusively through his carefully tailored TV ads. 
 It was Mr. Bloomberg's identification with Mayor Giuliani that was his most powerful weapon. New Yorkers are still traumatized by loss. They know that soaring unemployment and gaping budget holes are inevitable. They know that further danger from terrorists is possible. They need a mayor who can restore the ambitious optimism that is the core of the city's character, and over the past two weeks more and more voters began taking Mr. Giuliani's word that Michael Bloomberg was the man who could do that.
He faces an unenviable challenge. He will now have to manage a greatly reduced budget, woo business interests to invest in Manhattan and take care of the needs of the victims of a staggering economy -- all at the same time. Mr. Bloomberg has said that one of his first actions will be to contact the city's union leaders, whose help he will desperately need. Those leaders had good reason to expect, only a few months ago, that their members would soon receive large and much-deserved raises. Mr. Bloomberg, whose own employees are not unionized, has had little experience in large labor negotiations. But his first impulse, to reach out and begin talking, was a wise one.
He must begin work immediately on preparing the budget that will be due within a few weeks of his inauguration, wrestling with shrinking revenues and expanding need for services. He must also become intensely involved in the rebuilding of Manhattan's downtown financial center. 
Finally, Mr. Bloomberg will have to contend with the big shadow thrown by Mr. Giuliani, who now occupies near-legendary status. Mr. Giuliani is moving on, but he is not likely to go away. The next mayor will never be able to match the strong, paternal image that Mr. Giuliani presented, and he should not try. He will have to rise to this moment differently, using his own voice in his own way to rally the city, manage it and keep it safe and financially sound.

HEADLINE: In a Turnaround, Virginia Elects a Democratic Governor 

BYLINE:  By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Va., Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Mark R. Warner, a Democrat who campaigned like a Republican, easily won the Virginia governor's race today, loosening the grip that Republicans have had on most top offices in the state for almost a decade.
 Mr. Warner, a multimillionaire venture capitalist who outspent and outmaneuvered his Republican opponent, former Attorney General Mark L. Earley, led by 52 percent to 47 percent with 99 percent of precincts reporting. 
 The victory gave Democrats some bragging rights. But the Republicans held on to the office of attorney general, and in legislative elections they increased their numbers in the House of Delegates to almost two-thirds of seats, from slightly more than one-half. So it was unclear whether the Warner victory meant the Republican wave that has been sweeping across Virginia in recent years had been stopped, just as it was unclear whether there were any national implications in the victory. 
In his victory speech, Mr. Warner said that Virginians "want a new government and I'm here to accept the challenge."
But aware of the results from the state House of Delegates races, Mr. Warner said he was looking forward to "working cooperatively with the General Assembly."
Mr. Earley, in congratulating his opponent, called on Virginians to "move forward as one people." He said he was proud of his effort to extend a Republican record in Virginia "that history will recognize as a golden era."
Virginia law limits governors to a single term, so the incumbent, James S. Gilmore III, who also serves as national Republican chairman, could not seek re-election. Mr. Gilmore had urged Republicans nationwide to contribute to Mr. Earley's campaign, and they responded by providing $3 million of the $10 million his campaign spent.
To the very last day of campaigning, Mr. Earley held out hope that President Bush, a hugely popular figure in Virginia, would drop down into the state for a final whirlwind day of campaigning with him. It never happened. Mr. Bush sent word that in the midst of a national crisis over terrorism, there was no time or place for partisan presidential campaigning.
Mr. Warner, 46, who ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate five years ago, has been a moderate-to-liberal Democrat for most of his political life. But this year , he ran as a "Virginia conservative," hardly ever mentioning that he was a Democrat. He spent about $20 million, including $5 million of his own money.
Mr. Earley, a 47-year-old conservative with close ties to the Christian right, tried to paint Mr. Warner as just another tax-and-spend Democratic liberal. And for a while he appeared to be making headway, especially after Mr. Warner said he saw no reason not to raise taxes to pay for better roads as long as the increases were approved by citizen referendums. But in the end Mr. Early could never fully close the gap of 10 points or so that Mr. Warner opened up in the earliest days of the campaign.
Voters were already somewhat sour on Republicans at the start of the campaign, mainly because Governor Gilmore and the leaders of the Republican-controlled General Assembly were caught up in a bitter intra-party fight over how to draw up and finance the state budget.
Mr. Warner was able to exploit that division and dissatisfaction by promising that such feuding would never occur on his watch and by promising that a Warner administration would be as reliably conservative, especially in a time of economic hardship, as any ever seen in the state.
To burnish his conservative credentials, he made dozens of trips to heavily Republican areas, began showing up at stock car races and country music shows and courting the National Rifle Association and talking up gun rights.
A number of the state's normally Republican business leaders very publicly endorsed Mr. Warner, as did a former Republican governor, Linwood Holton. Most embarrassing of all for Mr. Earley, the dissidents formed a group called Virginians for Warner.
The last Democrat elected governor of Virginia was L. Douglas Wilder, in 1989. Since he left office in early 1994, not only have Republicans held the office but they also won control of the state legislature.

HEADLINE: THE 2001 ELECTIONS: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
An Election In a Shadow

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
It was a mayoral election unlike any other, following a mayoralty unlike any other. Rising above the campaign's many extraordinary developments, from the race-tinted schism within the Democratic Party to the voters' acceptance of an expensive candidacy by a wealthy political neophyte, was the specter of the man who went before.
 He is a daunting figure, so celebrated he is known everywhere by his first name alone: Rudy. Rudolph W. Giuliani practically willed a drop in crime, gloried in a surging economy, alienated minorities, struggled through public moments of personal drama -- and seared himself into the collective memory of a metropolis. 
 But just when the city seemed ready to trust itself without him, the terrorist attack of Sept. 11 blew a deadly hole through Lower Manhattan. And Mr. Giuliani's reassuring calm in great crisis transformed him into a civic saint, his strengths magnified, his weaknesses forgotten. 
These dynamics set the stage for yesterday's critical event in city history, leaving these central questions:
Will the new mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, wither in the considerable shadow cast by Mr. Giuliani? Or will he figure out a way to lead, to manage, to be judged on his own terms?
The question of leadership ended up looming over all other issues in the campaign, making otherwise well-qualified candidates appear diminished. "The election changed on Sept. 11, and suddenly the No. 1 issue became leadership," said Ross Sandler, the director of the Center for New York City Law at New York Law School. "We suddenly saw how critical a single leader was in a time of crisis."
The times of crisis that lie ahead will certainly provide a thorough test of Mr. Bloomberg's ability to lead. The problems that faced the city before the attack on the World Trade Center are now intermingled with the breathtaking challenges created by the terrorist attack that destroyed the World Trade Center: the problem-plagued school system; the anthrax scare; the lack of affordable housing; the delicate cleanup and rebuilding of the city's devastated financial center.
Mr. Bloomberg may well find himself dealing in the morning with the complications of a deficit in the city's $40 billion budget, and in the afternoon with the needs of a constituency still traumatized by the terrorist attack. All the while, there will be the ghost of Mr. Giuliani by his side, available for constant comparison.
Indeed, it was Mr. Giuliani's endorsement less than two weeks ago that gave Mr. Bloomberg, the Republican candidate, a well-timed boost over his Democratic opponent, Mark Green, who during the campaign had the gall to suggest that he would have handled things even better than the man called Rudy. It was as though Mr. Bloomberg had been named star pupil, and Mr. Green commanded to wash his mouth out with soap.
But some see the potential for Mr. Giuliani's successor to overcome that ghost, to out-Rudy Rudy. Elliott Sclar, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University, said that coalition building among the city's ethnic groups and grass-roots organizations -- never one of Mr. Giuliani's strengths -- was essential in addressing a budget deficit that could reach $5 billion by 2003.
"With a shrinking pie," he said, "everyone is going to have to sign onto the fairness of what happens."
Mr. Sclar also said that the next mayor should also see himself as the leader of a much larger region. Mr. Giuliani reveled in contentious quarrels with the elected leaders of New Jersey and New York State, he said. "But the mayor of New York can catalyze the concerns of regional development," he said.
It is a vital concern, Mr. Sclar said, given that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey owns the World Trade Center site, whose redevelopment is one of the new mayor's foremost concerns. "Remember that old song?" he asked. " 'How Do You Get Them Back to Lower Manhattan Once They've Seen Hoboken?' "
These challenges will unfold against backdrops that may seem familiar -- from City Hall to Gracie Mansion -- but that in truth have been transformed by term limits and the travails of the recent mayoral campaign. When he assumes office on Jan. 1, Mr. Bloomberg will quickly be reminded why his new job is often called the second-most difficult in the world. Beyond the immediate deadlines prescribed by the City Charter -- offices to fill, budget reports to make -- he will find that he is not the only freshman at the learning institution of City Hall. 
Thanks to term limits, two-thirds of the City Council membership will be new, all wondering whom to back for the powerful position of speaker. The veteran at that job, Peter F. Vallone, will be gone, and with him the ability to deliver Council majorities on votes dear to the mayor's heart.
"Will it mean more freelancers?" asked Jerry Skurnik, a political consultant. "Will it mean more of a role for Democratic county leaders? Those are the interesting questions."
But there seems no end to the interesting questions raised by this campaign. For example, what does yesterday's election say about that city monolith, the Democratic Party?
With the notable exceptions of Fiorello H. LaGuardia, John V. Lindsay and Mr. Giuliani, the surest way to become mayor of New York was to win the Democratic nomination. But by the end of yesterday's contest, it appeared that another New York political truism had been proven false. 
The city remains 5-to-1 Democratic by registration, and its voters seem as likely as ever to vote Democratic when choosing whom to send to the White House or to Congress. But when the election centers on the control of City Hall, the city's Democrats are clearly finding it easier to vote for Republicans than their parents did -- assuming, of course, that their parents lived and voted in this demographic kaleidoscope of a city.
"This is the third straight election where partisanship hasn't meant very much," said David Axelrod, the Democratic consultant who worked for Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Democrat who lost the nomination to Mr. Green. "One thing is clear: whatever the outcome is, a large number of Democrats are going to vote on another line."
Mr. Axelrod's prediction certainly proved to be prescient late last night. In a predominantly Democratic city, a Republican candidate with no prior public service had blown the city's Democratic establishment away. Mr. Bloomberg's victory means at least three successive terms of a Republican City Hall.
Political analysts say that Mr. Green played it safe and smug for a dangerously long time. But they also say that the Democratic Party -- the party of Tammany, of unions, of minorities -- buckled under interfamilial squabbles that were colored by, of all things, race. 
The efforts by some Green supporters to torpedo Mr. Ferrer's hopes of becoming the city's first Puerto Rican mayor by linking him to the Rev. Al Sharpton marked the final moments of the Democratic primary in late September. Resentment over the gambit, which Mr. Green adamantly disavowed, clearly still lingers.
Also eating into Mr. Green's once-substantial lead were the truckloads of money that Mr. Bloomberg dumped into in his own campaign -- well in excess of $50 million, according to some estimates. 
Beyond the resonance of Mr. Bloomberg's television commercials, his victory indicates a city where voters no longer dismiss a candidacy based at least in part on a candidate's wealth, as many of them did in the losing mayoral and gubernatorial campaigns of Ronald S. Lauder and Lewis E. Lehrman. In doing so, the voters of New York join a national trend, seen in New Jersey and California, among other states, of becoming inured to the unlimited use of personal fortunes to finance political campaigns.
In different times and circumstances, the next billionaire novice may not fare so well, and the Democratic Party may heal its wounds. But at this moment in the city's history, it seems that party affiliations matter less, and leadership abilities matter more. Mr. Bloomberg will be charged with the responsibility of nursing a wounded city back to health, and for that honor, has said he will decline the $195,000-a-year salary.

HEADLINE: THE 2001 ELECTIONS: MAYOR; 
BLOOMBERG EDGES GREEN IN RACE FOR MAYOR; McGREEVEY IS AN EASY WINNER IN NEW JERSEY

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Michael Rubens Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire who set out at the age of 59 to finance a new career in politics, was elected the 108th mayor of New York City yesterday, as voters turned to him to lead a city apprehensive about the loss of a popular mayor and anxious about a future clouded by threats of terrorism and economic turmoil.
 Mr. Bloomberg achieved the unlikely goal of being elected mayor of New York in his first outing in politics. It came after he spent what is likely to be far more than $50 million of his own money to defeat Mark Green, the public advocate and Democratic candidate. Along the way, Mr. Bloomberg set a modern-day record for campaign spending in New York City, in a way that raised questions about the effectiveness of the city's strict campaign finance law. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's victory marked the first time in the history of New York that two Republicans have been elected consecutively to City Hall. It means that in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans by five to one, the Republican Party is now poised to control City Hall for at least three terms in a row. 
And it left the city's once-dominant Democratic Party divided and dispirited, and facing the reality that winning the Democratic Party line is no longer the equivalent of winning citywide office. Even before the numbers were counted, Democrats were squabbling about who was to blame for Mr. Green's losing a contest that had once seemed in hand.
Mr. Green conceded in a speech to supporters at 12:25 this morning, congratulating his opponent but also leaving little doubt about why he thought he was not delivering a victory speech.
"When a campaign adviser last month told me that no candidate in America had ever won an election being outspent by $45 million, I thought we'd beat the odds," he told the subdued crowd. "We did good. Michael Bloomberg did a lot better, and I congratulate him and we all should."
Mr. Green quieted the boos that rose from the crowd and said: "I ask this city to support him as he begins the hard work and hard choices ahead. And let's face it: No American city has suffered a murderous attack and a municipal crisis as we have suffered." 
Mr. Bloomberg, with Mr. Giuliani at his back and deep circles under his eyes reflecting the all-nighter of campaigning he had pulled before Election Day, declared victory at 12:56 a.m. today.
"New York is alive and well and open for business!" he said. "We are clearly going to have enormous problems, but I know we are up to the task. We can do it.
"Tonight is not about Republicans and Democrats, it's about New Yorkers," Mr. Bloomberg continued. At that, Mr. Giuliani, who was picking confetti off Mr. Bloomberg's shoulder, raised a chant of "U.S.A." that was picked up by the crowd.
The mayor-elect concluded by saying: "The easy part is done. Now comes the hard part."
With 97 percent of the election districts reporting unofficial returns, Mr. Bloomberg had about 30,000 more machine votes than Mr. Green, according to a City Board of Elections official, Douglas A. Kellner, a Manhattan Democrat. Absentee and paper ballots had not been counted. 
The election marked the end of a contest held in a city still reeling from the attack on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, and jumpy over continued episodes of anthrax infections and fear of another terrorist assault. This atmosphere at first imposed a somber air on the politicking, but by the end, the race became as much of a street fight as any contest New York had seen in a generation.
The tense, tight and expensive race went down to the very last minute. Advertisements for Mr. Bloomberg, featuring a testimonial from Mr. Giuliani, were still on the airwaves as voters returned home from work last night. And former President Bill Clinton, at the behest of Mr. Green, conducted telephone interviews with black radio stations throughout the afternoon, encouraging listeners to vote for Mr. Green.
Mr. Green, who is not exactly new to this -- this was his 11th election night as a candidate since he first ran for Congress 21 years ago and far from the first time he has lost -- asserted that he was not fazed by the razor-tight denouement. 
"I cut off my nerve endings as a young man," he said earlier last evening. "Otherwise, you can't do this line of work. Since I can't affect it any more, since I've done everything humanly possible to explain my record and vision to the jury of voters, I'm satisfied with whatever the verdict is."
The campaign ended with a burst of spending by Mr. Bloomberg and a flood of harsh attacks by Mr. Green that some Republicans suggested last night had backfired.
In the final days of the campaign, Mr. Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg L.P., was ubiquitous: on television and radio, in mailboxes, on Web sites. Mr. Bloomberg even mailed videotapes, in which he appealed for votes, to households across New York.
Mr. Bloomberg chose not to participate in the system, in which candidates are provided public matching funds in exchange for agreeing to limits on donations. Mr. Green, however, did participate, a decision that several Democrats said yesterday proved to be a mistake as Mr. Bloomberg overwhelmed Mr. Green in spending.
And in a survey of voters leaving the polls yesterday, New Yorkers said they did not object to the notion that Mr. Bloomberg was using his personal fortune to win the election: more than half said they were not concerned by it, notwithstanding Mr. Green's efforts to make it an issue.
Mr. Green, after initially ignoring most of Mr. Bloomberg's criticisms, responded in the final weekend with a series of attacks and advertisements that were unusually harsh, even by New York City standards, including one in which he reprised the details of a sexual harassment suit filed against Mr. Bloomberg by a female employee of his company.
Mr. Bloomberg settled the suit out of court, and denied the charges. He denounced Mr. Green for the attacks in the final days, but there were indications that they had taken a toll. Voters who said they had made up their mind in the final three days of the campaign supported Mr. Green; voters who said they had made up their mind in the last week said they had backed Mr. Bloomberg.
By contrast, there were signs last night that strife among black and Hispanic Democratic leaders over the way Mr. Green had run his primary campaign against Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, had diminished Mr. Green's performance among traditionally Democratic voters. 
Mr. Ferrer disappeared from the campaign trail in the final days before the election, and the Rev. Al Sharpton declined to support Mr. Green, citing the efforts by some Green aides to use mailings and phone calls aimed at Jewish voters to highlight Mr. Sharpton's backing of Mr. Ferrer. Mr. Sharpton called those efforts racist; Mr. Green denied any knowledge of them.
The survey found that Latino voters were evenly divided between Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Green. And Mr. Bloomberg appeared to be winning about one-quarter of the black votes, a number that Mr. Sharpton noted was unusually high for a Republican candidate in New York.
And 4 in 10 of the voters who said they had supported Mr. Ferrer in the Democratic primary said they had voted for Mr. Bloomberg. He made a concerted effort to appeal to Mr. Ferrer's supporters, repeatedly chastising Mr. Green for his tactics.
Several of Mr. Green's supporters expressed bitterness at the absence of Mr. Ferrer from the campaign trail, as well as the decision by Roberto Ramirez, the chairman of the Bronx Democrats and one of Mr. Ferrer's closest friends, not to put his organization behind the Green candidacy. In signs that the finger-pointing had already begun, they suggested that Mr. Ramirez and Mr. Ferrer deserved a significant amount of the blame for the loss.
The contest also offered a measure of the extent to which Mr. Giuliani, the two-term Republican mayor who was prohibited by term limits from running again, could designate his successor. The mayor endorsed Mr. Bloomberg, appeared in a series of television advertisements for him, and turned out once more last night in time for the evening news.
Mr. Giuliani remains an extremely popular figure in New York, according to a survey of voters leaving the polls, and about one-quarter said they had been influenced by his recommendation that they vote for Mr. Bloomberg. (Though that influence was offset by some voters, particularly black New Yorkers, who said the endorsement made them less likely to vote for Mr. Bloomberg.)
Mr. Bloomberg did best among those New Yorkers who described the economy and jobs as the top issues facing New York's next mayor. Mr. Green did best among voters who said the second most important issue was education.
Although Democrats said they were confident about the outcome of the race, some were beginning last night to offer what could be taken as a post-mortem discussion, at least, of why Mr. Green had not done as well as he had expected.
"New York Democrats have been challenged this year, facing a Republican opponent who spent $60 million to defeat our candidate," said Judith Hope, the chairwoman of the State Democratic Party. "We'll become a stronger party because of these challenges."

How the Polls Were Conducted
The Election Day polls were based on questionnaires completed by voters as they left voting stations throughout New York City and New Jersey yesterday. Questionnaires in New York City were available in English or Spanish.
The poll was conducted by Edison Media Research of Somerville, N.J.
The results are based on 1,608 voters in New York City and 1,718 voters in New Jersey, located in 40 randomly selected districts in each place. 
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results should differ by no more than plus or minus three percentage points from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all voters who turned out in New York City or New Jersey yesterday. 
Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential sampling error. 
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on Election Day, such as the reluctance of some voters to take time to fill out the questionnaire, may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE DISSIDENT; 
U.S. Plucks Rebel Figure From Afghan Redoubt for 'Consultations,' Then Returns Him

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ with STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: QUETTA, Pakistan, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Hamid Karzai, the Afghan exile who has emerged as the Bush administration's main hope for forging a southern alliance against the Taliban, was plucked from Afghanistan by American forces early Monday, brought to Pakistan and then ferried back across the border, senior Pentagon officials said today.
 The operation showed considerable coordination between Mr. Karzai and the Bush administration, which has been criticized for lacking a strategy in the south, where the Taliban are strongest. Until now, the administration has concentrated its political and military support on more organized opposition forces in northern Afghanistan. 
 Mr. Karzai, who secretly entered Afghanistan several weeks ago to organize opposition to the Taliban in their southern stronghold, survived a battle with the Taliban in the district of Derawat in Uruzgan Province last Thursday. A senior American military officer said today that Mr. Karzai, the head of a well-known Afghan family, had asked to be taken out of the mountainous region when it be came clear that Taliban forces were closing in on his position.
"If we had done nothing, he would have died," the officer said.
At the Pentagon today, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Mr. Karzai had been spirited out with "a small number of his senior supporters and fighters" so that he could conduct "consultations."
Mr. Rumsfeld played down the operation to remove Mr. Karzai, which involved American Special Operations forces, saying "it was not an extraction in the sense of a military campaign."
Mr. Karzai apparently met with American officials and some of his own supporters in northern Pakistan before being taken back to his redoubt. Mr. Rumsfeld described the extraction of Mr. Karzai and the apparent sharing of information as a "very sensible arrangement."
Mr. Rumsfeld said the United States had provided Mr. Karzai with ammunition and food, but what else the administration has provided Mr. Karzai, who is considered more of a politician than a military strategist or commander, was not clear. The secretary suggested over the week end that Washington was poised to place American advisers with him, but the senior Pentagon officials said advisers were not accompanying Mr. Karzai, though he remained in close contact with American officials.
In the family home in this border town, word of American cooperation infuriated Mr. Karzai's family, who said they feared that the American embrace would severely damage his efforts inside Afghanistan.
"Does he want people to think he is an American agent?" said Ahmed Karzai, a younger brother, during an interview today. Ahmed has become the chief conduit between Hamid Karzai and the outside world, giving interviews to foreign journalists about news from his brother, who calls in by satellite phone. 
Ahmed also serves as a line to other anti-Taliban commanders who live here and appear to be waiting for the right moment to join Mr. Karzai.
Since the battle last Thursday, the Taliban have been denouncing Mr. Karzai as a tool of the United States and have insisted that they captured and then executed several of his sup porters. "The moderates who oppose the Taliban are not happy with this," said another brother, Shah Wali. "The Taliban are now calling him an American agent. What should we fight against: Taliban propaganda or Rumsfeld propaganda?"
Both Ahmed Karzai and Shah Wali denied today -- despite news reports to the contrary -- that Mr. Karzai had left Afghanistan. They appeared concerned by the notion that he had left Afghanistan, a move that would be interpreted as one of weakness by the Pashtun, the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan. Mr. Karzai, and most of the Taliban, are Pashtun.
On Monday, Ahmed Karzai said he had spoken to Hamid twice by satel lite phone and was told by his brother that he was still in the region of Derawat. Today, Ahmed Karzai said his brother had phoned to say he was well and continuing his "political work" inside Afghanistan.
Mr. Karzai is regarded warmly in Washington, in part because he has long seen Osama bin Laden as a serious threat. After the battle last Thursday, Mr. Karzai told Ahmed by satellite telephone that most at tackers were Arabs and Pakistanis.
On Monday night, one of Mr. Karzai's supporters, a man in his 20's who returned to Quetta from the battlefield in southern Afghanistan, stressed that Arabs and Pakistanis had led the Taliban charge against Mr. Karzai.
The supporter, who had driven for more than a day from Mr. Karzai's hideout, said Mr. Karzai fielded about 200 fighters against the Taliban's 700s. Although the numbers could not be independently verified, it appeared that Mr. Karzai was out gunned and outmaneuvered until help came from American war planes.
The supporter, who came to the Karzai home Monday night, said the fighting stopped when "the planes came." One of Mr. Karzai's anti-Taliban allies in Quetta, Yusef Pashtun, said Mr. Karzai had told him by telephone that the Taliban attack against him last Thursday was "highly professional."
Although Mr. Rumsfeld and other officials declined to discuss the "consultations" Mr. Karzai held, they suggested he had valuable intelligence that could be useful in the American campaign, now entering its second month.
Mr. Karzai is a leader of the Populzai clan, which is strongest in the Taliban heartland around Kandahar, Uruzgan, Helmand and Ghor Provinces. Mr. Karzai is asking the people in those areas to choose between their clan and the Taliban.
Because economic conditions had deteriorated and the Taliban had be come so unpopular, Mr. Karzai was confident that the people would choose clan over the religious rulers, Ahmed said.

Rebel's Nephew Is Executed
(By The New York Times), JABUL-US-SIRAJ, Afghanistan, Nov. 6 -- Taliban forces executed the 20-year-old nephew of the Pashtun dissident Abdul Haq on Monday night, family members reported to day. The young man, Izetulla, was captured with Mr. Haq late last month during a failed expedition to organize Pashtun resistance to the Taliban government inside Afghanistan. Mr. Haq was hanged within hours of his capture. 
"He was killed last night in Kabul," said Haji Kadir, Mr. Haq's brother and a leader in the opposition Northern Alliance, said in an interview today. "They shot him."
Mr. Kadir said he learned of his nephew's death this morning. Mr. Kadir said that Izetulla was the son of a third brother in the family, Haji Den, who served as education minister in the government that briefly ruled Afghanistan in the early 1990's before the country disintegrated into civil war.

HEADLINE: Man in the News; 
Finding a New Mission; Michael Rubens Bloomberg

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

 BODY:
Michael Rubens Bloomberg, among the wealthiest people in New York City, has been a man in search of a mission beyond making money. With yesterday's come-from-behind victory in the mayoral race, he seems to have found it.
 Mr. Bloomberg had made it well known in recent years that he was looking for a major life change. Friends and associates say he talked mostly about four jobs that would tempt him away from Bloomberg L.P., the financial information and communications company that he founded in 1981 and that, according to Forbes magazine, made him the sixth richest New Yorker, with an estimated worth of $4 billion. 
 The jobs were president of the United States, secretary general of the United Nations, president of the World Bank and mayor of New York City.
"He is absolutely driven by the need and desire to make a difference, which has nothing to do with money," said Dr. Alfred Sommer, who, as dean of the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, had spent many evenings over dinner with Mr. Bloomberg discussing his future.
Dr. Sommer had urged Mr. Bloomberg to consider a new career championing public health causes around the world, particularly since Mr. Bloomberg donated tens of millions of dollars to the Johns Hopkins public health school (it was renamed earlier this year in acknowledgment of those donations). But Mr. Bloomberg, who received an engineering degree from Johns Hopkins and an M.B.A. from Harvard, said it was not a good match with his background.
In the end, several of Mr. Bloomberg's associates said, Mr. Bloomberg was motivated to run for mayor by two factors. First, he accepted that he had no chance of landing the White House or United Nations job (at least not anytime soon) and he regarded the World Bank position as a long shot because another affluent New Yorker, James D. Wolfensohn, holds it. 
Second, and perhaps more important, he was inspired by the success of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in lowering crime rates and turning around the city's tarnished image.
"He genuinely admires the difference that Giuliani made," Dr. Sommer said. "When he looked around, how he could make a difference, and knowing his own skill set, the mayor's job was the obvious thing."
Many friends cautioned Mr. Bloomberg against making his first foray into public life, suggesting that he might not take well to the intense media scrutiny of a mayoral campaign. Mr. Bloomberg did engage in heated exchanges with reporters over some of their questions and even his campaign staff bristled at his occasional slip.
But more often than not, Mr. Bloomberg seemed to enjoy the attention of being a candidate and he often spoke in awe about the big and diverse city he discovered on the campaign trail.
"It's been a great experience," Mr. Bloomberg said on his last day of campaigning. "No matter how many people you know, you get a chance to meet more people. I think this is not a job for anybody that doesn't like people."
Mr. Bloomberg moved to New York in 1966 after graduating from Harvard to take a job for $9,000 a year at Salomon Brothers. In his autobiography, "Bloomberg by Bloomberg," he describes his first duties for the firm as counting billions of dollars of actual bond and stock certificates, stripped down to his underwear, in a sweltering bank vault. Only an occasional six-pack of beer made it tolerable.
Before long, Mr. Bloomberg was promoted to the equities desk, where he started his career trading stocks. He would spend 15 years at Salomon Brothers, learning all there was to learn about the financial industry and becoming addicted to the good life in New York. "I didn't love Wall Street just for the money, I also loved it for the lifestyle it provided," he wrote in his book.
In 1973, Mr. Bloomberg became a partner. But by 1979, Mr. Bloomberg's star was no longer rising at Salomon and he was pushed off to what was then considered the sidelines. His last job at the firm was running its information systems department -- his introduction to computers -- and by 1981 he was fired. "I had stirred the pot, lost the battle, and was paying the price," Mr. Bloomberg recalled.
But Mr. Bloomberg left Salomon with a $10 million handshake, money he quickly invested in starting a company with a few friends from Salomon in a one-room office on Madison Avenue.
Using the knowledge of computers and Wall Street gleaned at Salomon, Mr. Bloomberg named the company Innovative Market Systems and specialized in providing detailed financial information to the financial services industry on custom-made computers. The company would later be renamed Bloomberg L.P. and the computer terminals would become known simply as Bloomberg boxes.
Today, Bloomberg L.P. employs 8,000 people and does business in 126 countries, having expanded into radio, television, magazines and a news service. Mr. Bloomberg is still the majority owner, but in preparation for his run for mayor, he handed over the day-to-day operations of the company to Lex Fenwick, who formerly ran its European operations.
Though not particularly well-known to the general public, Mr. Bloomberg became a regular fixture in New York's society circles during his years at Bloomberg L.P. and he served on various boards, including those at Lincoln Center and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
He wrote in his book that one of the reasons his marriage to Susan Brown fell apart was, "I like to go out and party." They divorced in 1993. He is still friendly with his former wife, though, who, along with her boyfriend, was a volunteer for his campaign. The older of his two daughters, Emma, also volunteered, as did his sister and his mother, who is 92.
Mr. Bloomberg was born in the Boston suburb of Medford, Mass., on Feb. 14, 1942. His father, William, was an accountant at a local dairy. He died while Mr. Bloomberg was at Harvard. His mother, Charlotte, was a housewife and still lives in his childhood home. He says he calls her every morning before work.

Miami Beach Buyers Chill Out

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH 

 BODY:
AT the north end of Ocean Drive, the Art Deco axis of South Florida's night life, the Breez restaurant sits empty. It's a bar without drinkers, a restaurant without diners. It laid off its star chef five weeks ago. "We do a lot of cleaning," said Gabriel Fernandez, the 25-year-old bartender, wiping the sinuous aluminum bar.
 A nearby parking lot contains just two cars. One has a "For Sale" sign on the windshield. The other belongs to the attendant. 
 Farther down the beachfront strip, sidewalk hawkers offer two-for-one pina coladas and rum punches, thrusting menus into the hands of passers-by. At the Delano, Ian Schrager's oceanfront hotel, the icy chic of the corridors is undisturbed by human visitation: the long white marble sushi bar is empty. The Zen-like dining room has only a few patrons. 
For the last decade, Miami Beach has welcomed fashion photographers, interior designers and a fabulous fraternity of club hoppers -- all of whom coexisted with an older population in Bermuda shorts and knee-high black socks. As a photograph, and as a happening, it worked. But this fall the scene has evaporated. The jets are half empty, and many of the hotels are struggling to stay alive.
After seven years of ever-ascending prices, Miami Beach's overheated real estate market is finally cooling down. "Everybody -- buyers and renters -- is cautious right now," Zaino Mizani, a real estate agent with Majestic Properties, a company that both sells and develops condominiums, said Tuesday. "It's hard to convince people to buy. If they have to come here because of job relocation, they'd rather rent and hold on to the cash and see what happens." 
Some developers are making deals, not only for condos but for rentals. This week at the Waverly, a new rental project that is only 60 percent full, the landlords are offering between one and two months' free rent; two-bedrooms go for $2,235. 
The city's market is starting to bloat with listings of high-priced houses and half-built condominium developments, according to figures gathered by the local real estate agents association. 
Before Sept. 11, there were 540 condominium apartments on the market. This week, there were 1,497 -- almost triple the number. Before the attacks in New York, there were 73 houses in Miami Beach on the market. Now, there are 260. 
Bruce Singer, the president of the Miami Beach Chamber of Commerce, said he worries about a glut of new condominiums in tall towers that are still on the drawing boards, or just starting to rise. "It's not an opportune time," he said.
Mayor Neisen O. Kasdin is uneasy, too. "New hotel development, office construction and retail were already slowing," he said. Until Sept. 11, residential real estate was "continuing very strong." Now, he is awaiting the sales figures. "There is a good deal of concern," he said. "There's no candy-coating it; tourism has been hit bad after 9/ 11." Last weekend's cancellation of the Art Basel Miami Beach show, a result of fears of terrorism and anthrax, left Miamians reeling, the mayor said.
In an oceanfront area of mid-1990's condominium towers, the first of what was to have been twin projects has been built. "We've heard the second has been delayed," Mr. Mizani said. He gestured to a sign there proclaiming the Continuum development: "Never Before, Never Again." "That may be true," he said, with a wry smile. (The developer said there was no date set for groundbreaking on the second tower.)
At the Green Diamond tower on Collins Avenue, near the famous Fontainebleau Hotel, condominiums are selling for $350,000 to $800,000, around 20 percent to 30 percent less than similar ones at its twin next door, the Blue Diamond, which opened for business first. At the Yacht Club at Portofino, a 38-story, 220-unit condominium, there are 63 apartments for sale; 20 came on the market after Sept. 11. At the corner of Second Street and Collins Avenue is Ocean Place, a much smaller development. It is almost finished, but it appears that workers have walked off the job, leaving unfinished plasterwork and lighting fixtures hanging from their cords. 
Of the 17 properties shown on a recent tour of houses for sale, 10 had come on the market after Sept. 11.
Five of the rest had been reduced significantly. The price of one town house condominium had been reduced three times: from $425,000 to $380,000 to $365,000 to $349,000. A 1924 villa on Hibiscus Island had already been reduced from $3.5 million to $3.29 million on Oct. 4. The next day, it was reduced again, to $2.95 million. The stucco had been troweled -- and retroweled -- on a classic Mediterranean-style movie star mansion that desperately needed renovation, but the bones were there: a double-height living room with a stone fireplace, overlooking a swimming pool and an 80-foot waterfront. A white yacht was moored out front -- blocking most of the view. 
At another open house, for Villa Palma, a $3.4-million house with a marble fountain and a tennis court, the broker handed out fliers. "Owner very motivated and has reduced price yet again," they said.
Samuel Spencer Blum, a real estate lawyer here, said he has seen "a definite decrease" in new contracts. Mr. Blum blamed the lull on the national economy and on the terrorist attacks in New York. (Almost unmentioned here are the anthrax attacks in Boca Raton.) "If they're afraid to buy a toaster," Mr. Blum said, "they're going to be afraid to buy a second home."
In the Coral Gables section of Miami, he said, "three contracts have fallen through in the last week; nothing's wrong with the house -- people kept getting cold feet."
Nevertheless, some brokers are far from pessimistic. Jerry Grabill, chairman of the Realtor Association of Greater Miami and the Beaches, said the market "hasn't changed very much: I expected it to go down the tubes, but it seems to be stable." 
Alan Jacobson, president of Wimbish-Riteway Realtors, who deals in the most expensive properties in Miami Beach, said business is fine. "We have 13 signed contracts over $1 million since Sept. 11," he said. "That's below our average, but it's not a reflection of a down market."
In general, Mr. Jacobson said, "what has happened is, the supply of properties starts to exceed demand, and the prices come down. Those people who were waiting to put their house on the market are no longer waiting." He predicted that "real estate will remain stable in South Florida as it always has been." 
"Buyers who believe they can get a steal in this market are wrong," he said.
Mr. Jacobson is right about customers not getting a steal. In fact, Michael Y. Cannon, a real estate appraiser, said prices do not appear to be affected. "But the jury is still out," he conceded. He said data on the real estate market would not be fully digested until December. One sign of a softening, Mr. Cannon said, was the increasing number of classified advertisements in local newspapers placed by owners of unfinished condominiums trying to unload their investments. But overall, he said he disagreed with "the pundits" who predict sharp price declines.
Even if there are no steals, most buyers here expect a reduction, or at least more bargaining room, said Mr. Mizani of Majestic Properties. 
Jason Bryan, manager of Johnny Rockets restaurant in the Coconut Grove section of Miami, was out looking for a two-bedroom bargain rental two weeks ago. "There's lots of selection, and a lot more room to negotiate a price," he said. "We see a lot that have been reduced." (Miami's Multiple Listing Service shows 1,069 rentals available in Miami Beach; of those, 469 came on since Sept. 11.)
Mr. Bryan passed the Johnny Rockets on Ocean Drive. There were two people sitting at tables on the sidewalk. Inside, there was no one. "Last year, it would have been packed," he said. At the cafe at Gloria Estefan's Cardozo Hotel, there were 13 people sitting along the wraparound porch.
Again, no one was inside. 
But the people here say they hope that when the weather up North turns cold, the tourists will remember Miami Beach.
"Oh, honey, of course Sept. 11 affects our economy," said Mitchell Wolfson Jr., the founder of the Wolfsonian Museum. "But Miami Beach has the capacity to reinvent itself," Mr. Wolfson concluded. "The city has done it before."

HEADLINE: Technology That Aims To Do Good 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ZIPERN 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif. 

 BODY:
SILICON VALLEY is not generally known for a pervasive sense of charity. Last year Paulina Borsook, a longtime technology journalist, found a large and sympathetic audience with her book "Cyberselfish: A Critical Romp Through the Terribly Libertarian Culture of High Tech," which attacked the technology world for showing "a lack of human connection and a discomfort with the core of what many of us consider it means to be human."
 So an awards benefit in the heart of Silicon Valley to celebrate "Technology Benefiting Humanity" might seem incongruous. But on Nov. 1 the Tech Museum of Innovation, a three-year-old science and technology museum in downtown San Jose, held just such an event -- with a keynote speech by former President Gerald R. Ford -- to honor technology specialists who "improve the quality of life around the globe." 
 The museum, known informally as The Tech, brings a Silicon Valley spin to the notion of a public science institute. The Tech's financial backers may have made their money on silicon, but the technology that betters the human race, they argue, is much broader in scope. 
More than 1,000 people from around the world attended the evening's black-tie fund-raiser and banquet as two enormous screens projected short videos about work by 25 finalists for the museum's Technology Benefiting Humanity Awards.
The judges, assembled by Santa Clara University's Center for Science, Technology and Society, reviewed more than 390 applications from 50 countries. Awards carrying $50,000 stipends were given in five categories: health, education, environment, economic development and equality. 
"This means we can make a whole lot more limbs for a whole lot more people," said Dr. Chaz M. Holder, who received the equality award for a system of socketless prosthetic limbs that weigh and cost less than versions commonly used. Mr. Holder, himself a triple amputee after a car accident 20 years ago, said that some 25 million people in the developing world who need artificial limbs never get them because they can cost upwards of $20,000. Over the last two years his company, CZBioMed, based in Fayetteville, N.C., has fit 400 prosthetic limbs on patients in Sierra Leone and Vietnam.
The health award went to Joseph DeRisi, a professor of biochemistry at the University of California at San Francisco, who is working to identify the genes likely to be essential to the survival of the parasite that causes malaria. 
The South Africa-based Freeplay Foundation won the education award. More than 150,000 wind-up and solar-powered radios have been furnished by Freeplay for use in development, disaster relief and education initiatives, mostly in Africa.
Fabio de Oliveira Rosa, the president of Ideaas, a Brazilian organization, received the economic development award for developing low-cost rural electrification systems. The environment award went to Dr. Betsy Dresser, director of the Audubon Nature Institute's Center for Research of Endangered Species in New Orleans, for innovative applications of technology to preserve biodiversity.
Peter Giles, president of the Tech Museum, said that the idea for the awards was inspired by a policy group's report on economic development and technological change. Applied Materials, already a benefactor of the Tech Museum, signed on as a sponsor, and individual awards were backed by Nasdaq, Knight Ridder, Credit Suisse First Boston, Intel and J. P. Morgan Chase.
The report, an annual "State of the Future" analysis by the Millennium Project of the American Council for the United Nations University, suggested that the most effective way to encourage progress in fields without obvious market potential was through incentives like prize money as well as peer recognition.
Jerome C. Glenn, co-director of the Millennium Project and an author of the report, argues that Silicon Valley's kind of entrepreneurial know-how and small-group collaboration should be applied in tackling problems of the developing world. "These winners will become attractors around which energy can flow," he said of the award recipients.
Mr. Glenn said that the terrorist attacks helped crystallize the awards' purpose.
"You can't have two billion people living with disease, poverty, war, conflict and terrorism and survive like that for very long," he said. "We have to ask how we can use technological innovation to create a more serious global partnership between the rich and the poor."

HEADLINE: For Antiquers, An Anxious Season 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
THE Winter Antiques Show in January, the most prestigious annual antiques event in the country, has been locked out of the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue at 67th Street -- its home for 48 years -- by National Guard operations there. The show will be staged instead at the Hilton New York on the Avenue of the Americas at 53rd Street.
 "I'm aware of the three magic words -- location, location, location," said Arie L. Kopelman, president of Chanel U.S.A. and chairman of the show committee, anticipating sales nervousness about the absence of the armory's well-heeled foot traffic. "The good news is that there's a show." 
 The military occupation of two East Side armories and the city's occupation of the West Side piers has forced the cancellation of much of the antiques fall and winter exhibition schedule. According to dealers and organizers, the disruption has cost them tens of millions of dollars in revenue. 
The Winter Antiques Show's homelessness is the glittering tip of the iceberg of events since Sept. 11 that have also changed the antiques market's direction generally and produced uneasy thinking about New York as the collectors' capital. 
Compounding a cooling economy, the impact is registering at all levels, from the fine-furniture sales in October at the auction houses, where only the best sold well, to the 26th Street flea markets, where panicked sellers are bringing out their best pieces to keep buyers interested. 
The exclusion from the armories has already necessitated the cancellation of the International Art and Design Fair in September and the International Fine Art and Antique Dealers Show in October. Anna Haughton, an organizer of both events, said that they represented a loss as high as $75 million in sales for dealers. If venues for large shows are still unavailable by spring, organizers said, the outlook could deepen from dark to pitch black.
"They do 20 to 70 percent of yearly business at these shows," Ms. Haughton, who is based in London, said of dealers. "Globally, New York is the center of the market. If the fairs are not up and running quickly, the market will fragment and start to move away. And it will never come back."
For now, Leanne Stella, the president of Stella Show Management, was optimistic about keeping her shows in New York, despite the cancellation of three out of four fall events, including the Triple Pier Antiques Show, which was to have taken place this weekend and next, with 1,200 dealers participating at Piers 88, 90 and 92, now also unavailable to exhibitors indefinitely.
"I've lost my exposure to New York," said Carol Lehman, manager of Stevens Antiques, a shop in Frazer, Pa., who was scheduled to exhibit at the piers. "We only do the shows in New York to give us presence there, for decorators."
Ms. Stella said that the loss of revenue to her company would be "several hundred thousand dollars -- it's easily 50 percent of our business." She estimated the loss to dealers bounced from the piers at more than $24 million, based on previous shows. Hardest hit are those without shops.
"They are really frightened of being crippled by the loss of the show," she said. "It's devastating to them." 
Though uncalculated, the cancellation of the fall antiques events undoubtedly affected the revenues of other convention services, like hotels and restaurants. 
Ms. Stella added that if her spring show, to be held in March, was not possible at the three piers, it would force the issue of removing the event from New York City. "Connecticut or northern New Jersey or upstate -- you have to go where there's already interest in antiques," she said. Yesterday, Ms. Stella was trying to organize an impromptu fair of 200 dealers from the canceled piers show, which would take place in Somerset, N.J., on Dec. 1 and 2.
Genevieve Ward, an associate editor at Antiques and the Arts Weekly, a trade journal in Newtown, Conn., said that she was seeing organizers' restiveness to relocate shows, though not the biggest-ticket events like the Winter Antiques Show.
"Show managers are looking to branch out into suburban locations," she said. "Civic centers, convention centers in Westchester. There are a lot of shows outside of New York, held as benefits for local museums; shows in Boston and Philadelphia, still on the go. All the New York collectors go to Boston and Philadelphia anyway."
But even local relocation has proved tricky. Stella Show Management moved its Gramercy Park Modern show, scheduled at the armory on Lexington Avenue at 26th Street, to Madison Square Garden, notifying participants a short week before its opening on Oct. 6. Ten dealers dropped out, a wary and weary reaction to added logistical problems, security issues and a lack of confidence that buyers would appear. Attendance dropped by 15 percent from the previous year, Ms. Stella said. The organizers' costs rose by $50,000, or 25 percent, because of the move.
"I didn't have a good feeling about it," said Chris Kennedy, a Massachusetts dealer who canceled, uncertain that it would draw a crowd, or spenders. "For me, a furniture dealer, I'll walk a small table down to the curb for a customer, but you could no longer exit by the nearest door. The load in, the load out -- everything was compounded by security."
Mr. Kennedy, the owner of e-modern in Springfield who has exhibited for 15 years on the New York show circuit, confirmed an atmosphere of caution among buyers and sellers in the last month, mentioned at every tier of the antiques market.
"I don't think this foreshadows a depression movement -- to get liquid quickly by selling what you have cheaply," he said. "But you retrench, buying more carefully so you have a cushion, so you can reduce a price to make a sale."
The modern design collecting community's flagship event, Modernism, which opened today, was relocated from the Seventh Regiment Armory to the Hasbro toy showroom at 32 West 23rd Street (www .sanfordsmith.com). 
The show also shrank, from 72 exhibitors to 55, because of lack of space and cancellations. The move cost its organizers, Sanford L. Smith & Associates, $75,000 on top of the usual costs, Mr. Smith said.
In its own relocation scramble, the Winter Antiques Show (www.winterantiquesshow .com) also looked into vacant retail space on West 57th Street and at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.
The imperative to move threatened to turn one of the city's more elegant tailgate parties, with six-figure merchandise sold from the richly decorated dealers' booths inside the Upper East Side 19th-century landmark, with its Tiffany interiors, into what dealers feared would be more akin to selling old furniture out of the back of a truck. The Winter Antiques Show benefits the East Side Settlement House in the Bronx; it raised more than $1 million last year.
David A. Schorsch, a dealer from Woodbury, Conn., exhibiting for the first time, said he was not concerned by the change in venue. "Obviously when you're in the business of retail, you like the idea of folks on Park Avenue wandering in," he said. "But we have to keep our eye on the ball -- the country's at war. For antiques dealers to deal with inconvenience seems reasonable to me, in the larger scheme of things."
John Levitties, the owner of the John Alexander gallery in Philadelphia, a specialist in English Arts and Crafts exhibiting at Modernism, said: "Everyone's rolling with the punches this year. For us, it's not the income of the show. The juxtaposition of different styles and booths at a show like this introduces people clearly to what we do."
Mr. Levitties said that his business had been quiet after the World Trade Center attack and stronger since the last week of September. "There's been no noticeable negotiation about prices," he said. "But people are somewhat slower to make decisions."
Storefronts and galleries, though a source of steadier business, cannot provide the lively anticipation and competition among collectors that major shows can, said several dealers.
"Shows generate excitement," said Leigh Keno, a prominent American antiques dealer with a shop in New York, who will be at the Hilton with the Winter Antiques Show. 
Mr. Keno said that September's tragedy, the subsequent disruptions and a lingering question over larger values in the light of current circumstances -- both economic and social -- had affected people's approach to buying. "Major items are still selling," he said. "But items that are 5 or 6 on a scale of 10? People are just waiting."
Lou Marotta, a dealer at 243 East 60th Street, on a block of antiques shops that cater to decorators rather than to collectors, was not so sanguine.
"Before Sept. 11, business was better than ever," he said, despite a slowing economy. "Then, no one walked in for three weeks. Since the fourth week, business has been unreliable. People buying things and then changing their minds -- waffling. People are asking for discounts, more than ever. It makes me realize how fragile this business is. All my money is put back into inventory, to keep it fresh. How many months can I go, and pay the rent?"
Mr. Marotta concluded: "I've really thought it through. In four months, I would be doing something else to earn money, like interior design. In six months, I would be out of business."
Mr. Keno, speaking on Monday upon his return from the Ellis Memorial Antique Show in Boston and smaller weekend auctions in the Northeast, said that he saw no evidence of buyers trying to drive unusually hard bargains.
But of the big collections coming up for sale in New York at the Americana auctions that typically coincide with the week in January of the Winter Antiques Show, Mr. Keno cautioned auction houses that great expectations might well be untimely and unwise.
"The key in these sales is going to be conservative estimates," he said. "I don't think buyers are as tolerant right now of aggressive estimates."
In fact, though Sotheby's and Christie's both reported stronger than anticipated attendance and sales results at October's decorative arts auctions, the buy-in rate -- the number of lots that the house buys because bidding is not satisfactorily high -- was nearly double last year's at certain sales. At Sotheby's English furniture auction on Oct. 19, the buy-in was 21 percent, up from 12 percent the year before.
"Some people think, 'Great, we're going to get a bargain,' " Peter Lang, the director of the English furniture department, said, adding that there were bargains to be had, but not on the best pieces.
On Sunday at the flea market on the Avenue of the Americas at 26th Street, a thinner than usual crowd was rummaging as hard as ever, moving like truffle pigs through the piles of dainty discarded silver and disco-era lighting.
Jim Oliveira, who has a vintage-glass business with Sara Blumberg, his partner, said that the flea market itself was improving.
"It was drying up as a source," he explained. "A lot of dealers who set up shops in a better economy are returning."
Mr. Oliveira mentioned a 1920's Italian vase he purchased recently.
"There's more stuff coming out than I have seen in years, things that disappear from the market in a boom," he said. 
"It's a rare vase; I haven't seen anything like this in eight or nine years," he said. Mr. Oliveira has several customers for it.
"The hard-core buy, when they see pieces like that," he said.

HEADLINE: To Promote Democracy 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While richer nations must certainly be prodded to increase foreign aid to developing nations (Economic Scene, Nov. 1), a concerted effort should be made to see that the money we are sending abroad is used wisely. 
 Since 1999, the United States has spent $1.4 billion on "democracy promotion," yet there is very little in the way of cogent analysis about the impact of these grants. 
Foreign grantees and the American nongovernmental organizations that work with them often make a good case for continued financing. With little attendant scrutiny from the media, scholars and independent good-governance organizations, however, precious resources can be squandered year after year. 
 Americans must take an interest in these daunting and often dangerous initiatives.

HEADLINE: The Caprice of Coffee 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: MONTENEGRO, Colombia 

 BODY:
For generations, coffee paid for everything here: the paving of roads, the electrification of remote hamlets, the building of schools. Growers, flush with cash from producing beans that were widely considered the best in the world, built elegant haciendas and sent their children to top universities.
 But now, the price of raw coffee has plunged worldwide, and many growers are planting other crops, trying to become more efficient or going out of business. 
 The situation has been especially acute for farmers in Colombia, who are loath to scrimp on the production of their premium, smooth-tasting beans but who must modernize and cut expenses to compete with countries where coffee is grown at a fraction of Colombia's production costs.
"Coffee has given us comforts, a good income and stability, but today we worry that coffee, at today's prices, is just not worth it," said Fernando Gallego, who has a 61-acre farm here. "I still have some coffee plantations, but next year, I imagine I am going to sell some of my land." 
Coffee growers across the world are suffering as an oversupply of coffee has caused the price of a pound of beans to sink to its lowest level in 30 years.
 The price dropped to 45.19 cents in New York on Wednesday, down from 95 cents in December 1999. 
Nowhere has the bust been more devastating than in Latin America, which produces 60 percent of the world's coffee and where some economies are heavily dependent on coffee exports.
"The prices have deteriorated to the point that for a majority of countries, not to mention all of them, the actual prices are not covering production costs," said Jorge Cardenas, president of the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia, which represents 570,000 coffee farms.
And nowhere are farmers more frustrated than in places like Colombia, where the care lavished on the beans -- care that made the product distinctive -- makes production particularly expensive.
The reason for the oversupply and the price slump is simple: The 60 coffee-growing countries around the globe are producing too much. In the year ended Sept. 30, they churned out 115 million 132-pound bags, while world consumption reached only 108 million, according to the Association of Coffee Producing Countries, which is based in London.
Much of the glut has come from a surge in production in Vietnam, where coffee is cheap because of labor costs and subsidies. Once a minor player, Vietnam has surpassed Colombia as the world's second-largest coffee producer. Production there rose from a million bags in the late 1980's to 13 million in the last year -- a million more than Colombia. Brazil, the No. 1 grower, is also increasing production at low cost because its farms are highly mechanized.
Conditions will probably get worse, analysts say, pointing to the recent failure of a plan by the coffee growers group to have its 28 member countries hold back on exports and thus stabilize prices.
The turmoil in the industry has been catastrophic for many Latin American coffee farmers. Some from the eastern highlands of Mexico have embarked on perilous journeys across the desert in search of work in the United States. Subsistence farmers in Central America are losing their livelihood, and itinerant pickers have resorted to begging. Farmers elsewhere, from Venezuela to Peru, are trying to sell land or switch to more lucrative crops.
And then there is Colombia, which has been economically, psychologically and emotionally tied to coffee like no other country.
Half a century ago, Colombian coffee commanded $5 or more a pound in today's dollars and made up 80 percent of the country's exports. Colombia's economy has diversified in the last 20 years, but coffee is still the No. 2 export, following oil, and it accounted for about 9 percent of total exports last year.
The benefits were greatest here in Quindio, a province of 575,000 people in the mountainous heart of coffee growing country, a region where rainfall, soil composition and altitude are said to be perfect for coffee cultivation.
In the mid-1990's, at least 35 percent of Quindio's workers were directly employed in the coffee industry. And through the National Federation of Coffee Growers, the de facto government in this region, coffee revenues have financed public works projects like telephone lines, the salaries of agricultural technicians and the building of aqueducts -- services often absent from Colombia's many strife-torn regions.
"We never had guerrilla groups because the level of life here was very good," said Pedro Nel Salazar, director of the National Coffee Park, a former farm turned theme park in Montenegro. "But it was not the state that came here. It was the Federation of Coffee Growers."
Now, though, the signs of economic disarray are everywhere as the bean grown in Colombia, arabica, one of two main species in the world (the other, less expensive bean, is robusta), has slumped.
 It dropped from $1.23 a pound in December 1999 to 67.50 cents on Wednesday. 
The effect on the nation's economy has been immediate, with coffee exports falling to $1.2 billion last year from $2.4 billion in 1997, when a recession began taking hold.
Three million to 4 million of Colombia's 40 million people have traditionally been hired for the twice-a-year harvests. Now, hundreds of thousands are losing their jobs, as farmers scale back their operations.
"We cannot take out credit for our farms, and we have had to reduce the work force," said Oliverio Castellanos, who helps run several family farms. "You feel hopeless because producing is almost not worth it."
Shaken by the crisis, the government of President Andres Pastrana announced a $150 million rescue package in September, although most farmers here think the bailout will fall far short.
The National Federation of Coffee Growers has had to drastically scale back its largesse. Allocations to regional committees are just 30 percent of what they were in the 1980's. Globally, the most visible cost-cutting has been in the budget for advertising, which for 40 years has featured Juan Valdez and his burro, Madison Avenue creations that helped sell Colombian coffee.
Those most likely to weather the tumbling prices are the larger farmers, who can more easily cut costs and increase efficiency. But the vast majority of Colombia's farms have only about 10 acres, said Eduardo Uribe, a coffee expert at Los Andes University in Bogota.
If farmers want to stay in business, they must focus on organic coffees and other specially produced brands likely to command a superpremium price, said Richard P. Peregoy, an international business expert at the University of Dallas Graduate School of Management in Irving, Tex. "Things are going to go down, down, down unless they find a niche market," he said.
Coffee growers agree but say the prospects of making such a switch are grim.
"That is what they say, but the reality is different," Mr. Gallego, the farmer, said. "We do not have the capital for that, to bring out the specialty or organic coffees."
So he and most other farmers are squeezing in other crops, like plantains, between their coffee bushes to increase revenue. Hugo Tabares, who, like many farmers living in haciendas, is trying to rent out rooms to weekend visitors.
"We have to act and try to find another way to make money," Mr. Tabares said. "And we try to keep costs as low as possible."
He added, "We just want to do what we can to keep our farms."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
The decline of the Muslim Middle East, and the roots of resentment, can be traced to Islamic inheritance law.

BYLINE:  By Virginia Postrel; Virginia Postrel is the editor at large of Reason Magazine and the author of "The Future and Its Enemies." E-mail: vpostrel@reason.com.

 BODY:
UNTIL the late Middle Ages, the Muslim Middle East was at least as economically developed as Europe. Then, beginning with the rise of the great Italian traders in the 14th century, Europeans pulled ahead, while the Islamic world gradually declined. By the 19th century, European economic influence had translated into political domination of the Middle East. The Islamic world has never fully recovered, and that disparity feeds resentment today.
 What happened? The puzzle is vexing not only because Muslim traders had been so successful in earlier eras but because they remained successful in trade with other regions, like India and East Africa. They were not bad at business; to the contrary, they were good at it. 
 This is the sort of big-picture question that interests economists who study "institutions" -- the laws, regulations and norms that provide the underpinnings for economic life. After the work of the Nobel laureate Douglass C. North, these scholars recognize that development does not take place in a vacuum. The institutions that work well for certain types of economic activity may not work as well for others. Discovering new and better institutions is as important as discovering new technologies or business practices. And that trial-and-error process can take time.
Since 1997, Timur Kuran, an economist at the University of Southern California, has been investigating the connection between institutions and the economic decline of the Muslim Middle East. In a paper, "The Islamic Commercial Crisis: Institutional Roots of the Delay in the Middle East's Economic Modernization," he proposes an answer: Islamic partnership law and inheritance law interacted to keep Middle Eastern enterprises small, never allowing the development of corporate forms. (A version of the paper can be downloaded at papers.ssrn.com/abstract_id=276377.)
In the Middle Ages, both Islamic and European law required that a partnership dissolve if one partner died or was incapacitated. That tended to limit the size of such arrangements. The typical partnership would be, say, two financial backers and one trader who brought merchandise to or from a distant locale. The more people involved, the more likely the partnership would have to dissolve in the middle of a venture.
In Europe, the consequences of a partner's death could be limited. Inheritance law often allowed a person to designate heirs. So a particular son might inherit the partnership share. The partnership would still have to dissolve technically, but it could be immediately reconstituted. Even in places where inheritance law was more rigid, heirs were generally limited to the nuclear family, keeping down the number of claimants and, therefore, the potential for disrupting partnerships. As a result, European partnerships were able to expand over time, allowing more ambitious, better-financed ventures.
Under Islamic law, by contrast, inheritance was prescribed in rigid detail, with all sorts of family members -- uncles, cousins, siblings, parents, and so on -- getting pieces of the estate. There was no way to limit a stake to a single heir. These prescriptions were rooted in the Koran, which meant they were virtually impossible to alter. The fragmentation produced by inheritance law, combined with the strictures of partnership law, kept Middle Eastern enterprises small. That, in turn, limited the pressure to evolve new economic forms.
"Why did you get the joint stock corporation and the modern corporation in Europe?" Professor Kuran asked. "Because as these partnerships expanded, they created problems that had to be resolved by putting pressure on the legal system to recognize new institutions." For instance, partners who wanted to pull out and sell their shares needed a financially graceful way to do so, leading to transferable shares and stock exchanges.
"As these problems arise, the legal system responds," Professor Kuran said. "The same thing doesn't happen in the Islamic world because the partnerships don't grow."
That difference did not matter for a long time, because the small partnerships were still extremely successful, and most of their trade was with Africa or Asia. Only in the 18th century, when trade with Europe became a big part of Middle Eastern commerce, did the difference between the systems become important.
At that point, Christians and Jews in Islamic countries also suddenly had a business advantage. As religious minorities, they had been able to choose whether to do business under Islamic law or, with mutual consent, under some other law. Although their own religions also provided laws and courts, they generally relied on Islamic law.
When Europeans started dominating Middle Eastern trade, however, they brought European courts with them. That gave Middle Eastern religious minorities a new option: to use European law. "So," Professor Kuran said, "a local Christian in Istanbul suddenly gets the idea he could start running his business under French law and take his disputes to the French court in the city, and to have his contracts notarized by a French notary, effectively moving under French law. This happens on a very large scale."
Since European institutions had evolved to better suit the scale of modern businesses, in which thousands of people may be involved as investors and employees, Christians and Jews using those laws began to prosper in comparison to their Muslim neighbors. Only in the 19th century did Middle Eastern governments begin adopting secular commercial laws that allowed Muslim-owned enterprises to grow.
Today, Professor Kuran says, Islamic inheritance law poses no problems to large-scale endeavors. The estate simply divides up the securities among the heirs, and the business goes on undisturbed. Secular corporate law lets religious inheritance law work in a modern economy.
"I'm not talking about blanket condemnation of Islamic law," he said emphatically. "That is patently false. I don't believe it and I don't argue it." Rather, he views the situation as an unintended consequence of institutions that were suited for the times in which they developed.
"When the inheritance law was put into place, the early Muslims in the seventh century were not thinking about the consequences for commerce with Europe 1,000 years later," he said. They were addressing inequities in their own day, including the problems of daughters left with no inheritance. "But in the process," he said, "they created another problem 1,000 years down the road."

HEADLINE: Novartis Plans Drug Discount For Elderly 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Novartis A.G. of Switzerland said yesterday that it would offer cards to low-income elderly Americans to provide discounts of 25 percent or more on the company's brand-name drugs.
 Novartis said the discounts would take effect in January. Those eligible will be people who are 65 or older and have incomes of $26,000 or less for single people and $35,000 for couples. 
 The offer follows a similar announcement early last month by the British company GlaxoSmithKline. A number of pharmaceutical companies are seeking to burnish their reputations in hopes of deflecting pressure in Congress for measures that could increase the government's influence on drug prices. Other drug companies are cutting prices on anthrax drugs and offering to produce smallpox vaccines.
"The pressure on the industry has eased, due to the war and bioterrorism," said Dr. Daniel Vasella, chief executive of Novartis. "It's a good time to be proactive instead of defensive."
The discount drug card program, he said, is a partial step toward reducing the burden of drug costs for 10 million low-income people who do not have insurance that covers drugs. 
That group is faced with some of the world's highest drug prices. Reflecting the buying power of the purchaser, the same drugs cost less to United States government agencies, managed care buyers and, to a lesser degree, people who get discounts through mail-order pharmacies and discount drug cards like ones offered through the retiree organization AARP. 
"We are trying to make a contribution to easing some of the divides" between wealthy and poor Americans, Dr. Vasella said.
Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of Health and Human Services, said Novartis was "offering an innovative solution" to make prescription drugs "more accessible to those seniors who cannot afford them." 
"Moving forward," Mr. Thompson said, "it will be necessary for the administration, Congress and the private sector to work together to formulate a more comprehensive solution." 
Consumer advocates and industry analysts said the drug company cards would have little effect. "Only a tiny, tiny portion of the elderly population is likely to avail themselves of such a card," said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, an advocacy group in Washington. 
It is unclear how many people already use Novartis drugs. Novartis products accounted for almost one in four recommendations by doctors to patients over 65 in the last 12 months, according to IMS Health, which collects data about pharmaceutical sales. But Mr. Pollack said only one Novartis product, Miacalcin Nasal Spray for osteoporosis, was among the top 50 drugs used by the elderly in a Families USA survey last year. 
GlaxoSmithKline has only recently begun to send sales people to tell doctors about its drug card program, said David Stout, president of the company's United States unit. He said 3,000 callers to the company had requested applications after a "brief, modest advertising campaign."

HEADLINE: U.S. Figures Show Rate of Productivity Gained in Third Quarter 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
Productivity in the third quarter rose at the fastest pace in more than a year as companies relied on fewer workers to produce goods and services, government figures showed today.
 Productivity, a measure of how much employees produce for every hour worked, increased at a faster-than-expected 2.7 percent annual rate from July through September, compared with a 2.2 percent pace in the previous three months, Labor Department figures showed. Analysts had expected a 2 percent rate of increase in the quarter, when the economy shrank for the first time since 1993. 
 Worker hours fell at a 3.6 percent annual rate in the third quarter, more than at any time since 1991 as companies cut almost 250,000 jobs to save money in an economic slowdown. At the same time, companies installed new systems to improve efficiency.
"The relatively strong rise in productivity attests to firms' desperate efforts to remain price competitive and protect battered profit margins by aggressively cutting back on their work force," said Jade Zelnik, chief economist at Greenwich Capital Markets Inc.
The increase was the largest since a 6.3 percent surge in the second quarter last year, just before the economy started to slow. The third-quarter pace compares with productivity increases that averaged 2.5 percent a year from 1996 to 2000, when the economy grew at an average rate of 4.1 percent.
Unit labor costs, or the amount paid for each unit of production, rose at a 1.8 percent rate in the third quarter, the slowest pace in a year. That compares with a 2.6 percent rate of increase in the second quarter.
In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said that consumer borrowing rose by $3.2 billion in September after a $6.1 billion jump in August and a $2.1 billion decline in July. Even with September's unexpected increase, borrowing has averaged a $1.6 billion increase the past four months, after rising an average $11.8 billion in the first five months of the year.
That is a further sign consumers have cut back their spending. The Commerce Department also reported sales by wholesalers fell more than inventories in September.
Sales declined 1.3 percent, the largest drop since March, after a 0.5 percent increase in August, the Commerce Department said. Inventories fell 0.1 percent, after falling 0.2 percent in August. The decline was the fourth in a row, the longest stretch since March-June 1991, when the country was emerging from a recession.
Productivity lowers the cost of doing business and enables the economy to grow faster than once thought possible without igniting inflation.

HEADLINE: Pakistanis Urge U.S. to Suspend TextileTariffs 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
A two-thirds decline in business from United States companies is forcing apparel and textile concerns in Pakistan to lay off thousands of people and could soon close numerous factories, according to a report released yesterday by a Pakistani trade group. The Pakistani government had previously estimated the decline in orders at closer to 40 percent. 
 The Pakistan Textile and Apparel Group, a coalition of Pakistani clothing manufacturers and buyers for United States companies, issued the report as part of its campaign to encourage the United States to suspend tariffs on their goods. The domestic textile industry bitterly opposes such a move, arguing that the removal of tariffs would cause further job losses in an industry already suffering. 
 Textiles and apparel manufacturing is a crucial industry in Pakistan, as it employs roughly 60 percent of the industrial work force. The United States, which imported $1.9 billion of the industry's goods last year, is Pakistan's biggest customer. Since the United States took its war on terrorism into the region, many American companies, including American Eagle Outfitters and Perry Ellis, have stopped ordering goods.
Rising unemployment in Pakistan could pose political problems for the United States since the nation is a key ally in the effort to rid Afghanistan of Osama bin Laden and his allies.
"Unfortunately, millions of Pakistani workers risk losing their jobs, destabilizing the economy and potentially the entire government, because of the collateral effects of the military activity in neighboring Afghanistan," said Senator Jon Kyl, a Republican from Arizona who supports some trade concessions for Pakistan.
Although the production and shipment of Pakistan products, like yarn and knit polo shirts, continue uninterrupted, many American companies have not placed new orders out of fear that escalating hostilities could interfere with getting the products to market on time. Some companies have also decided to move business because of rising insurance and freight costs.
Reliable statistics on orders in Pakistan are difficult to get because big retailers often buy through third parties. The report released by the Pakistan Textile and Apparel Group is based on a survey earlier this week of 14 big apparel factories in Lahore, Karachi and Faisalabad. Pakistan has 350 factories that make textiles and apparel, according to the group, though many are smaller than the ones surveyed.
The survey showed a 64 percent reduction in orders for clothes that would be made from December through February. Employment in the 14 factories dropped 32 percent, from more than 16,000 a year ago to about 11,000 this week. 
The same group had previously estimated that 18,000 workers had been let go throughout the industry. A New York spokeswoman for the group said the survey suggested that that number had certainly risen, but she did not have a revised nationwide figure.
The group is publicizing the losses to press its case for a suspension of United States tariffs on Pakistani imports, which average 17.5 percent on top of the cost of the orders. 
"Pakistan desperately needs tariff relief for our industry to survive," said Aleema Khan, another spokeswoman for the group, who owns a business in Lahore and represents a number of United States companies that import textiles from Pakistan.
The Bush administration has asked Congress to pass legislation that would allow it to cut tariffs, but the domestic textile industry and its allies in Congress are expected to fight it.
The domestic industry has lost 90,000 jobs in the last 18 months to foreign concerns, according to its Washington lobbying arm, the American Textile Manufacturers Institute.
Ms. Kahn said that Pakistan was not competing with the United States for jobs but was losing business to other nations like Bangladesh, China and Vietnam.
"Giving Pakistan the relief we are seeking will not harm the U.S. textile industry," she said. "It will not create additional business. It will only help bring back the business we had before."

Trade Group Predicts Turnaround in Chip Sales Next Year

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Nov. 7 

 BODY:
The trade association for the semiconductor industry predicted today that the sharpest ever decline in chip sales would turn around next year with 6 percent growth, followed by a full-blown recovery in 2003.
 The forecast by the Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents most chip makers, was more optimistic than several other predictions by independent research firms, which believe the market will grow only slightly at best and shrink 7 percent at worst. 
 The semiconductor association, which is based here, said chip revenue this year would fall 31 percent, to $141 billion, after a record surge in sales pushed the industry up 37 percent in 2000, to $204 billion. The 31-percent decline would nearly double the decline in 1985, the sharpest drop on record, when the market fell 17 percent. 
The association predicted that demand would remain weak in the first half of next year but pick up substantially in the last six months, pushing the market to $150 billion, a 6 percent increase over 2001.
The momentum will carry into 2003 and 2004 with 21 percent growth for each year, the association said.
The recovery is expected in every region of the world. The forecast called for 4 percent growth in the Americas, which slumped 43 percent this year, and 1 percent growth in Europe, which declined 29 percent this year. Asia, which declined 23 percent this year, is expected to lead the surge with 14 percent growth.
The sales of computer chips, the computer brains in everything from personal computers to cell phones to automobiles, are widely seen as a sign of the technology industry's health. While manufacturers of memory chips and networking processors continue to suffer through a terrible slump, chip makers for PC's and wireless devices have seen signs of improvement in recent months, though revenue has lagged because of price wars.
George Scalise, the trade association's president, said makers of PC and wireless chips have largely cleared out their excess inventory and are beginning to see increases in orders. He said his forecasters believed early evidence that consumers would spend about as much money this holiday season as last. More electronics sold means more chips sold.
"We've been through these cycles before, and we know this too shall pass," Mr. Scalise said. "The industry will continue to grow as it has in the past."
But Wall Street analysts and independent research firms varied in their hopes for the extent of the upturn. Several agreed that 2003 would improve dramatically over 2002, by as much as 25 percent. But they questioned whether the industry could improve enough in the second half of next year to offset an expected slow first six months.
"It's very hard to see anything better than flat in '02, because you're starting in a very deep hole," said Mark Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley.
The International Data Corporation, based in Framingham, Mass., has predicted the chip industry would decline by 7 percent in 2002, the first ever consecutive years of shrinking sales. Mario Morales, a senior vice president in the company's semiconductor group, said the number of chips sold would improve, but their average selling prices have decreased so sharply that chip makers would have trouble surpassing their sales, even compared with such a dreary year as this.
"The major impact is really the price erosion we've witnessed over the last couple of quarters, in not only the PC-related markets but also the wireless and network equipment markets," Mr. Morales said.
IC Insights, a research firm based in Scottsdale, Ariz., predicted a 1 percent increase next year. But the company's president, Bill McClean, acknowledged that companies and consumers could take very little prodding to cut back spending on electronics even further.
"If the U.S. economy proves stubborn to interest rate reductions, and people don't feel comfortable spending for one reason or another, we could easily see single-digit negative growth rates next year," he said.

HEADLINE: Global-Warming Talks Gain With Accord on Compliance 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: MARRAKESH, Morocco, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
Government ministers from around the world moved a step closer today to bringing a treaty to combat global warming into force after their officials reached agreement on a crucial sticking point. 
 Ministers were upbeat as they addressed the United Nations talks here to define the terms of the pact that will commit industrialized nations by 2012 to cut their emissions of heat-trapping gases by an average 5 percent below where they stood in 1990. 
 Many were encouraged by a breakthrough in lower-level talks late Tuesday that put in place a system to ensure that countries comply with their pollution targets -- previously seen as a stumbling block that could have sunk the treaty. 
"The progress made thus far is solid and encouraging," the Iranian environment minister, Massoumeh Ebtekar, told the session on behalf of the group of developing countries known as the G77. "The agreement reached last night is indeed a very good outcome," she said.
Whether countries that emit more greenhouse gases than allowed under the so-called Kyoto Protocol of 1997 would face binding sanctions had been a thorny question at recent similar forums, but many delegates said it now seemed settled. 
Environmental groups that had accused Japan, Russia, Canada and Australia of trying to elude a binding sanctions system welcomed the agreement. "Countries now know if they miss their targets there will be consequences," said Jennifer Morgan of the World Wildlife Fund.
Ministers had agreed on the outline of a compliance system at a meeting in Bonn, Germany, in July, but squabbling in Marrakesh over the legal fine print had cast the deal into doubt.
Emphasizing the importance of a climate change treaty, Secretary General Kofi Annan said the Kyoto proposals, which were rejected by the United States in March, were "a victory for multilateralism."
"Indeed, joining forces against global threats to human society and the planet has never been more important," he said in a message read to the conference by an envoy.
The United States faced a barrage of criticism when it pulled out of the treaty saying the Kyoto pollution-cutting requirements for developed countries but not poorer ones would hurt the American economy.
The American under secretary of state for global affairs, Paula J. Dobriansky, gave no hint that Washington would return to the treaty, which President Bush had described as "fatally flawed."
"Our collective long-term objective must be to create a truly global approach that stitches together actions by all countries into a tapestry of national and international cooperation," she told the conference.

HEADLINE: Holiday Air Travel Is Expected to Be Off Sharply 

BYLINE:  By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
Air travel this holiday season is expected to be off sharply, deepening the gloom for airlines that have been desperately cutting fares to try to put more people into airplane seats during what is traditionally the busiest travel period of the year.
 With almost daily reports of new airport security slip-ups, and with repeated and vague government warnings of further terrorist attacks, Americans are showing less interest in venturing far from home over the Thanksgiving holiday, surveys and experts say. For the entire fourth quarter, air travel is projected to be at least 25 percent below last year's levels, according to the Travel Industry Association of America. 
 Estimates scheduled for release today by the AAA automobile club project a 5.9 percent decline from a year ago in the number of Americans planning to make Thanksgiving weekend trips of more than 100 miles from home. Last year, the AAA said that a record 36.8 million Americans made such trips. 
"It looks like the overall number of travelers will decrease, but a greater percentage will be going by car," said Mantill Williams, a spokesman for the AAA. Part of that may be because gasoline prices this year are averaging about 32 cents a gallon lower than last year, he said.
Travel industry officials attribute the likely drop in air travel to both the weakening economy, which has discouraged longer trips, and post-Sept. 11 fears. But the fears are not particularly of becoming a victim of terrorism.
"We find that the much bigger factor is fear of being stranded," said Betsy O'Rourke, the marketing director of the Travel Industry Association of America, which regularly polls travelers. "The feeling is, 'I don't want to get caught too far away from home right now,' " she said.
The apprehension stems mainly from fresh memories of an air system that came to a halt, stranding tens of thousands of travelers on Sept. 11, she said.
"Literally everybody has a story," Ms. O'Rourke said. "They know somebody who was stranded somewhere, or didn't get on a flight."
Domestic airlines, facing losses this year expected to exceed $5 billion industrywide, had hoped that deep, but selective, discount fares could lure Americans back to flying over the holidays. But airline executives have been telling analysts that the strategy has not worked, and that they may abandon fare-cutting soon.
"In my discussions with airline C.E.O.'s, they are saying that any pricing stimulus they have attempted in the last three to five weeks has produced nothing," said Michael Dyment, a partner at Andersen, the financial consulting firm. 
Instead, he said, discounting has simply damaged the airlines' financial performance, because business travelers who would be flying regardless of the fare are paying less. The National Business Travel Association projected this week that the average fares paid by business travelers, which had been rising at near double-digit rates in recent years, would increase only about 3 percent in 2002.
The picture still could improve, of course, if fare sales prompt Americans to make last-minute holiday travel plans; not just airlines, but hotels, restaurants and related businesses are still hoping they will.
In the meantime, airlines are trying to assure customers that airports are not as chaotic and inconvenient as many suppose. Northwest Airlines, for example, said this week that it had streamlined boarding procedures, even with tighter security, and now advises that travelers arrive at the airport 90 minutes before flight time, instead of the two hours that had been recommended.
Additionally, the F.A.A. said yesterday that it was hiring and training several hundred temporary security workers to augment its force of about 850 airport security agents, about half of whom are deployed at check-in areas. Rebecca Trexler, a spokeswoman for the agency, said the new employees should be on duty before Thanksgiving.
Robert L. Crandall, the retired chief executive of American Airlines, said that this year's holiday travel numbers ought not be given much weight as a measure of the long-term health of the airline business.
"It's still too close to Sept. 11," he said. "There are no indicators in the short term that have any prognosticating value for the long term. We're all in a state of crisis, and what happens this Thanksgiving or Christmas, I don't think has anything to do with what's going to happen in 2002 and the years beyond that."
Ms. O'Rourke, the travel trade group executive, said that she saw "more good news than bad news" in poll data, for example, showing that the number of Americans who now say they are afraid to get on an airplane is about 7 percent, virtually unchanged from before Sept. 11. 
For those who are traveling by car, train, bus or on shorter flights, she added, bargains abound as hotels and other destinations have begun promoting packages to entice Thanksgiving travelers who want to stay closer to home.
Some hotel companies say those tactics are paying off.
"Locations that are dependent on airlines to deliver their customers are having a difficult time, but locations where they get a lot of driving traffic are actually doing quite well," said Bruce Wolff, the senior vice president for global sales at Marriott International.

To the Editor:
The report that overtime earnings as a result of the World Trade Center attack will lead to a record number of police retirements (front page, Nov. 2) could be turned into a blessing by the new mayor. In the 1990's the size of the Police Department was greatly increased, and crime decreased. 
 But crime decreased everywhere in the 1990's, even where the number of police officers stayed the same. Although politicians and the police took credit, the crime drop was probably due mostly to the Supreme Court. Twelve years after the court decided that abortion was legal, crime started dropping and kept dropping for a decade. 
 Crime has leveled off. But the economic boom is over, and the city is left with a police department that is bloated and wasteful, as can be seen from the daily activity records of individual officers. A wave of resignations might be perfect for a city that needs to re-examine its expenditures.

HEADLINE: Johnnie Cochran to Head Business Zone 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., the lawyer who gained national prominence by successfully defending O. J. Simpson against murder charges, has been named chairman of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, the economic development organization that has been administering $250 million in federal, state and city funds in Harlem, Washington Heights and Inwood.
 Mr. Cochran, 63, was the choice of United States Representative Charles B. Rangel, the powerful Harlem Democrat, to succeed the current chairman, Richard D. Parsons, the vice chairman of AOL Time Warner. The zone's governing board approved the nomination Oct. 22. Mr. Rangel described Mr. Cochran in a statement as "visionary when it comes to community and economic empowerment." 
 Mr. Cochran, whose recent clients have included Sean Combs, the rap mogul, and Abner Louima, who was tortured by the police, is a popular figure in Harlem, and his involvement in the empowerment zone may help allay concerns in the neighborhood that the program has done more to help big developers and national retailers than small businesses. Mr. Rangel has often been at odds with city and state representatives who have veto power, along with him, over how the empowerment zone money is spent.
But critics of Mr. Cochran's selection said they wondered if he had the time to devote to the empowerment zone. In recent years, he has built the nation's largest plaintiffs' law practice, with 10 offices around the country and more than 100 lawyers. His appointment takes effect early next year, he said.
Mr. Cochran said he would be his own man. "If you know anything about me," he said, "you know I'm pretty independent. I very often speak up and fight the status quo."
Mr. Cochran has also not endeared himself to those who were appalled by the racial overtones of the Simpson defense and who disapprove of his close relationship with the Rev. Al Sharpton. But Jim Capel, Mr. Rangel's chief of staff, said Mr. Cochran had "one persona in terms of being a lawyer and another in terms of being chairman of the board," and would be able to keep these roles separate.
Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington, the city's representative on the empowerment zone board, refused yesterday to discuss Mr. Cochran's new position. State officials did not return a call requesting comment.
Mr. Cochran said yesterday that he spends about half of his time in New York, where he has an apartment on West 57th Street. He still votes in Los Angeles, where he was raised. His parents moved there from Shreveport, La., when he was 6. Acknowledging that he is something of an outsider, he said, "Maybe because of that I bring a fresh approach."
He said he planned to get very involved in the empowerment zone, despite his busy schedule. "My mother had a saying," he said. " 'If you want to get something done, give it to a busy person.' "

House Committee Approves Measure to Aid Insurance Industry in Terrorist Attacks

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
Congress edged closer to aiding the insurance industry tonight when a House committee voted to promise insurers billions of dollars in loans in the event of any large terrorist attacks next year.
 The measure, approved by a voice vote of the Finance Services Committee, would generally provide loans to the industry to cover 90 percent of terrorism costs greater than $1 billion. For attacks causing more than $20 billion in losses, the bill would impose a special assessment on insurance policyholders to help defray the costs. House Republicans said they had decided to adopt a one-year measure now and advance a longer-term plan next year. 
 Democrats on the committee failed in efforts to raise the amount of money the insurance industry would have to pay before the government offered any assistance. The Democrats said tonight that they would continue trying to raise this amount in the full House. A measure being prepared in the Senate would offer assistance only after the insurance industry paid the first $10 billion in claims from any terrorist attack next year.
The bill the committee approved this evening would protect smaller insurers that face big claims and would give the industry tax breaks to encourage it to build up reserves for terrorism coverage. It also protects the insurers from punitive damages in any lawsuits arising from terrorist attacks.
Bush administration officials and industry executives say that to avert an economic crisis Congress must adopt the legislation before adjourning shortly.
The world's leading reinsurance companies, which provide insurance to primary insurers, have said they intend to stop covering losses from terrorist attacks as 70 percent of insurance contracts come up for renewal at the end of the year. Without adequate coverage, banks and other lenders say they will stop providing credit for major construction projects and corporate equipment purchases. 
Though a consensus has emerged in Congress that quick action must be taken, there is wide disagreement about the details. Although competing measures provide different kinds of federal relief, they all take the first step of putting the federal government into a new supervisory role over the insurance industry. 
The House legislation sidestepped some lawmakers' concern about a Senate plan endorsed by the Bush administration. That proposal would rely on the federal treasury to bear the costs of any large-scale attack. 
"Unlike other approaches that have been suggested by the Senate and the administration, the bill that I and 30 other bipartisan members introduced is clearly a backstop, not a bailout," said Representative Michael G. Oxley, the Ohio Republican who heads the House Financial Services Committee. "We are providing a helping hand-up, by creating immediate federal assistance in the aftermath of another terrorist attack, but not a hand-out, by demanding that every dollar of American taxpayer assistance ultimately be repaid."
But Democrats and industry experts say the House plan will not do enough to keep insurance premium rates down in the same way the Senate plan might. Some lawmakers were also critical of the tax breaks that the House bill would give the industry.
"While the proposal purports to recover money from industry, it also provides the industry with a long-term subsidy which could well exceed what it pays," said Representative John J. LaFalce of New York, the ranking Democrat on the Financial Services Committee. He said the proposal "could actually impede the re-emergence of the private market" for terrorism insurance.
Prospects remain uncertain for the completion of a bill before Congress adjourns. The Senate measure has stalled over a jurisdictional squabble among three committees.
The Senate bill, being prepared by senior Democrats and Republicans on the Senate banking committee, would require the industry to pay for $10 billion in insurance claims before the government intervened. The government would pay 90 percent of losses that exceeded $10 billion.
But the legislation has been bogged down in a dispute over its limitations on the civil liability of insurers. Senator Ernest F. Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat who heads the Commerce Committee, has indicated his interest in possibly introducing a rival measure.
None of the measures under consideration would provide money for any losses from the attacks of Sept. 11. Experts estimate those attacks could cost the industry more than $40 billion.

HEADLINE: No Joy in Mudville, as Twins Are Near Striking Out 

BYLINE:  By JOHN W. FOUNTAIN 

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
There is no epitaph for baseball here yet. But if there was any handwriting on the wall for Minnesota Twins fans on the day after Major League Baseball owners voted to cut the 30 professional teams by two, it read: Baseball is dead.
 While the owners may not decide for several weeks which of the financially weakest teams will die, the Twins, along with the Montreal Expos, are on the short lists of most baseball experts. And so on a somber day across the Twin Cities, the fans mourned. 
 Some reminisced, while others cursed or huffed. Still others choked up as they recalled fond memories of the days that eventually turned into years of watching baseball while eating a hot dog, sipping on a Coke and cracking peanuts at the old ballpark.
"This is something I'm really struggling with," said Tom Montbriand, a sales representative for a local sign company who was inside the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, which the Twins have called home for the last two decades, on business this afternoon.
"Growing up in a family of five boys and a sports-crazed dad, we really loved the Minnesota teams. So it's not easy," he said of the potential demise of the Twins.
Mr. Montbriand has not missed a Twins home opener since 1966. He grew up just three blocks from Metropolitan Stadium, where the team played for 20 years after moving from Washington in 1961. He started going to games with his father at age 5, Mr. Montbriand said. He is 41 now with children of his own: a son Joshua, 6, and a daughter, Taylor, 7.
"I'd like them to enjoy a lot of things that I was able to enjoy when I was a young child going to a game with my dad," Mr. Montbriand said. "They'll be missing out on that."
There seemed few, if any, people here who were holding onto any thread of hope, most considering it a done deal that the Twins are one of the two teams headed for extinction, although the Oakland Athletics and both Florida teams -- the Marlins in Miami and the Devil Rays in St. Petersburg -- are other possible candidates.
Commissioner Bud Selig said that elimination of two of the 30 major league teams was necessary for economic reasons. Contraction will mean two fewer teams for owners to subsidize through their revenue-sharing plan as well as two fewer teams to share national television revenue.
In the case of the Twins, the owner, Carl H. Pohlad, has wanted to get out of baseball for some time, and would probably get more money from Major League Baseball than he would from selling the team to someone else. The Twins have had a difficult time filling the Metrodome in recent years, although attendance picked up this year when the team made a strong, but ultimately unsuccessful, run for the division title. They last won the World Series 10 years ago.
Most fans echoed Mr. Montbriand's sentiments.
"With everything that's gone on over the last few months, the way our world has changed, there's been definitely no guarantees for anything," said Steve Oslund, 32, a maintenance worker at the Metrodome, who added that he worried about being able to keep his job if the Twins disappear.
"I feel sorry for a lot of people I know that are going to be out of work, good people that have got families and everything," he said. "I'm a little sad." 
"It's going to be painful for us, but yet, for the team it's going to be hard," added Mr. Oslund, sitting inside the stadium, which has undergone its seasonal metamorphosis from baseball stadium to football field for the Minnesota Vikings.
"Bud Selig says it's not going to be a sad day. I don't know what the hell he's thinking," Mr. Oslund said. 
Co-worker Darrell Nomeland, piped in. 
"You know what he's thinking: 'All right you guys, come on and give us a hundred-million dollars or we're going to shut you down,' " Mr. Nomeland said. "Those guys don't care about baseball. It's the bottom line." 
"It's the almighty dollar," Mr. Oslund said. "That's what it's all about."
For fans here, there was plenty to be said today about the death of baseball, of an end to warm summer evenings under the glow of stadium lights, the smell of beer wafting through the stadium, the cry of "hot dogs," "peanuts" or "Cracker Jack." At restaurants and bars and on the airwaves, the idea that the Twins may be history has begun settling in like winter cold.
At the Dome Souvenir Shop, a family-run business near the Metrodome, the owner, Ray Crump, mourned the team's expected demise. Mr. Crump, 65, has followed the Twins for decades, dating to the days when he earned 50 cents a game as a batboy for the team when they were the Washington Senators and later as equipment manager for the team when it moved in to Minnesota, and Mr. Crump moved with it.
"It's a sad day. I have one guy in particular who has been coming to my store since 1986, and he's come to every Sunday game since 1986 and all he does is live for baseball," Mr. Crump said. 
So does Mr. Crump, who also runs a fluorescent-lighted establishment adjacent to his souvenir shop named, "The Original Baseball Hall of Fame Museum of Minnesota." It is a long narrow room filled with glass-encased World Series bats, baseballs and Twins memorabilia that on game days draws fans in droves.
"I'm going to miss it," Mr. Crump said, sounding resigned. "It's my life."

HEADLINE: THE 2001 ELECTIONS: THE GOVERNOR-ELECT; 
McGreevey Warns of Tough Fiscal Future in New Jersey

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

DATELINE: WOODBRIDGE, N.J., Nov. 7 

 BODY:
Governor-elect James E. McGreevey exulted today in his victory over Bret D. Schundler and thanked voters for their support at his first post-election news conference. But he also issued a stark warning about the tough fiscal situation that he and the newly elected state legislators will face when they take office.
 "Santa isn't coming to the State Legislature with Christmas tree lists this year," he said. "We need to cut back. We need to be fiscally responsible. We need to live within our means." 
 Mr. McGreevey looked pale and had dark rings under his eyes as he faced a bevy of microphones and television cameras in the council chambers at Town Hall here today. But if he was thoroughly exhausted, he was also downright giddy. "A nonpartial crowd," he joked, as supporters, campaign staff members and Woodbridge municipal employees loudly applauded his arrival. "Where were you guys four years ago?" 
Mr. McGreevey first ran for governor four years ago, losing to Gov. Christie Whitman. On the day after that election, a disappointed Mr. McGreevey vowed to run again. Today, he happily deflected questions about his transition plans and about the potential makeup of his cabinet. He cheerfully conveyed his "heartfelt gratitude" to voters. He smiled as he reported that his pregnant wife, Dina, who remains hospitalized with complications, "is doing incredibly well and the baby is healthy and all things are moving forward." And he laughed about his plans to invite his Irish relatives from around the world to a reunion at Drumthwacket, the governor's residence.
But he also fielded a barrage of questions that highlighted the tough challenges that lie ahead: a looming deficit of perhaps $1.5 billion, ballooning state debt, a stalled economy, ongoing terrorist threats, the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, sky-high property taxes and auto insurance rates and a struggling public school system. Not to mention the perils of Trenton, a state capital filled with internecine rivalries, some of which have only been inflamed by the Democrats' return to power.
On the state's impending budget problems, Mr. McGreevey said again that he would not raise taxes. "I guess I'll answer this question for the 400th time," he said. "I am committed to having a government living within its means. And it will be necessary to make difficult decisions." Asked specifically about taxes, he replied, "Oh, I am ruling out a tax increase." And he promised a thorough review of state spending. 
"Yes, there will be cuts," he said. "And I am committed for New Jersey state government to being operated in a cost-effective, fiscally conservative and responsible manner, and we will have to make difficult decisions. But again, it's a 5,000-plus line item budget. It will be an agonizing reappraisal of what government should do and, perhaps more importantly, what government ought not be doing." 
Mr. McGreevey said that he had already been in touch with Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco and that he hoped for a good working relationship in the Republicans' final months after eight years of control. Mr. McGreevey said he would meet with Mr. DiFrancesco this week and would consult with him on many issues, including New Jersey's role in the cleanup and recovery from the attack on the World Trade Center and the state's claim to federal aid as part owner of the trade center. 
Mr. McGreevey also said that he hoped that Mr. DiFrancesco and the Republicans would not complete a deal for a new sports arena in Newark, so that he could do it. "Clearly my preference is to move forward on the arena subsequent to the inauguration," he said. "We need to ensure the sole exposure is to the bondholders, not to the taxpayers." And he repeated earlier criticisms that an arena deal by Republicans that failed this summer had been a "billion-dollar porkfest." 
But several Republican officials said, by contrast, that the best situation for Mr. McGreevey would be for the arena deal to be completed before he took office and that, in fact, his comments might have been intended to move the deal along.
Even before the arena issue resurfaces, Mr. McGreevey will be forced to confront a battle for the speaker's position in the soon-to-be Democrat-controlled State Assembly. 
"We need to achieve consensus," Mr. McGreevey said today, adding that he would become involved in the dispute only if legislators requested his involvement. His aides said he was in fact hoping to broker a deal to prevent a battle between the Democratic minority leader, Joseph V. Doria Jr. of Bayonne, and Joseph J. Roberts Jr. of Camden. Mr. McGreevey declined to say whom he preferred. "I would look forward to developing consensus with all of the members," he said.
At the outset of his news conference Mr. McGreevey said he would not answer questions about who would be appointed to his administration. "As to transition, we will be making announcements next week," he said. But the rumor mill, of course, was churning wildly among Democrats, and aides to Mr. McGreevey said some appointments were virtually certain. For example, Gary Taffet, Mr. McGreevey's longtime chief of staff in Woodbridge, is expected to have the same job at the State House, they said. 
In addition to the news conference, Mr. McGreevey met with his campaign staff members to thank them and spent much of his day at the hospital with his wife, aides said. 
Throughout today's news conference, Mr. McGreevey spoke of the gravity of his responsibilities as governor, particularly in relation to education issues and antiterrorism measures. "I appreciated the campaign and the excitement of last night," he said. But he also talked about "the seriousness of the mission at hand" and "the need to tackle serious security issues, working in concert with the Office of Emergency Management, working in concert with the Department of Health."
To voters, he said: "I will continue to work hard to earn your trust every day. I will work at this job with every ounce of energy and every fiber of my being."
Mr. McGreevey also said he had sought during the campaign to outline proposals without making too many promises. "I think we made very clear specific commitments, particularly regarding the quality of public education," he said. "Yet we were also steadfast to ensure that we did not commit financial resources to initiatives which could not be sustained, particularly during these economic times."
But even as he stressed the serious work ahead, Mr. McGreevey clearly could not suppress his giddiness over fulfilling a longtime dream and being elected New Jersey's 51st governor. Dressed in his familiar navy suit and red, white and blue tie, Mr. McGreevey also displayed his trademark self-deprecating humor as he described plans to move with his wife from their condo in Woodbridge to the executive mansion in Princeton.
"Dina and I will be moving to Drumthwacket," he said. "And we will be immeasurably lowering the lineage of Princeton and the Princeton community." He also said one of his dreams was to hold a reunion for his Irish relatives from all around the world at the mansion. As for neighbors, he said, "I can see them saying, 'There goes the neighborhood.' " 

How the Polls Were Conducted
The Election Day polls were based on questionnaires completed by voters as they left voting stations throughout New York City and New Jersey on Tuesday. Questionnaires in New York City were available in English or Spanish.
The poll was conducted by Edison Media Research of Somerville, N.J.
The results are based on 1,608 voters in New York City and 1,718 voters in New Jersey, located in 40 randomly selected districts in each place. 
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results should differ by no more than plus or minus three percentage points from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all voters who turned out in New York City or New Jersey yesterday. 
Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential sampling error. 
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on Election Day, such as the reluctance of some voters to take time to fill out the questionnaire, may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: Head of Troubled New York Academy of Sciences Is Resigning in Policy Rift 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS OVERBYE 

 BODY:
The New York Academy of Sciences announced yesterday that its president and chief executive, Rodney W. Nichols, would leave at the end of the year. Mr. Nichols's efforts to reshape the academy, including closing its award-winning magazine The Sciences and putting its elegant headquarters on East 63rd Street up for sale, roiled the institution in recent months.
 In his letter of resignation, given to the board of governors last Thursday, Mr. Nichols, a physicist and former executive vice president at Rockefeller University, said that he had served for almost a decade and "I believe it is time for me to pursue new goals." In an interview he said he had been mulling over the move for a year for a variety of reasons, including the fear that the criticism and resentment he was encountering were hurting the academy. "I'm more of a distraction to the continuation of the process of renewal and modernization," he said. 
 The academy, founded in 1817, is the city's oldest scientific organization, including Thomas Jefferson and Charles Darwin as former members. It is known worldwide for its work on human rights for scientists in foreign countries, for its scholarly publications and for holding groundbreaking scientific conferences on subjects like AIDS and women in science.
Dr. Torsten N. Wiesel, a neurobiologist and former president of Rockefeller University who took over as chairman late in September, called Mr. Nichols's resignation a big surprise. "He has played a major role in helping the organization renew and modernize its mission of serving science, technology and society," Dr. Wiesel said in a statement.
Under Mr. Nichols the academy began projects like science education, technology and the economy, and pollution in New York Harbor, and took steps towards raising an endowment, which it has never had.
Others close to the academy, however, said that a rift had developed between Mr. Nichols and some board members over the purpose of the academy and its finances.
Mr. Nichols's critics said that he was turning the academy into a think tank, instead of a forum where scientists could meet and talk. "Scientists in the academy -- and the academy is for the scientists -- disagreed with him," said Dr. Fleur L. Strand, a former president of the academy and professor of biology at New York University.
The academy has been in trouble, all agree. In recent years its membership has declined from about 42,000 worldwide to about 28,000. It traditionally operated as a confederation of so-called sections organized along specialties like chemistry or anthropology. But this summer Mr. Nichols announced that the sections would be disbanded in favor of interdisciplinary forums.
The proposed sale of the mansion, which many agree the academy has outgrown, nevertheless struck a sour note with many academy members who regard it as a symbol.
Dr. Wiesel said it was unlikely that The Sciences, which had won seven National Magazine Awards, would be revived soon, calling its cancellation a fiscal decision. In searching for a replacement for Mr. Nichols, he said he wanted to keep in mind the needs of the New York area's scientists.
"It's important that they see this as a home for scientists," he said.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
From a Room With a View, Going to Bat for Parks

BYLINE:  By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
HOW often is it that a New Yorker gets a chance to work in a charming old building that looks like a medieval fortress, and from an office window, can hear sea lions barking for their chow three times a day?
 David Rivel is in this fanciful situation. He's the new executive director of the City Parks Foundation, a nonprofit group that raises money to restore neighborhood parks. He is found on a recent afternoon behind his tidy desk in the group's second-floor office in the Arsenal in Central Park, also the home of the New York City Parks and Recreation Department. It overlooks the Children's Zoo, hence the barking sea lions. 
 "Some people call them seals, but they're sea lions," he says knowledgeably, seemingly into the groove of his environs after one month on the job.
On the surface, Mr. Rivel, 40, is rather dry, a bit stiff -- not exactly your fanciful type. That is, until you get him talking about Jerry Lewis films -- his undergraduate thesis at Wesleyan University analyzed the comedian's directing career -- or razz him about his nom de parc, Sturgeon, bestowed by the parks commissioner, Henry J. Stern, in honor of Mr. Rivel's grandfather who founded the famous Murray's Sturgeon Shop on the Upper West Side. (Every park employee or park friend gets a moniker. "It's Henry's thing," Mr. Rivel says.)
He readily admits he is not a "parkie," one of those folks who can gab endlessly about wetlands and distinguish among tree species. "I don't know anything about that stuff."
But Mr. Stern, who created the foundation in 1989 while serving under Mayor Edward I. Koch, considers him a full-fledged member of the park family. Mr. Rivel was even presented with a little gold pin that says "Sturgeon" to wear on his jacket pocket. "He may not wear it for you; some of the new people are a little self-conscious," Mr. Stern says. The commissioner is also aware of Mr. Rivel's other strengths. "He's supposed to be a fund-raiser and a team player, so we look forward to working with him."
The other day, Mr. Rivel was pondering the task ahead of him now, after six years as president of the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music. He is credited with steering the music school from being near financial collapse to having an endowment of $1.5 million, a $300,000 scholarship fund and a $2.4 million renovation of its main building in Park Slope. He assumed the leadership there after a vice presidency at Lincoln Center.
Slightly built with a trim, graying beard, Mr. Rivel leans back, hands clasped behind his head. He has an almost scholarly air as he talks about the role of parks. For one thing, he sees them as healing places.
"Look at what happened after the tragedy of Sept. 11," he says. "Everyone went to the parks. I went to Union Square. Parks are those communal places where people can come together and share experiences. They've always been that way, but every once in a while something happens to make you realize that."
Mr. Rivel's office has few personal touches. He's kept the autographed posters left by his predecessor, Deborah Landau, of one the foundation's biggest programs, Central Park SummerStage, the music festival in the park's Rumsey Playfield.
He says his biggest challenge is getting a handle on all the programs under the auspices of the foundation, which has an annual budget of $15 million. They include one of the biggest youth tennis programs in the nation, as well as programs to help public schools grow gardens and to mobilize community groups to improve their parks.
As Mr. Rivel talks about the community mobilization initiative, started in 1995, you can tell his juices are flowing. "It grew out of the realization that wealthy parks will be just fine, and what do we do about other parks? We try to organize communities to support their parks so there's a built-in constituency."
Mr. Rivel, who grew up in Weston, Conn., describes himself as an old-fashioned liberal. His father owns a market research company, and his mother used to run a cooking store and school. He met his wife, Laura, in an antinuclear group in Chelsea in 1986. They bonded when they were arrested at a protest on Staten Island. She now runs a program for teenage parents and their children in Queens. The couple, who have a 12-year-old daughter, Hannah, live in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn.
On this windy, cool afternoon, Mr. Rivel decides to tool uptown through Central Park in a dark green van, passing joggers, a wedding party, swirling leaves on manicured lawns. He wants to meet some staff members for the first time in Marcus Garvey Park near 125th Street in Harlem.
THE leafy retreat is one of five major parks, including Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn and Crotona Park in the Bronx, that his group has intensified efforts to spruce up. "The foundation can play a role in making sure that every park looks like Central Park," he says.
The foundation now produces summer concerts in the Harlem park. It has contributed to the hiring of a gardener and bought computers for the recreation center. Soon, it hopes to fix the broken footpaths that wind all the way up to the park's watch tower.
There's a long way to go, but Mr. Rivel is optimistic. In the golden shadows of dusk, he is beaming, watching two uniformed schoolgirls cut a path through the park. "It's part of their community now. It's not the thing they walk around and avoid because it's a horrible place."

Baseball Is Now Waiting for the Sale of Two Teams

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
As intriguing as Major League Baseball's decision to eliminate two teams is, so are the ongoing negotiations for the sale of two other teams, one of them to an owner whose team is No. 1 on the contraction list.
 In fact, word circulating among baseball executives yesterday was that the primary reason Commissioner Bud Selig has declined to identify the teams to be eliminated is that he is waiting for the results of those negotiations for the sale of the Florida Marlins and the Anaheim Angels. 
 Jeffrey Loria, owner of the Montreal Expos, is negotiating to buy the Marlins from John Henry, and Henry is negotiating to buy the Angels from the Walt Disney Company. Selig denied yesterday that those talks are having any impact on his disclosure of the two teams he says will be eliminated before next season. 
"That's not true," Selig said. "It's not even close. Those are unrelated."
Selig said after the 28-2 vote at the owners meeting on Tuesday that the teams would not be identified until negotiations with them are completed. 
"We have so many details to work out," he said yesterday.
There was no further word from the Players Association on contraction yesterday. Given the angry reaction by Donald Fehr, its executive director, the union will certainly challenge the owners' plans through the grievance procedure. The union, if it chooses, can also try to block contraction by refusing to approve the new schedule that the owners would have to produce after eliminating two teams. 
Representatives of the union and the owners are scheduled to meet in Manhattan today. The owners maintain that they do not have to negotiate contraction with the union, but they acknowledge that they have to negotiate the effects of contraction, like the distribution of players to other teams.
The prevailing belief among baseball executives is that the Expos and the Minnesota Twins will be those teams. But the high-powered game of musical owners is just as intriguing as the idea that baseball will shed teams.
Loria, an international art dealer who lives in New York, would prefer to move the Expos, perhaps to northern Virginia, but Selig will not permit relocation now. Loria wants to remain in baseball, so his alternative is to buy another team. He would not talk about that alternative yesterday. "I have no comment on any of that," he said.
Henry, an investment entrepreneur who lives in South Florida, has been unsuccessful in his efforts to gain public funding for a new park for the Marlins and has said he cannot fund a stadium by himself while also maintaining a large-enough payroll to have a competitive team.
So he is trying to buy the Angels from Disney, which wants to sell. But two executives said yesterday that Disney is asking for more money than Henry has offered.
Efforts to reach Henry by telephone were unsuccessful. Tim Mead, an Angels spokesman, said Tony Tavares, the club's president, has acknowledged that Henry was interested in buying the Angels. He also quoted Tavares as saying that Disney would discuss the sale of the club with any owner who was involved in contraction as well as any other potential buyer.
The Angels, however, are proceeding with plans for the 2002 season as if Disney will still be the team's owner.
The delay in identifying the teams to be eliminated prompted speculation ascribing two different motives to the plan.
One theory has Selig trying to panic state legislatures in Minnesota and Florida into finding funding for new stadiums for the Twins and the Marlins. If the legislators think a team from their state could disappear, they might act quickly in reversing their opposition to using public money for new parks.
The other theory has Selig using contraction as a negotiating weapon. That idea has the commissioner threatening to eliminate 50 major league jobs but withdrawing the threat if the players make the kind of economic concessions the owners will seek in talks to replace the collective bargaining agreement that expired at midnight last night.
"This is not meant to do anything other than what we in the industry believe we have to do," Selig said in denying those alleged motives.
Asked if contraction was a negotiating ploy, the commissioner said: "It is not a negotiating ploy. I said before that I think this is something that has to do with the number of franchises that can't produce enough revenue to be competitive. There isn't anything in their past, present or future that indicates we can solve that problem."
Is it possible that Selig and the owners will change their minds and not eliminate the teams before the 2002 season? "We have every intention of doing it," Selig said.
Agents, meanwhile, began grumbling yesterday about the difficulty they will face in determining which teams to begin negotiating with for clients who are free agents. Those players can begin signing with new teams Nov. 20. 
"We have to move as expeditiously as possible," Selig said, acknowledging the need to complete contraction plans so that clubs and players can get on with their business.

Man Indicted In Fake Threat Of Anthrax

BYLINE:  By JANE FRITSCH 

 BODY:
Nixon B. Saldanha of Bombay had had enough of New York and wanted to return to India. But he could not afford the plane fare, prosecutors said yesterday, so he tried to get himself deported.
 First, he called 911 about 10 days ago to complain that someone had thrown an envelope full of something at him, officials said. He had hoped to be arrested for filing a false report, they said, but the police never responded to the call. 
 On Friday, however, Mr. Saldanha, 30, who has been living in Jackson Heights, Queens, got plenty of attention when, investigators said, he told a member of the National Guard outside Grand Central Terminal that he had found two envelopes that appeared to contain anthrax.
Mr. Saldanha was indicted yesterday by a federal grand jury in Manhattan on charges that he made false statements to federal officials in connection with an anthrax hoax. If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 or more.
The incident occurred about 11 p.m. on Friday, after a National Guardsman had completed work at the site of the World Trade Center and was waiting near the terminal for a ride, according to the indictment. Mr. Saldanha approached him with two envelopes, one addressed to Tom Brokaw, the NBC News anchor, and the other addressed to "Editor, New York Post," investigators said.
Mr. Saldanha told the guardsman that he had found the envelopes on top of a nearby telephone booth, the indictment said. Concerned about the possibility of anthrax, the guardsman told Mr. Saldanha to put the envelopes on the ground, and contacted the Metropolitan Transportation Authority police.
The envelopes were removed by hazardous-material specialists and were sent to the City Department of Health for analysis.
Meanwhile, F.B.I. agents interviewed Mr. Saldanha. They said Mr. Saldanha told them that he had found the envelopes. Later, he told a different story to detectives from the Joint Terrorist Task Force, the indictment said.
He told the detectives that he had come to the United States in June 1999 on a visitor's visa. He had attended community college and worked, but had been unemployed since August and wanted to go home.
So, he told the detectives, in late October he decided to find a way to get arrested so that he would be deported. After his 911 call got no response, he downloaded copies of anthrax-tainted letters from a news organization's Web site, prepared similar letters, then sealed them in envelopes along with talcum powder, the indictment said.
Mr. Saldanha is to be brought before a magistrate in Federal District Court in Manhattan today. Investigators said his wish to be deported might be fulfilled -- after a stay in a federal prison. JANE FRITSCH

HEADLINE: 1,400 Layoffs Are Planned At Waterford Wedgwood 

BYLINE:  By BRIAN LAVERY 

DATELINE: DUBLIN, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
Waterford Wedgwood, the Irish luxury goods conglomerate, will cut 1,400 of its 10,000 jobs worldwide in response to slumping sales, which started falling from record highs in July and are now down 4.5 percent from last year.
 After additional restructuring of its retailing and manufacturing, the company said, the changes will add 43 million euros ($38 million) to company profits, for a charge of 60 million euros ($54 million). 
 Since Waterford Wedgwood's only chance to bolster sales figures lies in the coming holiday season, the company simultaneously increased its marketing budget 15 percent. 
It also unveiled a new advertising campaign that uses images of warmth and comfort for "a focus on family and friendship, what the Americans call 'cocooning,' " in line with post-Sept. 11 consumer trends, the chief executive, Redmond O'Donoghue said. New television ads will start immediately in the United States, where Waterford Wedgwood does 44 percent of its business.
"In spite of all of these events, gift giving will go on," he said. "People want to celebrate births, anniversaries, graduations, and we have the brands to help them do that."
September's terrorist attacks hurt luxury goods manufacturers in two ways because they curtailed tourist travel as well as regular consumer spending. Vacationers are the most reliable buyers of high-end products, even in regular department stores, Mr. O'Donoghue said. In Ireland, the second-biggest market for the Waterford brand of crystal, the number of tourists from the United States is expected to fall from a million in 2001 to half that number in 2002.
More than 1,100 of the company's layoffs will be at manufacturing operations in Britain, although 100 workers will lose their jobs at the company's flagship crystal plant in Waterford, Ireland. It will also close 40 of its British retail outlets, with the loss of 400 jobs.
Mr. O'Donoghue moved today from chief operating officer to group chief executive, a change that formalized his role overseeing the group's four component companies. A familiar name, Tony O'Reilly Jr., rose to chief executive of the Wedgwood ceramics division. Mr. O'Reilly's father is Sir Anthony O'Reilly, the Irish billionaire and media magnate, who holds a controlling interest in Waterford Wedgwood.
Mr. O'Donoghue took a bullish long-term view today, sticking to Waterford Wedgwood's commitment to double last year's record annual revenues by 2005. American sales have been hurt the most in recent months, but luxury goods are still selling well even in recession-hit areas like Japan, where Waterford Wedgwood licenses its brand.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Lose Momentum And Give Up Sharp Gains

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks slipped yesterday, eroding the previous session's sharp gains, as worries about the gloomy economic environment overshadowed hopes the Federal Reserve's rate cuts can help spur a rebound.
 "You get these fights with the bulls and the bears," said James Volk, co-director of institutional trading at D. A. Davidson & Company. "There are a number of people that are bullish about the economy turning around and there's another group that think there's no reason for this buoyancy in the market because it's still way, way premature." 
 The market initially built on Tuesday's rally when the Fed's 10th interest-rate cut this year sent stocks soaring to their highest levels in about two months. But momentum faded toward the end of yesterday's session.
"We had a big run up yesterday after the Fed announcement," said Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray & Company. "The announcement was expected, but the run-up wasn't, so we're just giving up a little bit of ground on that."
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index, buffeted early in the session by disappointing results and a discouraging forecast from the wireless telecommunications company Qualcomm, finished with a gain of 2.45 points, or 0.1 percent, at 1,837.53.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 36.75 points, or 0.4 percent, to 9,554.37. At its session high of 9,644.12, the blue-chip index had erased all of its post-Sept. 11 losses.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.06 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,115.80.
Shares of Hewlett-Packard dragged on the Dow after the company and Compaq Computer stood firm on their plans for a $21 billion merger, even as pressure mounted from Hewlett and Packard family members to cancel the deal.
Hewlett shares slipped 63 cents, to $19.18. The stock gained more than 17 percent Tuesday after the founding Hewlett family, which has a stake of more than 5 percent in Hewlett-Packard, said it would vote against the deal. Compaq's stock sagged 51 cents, to $7.99. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday as investors speculated rising worker productivity will keep inflation in check, giving the Federal Reserve room to follow Tuesday's interest-rate cut with another in December.
"Productivity gains and lower labor costs indicate there's the possibility for growth, so we can keep lowering short-term interest rates without worrying about inflation," said James Cusser, who manages about $1 billion at Waddell & Reed in Overland Park, Kan. 
The 10-year Treasury note rose 19/32 , to a price of 106 17/32 .
The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.18 percent from 4.26 percent on Tuesday. The yield was the lowest it has been since Oct. 5, 1998.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 31/32 , to 109 5/32 . The bond's yield fell to 4.79 percent from 4.85 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Slow Lane to Kmart's Recovery; 
Consumers Turn Frugal and Many Suppliers Discontent

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
When Charles C. Conaway strode into Troy, Mich., 18 months ago to take over the sagging Kmart Corporation, he had big plans. Not only did he intend to revive Kmart, the nation's No. 2 discount chain, by attracting new customers with a wide array of useful, low-price goods, but he would also do it by September 2002. 
 Much has changed since then, but not according to plan. The company announced last week that Halloween sales fell from those last year, a disturbing development in any retailing business. Kmart executives also said that the prime fourth quarter, when Americans shop for the December holidays, was likely to be flat at best. 
 And on Tuesday, Moody's Investors Service said it was reviewing Kmart's credit rating for possible downgrading. 
Mr. Conaway says he remains confident that a turnaround is on track. "We're doing the right thing," he said. He acknowledges that the makeover, which he calls "a massive cultural as well as structural transformation," is still in progress, but says that many of the behind-the-scenes remedies that customers rarely see are already behind him.
Some of the company's problems seem beyond management's control. Nearly a year ago, the economy started to shrivel and consumers stopped spending so lavishly. The terrorist attacks nearly two months ago delivered a further economic blow. 
But several analysts and manufacturers say that Kmart still seems to lack a strong image that might draw consumers and is riven by problems years in the making. For one thing, while other discount merchants have picked up newly frugal customers, Kmart has been largely left in the cold. Analysts say that Mr. Conaway, despite his efforts, has not found the formula he needs to distinguish Kmart from its competitors. Moreover, in a possible indication that Kmart is going out of its way to conserve cash, many manufacturers who supply products to its 2,100 stores complain that they are having a hard time being paid. 
Kmart was in disarray before Mr. Conaway arrived from the drug retailer CVS, where he had been president and chief operating officer. His predecessor, Floyd Hall, recruited five years earlier on a similar mission, developed private brands for Kmart and introduced Super Kmart grocery stores. He stepped down in part because Martha Stewart, whose home furnishings line is a top seller for the company, complained that he was not committed enough to her products.
Running Kmart has long been one of the toughest jobs in retailing. Once one of the fastest-growing companies in the United States, it has been steadily losing ground for years to Wal-Mart, the nation's biggest retailer, while other chains, like Kohl's, have picked up steam.
Many things about Kmart were "broken," Mr. Conaway said -- from the supply chain, which is supposed to transfer products smoothly from manufacturer to warehouse to store shelves, to the computer systems intended to track sales and inventory. 
Beyond that, Kmart was suffering from an identity crisis. While its name may be embedded in the nation's consciousness -- with its BlueLight specials and its battle cry "Attention, Kmart shoppers" -- many shoppers have been unclear for years about just why they should go to Kmart.
Wal-Mart became the world's biggest retailer by efficiently delivering the lowest-priced goods in town; Target created an image as the place for the simultaneously price-conscious and fashionable. But at Kmart, shoppers complained that the products they most wanted were often out of stock. And prices, while low, were regularly undercut by Wal-Mart.
Against this backdrop, Mr. Conaway, a trim 41-year-old whom some analysts make fun of for his tendency toward malapropisms (in a conference call over the summer, he declared that "Kmart and Martha Stewart are inexplicably linked at the hip"), sought to carve out a space for Kmart.
Earlier this year, he zeroed in on mothers, saying Kmart would market itself as the retail destination that best met their families' needs. Brands that Kmart already sold, like Martha Stewart and Sesame Street, fit in neatly.
Mr. Conaway has signed additional exclusive agreements for apparel with Joe Boxer and Disney. The brand lineup, together with the convenience offered by the urban locations of many Kmart stores, he told analysts on Sept. 10, will provide "a tremendous sweet spot for us, by being the authority for Mom."
Not everyone agrees. "Wal-Mart and Target have already perfectly divvied up the market," said George Strachan, a Goldman, Sachs analyst, noting that among the top three discounters, Wal-Mart captures a majority of shoppers who earn $50,000 a year or less, and Target attracts most who earn more.
Mr. Conaway quickly committed the company to lower prices, with his "BlueLight Always" program. The price cutting began earlier this year with a few thousand products, and by last month it had widened to about 38,000 items, roughly a third of its total, the company said.
Mr. Conaway has also tried to improve customer service, tying compensation for store managers to how well their stores do on service. Mr. Conaway boasted not long ago that scores for service had barreled upward from just 40 percent satisfaction a year ago to about 60 percent today.
He has also invested in self-service cash registers that allow shoppers to scan their own purchases -- in the interest of improving their experience in the store. 
Kmart's overall financial performance has left room for improvement. Last fiscal year, including special charges, it had a net loss of $244 million on sales of slightly more than $37 billion. In the most recent four quarters, Kmart barely eked out a profit.
And while Mr. Conaway's promises are compelling, the results have yet to appear in hard numbers. Kmart's sales per square foot, a typical retailing gauge, lag behind those of both Wal-Mart and Target. J. C. Penney, another old-line retailer trying to turn itself around, is one of the few chains with a worse performance by that measure.
As Mr. Conaway's price cutting got under way, Wal-Mart executives moved quickly to lower prices, which stymied Mr. Conaway's effort to stand out. While Wal-Mart's sales have risen 5 to 6 percent this fall, Kmart's have been flat. 
Kmart is now so focused on the bottom line that it makes missteps with consumers, a manufacturing executive said.
"Take Halloween," he said -- "and all that candy. The day after Halloween, Wal-Mart will mark theirs down 75 percent. They don't want it there. It's like dead fish. And Target will have it for 50 to 75 percent off. At those two stores, it will be gone within a week. But at Kmart, it will be marked down 20 percent, and it will be straggling for God knows how long."
The disappointing sales in October -- which Mr. Conaway attributed to a nationwide mood of anxiety that put a damper on trick-or-treating as well as other spending -- were hardly good news. "They definitely are struggling," said Emme Kozloff, a retailing analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein.
Mr. Conaway said December would reveal much about his strategy. "You've really got to get through the holiday season to understand how long it's taking you to change consumer behavior and your own culture," he said. 
Another important indicator is inventory turnover, which shows how frequently the overall stock of goods moves from warehouse to customer. At Wal-Mart, the average for last year was 7.3 times, and at Target 6.3. At Kmart, it was 4.3. 
Rapid inventory turnover is essential because the longer products sit in stores, the more they cost the retailer, who as a rule has paid for them up front.
Some manufacturers, insisting on anonymity and noting that the deadline for Mr. Conaway's turnaround was just 10 months away, made a point of the company's tight cash practices. At the beginning of this year, one manufacturer was asked to "contribute" money back because Kmart's margins were not as high as expected. The executive in charge was incredulous, asking why his company should be responsible for Kmart's difficulties. The answer he received, he said, was blunt: "Well, in order for us to stay in business, everybody has to contribute." 
Mr. Conaway said he knew of no such conversations. But he said he had had one meeting with a supplier who said that he had not been paid on time. The problem, it turned out, was that Kmart had lengthened the period it had to pay him, "and he didn't realize it." 
The difficulty for many manufacturers is that Kmart is a major account, and none want to lose its business, particularly at a time when general economic conditions are deteriorating.
Mr. Conaway said Kmart was working to improve relations with suppliers, and wanted to eliminate the $200 million worth of "charge-backs," or fines for shipping delays and the like, that it posts annually. The company stopped charging manufacturers for most of the summer, and even collected an award for the effort.
But the charge-backs are now in full swing once again, and among manufacturers, resentment is growing over that, as well as other methods Kmart appears to be using to shore itself up.
The Moody's review will examine Kmart's ability to pay off money it owes.
A spokesman for Kmart, Jack Ferry, said: "To date we have made significant operational progress in transforming Kmart's business model. It takes time for the financial performance to be seen."
Several manufacturers said the company had fallen behind by a week or more in its payments for products already delivered. Such a delay may seem insignificant, but the amount of money flowing through a giant retailer quickly adds up. Kmart makes an estimated $70 million a day in payments to suppliers, according to Burt Flickinger, a retailing consultant; thus, a weeklong delay amounts to a half-billion-dollar interest-free loan. 
Kmart is not alone. "As the economy slows down, companies are more likely to stretch their cash by taking longer to pay their bills," said Robin Schauseil, executive vice president of the National Association of Credit Managers. 
Mr. Conaway says Kmart is not short of cash, but adds that he still has plenty to do before the company is fixed. When he arrived, he said, "our prices were too high, our stores were too dirty, our lines were too long, and we were out of stock a lot. Those are huge liabilities that we are working on."

HEADLINE: No Strings, No Loyalists 

BYLINE:  By Andrew White; Andrew White is director of the Center for New York City Affairs at the Robert J. Milano Graduate School of Management and Urban Policy of New School University.

 BODY:
The New York City electorate has realigned itself once again. This time Latinos held the winning hand, and they played it for Michael Bloomberg. In an extraordinary swing that has implications for the future, nearly half the Latino voters pulled the lever for the winner in the mayor's race. This bloc was not necessarily pro-Bloomberg, but it expressed anger about Mark Green's failure to make sufficient amends with Latinos after his attacks on Fernando Ferrer in the Democratic primary runoff.
 Mr. Bloomberg has an electoral coalition representing two very different core constituencies. On the one hand are Giuliani Democrats -- white working-class and middle-class voters -- along with wealthier pro-business voters. On the other are mostly working-class Latinos and about 25 percent of the black vote. In the face of the emerging fiscal crisis, it may be very difficult to hold these groups together. 
 The last mayor to try to hold onto support from such a diverse coalition was David Dinkins, who spent four beleaguered years in City Hall at war with the surging crack epidemic, a brutal recession and all manner of consequent social disasters. Who now remembers that Mr. Dinkins tried hard to earn the support of the business establishment as the economy sagged? He eliminated thousands of jobs in city bureaucracies, cut funds for many social programs, promoted real estate development and found money for 6,000 new police officers.
As a result, he ultimately lost much of his coalition's activist and labor base. Today, purveyors of conventional wisdom remember Mr. Dinkins as weak on crime and a patsy for divisive ideologues. All of which says a lot for the powerful forces that shape public opinion, and perhaps more for the Dinkins administration's inability to sell anything resembling a vision to voters.
Rudy Giuliani's great achievement was being able to impart a vision to his policies. The public understood his intentions and goals: cut welfare, reduce crime, keep Manhattan's streets free of beggars and other signs of disorder. Michael Bloomberg will succeed as mayor only to the degree that he can communicate a similar clarity of purpose, even if he pursues a substantially different agenda.
And he will have to. We no longer live in the 1990's, when the reformation of welfare, crime policy and taxation were top priorities in cities nationwide. Today some level of fiscal conservatism is assumed in New York City, despite campaign rhetoric to the contrary. Even if Mr. Giuliani hadn't drilled this deeply into the civic discourse, the devastation from the Sept. 11 attacks and the decline in the city's revenue forecasts mean Mr. Bloomberg has to govern with severe budget cuts. 
Nor can he coast on Mr. Giuliani's basic reforms -- many of which are not fully implemented. Instead, he has to build on these reforms at a time of declining public resources. His interest in social welfare, expressed even at the height of an often nasty campaign, is different from the passions of the departing mayor. While Mr. Giuliani cut the welfare rolls, one in five city households still had income below the federal poverty line last year. With the coming recession, Mr. Bloomberg will have to ensure that more eligible people, including the working poor, receive food stamps and other federally funded supports that are available to the city. 
In child welfare and foster care, he will have to take promising bureaucratic reforms made by Nicholas Scoppetta, commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services, and push those reforms out into the neighborhoods to change the way basic services are delivered, without adding greatly to the cost.
In the Police Department, he will need to reduce the social costs of Mr. Giuliani's anticrime policies. There is widespread anger about the enormous numbers of young men in minority neighborhoods who are stopped by police and searched. He may have to re-examine the impact of arresting and detaining -- rather than ticketing, as was once standard policy -- thousands of young blacks and Latinos each year for low-level misdemeanors. He will also have to limit the costly practice of neighborhood street sweeps in order to pay for new antiterrorism security needs. 
Meanwhile, the unions await new contracts. Businesses await new tax abatements. Unemployment is on the rise, and the 16-acre site of the World Trade Center sits just blocks from City Hall. The new mayor will almost certainly find himself fighting with groups that are affected as the city department budgets are slashed and welfare rolls swell. Like Mr. Dinkins during the last recession, Mr. Bloomberg must balance the budget, or he could well face a fiscal takeover by the state-chartered Financial Control Board, which managed city finances after the fiscal wreck in the 1970's.
Like Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Bloomberg isn't beholden to the union bosses and machine politicos who helped to put Mr. Dinkins in office. He has a high degree of independence from interest groups in city government. The Republican Party is largely irrelevant in New York City anyway and had little to do with his election. The municipal unions mostly abdicated any active role in the general election. 
Mr. Bloomberg's lack of such attachments will work to his advantage. Many of the voters who chose him -- conservative and liberal whites, Latinos, a smaller constituency of blacks -- were seriously alienated by Mark Green and the Democrats. In this context, his lack of a public record may have helped him to win by default; four years from now, he won't have that advantage.
If Mr. Bloomberg wants a second term, he will have to reach out to these various constituencies. He certainly won't be able to count on a repeat performance of the Democratic Party's self-immolation along ethnic and racial lines. But that is an issue he will face in time. For now, in the wake of Sept. 11 and after a bitter campaign season, he would do well to bring to his new administration a dose of humility and inclusiveness. The challenge is to blend those qualities with the projection of competence and clarity of goals that a traumatized city needs.

HEADLINE: Court Overturns Jury Award In '89 Exxon Valdez Spill 

BYLINE:  By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
A federal appeals court ruled today that the $5.3 billion in punitive damages the Exxon Corporation was ordered to pay for the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, the worst in the nation's history, was excessive, and told a judge to set a lower amount.
 The decision vacates the award a jury in Anchorage ordered Exxon to pay in 1994 to 33,000 commercial fishermen, Alaska Natives, property owners and others harmed when the Exxon Valdez ran aground and spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound. 
 Exxon, which has since merged with Mobil to become the Exxon Mobil Corporation, had repeatedly appealed the jury award, arguing that it should not have to pay the punitive damages because it had already paid damages as ordered by Congress. A district court in Alaska rejected the company's appeal in 1995, and the United States Supreme Court rejected its request for a new trial last year. 
But today, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, ruling on oral arguments made in 1999, said that while punitive damages could be awarded for the spill, which devastated 3,000 square miles and severely damaged one of the world's most sensitive ecosystems, the $5.3 billion was excessive in light of recent Supreme Court rulings on damage awards. Under those rulings, Exxon Mobil might be ordered to pay up to about $1.6 billion, or less than one-third of the original award.
Exxon Mobil had no immediate reaction to the decision, a company spokeswoman said.
In Alaska, the organization representing the Prince William Sound fishermen affected by the spill said there was "shock and surprise" at the ruling.
"There's some disappointment around here," said Sue Aspelund, executive director of the Cordova District Fishermen United. "People's lives have been on hold a long time, since 1989, trying to get this thing resolved." 
Environmental groups said they were dismayed by the ruling.
"We feel that Exxon is getting let off the hook," said Gary Skulnik, a spokesman for Greenpeace. "They have committed environmental atrocities, and they are not being made to pay the price for it."
The Ninth Circuit panel, in what sounded like an effort to deflect such a reaction, wrote, "This is not a case about befouling the environment."
"The verdict in this case," it said, "was for damage to economic expectations for commercial fishermen."
The panel noted that the Supreme Court in 1996 set forth for the first time factors that should be considered in reviewing whether punitive damages were excessive, including the reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct, the ratio of the award to the harm inflicted on the plaintiff, and the difference between the award and the civil or criminal penalties in comparable cases.
Judge Andrew J. Kleinfeld, in writing the unanimous decision, noted that Exxon mitigated its reprehensibility by spending more than $2 billion to remove the oil from the water and adjacent shores, "and even from the individual birds and other wildlife dirtied by the oil." Exxon also "began settling with property owners, fishermen and others whose economic interests were harmed by the spill," Judge Kleinfeld wrote, spending $300 million on voluntary settlements "prior to any judgments being entered against it." 
Finally, he noted, the ratio of the $5.3 billion in punitive damages and the $287 million in compensatory damages the jury awarded was more than 17 to 1, a figure that would not get by the Supreme Court.
While the appeals panel did not set an amount for the Alaska district court to order, it noted that the Supreme Court set a ratio of about four to one in punitive awards to actual harm to the plaintiffs. The panel noted that the district court had determined the actual monetary damage to the plaintiffs as $288.7 million to $418.7 million, which would bring the punitive damages to, at most, about $1.65 billion.
The Exxon Valdez spill occurred shortly after midnight on March 24, 1989, when the tanker ran aground on a reef while trying to steer away from icy waters. The Anchorage jury found that the tanker's captain, Joseph Hazelwood, was reckless for leaving the bridge as the vessel neared the reef, which was shown on navigation charts. 
The jury also found recklessness by Exxon for allowing Mr. Hazelwood to be in charge of the ship when the company knew that he was an alcoholic, that he had begun drinking again and that he was drinking on board their ships.
The oil spill disrupted entire fishing communities, forcing shops to close, fishermen to declare bankruptcy and people to move from their hometowns. (While many people did receive settlements from Exxon, many others did not.) The spill also killed 250,000 birds and thousands of marine mammals, affecting 20 animal species. Ten years later, only two species, the bald eagle and the river otter, had fully recovered, while 10 had shown no significant recovery.
While public outrage over the spill forced President George Bush to abandon his drive to allow drilling in the coastal plain of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the plan has been renewed this year under the administration of his son.

Mark Green's Problem

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
It was a humiliating defeat. And if Mark Green is at all interested in understanding the real reason he is not the mayor-elect of New York at this critical moment in the city's history, he should do the thing he has always done best -- look in a mirror.
 To get a sense of how quickly and disastrously the Green campaign collapsed, consider that on Friday night the co-chairman of Miramax Films, Harvey Weinstein, served as chairman of a gala "Unity Dinner" for Mr. Green, which was attended by, among others, former President Bill Clinton and Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles Schumer. 
 Seventy-two hours later Mr. Weinstein endorsed Michael Bloomberg for mayor. That is bizarre by anyone's definition.
From Friday to Monday Mr. Weinstein had tried to broker a little real unity between Mr. Green and the Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, who was defeated by Mr. Green in a bitter runoff election. 
But Mr. Green and his supporters were afraid of being perceived by white voters as caving in to Mr. Ferrer and his supporters (especially the Rev. Al Sharpton), so they aborted the attempted reconciliation. Mr. Weinstein was so angry he bolted to Bloomberg.
It seems always to be like that with Mr. Green. He infuriates people. He has a level of arrogance that is breathtaking, even for a politician. And his empathy gauge is almost always on empty.
Mr. Green never seemed to appreciate the depth of the anger of Mr. Ferrer's supporters in the aftermath of the runoff. When Mr. Green's own supporters were trying to forge links with the Ferrer camp, Mr. Green kept insisting that he didn't need the Ferrer people to win the election. He needed their support in order to govern successfully, he argued, but he could win the election without them.
Mr. Green's biggest problem was not that he made mistakes, but that he never learned from his mistakes. Almost from the beginning he seemed to take it for granted that he would be elected mayor. He seemed mesmerized by the polls, which almost always showed him winning. So he ran a Rose Garden campaign in the Democratic primary, and finished second, which shocked him. He went down and dirty against Mr. Ferrer in the runoff, which he won, but his tactics turned off Ferrer supporters by the thousands.
If he was chastened, he didn't show it. As the general election got under way, he went back to the Rose Garden. As late as two weeks ago, after a Bloomberg attack, Mr. Green coolly replied, "I don't really have to respond to him."
And when the question of debates came up, Mr. Green said of Mr. Bloomberg, "I'm not sure he's entitled to a debate, but I may give him one." They ended up debating twice. 
All kinds of reasons for Mr. Green's defeat are being tossed about. Certainly Mr. Bloomberg spent obscene sums of money. And lots of fingers are being pointed at the city's designated scapegoat, Al Sharpton. (In truth, Mr. Sharpton was treated shabbily by Mr. Green. The two men double-dated with their wives when that served Mr. Green's purposes. And then, when the campaign needed a demon, Mr. Sharpton was available for that role as well.)
But it wasn't Michael Bloomberg or Al Sharpton who loudly proclaimed that he would have done "as well or better" than Rudolph Giuliani in the aftermath of the trade center catastrophe. That was Mr. Green himself. And it was Mr. Green who, each time his lead shrank to near-zero, turned to the pettiest and nastiest tactics. The ad that he ran in which an announcer says, "Kill it! Kill it!" in a reference to a comment Mr. Bloomberg was alleged to have made to a pregnant employee was a grotesque embarrassment. 
The margin of Mr. Green's defeat was razor-thin, which tells me that if he had tempered his arrogance and demonstrated a modicum of leadership on the great issues of the day, he would have won.
Lee Miringoff, who directs the respected Marist College Poll, noted yesterday that voters -- concerned about terrorism and its effect on the city's economy and overall future -- brought "a higher level of seriousness" to this campaign than either of the candidates.
So the guy with all the money won. But it didn't have to be that way.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: MUSLIM ALLY; 
Musharraf Urges Bombing Halt for Ramadan

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE DALEY

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
The president of Pakistan, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, made another plea today for a stop to the American-led military strikes in Afghanistan during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan as he made his way to Europe and the United States.
 Speaking at Ataturk Airport in Istanbul during the second stopover of a six-day diplomatic shuttle that brought him to Paris this evening, General Musharraf said he would discuss a pause in the bombing with President Bush later in the week during his visit to the United States. 
 "One would certainly wish it would not go on during Ramadan because it will definitely have negative effects around the Islamic world," the general said.
But General Musharraf stopped short of categorically calling for a halt to the bombing during the holy days beginning later this month, and in a news conference with President Jacques Chirac of France the subject did not come up. 
The general is on his first trip outside of Pakistan since the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington and is scheduled to address the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday. 
At Elysee Palace here, General Musharraf and Mr. Chirac said their evening together would be spent over a "working dinner," discussing the difficulties Pakistan is facing and the economic aid it needs. 
"Pakistan has chosen to fight against terrorism," Mr. Chirac said. "France understands the difficulties involved in this courageous decision and wants to give it its support." 
Once given a cool reception in the West, General Musharraf has already won pledges of debt relief and the lifting of United States economic sanctions as part of a number of measures intended to prop up Pakistan's stalled economy in exchange for his support of the American-led antiterrorism coalition. 
But the six-day trip is another occasion for General Musharraf to enhance his stature in Pakistan by talking with world leaders as well as pursuing even more concrete promises of aid. 
General Musharraf made two stopovers in Iran and Turkey -- both predominantly Muslim countries -- before arriving in Paris. He is to meet with Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Thursday before traveling on to London and New York.
Few details were made available about his stopover in Tehran, although a local news agency said that he met with the first vice president, Muhammad Reza Aref, on the crisis in Afghanistan. 
Iran disagrees with Pakistan and Turkey over the war in Afghanistan, with Tehran condemning the strikes against the Taliban. 
During a 40-minute stopover in Turkey, General Musharraf said news reports on civilian deaths in Afghanistan were exaggerated, though he did not offer his own assessment of the number killed. 
He dismissed accounts of divisions within Pakistan's military over his assistance to the United States, saying that Pakistan is a moderate Muslim country where a minority has given the world a false impression. 
"Pakistan has one of the strongest and best-disciplined armies in the world, which would follow only its leader," he said. "Just as there is no possibility of another coup in Turkey, there is none in Pakistan, either."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: ECONOMIC LEGISLATION; 
Spending War With White House Focuses on Countering Terrorism

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
Democrats in Congress headed today toward a major confrontation with President Bush over tax and spending policy, vowing to defy his threat to veto legislation that provides additional money to counter terrorism in the United States.
 The Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, and the speaker of the House, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, sided with the president, who told lawmakers on Tuesday that they should wait until next year to review whether more money was needed beyond the $40 billion Congress had already provided. The leaders put pressure on their colleagues, winning support from top Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee who had favored added spending. 
 But Democrats said they welcomed the coming confrontation with Mr. Bush as an opportunity to highlight differences between his domestic priorities and theirs. 
Democrats brushed aside Mr. Bush's threat to veto emergency spending that exceeded the $40 billion approved by both houses of Congress on Sept. 14, three days after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and before the outbreak of anthrax threats and other security concerns. 
Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, said: "The $40 billion has all been spoken for. Additional money for homeland security and bioterrorism is urgently needed. If there's anything that is important to people right now, it's their personal safety and security and their economic safety and security."
On Thursday, the Senate Finance Committee is expected to approve a $67 billion package of tax cuts and new spending intended to stimulate the economy, which has been teetering for months on the edge of recession. 
Democrats plan to take the bill to the Senate floor next week after adding $10 billion to $20 billion -- to hire agents at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Customs Service and the Border Patrol; to upgrade the public health system; to purchase smallpox vaccine and antibiotics, and to pay for new food safety and airport security measures. The money could also be used to increase security at nuclear power plants and to inspect ships arriving at American seaports. 
In addition to that spending, Democrats relished the opportunity to contrast their economic stimulus bill -- which provides jobless benefits and health insurance for the unemployed and immediate tax rebates for low-wage workers -- with a Republican bill passed by the House, which would cut taxes for many large corporations.
"The Democratic caucus sides with the people," said Senator Mark Dayton, Democrat of Minnesota. "The Republican caucus sides with the privileged, so they can give tax relief to millionaires and billionaires."
Senators of both parties predicted today that the economic stimulus bill would be approved by a party-line vote in the Finance Committee. Senator James M. Jeffords, independent of Vermont, said he planned to vote with the Democrats. To win his support, the Democrats agreed to pump $6 billion into agriculture programs, not normally viewed as a means of providing quick stimulus to the economy.
Mr. Lott said the proposals for new spending had proliferated so fast that "it's hard to keep up with all the different suggestions." He circulated a critique of the Democratic bill deriding it as a "special interest grab bag." In the end, Mr. Lott said, the president's veto threat will avert the need for a veto. "There won't have to be a veto" because Congress will rein in its impulse to spend more and more, Mr. Lott predicted.
Under one provision of the Senate Democratic bill, the government would help farmers by buying certain commodities that have been selling at low prices in the last two years. Crops eligible for this program include apples, asparagus, blueberries, cauliflower, cranberries, peaches, potatoes, pumpkins and watermelons.
Dick Armey of Texas, the House Republican leader, rallied to the president's side, saying: "This country is in the middle of a war. Now is not the time to provoke spending confrontations with our commander in chief."
The chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, C. W. Bill Young, Republican of Florida, had wanted to increase spending on antiterrorism programs. Today, under pressure from House Republican leaders, Mr. Young said he would support Mr. Bush's call to limit such spending to $40 billion. But he said other members of his committee would insist on additional money, and Mr. Young said he might not have the votes to block those efforts.
Mr. Hastert said Congress could always provide more money next year. "If there are new needs," Mr. Hastert said, "we would move legislation as soon as the need arises."
Despite Mr. Lott's prediction that no veto would be needed, the president's threat was somewhat risky. Many Republican lawmakers would like to vote for more money for popular antiterrorism efforts.
The administration supported the stimulus bill approved by the House, saying that corporate tax cuts would help avert further layoffs and would stimulate an economic recovery by encouraging companies to invest in new equipment and factories.
But Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the House bill would provide a windfall to big companies. Specifically, he said, by retroactively repealing a provision of the tax code known as the alternative minimum tax, the bill would provide $1.4 billion to I.B.M., $1 billion to Ford, $833 million to General Motors and $671 million to General Electric. 
Moderates like Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, expressed despair at the resurgence of political infighting. 
"Two months after Sept. 11, one of the most cataclysmic events in our nation's history, we're dithering," Ms. Snowe said. "There does not seem to be any genuine good-faith interest in negotiating on a bipartisan basis."
The bill expected to emerge from the Finance Committee has several provisions to help New York, including tax credits for employers in Lower Manhattan and tax incentives for developers to rebuild the area devastated by the terrorist attacks. Aides to Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said that 10,000 companies with 300,000 employees would qualify for the tax credits. 
In the past, such tax credits were offered to employers to encourage the hiring of welfare recipients and low-wage workers. But Republicans said the Democratic bill included no such requirements. Thus, Mr. Lott's critique of the bill says it would provide companies with a $4,800 tax credit for each investment banker employed in Lower Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Bush Plan Would Revise Bill to Aid Charities 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
President Bush asked the Senate leadership today to pass a slimmed-down version of his plan to give federal money to religious charities, saying all charities were hard-pressed to provide disaster relief for the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks while helping the needy.
 These pressures from the war on terrorism helped persuade Mr. Bush to eliminate the most contentious parts of his religion-based initiative to win passage of the law before the end of the year. 
 In letters sent today to Senator Tom Daschle, the South Dakota Democrat who is the majority leader, and Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the minority leader, Mr. Bush said charities needed help immediately. 
"Although individual generosity is evident everywhere, thousands of our nation's charities, paradoxically, have been suffering," he wrote.
With the economy in a downward spiral, more people may seek help from charities. But at the same time many charities are finding it increasingly difficult to raise money for causes other than the care of victims from Sept. 11.
Mr. Bush said in his letter that such a bill should include incentives for donations to charities, equal treatment of community and religious charities and direct support to groups like those that help children with a parent in prison.
The House passed a broader measure this summer but it was stalled in the Senate. Mr. Daschle said he was unlikely to consider the House bill soon because of many so-called charitable-choice provisions that would allow religious groups receiving federal money to hire only members of their faith and to disregard antidiscrimination laws. 
Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, will be the co-sponsors of a bill that would eliminate the most contentious provisions while providing equal treatment for the charities.
The House bill grants up to $13 billion in tax relief over 10 years. It allows people who do not itemize their taxes to deduct up to $25 in charitable contributions and allows noncorporate businesses like family restaurants to receive tax credits for food donations.

HEADLINE: Essay; 
To the Crawford Summit

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
George Bush told Vladimir Putin last month that the 1972 ABM treaty was "outdated, antiquated and useless." Putin countered by telling Barbara Walters, in an interview ABC broadcast last night, that the treaty, which keeps the U.S. and Russia defenseless against nuclear attack, was "essential, effective and useful." 
 Then the Russian president added the crucial but: "But we have a negotiating platform from which we could reach agreements." 
 That platform was secretly nailed down on Oct. 21 in Shanghai: the useless-to-us, useful-to-them ABM treaty will be stretched to permit us to test -- in ways currently prohibited -- a defense against terrorist or rogue-state missiles. 
In return, the U.S. will agree at the president's Crawford, Tex., ranch next week to a Start treaty reducing each side's nuclear missiles to under 2,000, which is all the Russians can afford to maintain. Notes the Jamestown Foundation's Harry Kopp: "Start Plus meets ABM Minus." 
About the war in Afghanistan, Putin gave Walters this accurate assessment: "The United States is losing not in the military but in the information. It seems to me that on the information field, terrorists are acting more aggressively and more offensively. . . ."
The Russian leader ought to know; the ex-K.G.B. operative has long been a master of disinformation. He gained popularity among nationalists by blaming Chechen separatists for all terrorist acts in Russia. Now, in the onslaught of organized terrorism against the U.S., he volunteers to be what Russians call our partnyor in defeating it.
A politician who recently talked with him at length in Russian tells me "he's still K.G.B., but he no longer has to worry about the nationalists and militarists like Zhirinovsky and Lebed. The old Communists are dying off while the young reformers dwindle down, and he's grabbed control of the media so nobody can be heard criticizing him." 
With his popularity rating soaring to Bush-like heights, Putin has three geopolitical choices: (1) to align Russia with China against the West; (2) to romance Europe and try to draw it away from the U.S. superpower; or (3) to disappoint China and astound Europe by befriending the U.S. directly.
He started moving toward that America-first option by closing down his Cuban spy operation, abandoning the Cam Ranh Bay naval base in Vietnam and withdrawing objections to our dearly desired oil pipeline from the Caspian Sea through Turkey. Though he clings to his lucrative, dangerous nuclear buildup of Iran, he no longer glowers at our desire to admit the Baltic States into NATO. 
Then, after Sept. 11, Putin seized his opportunity to help the injured U.S. When he permitted our military presence on his southern flank in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, his generals dared not object publicly. He could even offer us combat troops -- "in rescue operations, including on the territory of Afghanistan" -- secure in the knowledge that the last thing anti-Taliban Afghans would tolerate would be a Russian re-invasion. 
But the surest sign of Putin's strategy will be his willingness to bend the ABM treaty out of shape. Hu Jintao went to Moscow last week to argue that an American space shield would undercut China's nuclear threat to Taiwan; he was rebuffed. (Who's Hu? He's the Chinese leader likely to replace Jiang Zemin in two years, and Barbara should start going after him now.) 
European leaders, opposing our missile shield in what they hoped would be a worldwide gang-up against American hegemony, are agape. How could Putin bypass their toll bridge to integration with the West, they sputter, and make a private deal with the unilateralist Bush? 
Putin seeks an osobye otnosheniya -- "special relationship" -- with the U.S. for good reasons. China, bordering Russia's east, is a long-term strategic threat; the U.S. is not. Europe is not about to welcome an economic rival, but the U.S. has the money and savvy to exploit Russia's oil and gas resources, and holds the key to its entry into the World Trade Organization. 
We can hope that at the Crawford summit, Bush and Putin will cut the pious soul-searching and fulsome expressions of undying trust. America's national travail has enabled Putin to speed a rapprochement, but we should not forget that once up on its hind legs, the Russian bear will growl again.

HEADLINE: Focusing on the Losers 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
In a burst of candor and finger-pointing, a senior Republican official here departed from his colleagues' spin that they had frittered away the governorships in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday to Democrats who had more money and did not have to contend with divisive primaries.
 In fact, that official, Steve Schmidt, communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said, the two losers, Mark L. Earley in Virginia and Bret D. Schundler in New Jersey, were at fault. 
 "We're glad the president did not campaign for these guys," Mr. Schmidt said in an interview. "No one wants to see him spend political capital on people who have run preposterously bad campaigns." 
It seems like a basic point: The best campaign wins. But that notion was often lost in the cross-fire today as Republicans and Democrats battled a public relations war over whether the elections of James E. McGreevey in New Jersey, Mark R. Warner in Virginia and Michael R. Bloomberg in New York City carried any national political consequences.
In the view of strategists in both parties, the outcome came down to the strengths -- and often the flaws -- of individual candidates. In Virginia, Mr. Earley found himself squabbling with other Republicans over the state budget and never found a way to counter Mr. Warner's conservative pitch. In New Jersey, Mr. Schundler struggled to become untethered from the conservatives who helped him win the nomination. And in New York, Mark Green, despite his decades in Democratic politics, could never manage to unite restive wings of the party behind him.
"The most important thing, even more than money, is the candidate," said Douglas Sosnik, a Clinton political director. "Mark Earley never gave people a reason to vote for him. It got so bad that he closed his campaign with an endorsement from the mayor of New York -- not traditionally the most effective way to get elected governor of Virginia. And Warner made himself an acceptable alternative, no small feat for a Democrat in Virginia."
The Democrats did not manage the sweep that their party chairman, Terence McAuliffe, had confidently predicted. Mr. McAuliffe was so eager to dwell on the positive that he declared, "Mark Green almost won!"
While almost is not good enough, the twin victories in New Jersey and Virginia gave Mr. McAuliffe the most encouraging political news since the Democrats took control of the Senate in June. The success in two states with quite different demographics may give the party a psychological lift and help with recruitment and fund-raising.
Now Mr. McAuliffe can lambast his Republican counterpart, Gov. James S. Gilmore III of Virginia, for not rescuing his own state.
"When the president is at 90 percent approval and they run an anti-tax message where the chairman of the party is the governor of the state and yet our Democratic candidate wins the governorship," Mr. McAuliffe said, "there's something fundamentally wrong with the Republican message."
But Mr. Bloomberg's upset victory in New York, where Democrats are registered five to one over Republicans, prevented the Democrats from making a potent case that there was any national tide for their party -- and took the edge off the expected but nonetheless stinging Republican defeats in New Jersey and Virginia.
And because President Bush did not campaign in any of the races, the Democrats cannot convincingly say that their victories were a referendum on his presidency, just as in New York Republicans cannot say the results had anything to do with the White House. In New Jersey, for example, exit polls found that foremost on the minds of voters were not the attacks on Sept. 11 but their state's ailing economy and high taxes.
Mr. Gilmore portrayed the Democratic victories for governor as "great personal triumphs" that had nothing to do with a national trend. He said the same even about New York, where Mr. Bloomberg benefited from the endorsement of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. "The New York win was spectacular," he said. "it says a lot about Rudy Giuliani -- as much as Mr. Bloomberg."
As was Mr. McAuliffe, Governor Gilmore was searching for the positive. Playing down the defeat of Mr. Earley in his state, Mr. Gilmore said, "We came very close in our lieutenant governor's race."
There were some similarities in the three big winning campaigns. From the start, all three vastly outspent their rivals. Perhaps guilty of hyperbole, Mark Mellman, Mr. Green's pollster, said of Mr. Bloomberg, "It was the largest concentrated spending on a political campaign in human history."
Mr. Bloomberg and the pair of Democratic victors were also successful in expanding their appeal beyond their parties' traditional voters. As Mr. Gilmore put it, "Mark Warner ran very much as a Republican" and "McGreevey was running as a no-tax fiscal conservative." And Mr. McAuliffe said Mr. Bloomberg "ran on a Democratic message."
The winners also benefited from candidates who were not widely liked in their own parties.
It was never a secret in their parties that the losing candidates were viewed as flawed. In an internal memorandum to Governor Gilmore after the results were in, Todd Reid, a party official, was unsparing in his criticism of Mr. Earley's campaign.
In one passage, he complained that Earley commercials were concentrated "on shows like 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer,' 'Xena: Warrior Princess' and 'Showtime at the Apollo' " and that "we were never able to make up for all those wasted ads run when no one was watching."
Some Republicans argued that the party was trying to make scapegoats of its candidates when it should consider its own role.
"If I were Gilmore, I'd be very, very embarrassed," Mickey Edwards, a former Republican congressman, said. "When you're the national chairman of the party and your state goes to the other party, to some extent it's got to be a referendum on you."
That may be the case. But many Republicans would clearly rather Mr. Gilmore take the blame than the person who made him chairman, President Bush.

HEADLINE: THE 2001 ELECTIONS: THE DEMOCRATS; 
It's Morning for the Democrats In the Suburbs of the Northeast

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
In New Jersey, Democrats claimed control of state government for the first time in nearly a decade. In Nassau County, Democrats wrested control of the county government for the first time since World War I. Even in Greenwich, Conn., a bastion of Republican politics, Democrats managed, in a stunning upset, to take control of local government for what the new top elected official believed was the first time ever.
 With the notable exception of New York City, where Democrat-turned-Republican Michael R. Bloomberg upset Mark Green, Tuesday was a very good day for Democrats throughout the New York region. 
 Helped by redistricting, buoyed by some poor performances by Republican incumbents and lifted by an influx of voters more amenable to core Democratic beliefs, Democrats showed that for the first time in many years, they were a suburban force to be reckoned with, even in Republican strongholds. 
At the same time, the victories reflected two newer political realities. One is that the Democratic Party, with its current taste for Clintonian centrism, has been solidifying its strength throughout the Northeast. The other is that the aging Republican machines in places like Nassau and Suffolk Counties have weakened so much that they can no longer be counted on to deliver victory after victory, automatically.
"I don't think there was an anti-Republican tide," said United States Representative Peter T. King, a Long Island Republican. "But I think the Democrats are getting an edge, and Democrats for the most part have been in the ascendancy in the Northeast."
At no time was the region's increasingly Democratic hue more evident than in the 2000 presidential election. States supporting Al Gore were shaded blue in the television coverage, while states supporting George W. Bush were in red. With the exception of New Hampshire, the Northeast was all blue.
The increasing appeal of the Democratic Party was also manifested last year by how well Hillary Rodham Clinton ran in traditionally Republican upstate New York in her Senate campaign. Next year, Gov. George E. Pataki is likely to face a formidable Democratic challenger.
In New Jersey, an increasingly fractured Republican Party has not yet decided who should challenge the state's embattled senior senator, Robert G. Torricelli. It might be former Gov. Thomas H. Kean. Or, if the powerful conservative wing of the party -- the same people who propelled Bret D. Schundler to an emphatic primary victory -- has its way, it might not.
Still, Democrats have been careful in assessing their long-term plans, especially with a slumping economy and government belt-tightening all but guaranteed.
"One thing I've learned from political activism is that you're only as good as your next election victory," said Robert P. Zimmerman, a Nassau County member of the Democratic National Committee. "But this is one great send-off to plan for your next victory."
In Nassau, where the county's financially troubled government was the dominant issue, Thomas R. Suozzi, the Democratic mayor of Glen Cove, trounced Bruce R. Bent, a Republican, for county executive. It was the first time a Democrat has led the county since 1970.
In the County Legislature, the Democrats retained the slim majority they won in 2000, their first majority since 1917. And in an upset, the Republican comptroller, Frederick E. Parola, lost a close race to his Democratic challenger, Howard S. Weitzman.
Even in solidly Republican Suffolk, there were dents in the party's armor. James M. Catterson Jr., the three-term district attorney, was soundly defeated by his Democratic rival, Thomas J. Spota III, a former prosecutor.
Republicans may have wanted to see the results as purely local events with little relation to national trends. To Democrats, though, the results in the downstate suburbs of New York mean that Governor Pataki will probably have to work harder to win the same voters in the 2002 gubernatorial election.
"I gather the governor used to rely on good old Nassau County," said Howard A. Scarrow, a political science professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. "Well, guess what? It's probably not much different than Westchester or New Jersey or the suburban counties."
In New Jersey, Democratic strategists were still giddy yesterday about the election of James E. McGreevey as governor, the party's new 44-to-36 majority in the State Assembly and the 20-20 tie in the State Senate. It was only eight years ago that the Democrats were crushed, at every level, by the Republicans, who tapped into voter discontent over the $2.8 billion tax increase under Gov. Jim Florio. 
Some Republicans said the losses reflected voter antipathy toward Mr. Schundler. Party leaders chose to take encouragement from smaller wins, citing victories in freeholders' races in Bergen, Cumberland and Passaic Counties.
"We're very disappointed," said State Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos, the state Republican Party chairman. "But I think there are some quieter successes around the state that hearten me, and that indicate that we have a strong farm team."
Democrats, though, said the results reflected years of grass-roots organizing, particularly in the suburbs. Some of those efforts, they added, were manifested in some historic breakthroughs in several local elections.
One traditional Republican area, Summit, elected two Democrats to its seven-member City Council. It was the first time that even one Democrat had won there since 1922, and it reflected the changing demographics of a city that has become more diverse with the arrival of baby-boom families from New York City who tend to be socially liberal, fiscally moderate and locally independent.
In Greenwich, Richard Bergstresser, a Democrat, defeated the incumbent Republican, Lolly H. Prince, to capture the top elected post, first selectman. It was the first time a Democrat had won that position in 18 years. Democrats also won the majority on the board of selectmen for the first time in four years, he said.
But Mr. Bergstresser said he could not recall when, if ever, Democrats had control of both the first selectman's job and the board. 
"Any time a Democrat can win in Greenwich, it's an upset," he said. "We've managed to awaken what we hope is a sleeping giant."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED -- AN OVERVIEW: NOV. 7, 2001; 
Pursuit of Terror Funds, Anthrax Victim on Tape, Partisan Sniping

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
 "Follow the money" is a tried and true maxim for investigators, and it works for President Bush, too. Repeatedly, he has made clear that one way to strike at Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, is to cut off its cash flow. Now that effort has taken a new course.

UNUSUAL ALLIES IN CRACKDOWN -- With help from other countries, the United States went after two financial networks accused of not only supplying Al Qaeda with money but also helping it to move weapons and relay instructions to its terrorist cells. Their names are Al Barakaat and Al Taqwa, and yesterday a string of their offices were raided by law enforcement agents around the United States and in Europe. As important, perhaps even more so, the crackdown was joined by countries that normally have little appetite for this policing.
 For instance, the United Arab Emirates seized assets and records of Al Barakaat, which is based in Dubai. Liechtenstein, a center for international money-laundering, took measures against Al Taqwa. Also cooperating, senior officials said, was Saudi Arabia, the much-criticized homeland of 15 of the 19 airplane hijackers in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
Protests of innocence by the two financial networks failed to impress Washington. Al Barakaat was said to have slipped tens of millions of dollars a year to Mr. bin Laden's operation by skimming money off the top of routine transactions. Al Taqwa was described as sort of an E.F. Hutton for terrorists, offering investment advice.
Did the raids choke off Al Qaeda's entire money stream? Not likely, officials in Washington said. Still, Mr. Bush said, this latest action "blocks an important source of funds."

ELUSIVE LEAD ON ANTHRAX -- The president is intent on showing that the campaign against terrorism and Mr. bin Laden's Taliban protectors in Afghanistan is moving apace on several fronts. That has not always been an easy task, especially when his administration is forced to concede that it has no idea of the source of the anthrax that has killed or sickened 18 Americans. Still, there were encouraging words from Tom Ridge, the director of homeland security. With no new cases of the disease reported this week, Mr. Ridge said that he hoped "the anthrax has stopped permanently."
For a while it seemed possible that a new anthrax-bearing letter had come to light. A tape surfaced of a phone call to 911 made on Oct. 21 by one of the two Washington postal workers who died from inhalation anthrax, the worst kind. In that call, the worker, Thomas L. Morris Jr., talked about being near a colleague who handled a letter with powder in it. As it turned out, that powder tested negative, so there was nothing to point investigators in a eureka-prompting direction.
Even so, Mr. Morris's call for help, the night before he died, gave a glimpse of a man in distress. To a question from the 911 operator, he said he had no idea what happened to the suspect letter, or if its contents were indeed anthrax. "I was told it wasn't," he said, "but I have a tendency not to believe these people."

PARTIES SPAR ON ECONOMY -- In Washington, the bipartisan glow was fading. Democrats and Republicans have sparred over how to improve airport security and how to give CPR to a troubled economy. (More tax cuts for business, Republicans say. More money for unemployment and health benefits, Democrats reply.)
Now the two parties are hung up on how much to spend on anti-terrorism measures like hiring federal agents and improving the public health system. Soon after Sept. 11, both houses of Congress approved $40 billion in emergency spending. The Democrats now say that sum is not enough by a long shot, but the White House and its Republican allies on Capitol Hill are standing their ground. If the president makes good on a threat to veto any more money to counter terrorism, Democratic leaders say they are prepared to defy him.

PROGRESS BY NORTHERN ALLIANCE -- On the war front, the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance said it had captured another town, putting it closer to an assault on Mazar-i-Sharif, a city crucial to controlling northern Afghanistan. Should that city fall to the alliance, American forces would have an easier time moving into Afghanistan from bases in neighboring Uzbekistan.
One problem was that the rebels' claims of success could not be independently verified. Nonetheless, an alliance commander promised that Mazar-i-Sharif would be seized before the week is out. "God willing," he said. CLYDE HABERMAN

HEADLINE: The Big City; 
An Outsider Comes Inside To Run Things

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
ONCE again we have elected a mayor who proudly claims not to be a politician. This is a wonderful formula for lively news conferences, as we learned during Rudolph W. Giuliani's performances, and the city's political journalists are understandably ecstatic. 
 It's hard to know exactly what else Mr. Bloomberg's election means, because he has been vague about his plans. He didn't dwell on bureaucracies and budgets during the campaign, and after Sept. 11 that approach seemed to suit voters. 
 "Until Sept. 11, the compelling question in the campaign was how to carve up the city's $40 billion budget," said Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University and an adviser to Mr. Bloomberg. "After Sept. 11 the question became: how do we keep the city's $400 billion private economy intact? Workers of all classes were worried, especially the ones dependent on entry-level jobs in hotels and restaurants."
The public-private dichotomy was evident in a survey of voters Tuesday that was commissioned by the City Journal, the quarterly of the Manhattan Institute, the conservative research group. People who reported working for private, for-profit companies preferred Mr. Bloomberg by a 15-point margin. Mr. Green won by 17-point margins among government employees and among workers for nonprofit groups, which often depend on public money. 
The closeness of the final result reflected the disproportionate turnout of the government and nonprofit workers. Although they're outnumbered in the city's workforce about three-to-one by employees of for-profit companies, on Tuesday they constituted nearly as large a share of the electorate (37 percent versus 41 percent) as the for-profit workers.
"Public employees turned out to choose their boss, and they wanted it to be Mark Green," said Myron Magnet, the editor of City Journal. "People outside the public sector preferred someone who had started his own company."
During the campaign, Mr. Bloomberg was faulted by some members of the business community for political naivete. Conservatives distrusted his background as a liberal Democrat. But two-thirds of conservatives ended up voting for him, according to the poll of voters. 
"Conservatives were reassured late in the campaign by Bloomberg's unequivocal promise not to raise taxes," Dr. Magnet said. "I was heartened that the first words out of his mouth after being elected were, 'New York is open for business.' Yes, he's a liberal on cultural matters, but he believes in fiscal prudence and business-friendliness, and that's what we need most now along with public safety. Half a Republican is better than none."
Dr. Moss, after knowing Mr. Bloomberg for nearly a decade and advising him in the campaign, predicts that he will surprise his critics. "We've had politicians and we've had prosecutors as mayors, but we haven't had a manager who cares about performance," Dr. Moss said. "Mike is not an ideologue. He's a doer. Democratic politicians here succeed by taking fewer and fewer risks as they climb the ladder -- any new idea threatens special interests. Bloomberg's basic career path has been to find a new way to do something. He is a risktaker who is going to change the culture of city government."
Mr. Bloomberg hasn't explained how he'll change the culture of workers who can't be fired, but he has at least shown that he looks at some problems differently. Before Sept. 11, he refused to join the Democrats promising more and more subsidized housing. He preferred to rely instead on private builders.
AFTER Sept. 11, he did not call for a grand new bureaucracy to rebuild downtown Manhattan. While Mr. Green was vowing to bring back the financial services industry, Mr. Bloomberg said that revival would depend mainly on private efforts and on new industries. He pooh-poohed the plans by Democrats to woo back the old businesses by offering tax credits. 
"Any company that makes a decision as to where they are going to be based on the tax rate is a company that won't be around very long," he said in an interview last week. "If you're down to that incremental margin you don't have a business." Mr. Bloomberg didn't pretend to know which industries would ultimately find it profitable to be downtown, so he didn't offer a master plan. Whatever you think of his restraint, it was radical by New York standards. Only a nonpolitician around here could imagine the city surviving without his guidance.

HEADLINE: THE 2001 ELECTIONS: THE TRANSITION; 
Giuliani Officials Aren't Promised Automatic Jobs

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg indicated yesterday that he would form his own team for a new administration, and not necessarily by retaining Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's top aides. 
 Mr. Bloomberg had long campaigned on the theme of carrying on the policies of the Giuliani administration, and many voters chose over him over Mark Green for that very reason. But in answer to repeated questions yesterday about which people Mr. Bloomberg would keep from Mr. Giuliani's team, the mayor-elect said that although he expected short-term help from the current administration, he would be reviewing his options. 
 This apparently also applies to the outgoing mayor, whom Mr. Bloomberg said he would consult when making appointments to the new commission to redevelop downtown. But he would not promise to name Mr. Giuliani to the panel. 
"The only one I've said publicly that I'd like to keep is the police commissioner, Bernie Kerik," Mr. Bloomberg said, adding that he had received a promise yesterday from Mr. Kerik that he would consider the job. 
"In terms of any other commissioner, I have not made any other firm decisions," Mr. Bloomberg said.
"I have thought a lot about it," he added, when asked if he had considered anyone else from Mr. Giuliani's roster. "Before you pick, you want to see who else is available." 
Other Giuliani appointees who might be asked to stay at least temporarily are Deputy Mayor Joseph J. Lhota and Transportation Commissioner Iris Weinshall, Bloomberg aides said. 
Whomever Mr. Bloomberg chooses to join him in what may well be one of the most arduous mayoralties in decades, it seems clear his administration will have a potpourri of political leanings and backgrounds. Mr. Bloomberg, whose nascent political career has left him owing little to traditional political allies, is expected to appoint people from the private sector as well as government and politics. Page D1. 
And just as his campaign drew advice from Ester Fuchs, a left-leaning professor of political science at Barnard, as well as from aides with the State Republican Party, Mr. Bloomberg's administration is expected to be diverse and occasionally incongruent, drawing advice from people ranging from the sitting mayor to Fernando Ferrer. 
"He is very smart, he is an independent thinker who owes nothing to anyone," said former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who crossed party lines to support a candidate who did the same to run. "Politics don't mean anything to him. I think he will look at all of Giuliani's people individually and take advice from Rudy, but he is his own man."
Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday that he would name his transition team in a few days, and that his administration would be put together behind closed doors. But yesterday, several people who worked closely with his campaign proffered a most-likely-to-succeed list. 
At the top is Patricia E. Harris, who oversees philanthropic operations at Bloomberg L.P. and was the first person he thanked on election night. Ms. Harris, who did not return calls yesterday, is expected to be offered a deputy mayoralty or a top commissionership. 
Kathleen Cudahy, a former top aide to the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, who quit to join Mr. Bloomberg's campaign as a senior policy aide, is also expected to join the new administration.
"She will play a major role because of her expertise with the City Council and also in economic development and a whole host of other issues," said Jonathan Capehart, another policy adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, who is weighing his own options. He is a former newspaper reporter, and says he cannot decide whether to return to that profession or stay on with Mr. Bloomberg, which he said would be a joy.
Others who are expected to play a role, Bloomberg people say, are Kevin Sheekey, who worked for Mr. Bloomberg as a lobbyist and political adviser at his company in Washington, and is being considered as a chief of staff or for a similar high-level role, if he can be convinced to leave Washington; William Cunningham, one of Mr. Bloomberg's senior strategists, whom many expect to play a senior role in the transition and the administration; and Vincent A. LaPadula, who worked in the Giuliani administration before joining the Bloomberg campaign.
"It is his decision to approach who he wants," said Mr. Cunningham, who, like others yesterday, insisted that they had not discussed future roles with the mayor-elect. "He knows where I am."
Mr. Bloomberg has also expressed an interest in finding a role for a former police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly. His campaign press secretary, Edward Skyler, is expected to lead the press operations, officials said.
Mr. Bloomberg, a lifelong Democrat who joined the Republican Party for the sole purpose of running for mayor, is said to have low tolerance for ideology, preferring pragmatic solution-oriented advice from people of all political persuasions that he turned to when running his media business. While Gov. George E. Pataki appeared yesterday at the joint news conference and stood beside him on election night, the governor and the mayor will probably vie for his attention. 
Further, many of Mr. Giuliani's commissioners, deputy mayors and other high-level staff people are exhausted. There has been nearly two months of seven-day weeks, endless funerals and nonstop meetings, all centering on a tragic event that left myriad municipal problems in its wake.
Even commissioners who are clearly not political, like Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the health commissioner, who has helped guide Mr. Giuliani through the anthrax crisis, could not say yesterday whether he really wanted to stay or not. One recent experience of Mr. Cohen's may explain the reluctance of many Giuliani officials: Just as he sat down to take a much-needed break over homemade ravioli that a neighbor had dropped off, his cellphone went off, and when he went to answer it, his dog chowed down his dinner. 
Mr. Bloomberg alluded to the idea that while he ran on ties to Mr. Giuliani's record and administration, he might not attempt to create a carbon copy of it, as was widely expected.
"I think that the problems change," he said yesterday. "The city changes, its population changes, its assets and resources change. We're going to go through a period where job retention is a very big problem. Rudy was blessed with basically a good economy after the first couple of years." 
Mr. Bloomberg also speculated yesterday that he would need Mr. Giuliani's help in the coming months, but would not commit himself to the offer of a specific role.
In terms of recommending to Governor Pataki that Mr. Giuliani head a new commission to rebuild downtown, Mr. Bloomberg said: "I certainly will talk to him about it. I can tell you this, I wouldn't be comfortable in us selecting anybody without his advice as to who should do it."

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "An Election in a Shadow: Attempting to Follow an Outsized Giuliani" (news analysis, front page, Nov. 7), you wonder whether Michael R. Bloomberg will "figure out a way to lead, to manage, to be judged on his own terms." 
 Mr. 
Bloomberg has vowed to build on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's successes, and to this end he might be compelled to continue most of the current administration's policies. 
 Yet for the last eight years the needs of low-income people have been largely ignored by Mr. Giuliani and his administration. This segment of the population has always been the most vulnerable to economic downturns, and this is even truer now. 
Mike Bloomberg has a golden opportunity to outshine Mr. Giuliani not only by building on his strengths but also by addressing his weaknesses.

HEADLINE: A Nation Challenged 

 BODY:
 The Financial Front

WAR ON MONEY NETWORKS -- President Bush announced an international effort to destroy two financial networks that American officials said had long been suspected of funneling money to members of the Al Qaeda terrorist organization. The announcement came as law enforcement officials in the United States and Europe staged raids to disrupt their operations. A1

FIRM UNDER SCRUTINY -- A partner in one of the financial networks singled out by investigators said he was a victim of guilt by association. B8

Dangers in the Gulf

TRAINING TERRORISTS -- Two defectors from Iraqi intelligence said they had worked for several years at a secret Iraqi government camp that had trained terrorists since 1995. A1

ATTACK AT AIR BASE -- A gunman was shot and killed after he opened fire at American and Qatari troops guarding an air base in the Persian Gulf nation Qatar that was being used by American military aircraft. B2

Where the War Stands

SHIFT IN STRATEGY -- With its caves, tunnels and urban hiding places, Afghanistan has proved to be an especially difficult battlefield. Already, the United States military has been compelled to adapt its one-month-old military campaign. A1

REBELS ON THE ATTACK -- Forces opposed to the Taliban captured a town near Mazar-i-Sharif, a city regarded as a linchpin in the battle to control northern Afghanistan. B1

GROUND OPERATIONS -- Pentagon officials make no secret now that success in Afghanistan will depend on ground operations, a kind of combat that was fading from importance before Sept. 11. B6

IN CAVES AND TUNNELS -- An Afghan general said American bombs had been effective but only ground troops could destroy the Taliban's network of caves and tunnels. B6

SAILOR APPEARS LOST -- A sailor went overboard from the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk. If confirmed, his death would be the fourth American fatality in the Afghanistan war. B6

GERMANY TIGHTENING SECURITY -- Germany cabinet backed changes in security and immigration laws in response to the Sept. 11 attacks. A12

The Messages

TWO LEADERS UNITED -- President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain are becoming allies joined by war, national self-interest and what their aides say is a growing personal chemistry. B3

NEWS CONFERENCES CURBED -- Under pressure from the United States, Pakistan has asked the Taliban ambassador in its capital to stop using news conferences to attack the United States for bombing Afghanistan. B3

SEEKING A PAUSE IN BOMBING -- The president of Pakistan made another plea for a stop to the American-led military strikes in Afghanistan during the holy month of Ramadan. B3

Congress and Business

RADIO IN AFGHANISTAN -- The House voted to create Radio Free Afghanistan to beam American news and entertainment programs to Afghans in their local languages in an effort to combat Taliban propaganda. B7

HELP FOR INSURERS -- Congress edged closer to aiding the insurance industry when a House committee voted to promise insurers billions of dollars in loans in the event of any large terror attacks next year. B7

HIJACKING SUSPECT -- Prosecutors are weighing whether to seek an indictment against a man in New York who the authorities suspect was to have been the 20th hijacker in the Sept. 11 terror attacks. B7

The Biological Threat

A VICTIM'S CALL -- Hours before he died, a Washington postal worker called 911 and told the emergency operator that he suspected he had anthrax because he remembered that colleagues working near him had handled a letter with powder in it. A1

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* "ALONG THE NILE: EARLY PHOTOGRAPHS OF EGYPT" AND "THE PHARAOH'S PHOTOGRAPHER: HARRY BURTON, TUTANKHAMEN AND THE METROPOLITAN'S EGYPTIAN EXPEDITION," Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1000 Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Dec. 30). "Along the Nile" is a gem of an exhibition of early, mostly amateur photographs of Egypt, including Maxime Du Camp's famous view of the colossal, half-buried face of Ramses II with an assistant posing on top of the sculpture, the ancestor of all those shots of Mom and Uncle Burt squinting into the camera and smiling next to the Sphinx. The show includes obscure figures like Ernest Benecke, a French wool trader of German descent, whose images are more remarkable for seeming accidental and serendipitous, and Theodule Deveria, whose photograph of the tomb of Ptahmose, the chief steward to Ramses II, is the only evidence of a site since reburied and lost beneath shifting sands. Pioneering works, these photographs have a virgin authenticity conveying the amateur photographer's amazement at seeing places through a device whose uncanny ability to capture those sights doubled the amazement. Half a century later Harry Burton photographed the excavation of Tutankhamen's tomb mixing Hollywood-style shots of Howard Carter uncovering Tut's mummy for the illustrated newspapers with documentary pictures made solely for the archives, which have an unintended modern beauty. The Burton show cleverly gives a fresh twist to the Tut craze, but the older photographs stick longer in the mind because they seem haunted from across a gulf of a century and a half. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman).

* "BAMANA: THE ART OF EXISTENCE IN MALI," Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313 (through March 3). African art is about envisioning a moral universe and shaping the world through spiritual energy to conform to that vision. The positive effects are evident in objects and images that unite communities, ease pain, forecast the future and explain the past. Nearly 100 of them are included in this wonderful show by one of the best museums in town. Among the highlights are exquisite iron ritual staffs, personable hand puppets, grave carved-wood maternity figures and a whole herd of the infinitely stylish antelope-shaped crest masks known as Ci-wara. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50, students and 65+; free on Sundays (Holland Cotter).

* "BRAZIL: BODY AND SOUL," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 27). The rotunda is black and half filled by an immense altar. The French architect Jean Nouvel's installation is aptly over the top, considering that the show is about a culture gloriously, self-consciously excessive. A sampler of Brazilian culture, the show divides attention between the Baroque and the modern. Physicality, spectacle, eroticism and pleasure: the cliches of Brazilian culture are all leitmotifs, in stunning objects mixing indigenous, African and European roots. These include the works of genius eccentrics like Aleijadinho, Brazil's Bernini, and Arthur Bispo do Rosario, a seaman, boxer, doorman, bodyguard, jailbird and mental patient who died in 1989 at the age of 78. He sewed banners out of bed sheets and embroidered them with long incantatory lists of places and people, including a presentation mantle he made for himself to wear before God on Judgment Day. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8, students and 65+ (Kimmelman)

* "TOM FRIEDMAN," New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Feb. 3). A suitably diverse survey of one of the less predictable artists of the 1990's, who has made his name by transforming common objects and materials into one-of-a-kind feats of sculpture, drawing or photography. Toothpicks, toothpaste, sugar, a pencil, a dictionary and soap are among the materials subjected to Mr. Friedman's carefully plotted, meticulously executed methods. The results can be engagingly manic or meditative -- and sometimes nearly invisible, in which case the work becomes a minimally accessorized punchline. But when Mr. Friedman changes an artwork in a way that keeps the before, the after and the intervening transformation equally clear, he stops time for a few luxurious instants. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, artists, students and 65+ (Roberta Smith).

* "ALBERTO GIACOMETTI," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Jan. 8). Giacometti as the Sartre of sculpture might lead you to imagine him the right subject for troubled times. But that would be the wrong reason to see this exhibition. The right reason is that like all perceptive and eloquent art, it tells you why it is good to be alive. It investigates the pleasure of thinking and looking long and hard, which is never as simple as it sounds. The work is more varied than you may think -- sometimes black-humored, playful, sensual, even devoutly tender -- and includes plasters, painted bronzes and even a clunky stone garden sculpture, a splendid oddity, that demonstrate the material virtuosity and subtle coloration of an artist too often presumed to be pretty much just dark and heavy. Spread chronologically across two floors, compressed then open, like the art they contain, the show has as its unnecessary excuse the centenary of Giacometti's birth. We don't learn much that isn't already known, but it is a thorough, serious, very elegant exhibition, and there is nothing the matter with being reacquainted from time to time with what great art looks like. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and 65+ (Kimmelman).

* "NORMAN ROCKWELL: PICTURES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Fifth Avenue at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through March 3). Coming after Sept. 11, the show gives everybody in town a chance to contemplate the Rembrandt of Punkin Crick, as a critic acidly dubbed him years ago, through altered eyes. In our flag-shrouded anxiety, Rockwell's cornball sentiments can seem less remote and contrived than they did. The debate about whether Rockwell was a good artist or not is as shopworn as his art. The sugar level can induce diabetic coma, and the late "serious" pictures replace the sugar with cod liver oil. That said, Rockwell's imagination and craftsmanship are obvious. What Rockwell painted was not what America, in its complexity, ever quite looked like. But at his best he captured what many Americans really felt and desired -- and many now feel and desire -- which is truth on a level deeper than surface appearance. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).

"SIGNAC 1863-1935: MASTER NEO-IMPRESSIONIST" AND "NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: THE CIRCLE OF PAUL SIGNAC," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Dec. 30). These shows give an excellent view of the career of Signac, the first and most fervent convert to George Seurat's color theories and Pointillist technique, and their chief proselytizer after Seurat's death in 1891. Redolent of Signac's intelligence, discipline, faith in progress and unflagging energy, the first show moves in clear-cut chapters, beginning with his awkward attempts at Impressionism and a gallery of beautiful transitional works that are among the show's best. Next come his Seuratesque seascapes and more distinctive figurative works; the radiant St.-Tropez paintings in which he made Neo-Impressionism his own; and his exuberantly eccentric late paintings and not-eccentric-enough watercolors. The importance of Signac's color to the development of Modernism -- starting with Matisse and the Fauves -- is unmistakable, but so is his tendency to be mechanical and a little soulless. The smaller exhibition of work by the artists he knew, from Seurat to Matisse, clarifies both his deficiencies and his achievement. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).

* "VITAL FORMS: AMERICAN ART AND DESIGN IN THE ATOMIC AGE, 1940-1960," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 6). The use of organic forms in the visual arts exploded after World War II, drawn from the human figure and its components along with plant, teardrop, amoeboid, cellular and molecular shapes. This ambitious display of more than 250 fine art and design objects tracks the use of these "vital" forms in mediums from highbrow painting to popular consumer products. The organizers argue that the artists were expressing humanism and humane values at a time of worldwide cataclysm, but not enough is made of the role that Surrealism and its dream imagery played. Still, the exhibition does a good job in demonstrating that by the mid-1950's the hard-edged machine esthetic of the prewar years had given way to a visual language centered more on natural forms, helped along by more flexible materials. There's some enlightening and enjoyable looking here, but in the show's broad coverage some of the work -- particularly the paintings -- gets a little lost. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3 for students and 62+ (Grace Glueck).

Galleries: Uptown

"EXQUISITE MOMENTS: WEST LAKE AND SOUTHERN SONG ART," China Institute, 125 East 65th Street, (212) 744-8181 (through Dec. 9). New York's big fall show of Chinese painting is installed in a very small space: two galleries at the China Institute that together could fit in a coat-check room at the Met. But square footage doesn't matter. Scale and quality do. Most of the 40 or so paintings in the show, on loan from premier American museums, are also small. Created in the form of album pages and fans, they are a one-on-one sort of art, meant to be brought out every now and then and savored, like love letters, in private. And as with love letters, the emotions conveyed are sweet, intense and sometimes deep (Holland Cotter).

* "NUMISMATICS IN THE AGE OF GROLIER," Grolier Club, 47 East 60th Street, (212) 838-6690 (through Nov. 17). A handsome show about an obscure subject: Renaissance illustrated books about ancient coins, with many of the coins and Renaissance medals they helped inspire. The illustrations, like the coins, are elegant and refined; the history offered in lengthy wall texts is a trove of obscure information. The larger fascination, for those not drawn to its elaborate scholarship, is the dialogue between media: how sculpture, in the form of these coins, influenced book illustration, which influenced sculpture, and so on. A curio: 16th-century prints of all the Roman emperors lined up in profile, with spaces left at the end, just in case, for future monarchs (Kimmelman).

Galleries: 57th Street

SOPHIA VARI, Nohra Haime, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 888-3550 (through Nov. 17). This Paris-based sculptor makes pedestal-scale bronzes in classic Cubist style but with a playful, contemporary feel. Selected planes of Ms. Vari's compacted, jumbled towers of spheres, ovoids, box shapes, pie sections and other sorts of volumes are painted in bright primary colors, which stand out against the near black sheen of the patinated bronze. The sculptures have a cheerfully decorative, slightly cartoonish appeal (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

JAYNE HINDS BIDAUT, "Natural Selection," Ricco/Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-4819 (through Jan. 5). You could mistake the shadowy, ghostly pictures of birds, museum dioramas and female nudes for experiments from the early years of photography. In fact, they were made by a contemporary artist using an old-fashioned process known as the dry plate tintype. Her most ambitious work is a mural of 50 large plates in a grid, on which she has orchestrated a vast collage of photogramatic images of plants, animals and human figures to represent the expulsion of Adam and Eve (Johnson).

TANIA BRUGUERA, "La Isla en Peso," LiebmanMagnan, 552 West 24th Street, (212) 255-3225 (through Nov. 17). This is the first United States solo show for Ms. Bruguera, a young Cuban performance artist who made a much-noticed contribution to last year's Havana Biennale. In her video installation in a black-out gallery, a taped cacaphony of animal noises fills the air. Eight screens carry the artist's contorted face moving in slow-motion: she seems to be floating under water. Her image is replaced periodically by lines from a poem, "Island Burden," which refers to water, animals, memories and entrapment in a hallcinatory account of a single day in Cuba, where "night closes over poetry, and forms blur" (Cotter).

MARY ELLEN CARROLL, "Mistakes and Lies, Part 2," Frederieke Taylor, 535 West 22nd Street, (646) 230-0992 (through Dec. 1). Works by this witty conceptualist include eye-buzzing paintings based on camouflage patterns found inside bank security envelopes; a quote from Gertrude Stein, slightly altered, in green neon lights; a video of auditioning, visibly sweating actors reading descriptions of the artist; and a panel with enlarged copies of corrections published in The New York Times, one of which concludes, "In fact, as Mr. Scott informed The Times yesterday, the wedding never took place" (Johnson).

LOIS DODD, "Mind the Gap," Fischbach, 210 11th Avenue, near 25th Street, (212) 759-2345 (through Nov. 17). Ms. Dodd has been making regular excursions to the Delaware Water Gap area in Warren County, N.J., since 1975; this 25-year selection of canvases reveals an accomplished painter deftly balancing particulars of place and Cezannesque abstraction (Johnson).

FLECHEMULLER, "Call My Mom," Gracie Mansion, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 645-7656 (through Nov. 24). This painter and photographic prankster presents enigmatic, slightly weird paintings of children copied from old clothing catalogs and funny photographs -- some digitally altered, some not -- that include one of a dog jumping improbably high in a bathroom and another of a long black limousine with the words "God Is Invincible" written in big white letters across its side (Johnson).

SIDNEY GOODMAN, ACA, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 206-8080 (through Nov. 24). This veteran Philadelphia realist-turned-allegorist doesn't shy away from big visionary themes. On large canvases, in a portentously illustrative style, he depicts giant cartoon animal balloons menacing a terrified crowd; nude people levitating as though caught up in the Last Judgment; and a nude pregnant woman recumbent on a huge pile of toys as a naked, wild-haired toddler looks on like a fierce little god (Johnson).

FRANK HOLLIDAY, "Trippin' in American," Debs & Co., 525 West 26th Street, (212) 643-2070 (through Nov. 17). An infectious reckless abandon fuels Mr. Holliday's Neo Abstract Expressionist paintings. Pouring, dripping, splattering, smearing and brushing, he produces expansive vibrantly sensuous and psychedelically spacey pictures. In each, a thick, black, tubular line snakes across or into the illusionistic depths like the path of an ecstatic mental traveler -- or a tripping hippie -- through his own visionary mindscape (Johnson).

LANSING-DREIDEN, LFL Gallery, 531 West 26th Street, (212) 631-7700 (through Nov. 17). Lansing-Dreiden is the collective name of a group of young artists working with drawing, digital animation and music. Their collaborative efforts are based on, or inspired by, elements from the fragmentary output of two earlier artist-writers, Friedrich Lansing and Caspar Dreiden, who lived in South America in the 1950's. The main piece in this engaging show is a black-and-white animated film titled "Quiet Earth," an episodic, surreal adventure narrative with a trippy continuous rhythm and a gently propulsive score by a band called the Lines, who are Lansing-Dreiden members (Cotter).

MORRIS LOUIS, Paul Kasmin, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474 (through Dec. 22). This excellent selection of canvases by the pioneering Color Field painter includes darkly glowing works from the "Veils" series; light-as-air examples of the "Unfurled" series; candy-colored stripes; and, most arresting, "Para III," which with its flowing pools of liquid red, green, orange and yellow is like a hallucinogenic light show (Johnson).

STEPHEN MUELLER, Bill Maynes, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 741-3318 (through Nov. 17). Glowing watery plaids, candy-colored stripes and checks and emblematic shapes that look Middle Eastern are playfully layered by Mr. Mueller in canvases both optically riveting and mystically suggestive (Johnson).

Galleries: SoHo

* "HEAVENLY VISIONS: SHAKER GIFT DRAWINGS AND GIFT SONGS," Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166 (through Dec. 15). In mid-19th century America, the Shakers experienced a period of revivalist fervor that included a spiritual reconnection with the sect's magnetic founder, Ann Lee (1736-1784). The presence of Mother Ann and the early Shaker saints was felt at prayer meetings. A few community members received supernatural "gifts" from them in the form of symbolic visual images which they turned into drawings. At once didactic and decorative, the drawings have no parallel in American religious history or art and they are among the least familiar components of Shaker visual culture, famed for its no-frills domestic objects. Elaborate, intricate, dense with detail, they are ethical guides to life on earth and charts to the world beyond. Nearly 80 of the 200 or so drawings that survive are included in this fantastic show, organized by the Drawing Center (Cotter).

Other Galleries

"A BREEZE FROM THE GARDENS OF PERSIA: NEW ART FROM IRAN," Queens Borough Public Library, 89-11 Merrick Boulevard, Jamaica, (718) 990-0700 (through Dec. 29). This library not only serves one of the city's most diverse and ardently book-loving clientel, it also presents some memorable art exhibitions. The work in this show, organized in cooperation with the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art and Tehran Arts University, ranges from miniature painting to modernist abstraction. Technical polish is high, though by current international standards the results are conceptually conservative. What's most interesting is the way artists play with traditional forms, sometimes almost obscuring them without abandoning them, as in the case of calligraphy, which finds some fantastic variations here (Cotter).

* "EXPANDING ON A LEGACY: AMERICAN ART FROM THE MONTCLAIR ART MUSEUM," UBS Paine Webber Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, near 51st Street, (212) 713-2885 (through Nov. 30). In the 19th century Montclair, N.J., was a thriving art colony whose best known member was the landscapist George Inness (1825-1894), and it had high-minded citizens with cultural aspirations. A splendid result was the Montclair Art Museum, which opened in 1914 and today is one of the country's leading small museums of American art. This sampler of some 80 paintings, sculptures and American Indian art is meant to bring its treasures to a larger audience while it completes a renovation. A 1782 portrait by Gilbert Stuart; a major Inness landscape; realist canvases by John Sloan and Edward Hopper; a good slice of early Modernist work by Arthur Dove, Stuart Davis and Morgan Russell; an early Abstract Expressionist theme by Adolph Gottlieb; a group of sculptures by names like Daniel Chester Frency, Louise Nevelson, Man Ray and George Rickey, and an elegant Tlingit totem pole from the Northwest Coast make this an appetizing prelude to the feast across the river (Glueck).

"LARGER THAN LIFE," Center for Figurative Painting, 115 West 30th Street, (212) 868-3452 (through Nov. 30). The standouts in this five-artist show are two painters of opposite but equally ambitious sensibility: Leland Bell, whose large, perfectly composed figure compositions project an Apollonian love of order and clarity, and Paul Georges, a passionate hedonist whose big, recklessly vigorous painting of wild pink roses under a bright blue sky evokes a summer day to almost unbearably delightful effect (Johnson).

Last Chance

* "CASPAR DAVID FRIEDRICH: MOONWATCHERS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sunday). Think of this exquisite, 19-work exhibition as a bit of fanfare played pianissimo. It heralds the arrival of "Two Men Contemplating the Moon," the museum's first painting by the supreme German painter of the Romantic era, who made nature his cathedral and placed figures before it as before an altar. Concentrating on paintings of figures transfixed by the moon, it brings out the more intimate and serene side of Friedrich's temperament. The show also includes a few paintings and drawings by his contemporaries and disciples. One result is a surprisingly vivid sketch of the artist and his circle, which offers the opportunity to get a sharper sense of his extraordinary achievement. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).

ANNA GASKELL, "Resemblance," Casey Kaplan, 416 West 14th Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-7335 (through tomorrow). Ms. Gaskell continues to produce the staged, dreamlike photographs of young girls engaged in mysterious, vaguely sinister activities for which she is well known. More surprising, and in some ways more imaginative, are her spidery cartoon fantasy drawings; she'd be a good illustrator for a new edition of Grimm's Fairy Tales (Johnson).

RED GROOMS, "Selections From the Graphic Work," National Academy of Design Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through Sunday). For all its ebullience, the art of Mr. Grooms as represented in this 100-piece print retrospective is curiously tedious. He produces teeming, riotously colored cartoons of metropolitan life and affectionately satiric portraits of artists from Courbet to Pollock to Chuck Berry. Many prints are made to be cut and folded into children's-book-style pop-up scenes or three-dimensional volumes, as in a boxy portrait of Gertrude Stein that looks like a parade balloon. But lacking the weird darkness of, say, James Ensor or the philosophical complexity of Saul Steinberg, Mr. Grooms's art remains psychologically if not formally one-dimensional. Hours: Wednesdays and Thursdays, noon to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $8; $4.50, students and 65+ (Johnson).

* DAVID HOCKNEY AND HENRI MATISSE, "Line Drawings," Artemis Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212) 445-0444 (through tomorrow). Not a few artists of the last half-century or so owe much to the wizardly draftsmanship of Matisse, and Mr. Hockney is a pretty good example. This show tries to suggest through their works on paper -- Matisse's from 1918 to 1948; Mr. Hockney's from the 1960's and 70's -- the effect of Matisse's spare but supremely articulate line on the younger artist. At its best, Matisse's sprightly drawing is a lesson in the eloquence of brevity. Mr. Hockney's work is tighter and fussier, his line more broken, his subjects more particularized by detail. Still, as his later portraits make clear (particularly of Vera Russell in 1983), he has learned much from Matisse's willful looseness, his ability to imply by the sketchiest of suggestion elements of hair, clothes and body language. The playing off of one's work against the other's makes an intriguing exhibition (Glueck).

GEORGIA O'KEEFFE, Gerald Peters, 24 East 78th Street, (212) 628-9760 (through tomorrow). This modest selection of works by the legendary American painter includes a small watercolor of grapes and oranges, painted in 1904 when the artist was just 17; atmospheric abstractions in watercolor, made with deft economy in 1916; and, best, two small oils, one a picture of a single dark purple fig on pearlescent gray cloth and the other of an almost supernaturally glowing red flower in a white glass (Johnson).

FAIRFIELD PORTER, "Drawings From the Estate," Hirschl & Adler, 21 East 70th Street, (212) 535-8810 (through tomorrow). None of the 83 drawings assembled for this well-produced show are nearly as memorable as Porter's best paintings. Sketchy and loose, they look hastily generalized rather than uniquely observant. Nevertheless, many have diaristic charm -- portraits of the artist's daughter playing guitar, for example, or views of small-town streets populated by cars and trucks. Some pictures of ocean waves could be mistaken for Cy Twomblys (Johnson).

* JAMES SIENA, Gorney Bravin & Lee, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-8372 (through tomorrow). Mr. Siena's captivating abstract paintings look as though they were created by someone in an altered, mildly ecstatic state of consciousness. Spiraling lines, nesting boxes, complicated lattices and other patterns are executed by a patient but eccentric hand in glossy, richly colored enamels on smallish aluminum panels. The results are a combination of systematic complexity, comic style and seductive sensuality that is mesmerizing and irresistibly delightful (Johnson).

HEADLINE: INSIDE ART 

BYLINE:  By Carol Vogel 

 BODY:
A Pedigree With Pull
 Some names -- like that of the publishing magnate Malcolm S. Forbes -- carry a special cachet, especially at auction. Forbes, who died in 1990, was an avid collector of everything from antique toys to Faberge eggs to Orientalist paintings. His collection and those of his five children have been on public display at the Forbes Gallery at 60 Fifth Avenue. 
 This week, Christie's announced that it would auction 62 American paintings and sculptures from the Forbes Collection on Nov. 29. The works are expected to bring $7 million to $10 million. 
Later, the auction house will be selling historical manuscripts from the collection, including handwritten manuscripts from Abraham Lincoln, Albert Einstein and John F. Kennedy. The manuscripts, valued at more than $10 million, will be sold in two auctions, on March 27 and Oct. 11, 2002.
Monie Begley, a spokeswoman for the Forbes Collection, said the family had decided to sell some works because Forbes's children have different tastes and have decided to refine their collections. "As our interests and focuses change, obviously the nature of the collections change," said Steve Forbes, president and editor in chief of Forbes magazine, in a written statement.
This isn't the first Forbes property Christie's has sold. In 1993 it auctioned a collection of Orientalist paintings, drawings, watercolors and sculptures that had been housed at the Palais Mendoub in Tangier. In 1997 it sold a collection of toy soldiers.
"What's most exciting is the diversity of great material at the high end," said Eric P. Widing, head of the American paintings department at Christie's.
Among the offerings is "Moorish Courtyard," a 1913 painting by John Singer Sargent in which the artist combines the grand proportions of a building's courtyard with the less glamorous function it serves by showing two donkeys in the foreground. The painting is expected to sell for $1 million to $1.5 million.
The Forbeses are known for enjoying the American West, often vacationing at the family ranch in Colorado, and several paintings up for sale on Nov. 29 celebrate that interest. Among them will be an Edward Hopper watercolor, "Mount Moran," painted when the artist was visiting the Grand Tetons in Wyoming in 1946. It is expected to sell for $600,000 to $800,000. (The Forbes Collection sold its best Hopper, a large interior, to the actor Steve Martin privately two years ago for a reported $10 million.) By far the best work up for sale is "Buffalo Hunt" (1897) by the cowboy artist Charles Marion Russell, and it carries an estimate of $800,000 to $1.2 million.
But given the Forbes provenance, prices could go a lot higher. "We're hopeful, but who knows?" said Stephen S. Lash, chairman of Christie's in America. "It's a great name."

Miami Has to Wait
What is sure to be the hottest contemporary art fair in America and this country's answer to the famous Basel Art Fair -- Art Basel Miami Beach -- has been postponed.
The organizers of the Basel fair spent five years planning to bring 150 of the world's leading dealers to Miami from Dec. 13 to 16 for the first Art Basel Miami Beach. But it has been put off a year and is now to run from Dec. 5 to 8, 2002.
"The galleries and the collectors asked us to put the fair off," said Samuel Keller, the fair's director. "It was a combination of politics and economics. The effects of the attack on the World Trade Center meant transportation problems for many of the dealers."
There were other problems, too, Mr. Keller said. Insurance was a big worry for many dealers, and psychologically, many people said they were still afraid to travel.
"We need this show in the long term," Mr. Keller added. "It's better to do it next year."

Gallery in Transition
The fate of Colnaghi, one of London's oldest art galleries, has become a matter of much speculation in both New York and London ever since Jean-Luc Baroni, its managing director, announced last week that he was leaving the company, taking senior staff members with him, and that the business might close unless a new owner could be found.
Mr. Baroni, who has been with Colnagi for nearly 20 years, is one of London's major dealers in old master drawings. In July he paid $8.4 million at Sotheby's in London for Michaelangelo's "Study of a Mourning Woman" and in January he bought Cuyp's drawing of a panoramic view of Dordrecht at Christie's in New York for $2.8 million, a record for the artist. 
Mr. Baroni joined Colnaghi in 1982 to establish a new drawings department. In 1996 its owner, the Oetker Group, run by Rudolph Oetker, a German businessman, restructured the business and asked Mr. Baroni to take over the paintings side of the gallery as well. A five-year agreement was signed by Mr. Baroni and the Oetker Group, which has now decided to end its involvement with Colnaghi.
"They asked me to buy the entire business," Mr. Baroni said. "I felt torn about it, but there was just too much overhead." Instead, Mr. Baroni decided to set up his own more streamlined operation beginning Jan. 1. The entire senior staff of Colnaghi is to join him in his new venture, Jean-Luc Baroni Fine Art Ltd., in which he will continue to deal in paintings and drawings from the 15th to the early 20th century. He is looking for a new space for the gallery in London.
One person whose name has surfaced as a potential buyer for Colnaghi is Konrad Bernheimer, a leading old master dealer with a gallery in Munich and an office in London.
"Yes, it's true they've offered me the company," Mr. Bernheimer said. "That's all I can say. Right now we're in the middle of negotiations."

An Opening in Houston
Ned Rifkin has resigned as director of the Menil Collection and Foundation in Houston after not quite two years. This week he was named director of the Smithsonian Institution's Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, succeeding James Demetrion, who retired early in October after 17 years. Mr. Rifkin is to begin his new job on Feb. 1. Meanwhile, the Menil plans a search for a replacement.

HEADLINE: Tighter Fuel Standards? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Better Cars, Cleaner Air" (Op-Ed, Nov. 2):
 Daniel F. Becker argues that federal mileage requirements on vehicles should be tightened to reduce our dependence on oil. 
 But Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations have already failed to do this, because increased fuel economy leads to an increase in miles traveled. Thus, oil savings have been less than a tenth of what they were projected to be.
And increases in mileage regulations would cost 100,000 jobs and increase new vehicle costs by thousands of dollars each -- to say nothing of the 1,300 lives lost each year in the smaller vehicles these mandates create.
Congress should meet our energy needs without tangling a struggling economy in red tape or wasting thousands of lives on America's highways.

HEADLINE: A Free Mitsubishi? No, Not Quite 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN 

 BODY:
THE hard-edged radio voice proclaims that Mitsubishi is offering "triple zero": zero money down, zero percent interest and zero payments until 2003. It sounds as though the company is giving away its cars. 
 But only about a quarter of the people who walk into a showroom and buy a car get the triple treatment, said Pierre Gagnon, president of Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America. The company divides buyers into three tiers of creditworthiness; only those at the top qualify for the full zero treatment. 
 Another twist: the free financing expires once the buyer actually starts making payments in 2003. The prevailing market rate will then apply.
Mitsubishi's average spending on incentives was less than $1,500 a vehicle last month, compared with an industry average of $2,900, the company said. "It's profitable for us," Mr. Gagnon said. The zero-percent, five-year deals offered by some manufacturers are "a lot more expensive than zero percent for 14 months," he added. "We're not giving away the farm."
But some industry analysts detect a whiff of desperation. Jeff Schuster, director of North American forecasting at J. D. Power & Associates in Troy, Mich., said Mitsubishi was caught between Korean automakers like Hyundai and Kia and the high end of the Asian import market, dominated by Toyota, Honda and a revitalized Nissan. He also said that Mitsubishi "runs the risk of hurting its brand with these special deals."
But Mr. Gagnon said Mitsubishi was headed for a record sales year and was attracting more savvy and affluent buyers. Consumer awareness of the brand is at an all-time high, he added. 
The triple-zero offer continues through November and may be extended month by month. WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN

HEADLINE: Ready for W.T.O. Talks, and Ready to Deal 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
As trade ministers converge on Doha, Qatar, for a World Trade Organization meeting that begins on Friday, Japan, long the world's staunchest multilateralist, is quietly hedging its bets, pursuing a parallel policy of negotiating bilateral free trade agreements.
 Frustrated by the glacial pace of group talks, fearing a rising China and hoping to tailor deals to protect its antique agricultural sector, Japan is talking one on one with its major trading partners. After disdaining bilateralism and regionalism in the 1990's, Japan now faces trading blocs in North America, South America and Europe. 
 Just this week, China announced that it had agreed to negotiations aimed at forming in 10 years the world's most populous trading bloc: 1.3 billion Chinese, plus the 500 million inhabitants of 10 Southeast Asian countries.
At the same time, Japan's exports are shrinking and its once-vaunted trade surplus is melting like butter. For the first half of this fiscal year, from April through September, Japan's trade surplus was 43 percent below the level of the comparable period last year. 
"W.T.O. is still the major interest for us, but it takes years to conclude a new round," said Nobuo Tanaka, vice president of the government's Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry. Referring to Japan's sudden surge of interest in bilateral free trade associations, he added, "I can see associations with Korea and Mexico, Canada and Australia."
Last month, Japan wrapped up a free trade agreement with Singapore, the first such bilateral agreement for Japan, which is the world's third-largest trading nation, after the United States and Germany. Seeing itself as a Pacific trading hub, Japan is encouraging new bilateral spokes to Mexico, Australia, Canada, Chile, South Korea and Taiwan.
Behind the interest is the realization that giant Japanese trade surpluses are as passe as disco music.
In the first half of this fiscal year, Japan's trade surplus was down 6.5 percent with the United States, 33.5 percent with Europe and 59.5 percent with Asia. Over the last two years, imports have grown steadily, while exports have stagnated or dropped. Trade surpluses, part of Japan's economic identity since 1965, could disappear in five years.
"Back in the 1980's and early 1990's, we were not interested in free trade agreements, but since then, we have started to become surrounded by these groups, in Europe and the United States," said Noboru Hatakeyama, chairman of the Japan External Trade Organization, a government trade promotion agency that favors bilateral pairings.
In Doha this weekend, Japan plans to pursue an agenda of keeping farm protection, liberalizing trade in services, standardizing investment rules and restricting antidumping practices. But after the collapse of the 1999 trade meeting in Seattle, Japan has become disenchanted with the slow pace of the 142-member organization.
Surrounded by water and lacking in natural resources, Japan has historically been sensitive to its dependence on foreign trade. Many Japanese still believe that the United States and Britain provoked the war in the Pacific when they cut Japan off from Asian sources of oil and rubber in the summer of 1941. Modern Japan imports most of its food and its energy sources, a dependency that was underlined last week when Japan's last coal mine announced that it would close in January.
At international trade meetings, Japan has usually taken refuge in multilateralism, joining with Europe to protect domestic farmers with tariff walls. The crowd was a safe place for the Japanese to avoid drawing Japan-bashing attention for protectionist stands.
Robert G. Wright, Canada's ambassador to Japan, said, "For 40 years, Japanese were the strongest multilateralists on the block, then they suddenly felt very isolated, with free trade associations all around them." 
If a liberalization agenda does not emerge from Doha, Canada and many other countries will line up to negotiate bilateral trade agreements with Japan, which is still the world's second-largest economy despite a decade of low growth.
"When Japanese authorities look in the direction of Singapore and Mexico, I want them to find Canada on their radar screen," said Pierre S. Pettigrew, Canada's minister of international trade, during a visit here last month. "We should also be thinking about what Japan and Canada could be doing together."
Under one timetable, a Japan-Mexico free trade pact would go into effect in two years. Eying a backdoor to the United States, the Toyota Motor Corporation announced last week that it planned to build a manufacturing plant in Mexico by 2003, joining Nissan and Honda there. Australia and Japan have asked a bilateral business panel to deliver a feasibility report six months from now on a free trade association.
Taiwan and Japan agreed last month to conduct a similar study for the potential of trade integration. In announcing the joint effort, Taiwan's economic affairs minister, Lin Hsin-yi, noted that among the world's 30 largest economies, Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan are the only ones without free trade agreements. (Japan's agreement with Singapore is to go into effect next April.)
"They must be very ambivalent about all this," Michael H. Armacost, president of the Brookings Institution, said last month on a visit to Tokyo, where he was United States ambassador from 1989 to 1993. "When I was here they felt that multilateralism was the best way to go."
Spurring Japan to action is the fear that Asia is falling into China's economic orbit, a move that could lock Japan into peripheral isolation.
China is urging the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to begin free trade negotiations, Atsushi Yamada, a columnist for Asahi Shimbun, warned last month. "If Japan does not act forcefully to liberalize its markets," he added, "it will likely be left out in the cold."
Seeking friends, many Japanese are once again looking across the Pacific to the United States. Some talk of a liberalized trading pact between the two nations, which have the world's largest economies.
The big obstacle would be agriculture. Japan maintains high import tariffs and funnels about $4,500 in subsidies into each acre of farmland -- far more than Australia, Canada and the United States.
The votes of Japanese farmers keep the Liberal Democratic Party in power, and the government shows no interest in liberalizing agricultural imports.
"As long as we include goods and agriculture, both Japan and the U.S. will encounter political difficulties," Ryozo Kato, Japan's new ambassador to the United States, said in an interview here late last month. Trade could be promoted, he said, through a different kind of free trade association, "one which sets aside goods and focuses more on the mobility of people, services and investment."
But in recent speeches, Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, has shown little interest in compromise. In one he said that "opening markets for U.S. farmers and ranchers is a top priority in our trade agenda."
Bilateral agreements have to be submitted to a World Trade Organization committee for review, largely to make sure that they do not discriminate against other countries. To avoid setting off alarm bells, Japan and Singapore have labeled their new agreement an Economic Agreement for a New Age Partnership.
While major food exporters, like Canada and Australia, do not want to drop the issue of Japan's agricultural subsidies unilaterally, their views seem tempered by pragmatism.
"About 35 percent of Canada's global trade is in services," said Mr. Wright, the Canadian ambassador. As for working out a deal with Japan, he added, "Before we say it is not doable, let's see what's doable."

HEADLINE: Terror War Offers Russia New Hope For Membership 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON with BIRGIT BRAUER 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
With China's membership in the World Trade Organization set to be sealed at the group's summit meeting in Qatar over the next few days, Russia remains the only big world power outside the global trade club.
That is a major disappointment to Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, who has made entry into the 142-country group a top priority. The Kremlin, which began its bid eight years ago, sees membership as crucial to its effort to remake its checkered reputation as a tough place to do business.
 Concerns over Russia's ability to transform its markets and come up with changes to its legal system that would help protect contract and property rights have shadowed several years of accession talks. 
 But now, the war on terrorism has ramped up Russia's chances as America has begun to take a noticeably softer tone toward its new coalition partner. The United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, visited Moscow at the end of September and talked with top officials there about Russia's entry into the W.T.O. Russian negotiators are set to convene again at the trade group's headquarters in Geneva on Dec. 10.
"It's a new political world," one American trade negotiator said. "We have been meeting with them and are changing our expectations for accession. The amount of energy we've been devoting has definitely increased."
Floundering economically just three years ago, Russia began a series of reforms to overcome impediments to business and attract foreign investment.
That, along with the country's new relationship with the West, may ease the atmosphere of the talks, which have often been frosty.
Last July, for instance, a W.T.O. committee questioned whether Moscow could bring its laws into line with group membership requirements. Russia has dozens of bills pending to remake its legal structure in areas including intellectual property and contracts.
Stung by the tortuous negotiations with China, during which promises were often made and broken, some member countries had resolved to be tougher on Russia, nailing down all the membership requirements in advance.
Russian negotiators were furious at suggestions that they submit draft legislation to the W.T.O. for approval. Russia's chief negotiator, Maxim Medvedkov, said that constituted treatment different from what other countries seeking membership had received, including the former Soviet republics Georgia and Moldova, which joined recently. There were Russian mutterings that "now they want to legislate our laws from Capitol Hill," according to one negotiator.
At the time, Russia had been pressing for entry as early as 2002, but Mr. Medvedkov said the date would more likely be three or four years away. That timetable could well be moved up now. "There is a willingness on the part of W.T.O. to speed up the accession of Russia because we realize it is doing hard work in adapting and adopting its legislation," said a spokesman for the trade group, Josef Bosch.
Mike Moore, the group's director general, has strongly backed Russia's entry. He traveled to Moscow last March to support the Kremlin's effort, noting that among Russia's toughest hurdles are its agricultural policies, which are running up against demands by the Americans, Australians and Europeans for freer market access.
Russia does not want to be left behind its former Soviet subordinates. In addition to Georgia and Moldova, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and Kyrgyzstan have joined the W.T.O. Kyrgyzstan is the only Central Asian country that has joined, but Tajikistan has applied and Kazakhstan is also eager to belong.
Kyrgyzstan, the first former Soviet republic to join, in 1998, has not seen much benefit yet, largely because it joined far ahead of its neighbors, and those neighbors have done little to expedite the passage of Kyrgyzstan's exports, experts say.
Kazakhstan's deputy prime minister, Oraz Jandosov, is also keenly aware of the issue. "It is important for Kazakhstan to join W.T.O. at the same time as Russia," he said, to "avoid distortions in the existing trade balance."

HEADLINE: Slump Seen Continuing for Asia Airlines 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: BALI, Indonesia, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
Asian airline earnings will suffer over the next 12 to 18 months as business travel demand drops, regardless of any improvement in economy-class travel, the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines said today.
 "The major financial effect is the collapse of the front-end" business class market, which is "primarily weak because as company profits fall, people travel less," said David Turnbull, chief executive of Cathay Pacific Ltd., in a speech at the association's annual conference in Bali, Indonesia. 
"Economy travel will return first, but the front end will take time," he said on behalf of the association's 18 member airlines. 
 Profit margins on business- class tickets tend to compensate for lower economy-class margins.
Airlines worldwide were already suffering from falling sales before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States, which came as the global economy was cooling. Companies have begun restricting travel to a minimum and shifting executives from business- to economy-class cabins.
Airlines like the Japan Airlines Company, the All Nippon Airways Company and the Korean Air Company, which rely heavily on trans-Pacific revenue, "have suffered enormously," said Richard Stirland, the association's director-general. "Southeast Asian airlines which rely more on intra-Southeast Asian travel have escaped relatively unscathed."

No Jerry Lewis, but Saudi Telethon Reaches Goal

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 

 BODY:
The midnight deadline ending Saudi Arabia's recent national telethon for the Afghan people was fast approaching, with the tally well short of the goal, when a $5 million pledge phoned in from King Fahd pushed it over the top. 
 Throughout the event, religious sheiks on screen urged Saudis to give copiously to relieve the suffering of fellow Muslims. Viewers responded in droves, their outpouring turning the courtyard of the state-run television studios into something resembling a giant Saudi garage sale. 
 The yard overflowed with giant tin trunks bursting with heavy gold bangles and pearl necklaces, refrigerators, mountains of blankets, air-conditioners, a jeweled sword, stoves, a wedding dress, cars, a wheelchair, giant tubs of dates. 
In the last hour, as the total surpassed $36 million, one of the religious scholars on screen made a historical aside about a violent event in the kingdom in 1979. He noted that Saudi Arabia wiped out a band of terrorists who seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca after a mere 15-day siege. 
"This is the way you handle terrorists, you should only deal with those who are perpetrators," said Sheik Saad al-Majid. "The way we handle terrorists is such that no innocent people were killed."
It was thinly disguised criticism of the American bombing in Afghanistan. Remarkably, however, throughout the event not a single presenter referred directly to the American bombardment.
Not a word was said about the quest to hunt down Osama bin Laden, nor the attacks in the United States. So the reason the Afghan people might need help went unmentioned.
The Saudi government has been picking a careful path between supporting Washington in finding those responsible for the attacks and expressing unease -- widely felt in the kingdom -- over the deaths and injuries suffered by Afghan civilians. 
The telethon perfectly mirrored the government's way of doing business: throw money at nasty problems and leave the unpleasant details under the rug. (This is, after all, the same government that took three days in 1990 to announce to its own people that one neighbor, Saddam Hussein, had invaded Kuwait, another neighbor.)

Ask the Sheik
Television, of course, has something of a checkered history in the kingdom. Introduced in 1965 by King Faisal, it provoked riots that had to be suppressed by armed soldiers. The religious condemned it as an innovation inspired by the devil, with at least one fanatical sheik issuing a fatwa damning it as a forbidden innovation. 
Over time, however, the devout discovered that broadcasts could be used to disseminate religious programs. Now much of the programming propagates the unadorned Wahhabi brand of Islam prevalent in the kingdom. 
There are even programs in English clearly pitched to non-Saudis, providing a kind of neighborhood sheik for foreigners. It's all part of Saudi Arabia's self-assigned task of spreading the faith, a role under scrutiny for helping transmit extremist interpretations in places like Afghanistan. 
For example, on the country's second channel an early evening English program, "Questions On Line," deals with viewers' quandaries about Islam. A moderator presents questions arriving by phone, fax or e-mail to a religious sheik who gives an instant response.
Recent inquiries on one evening's program ranged from whether it was acceptable to eat cake offered by infidel neighbors, to the best way to clean oneself after using the toilet, to how long to abstain from prayers if one is bleeding after a medical operation. 
On the subject of eating infidel cake, the viewers were told, "It is acceptable to eat cake offered by a non-Muslim, except if it is for a religious holiday or festival."
(Not that there is much chance for such open festivities in the kingdom. Worship other than Islam is illegal with violaters subject to deportation, and the only official holidays are the two main Islamic ones.) 
The sheik warned that eating such infidel cakes might imply recognizing the holiday. He said the same went for holiday presents, unless accepting them somehow served to convert the giver to Islam. 
On the matter of toilets, the sheik at first said good Muslims should prefer water over toilet paper. (Toilets in most of the Arab world come equipped with a hose for the very purpose.)
After answering another question, the sheik came back to the query and gave a slightly different, more involved answer. It is not wrong to use paper if the water is present, he intoned, but the optimum solution would be to employ both.
The moderator takes all questions in his stride, although he occasionally tells a viewer that something is too personal to be aired publicly and a private response is forthcoming.

Delayed Moment of Silence
More than 1,500 students attend the American International School of Riyadh, about half of them holders of American passports. Some are from the Middle East but were born in the United States while a parent (or both) was obtaining a graduate degree. The rest are members of expatriate families living in the kingdom. 
Some of these American students were a little taken aback when their request for a moment of silence to remember the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks ran into objections from the rest of the student body. Opponents remarked that perhaps there should be three years of silence for all the victims of oppressive governments supported by Washington. 
Finally, a week after the attack, parents, administrators, faculty and students did reach consensus and the school stood silently for a minute. The moment was in support of world peace.

Career Planning
With its booming young population, Saudi Arabia can no longer guarantee every college graduate the once-standard government job that garnered bureaucrats comfortable salaries while requiring a mere four-hour work day with frequent tea breaks. 
The lack of jobs causes grumbling and breeds a growing resentment toward the luxurious trappings of the al-Saud princes. But some young Saudis like Abdel-Rahman al-Turki, a 24-year-old senior at King Saud University in Riyadh, still aspire to that perfect job.
It is an uncommon sentiment among the current crop of college graduates, he admits, especially those studying subjects like history and geography. "In some majors, they are not only afraid of not finding a job, they have basically abandoned hope," he said. 
But Mr. Turki hit on what he hopes will be the magic formula for getting the kind of government job that might allow for sitting around all day reading newspapers: he's majoring in Hebrew. 
He noted that his Hebrew department had jumped over the last few years from a mere certificate program with a few dozen students to a full major attracting about 100. 
"It's a good opportunity to serve the country," he said, "Plus you have to do something these days to distinguish yourself. You need a speciality."
He summed up his goal by quoting a saying of the Prophet Muhammad: "Who learns the language of a people will be safe from their cunning."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Are Mixed Despite an Early Boost From Europe

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks ended with modest gains yesterday while technology stocks slipped as the market ran into a wall of profit taking after a big rally built on interest rate cuts by European central banks.
 Stocks also slid after the Oct. 2 minutes of the Federal Reserve's panel that sets interest rate said the Sept. 11 attacks could worsen the buildup of inventory -- a persistent problem for technology companies -- and that its current rate-cutting could be reversed if the economy expanded too quickly. 
 Investors remained uncertain, with signs of an expected recovery still absent and corporate profits in dismal shape. The Nasdaq composite index has also risen 28 percent since it hit a three-year low on Sept. 21, a move that has prompted some investors to lock in profits, analysts said. 
"Now we're just getting some normal profit taking and pullback after a big move," said James Volk, co-director of institutional trading at D. A. Davidson & Company. "There are still a number of people who are skeptical, including myself, as to when and to what extent this economy is going to turn around."
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which at one point had climbed 2.8 percent, ended with a loss of 9.76 points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,827.77. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.15 points, or 0.4 percent, at 9,587.52. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.74 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,118.54.
American stocks initially bolted higher after the European Central Bank and the Bank of England cut rates by a surprisingly hefty half a percentage point. The reductions came on the heels of a similar cut by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday.
"To really combat recession and recessionary pressures here at home, we need to see the rest of the world firm up a little bit," said Charles Payne, an analyst at Wall Street Strategies. "The interest rate cut by the E.C.B. caught a lot of people off guard in a good way."
At the Dow's high of the day -- up almost 170 points -- the blue-chip index had erased all of the steep loss it made after the Sept. 11 attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center sent the market tumbling. The Nasdaq and S.& P. 500 have already clawed back from their post-attack losses as investors looked past the bleak economic environment and bet on a comeback.
"You're going to see a cumulative effect of rate cuts, and I think you're going to see a huge rally into the end of the year," said David Holzer, managing director of trading at Brean Murray & Company. "There's no return in bonds, C.D.'s are yielding under 2 percent, and investors have to switch to the equity market. Money managers are going to get fired if they sit on cash." --------------------

Treasuries Are Lower
By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday as a decline in jobless claims and interest rate cuts by European central banks signaled the United States economy could rebound sooner than originally thought.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 22/32, to a price of 105 21/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.28 percent from 4.22 percent on Wednesday. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 7/32, to 107 30/32. The bond's yield rose to 4.86 percent from 4.79 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Toyota Bucks the Economy And Posts Record Earnings 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
It's a good time to be a company that sells cars for dollars and counts its profits in yen. While American carmakers struggle with losses, Toyota's profits are booming.
 Today the company reported the largest half-year profit in its history: $2.4 billion for the period ended Sept. 30, up 82 percent from the period a year ago. Strong sales in the United States, cost-cutting and favorable movements in exchange rates were responsible, the company said. It even raised its full-year profit forecast, something hardly any Japanese company has done lately. 
 Global sales rose 6.4 percent during the period.
Toyota dominates its home market with a 42 percent share, but it sells as many cars in the United States as it does at home, and more than two-thirds of its profits are earned overseas. Each dollar it reaped in America bought 7 percent more yen at the end of the half-year than at the beginning. 
But earnings would be healthy even without the currency effect, because of a string of vehicles -- the Sequoia, the Highlander, the RAV-4 sport utility vehicle and an updated Camry sedan -- that have proved popular, especially in America. "We're quite bullish about our sales in the U.S.," Ryuji Araki, the executive vice president, said. Global sales rose 6.4 percent in the half from the period last year.
The auto industry in general is bracing for declining sales next year, but Toyota should outperform the competition because it will revamp its top-selling car, the Corolla, for the first time in five years, said Christopher Redl of UBS Warburg Securities in Tokyo.
Mr. Redl said he expected Toyota to move ahead of Daimler-Chrysler in the global sales rankings for several months next year, cracking the industry's top three for the first time. Daimler-Chrysler has no major introductions planned for next year.
"They're on a roll, they're cruising," Mr. Redl said of Toyota.
Toyota's largest domestic rivals, Nissan and Honda, have lowered their projections for unit sales next year. Mr. Araki acknowledged that Toyota may not be able to fulfill its forecast, which it raised by 2.5 percent. "Uncertainty will likely continue for the time being as a result of the terrorist attacks," he said.
Though Toyota has plenty of cash -- 501 billion yen ($4.14 billion) on Sept. 30 -- the company has cut back on its low-cost financing in America as its rivals have expanded theirs. Still, its American sales jumped 27.5 percent in October.

HEADLINE: Fed Panel Saw a Need to Buoy Confidence 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
The need to support a stumbling economy by bolstering consumer and business confidence led Federal Reserve policy makers to lower the overnight bank lending rate by half a percentage point on Oct. 2, minutes of their meeting showed today.
 The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, and his nine colleagues on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee saw "increased evidence of a faltering economy and the decidedly downside risks in the outlook" as reason to approve a ninth cut in the federal funds rate this year, to 2.5 percent, the minutes said. 
 That half-point shift was repeated on Tuesday as the Fed cut the benchmark short-term rate to 2 percent, the lowest since 1961, and indicated that it stood ready to take further action. The economy shrank 0.4 percent at an annual pace in the third quarter as consumer confidence fell in the wake of the terrorist attacks. 
"Further vigorous easing action would tend to support business and household consumer confidence, which a number of members saw as especially important in the current circumstances," the minutes said.
Consumer price inflation "appeared likely to remain subdued or perhaps trend a bit lower" as labor markets eased and energy prices fell, the minutes said.
A stock price decline and a widening of interest rate spreads also eroded the effect of past rate cuts, the minutes said. At the same time, "continued firmness in the dollar, and "more sluggish performance in many foreign economies" was hurting export prospects.
The Fed, which had already cut borrowing costs in the weeks after the attacks, thought the "economy appeared to have been growing very little, if at all, prior to" the destruction of the World Trade Center and a section of the Pentagon.
"The dislocations," it said, "seemed to have induced a downturn in overall economic activity against the backdrop of heightened anxiety and uncertainty about economic prospects and a sharp drop, at least initially in stock prices."
Anecdotal reports suggested that business spending was still in "the process of moving lower" at the same time economic weakness abroad was adding to concerns. "In these circumstances, a substantial further drop in consumer and business confidence and spending could not be ruled out," the Fed said.
The panel members thought it "likely that the prospects for added job losses and the decline in equity wealth already experienced would hold down consumer expenditures over the months ahead," according to the minutes. 
The Fed panel expressed concern that business spending would remain depressed. "The decline in business confidence and corporate profits along with the currently high levels of excess capacity in many industries pointed to the persistence of poor prospects for capital spending" in the months ahead, the minutes said.
Still, the panel considered a "robust upturn" in business spending likely at some point, and was optimistic about the possibility of an economic rebound. According to the minutes, it saw a "relatively mild and short contraction followed by a gradual recovery next year."

HEADLINE: The Outlook for Saks Is Weak as Its Sales Tumble 

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
With shoppers skittish about the economy and worried about terrorism, many retailers have experienced drops in business this year. But the pinch is sharp at Saks Inc.
 The company, which includes Proffitt's and Carson Pirie Scott as well as the empress dowager of department stores, Saks Fifth Avenue, was wobbling before the economic slump stemming from the Sept. 11 attacks. Sales at the company fell markedly in the first half of the year, more than at other department store chains like Federated Department Stores and Nordstrom. For most retailers, the outlook remains bleak for the end of the year. 
 After a major slump in September, sales perked up industrywide in October. But Saks still looks weak. At Saks division stores open at least a year, sales fell 15.9 percent in October after a 23.5 percent decline in September. At all the stores open a year, including Proffitt's, sales dropped 6.4 percent in October after an 11.5 percent decline in September.
Saks has additional complications. While the mannequins in its Fifth Avenue windows are skeletal, a three-year buying spree by its chairman, R. Brad Martin, has left the company with robust debt. With sales in decline, the company still has to make payments on about $1.6 billion in debt.
Early in October, Moody's Investors Service warned that it was on the verge of downgrading Saks's debt for the second time since August.
"The company has had a lot on its plate," said Angela Jameson, the Moody's analyst who issued the warning, "and now the environment has turned against it." About 7 percent of sales come from its flagship store on Fifth Avenue near 50th Street in Manhattan, where tourism and shopping have slowed.
In the first six months of the year, Ms. Jameson noted, Saks's earnings fell 78 percent.
"Saks Inc. is more highly leveraged than a number of its competitors," Ms. Jameson added. "The unforeseen events on Sept. 11 have exacerbated an already declining operating trend." 
Moody's dropped Saks's bonds to junk grade in August. Standard & Poor's also downgraded Saks's debt in August, where it remains below investment grade, and has a negative outlook. With such ratings, Saks may find it hard to borrow, although Ms. Jameson noted that the company reduced its debt by about $410 million in the first half of this year and had valuable real estate and franchise assets.
Doug Coltharp, the chief financial officer of Saks, said Moody's announcement was disappointing. He called it "a precipitous action specifically related to the events of Sept. 11 and the fact that we have a major presence in New York City."
To compensate for weak sales, Mr. Coltharp said, the company is taking a number of steps, from cutting inventory to shrinking expenses. Selling costs should drop this year, he added, in part because of a new distribution center in Alabama as well as electronic procurement and travel systems that have replaced more expensive, labor-intensive ones.
To build profits, "we remain focused on our core customers," he said, "and on executing our product, marketing and customer service strategies." 
When Proffitt's, the retailer based in Birmingham, Ala., that Mr. Martin used as an acquirer, announced that it was buying Saks in 1998, many analysts considered the price too high and the outlook too uncertain. The day the deal became public, Proffitt's stock dropped $4 a share in heavy trading to $36.6875. The announcement of October sales pushed shares in the renamed company down 20 cents each yesterday, to $7.15.
At $2 billion, or about 13 times earnings, the Saks deal was the priciest of Mr. Martin's acquisitions. Though he boldly predicted that he would trim inefficiencies and otherwise bolster profits at the chain, which included a catalog business and 96 stores, Saks was already in good shape and cutting further would not be easy, analysts warned.
Another concern was that the culture of Saks Fifth Avenue -- peddling luxury to a sophisticated clientele -- might not fit well with the culture that serves the patrons of stores like Carson Pirie Scott and Proffitt's. Mr. Martin's past performance consisted largely of rapid store expansion that helped stoke earnings.
"You've got a company that moved from merchant management to financial management, and now finds itself tragically overleveraged," said Burt Flickinger III, a consultant with Reach Marketing in Westport, Conn.
After renaming the combined company Saks Inc., Mr. Martin introduced Saks Off Fifth, a kind of Saks substitute for the off-price crowd. He continues to preside over Saks and the other company chains, including McRae's, Younkers, Herberger's, Bergners and Boston Stores. Last year, Mr. Martin announced that Saks would spin off Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises, essentially all of the stores bearing the Saks name as well as its catalog company. That plan has since been called off.
Much more has changed, but none of it in Saks's favor. "The company's core department store group is seeing its customers transition from class to mass," Mr. Flickinger said, "trading their shopping trips at Proffitt's for trips to Kohl's and Target."

HEADLINE: New Unemployment Claims Drop Sharply 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
The number of workers filing new claims for state unemployment benefits plunged last week to the lowest level in one-and-a-half months, suggesting that the pace of layoffs may be slowing, a government report showed today.
 Initial jobless claims dropped by 46,000, to 450,000, in the week ended Saturday, compared with a nine-year high of 535,000 at the end of September. Last week's claims were the fewest since the week of the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 The number of people continuing to collect benefits rose to 3.72 million in the last week of October, the highest since April 1983. The number of continuing claims is a measure of laid-off workers' ability to find new jobs. The four-week moving average of new claims, which smooths out variations in the weekly figures, fell to 487,250 from 496,000.
In a separate report, import prices showed a record decline in October, led by the biggest drop in petroleum costs in a decade and decreases for building materials and computers, the Labor Department said. Last month's 2.4 percent drop in the import price index, the seventh decrease this year, came after a 0.1 percent increase in September.
The jobless rate rose to a five-year high of 5.4 percent in October, and service companies eliminated the most jobs in one month since 1983. 
This year, weekly jobless claims have averaged 403,000, up from last year's weekly average of 303,000 and the most since 407,800 in 1992. In 1991, claims averaged 448,000. The government's statistics are based on requests for financial assistance administered by state employment service agencies. The insured unemployment rate -- which tends to track the overall jobless rate -- held at 2.9 percent in the week ended Oct. 27. It measures the number of people receiving benefits divided by the number of workers covered by the program.

European Central Bank And Britain Lower Rates
With European nations slipping closer to recession, both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England reduced their benchmark interest rates by a half-percentage point.
 The rate cuts were deeper than many analysts had expected, and they were greeted with relief by investors. But they did not defuse criticism that the European bank had been too slow and too rigid in responding to deepening signs of economic distress. Page C2.

Toyota reported the largest half-year profit in its history: $2.4 billion for the period ended Sept. 30, up 82 percent from results in the period a year earlier. Strong sales in the United States, cost cutting and favorable movements in exchange rates were the reason. C3.

Outlook Weak for Struggling Saks
With shoppers skittish about the economy and worried about terrorism, business has dropped at many retailers this year. But the pinch has been particularly sharp at Saks. C4.

Retailers' October Sales Rose 0.9%
Retailers' sales in October rose a better-than-forecast 0.9 percent as consumers sought low prices at chains like Wal-Mart Stores and Kohl's and avoided clothing retailers like the Gap, industry figures showed. A 6.7 percent increase at Wal-Mart helped to lift the industry's sales at stores open at least a year, a crucial measurement, above the forecast for no gain, according to the Goldman, Sachs retail composite index.

HEADLINE: Fewer Choices For Workers On Benefits 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Tens of thousands of employees are being forced to drop their health plans and choose a different one this month as companies across the country sharply reduce their rosters of H.M.O.'s and other managed care insurers.
 Some employees will have to change doctors as well, if their physicians are not on the roster of the new health plan. Everyone who makes the switch will have to deal with a new set of customer service representatives and often different rules and out-of-pocket payments. 
 Health care economists say large employers are trying to force the managed care companies to hold down their charges as they compete for a smaller number of large contracts. Employers say that by reducing the number of plans, they can save money and tighten control over the quality of care. 
But critics like Alain Enthoven, a professor of management at Stanford, say employers are "going in exactly the wrong direction." With fewer choices, he said, doctors and hospitals will be under less pressure to compete by lowering prices.
Consumer advocates charge that the cutbacks are part of a strategy to shift more of the costs gradually to employees as health care inflation spirals upward.
"Businesses have found that they don't have a magic bullet to reduce their own costs," said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer group based in Washington. "Their strategy is going to be to shift those costs and the burdens, and push people into more restrictive health plans." 
The narrowing trend comes after years in which companies made more medical options available, said Jim Maxwell, health policy director at the JSI Research and Training Institute in Boston.
"Because of the managed care backlash," he said, "employers backed away from the tougher forms of managed care," which had helped to restrain cost increases, he said. And as the insurers changed their products to try to attract plan members, they dropped many of the restrictions that kept costs in check. For example, many health maintenance organizations stopped requiring members to get second opinions before treatments could be approved, and many no longer required permission from an internist or other primary doctor before a patient could consult a specialist.
Now, though, employers are facing rising health costs along with a weak economy, and their only way to keep expenses in check "is to negotiate more aggressively with the carriers," Mr. Maxwell said.
The changes are extremely widespread. In five years, 93 percent of Fortune 500 companies reduced the number of health insurers they offered, and none increased the number of insurance carriers, Mr. Maxwell reported in a study completed last year for the National Health Care Purchasing Institute.
In just the last two years, Sears, Roebuck dropped 120 health maintenance organizations and kept 65; American Express jettisoned 164 health plans and kept only 48. This year alone, Xerox removed 92 H.M.O.'s from its roster of 222 for employees wishing to choose a new plan, but current members of these H.M.O.'s could remain.
Sears, which covers 100,000 employees across the country, felt "forced into" dropping H.M.O.'s that demanded steep premium increases, said Liz Rossman, vice president for benefits at Sears. Some health plans were asking for 70 percent and 80 percent increases. She said most employees whose plans were dropped would still have access to the same doctors through a large national network offered by Empire Blue Cross. 
Employers said that when they used many insurance plans, each one covering a relatively small number of employees, it was hard to negotiate rates effectively.
Arleane Baltrusitis, vice president for benefits at American Express, which covers 60,000 employees, 6,000 retirees and their dependents, said that with 164 insurers, it was "difficult to know what you were getting, if you were really getting value." 
"In the 70's and 80's, the concept was to contract with everyone in sight" in cities across the country, she said.
"Twenty years later," she added, "we realized we had lost any leverage" with the H.M.O.'s. With relatively few employees in each local plan, she said, American Expresscould not negotiate with the H.M.O.'s on services or what the contract was going to look like.
Now most American Express employees have a choice of an H.M.O. or a doctor in a preferred provider network through UnitedHealthcare, an operating unit of the UnitedHealth Group. 
Xerox has tried another approach. Larry Becker, benefits director, said that to try to have better control of the dozens of health plans it still has outside its manufacturing center in Rochester, Xerox was dividing them into four groups that would be managed by Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, UnitedHealth, Aetna and Kaiser Permanente.
Smaller companies are also narrowing their sights. Kestrel Technologies, a rapidly growing software company based in Manhattan with 60 employees in seven states, hired Empire to take over from six health plans.
"I wanted to try to reduce premiums and provide equal benefits to all our employees," said Jake Karam, chief financial officer of Kestrel. The company's premium rates have plummeted 30 percent for the new year, he said, in part because insurers were more interested in covering a larger group of employees.
The drive to reduce the number of plans is spurred by the fact that as companies have laid off employees, their benefits departments have shrunk, leaving fewer workers to deal with health care insurers. "There is a greater push to do it this year because the rates are up and the benefit department has been downsized along with the rest of the firm," said Larry Boress, executive director of the Chicago Business Group on Health, an employers' group.
Consultants say H.M.O.'s are demanding premium increases of up to 17 percent from large companies for 2002.
Companies "are looking for one-stop shopping," said Laurel Pickering, executive director of the New York Business Group on Health.
Mr. Boress says the health plans are eager to become employers' sole health care managers. They offer discounts of at least 5 percent for the privilege, he said. "Insurers are terrified of selling a more comprehensive plan and competing with a less comprehensive plan" that siphons away healthier members, said Paul Ginsburg, president of Health Care Change, a research group based in Washington.

HEADLINE: Why the Chicanery in Connecticut? 

BYLINE:  By Colin McEnroe; Colin McEnroe is a radio talk show host and writer.

DATELINE: HARTFORD 

 BODY:
This has been exactly the kind of perfect autumn that can be so easily used to shore up the image of Connecticut on postcards, in movies, in the American mind. Parti-colored leaves tumble down from refulgent skies pierced by white Congregationalist steeples.
 Somewhere Katharine Hepburn is sipping tea and gazing across the sound, and Cheever's commuter is staggering off the 5:07 to Darien. 
 This is Connecticut. The land of steady habits and stern Thomas Hooker theology, right? 
Not in Waterbury, where a wide-ranging investigation into City Hall corruption was interrupted this summer when the Justice Department slapped soon-to-be ex-Mayor Philip Giordano with a 14-count indictment for sexual abuse of children.
Not in Bridgeport, where a federal grand jury chose Halloween to say "trick!" to Mayor Joseph P. Ganim, indicted last Wednesday on 24 felony charges -- a mix of racketeering, bribery and tax evasion, and a charge connected to accepting around $10,000 in what prosecutors called "investment quality wines." 
Not in the corridors of state government, where stomachs are still jumpy over an ongoing, years-long criminal probe by federal prosecutors who persuaded a former state treasurer, Paul J. Silvester, to plead guilty to racketeering and conspiracy to launder money. The Silvester affair has produced a flurry of guilty pleas and indictments, and federal prosecutors say more "targets" are being pursued.
These three scandals clump together into a nearly indigestible lump of chicanery in a state whose familiarity with political corruption is faint. Nobody is suggesting that the previous half-century in the state was an unblemished stretch of probity, but nobody can remember anything remotely like this.
Consider some of our paradigmatic political figures.
Lowell P. Weicker aimed his blunderbuss at Watergate and then ran for governor with the slogan, "Nobody's Man but Yours."
Ella T. Grasso was a governor of spartan habits and prim Mount Holyoke ways. When Bridgeport's mayor is accused of illegally accepting $4,300 in men's suits, one cannot help but remember Governor Grasso as a woman so uninterested in style that she once allowed a newspaper editor to design her inaugural dress.
Joseph I. Lieberman assumed not only Mr. Weicker's United States Senate seat but also the Weickerian tradition of being among the first to rebuke, on moral grounds, a president from one's own party.
How did we get from them to these scandal-ridden politicians? 
One explanation put forward by some pundits is the ghost town theory, but it doesn't quite wash. Yes, urban flight has emptied Connecticut's beleaguered cities of property-tax-paying homeowners. To shore up the crumbling tax bases, Connecticut has hurled hundreds of millions in state bond money for urban revitalization and school construction. So the close-up scrutiny formerly provided by local taxpayers has given way to a comparatively distant and casual management by government officials in Hartford. Still, Waterbury seems to have been able to hang onto its property owners.
I tend to think the blame lies with the virtual disappearance of interparty strife. Connecticut politics has become a big, sloppy love fest. Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, is almost fawning in his admiration for Senators Lieberman and Christopher J. Dodd, both Democrats. It is practically considered bad manners for either party to field a realistic candidate against any of these three men. Indeed, Senator Lieberman's last Republican opponent was Mr. Giordano. 
Mr. Silvester, a Democrat-turned-Republican, is the perfect Janus-like symbol of the era. As the federal probe pulled back the curtain on his operation, we saw a world in which heavy hitters from both parties could earn millions of dollars -- often quite legally -- by opening doors for out-of-state investment firms. In this time of unflagging, frequently lucrative amiability, neither party has called very loudly for "throwing the rascals out."
Or perhaps there is no single, unifying cause for our troubles, and the scoundrels will inevitably be replaced by leaders worthy of our steadier past. 
On Tuesday night, I stood in a packed restaurant while a salsa band throbbed and Hartford celebrated the mayoral victory of Eddie Perez. Mr. Perez was born in Corozal, Puerto Rico. He came to Hartford in 1969 and wound up in a very tough gang, the Ghetto Brothers. But he got out and over the past 20 years has become a respected community organizer.
At 44, he's the first Latino mayor of a Connecticut city. The crowd was exuberant, talking politics in two languages. The Irish-American city treasurer was waving a Puerto Rican flag. Late autumn is a strange time to grow anything in Connecticut, but perhaps Mr. Perez's victory might be the start of a political spring.

HEADLINE: McGreevey Asks for Freeze On Spending In New Jersey 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
With their common nemesis, Bret D. Schundler, finally out of the picture, Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco and Governor-elect James E. McGreevey met for lunch today at Drumthwacket, the executive mansion in Princeton, where both men promised a smooth transfer of power and pledged to work together to tackle New Jersey's looming budget deficit. 
 But Mr. McGreevey's hand-holding session with his favorite Republican followed an outbreak of backbiting among his fellow Democrats in the State Assembly, who recaptured the majority on Tuesday for the first time in a decade but failed to choose a new speaker at a contentious closed-door session this morning. 
 Mr. McGreevey also announced today that he had selected Anthony R. Coscia, a former chairman of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, to direct budgetary operations during the transition. 
Perhaps the easiest part of Mr. McGreevey's day was his meeting with Mr. DiFrancesco, the Republican acting governor who a year ago was seen as his foremost rival. Over grilled chicken sandwiches in the mansion's library, the two discussed what is projected to be a shortfall in the current fiscal year of more than $700 million, and a projected deficit in the following year, beginning next July, that could top $2 billion.
Emerging side by side through patio doors for a backyard news conference, Mr. McGreevey and Mr. DiFrancesco were positively chipper despite the ponderous challenge before them. Mr. McGreevey said he had asked the acting governor to freeze state spending and to have the Treasury Department provide him with a more current and realistic picture of the state's finances.
And Mr. DiFrancesco, who ascended to the governor's office in February when Gov. Christie Whitman resigned to join the Bush administration, assured Mr. McGreevey of his full cooperation and even promised that before vacating the office in January, he would leave Mr. McGreevey with a projected surplus for the current fiscal year.
"We will be open, honest, accessible and responsible," Mr. DiFrancesco said. "And I personally pledge to help him in every way possible to fully understand the awesome responsibilities, the tasks and the opportunities that lay before him. It has only been 10 months since I was kind of in Jim's shoes, so I am acutely aware of the kinds of information and assistance that an incoming governor needs to hit the ground running."
Mr. DiFrancesco also offered to act as a go-between for Mr. McGreevey with the White House and Tom Ridge, the director of homeland security.
This morning, meanwhile, as legislators met in their party caucuses for the first time since Tuesday's election, Mr. McGreevey, who has served in both the Assembly and the Senate, ran from one room to another in unannounced visits, in the debut of what his advisers say is likely to be an aggressively friendly governor.
The Senate, after all, is divided 20-20 for the first time in 64 years, meaning that gridlock will ensue unless at least one lawmaker crosses party lines on every vote.
"Partisanship must end," Mr. McGreevey said at his afternoon news conference. "It will end."
But some Republican senators, who spoke after Mr. McGreevey briefly addressed their caucus this morning, expressed a concern that the era of good feeling may be short-lived because the next round of Senate elections are in only two years. 
"We've already talked about 2003 this morning, in looking at where we can begin to try to develop a platform," said Senator Robert J. Martin of Morris Plains.
Senator John Bennett, the Republican leader, preached solidarity to his colleagues. Senator-elect Leonard Lance, who is moving up from the Assembly, bolstered that argument by pointing out that, in the aggregate, Republicans had received more votes in the Senate elections than had the 20 Democrats -- an argument last heard from Democrats citing Al Gore's victory in the popular vote for president.
On the Democratic side, meanwhile, Richard J. Codey, now the minority leader, refused even to discuss a power sharing arrangement, holding out hope that a narrow Republican victory in one South Jersey Senate district would be reversed in court.
Democrats in the Assembly appeared to face an internal split that was nearly as paralyzing as the stalemate in the Senate. Joseph V. Doria Jr. of Bayonne, who was speaker when Democrats lost the majority 10 years ago and has been the minority leader ever since, is facing a stiff challenge for the speaker's job from Joseph J. Roberts Jr. of Camden, the state Democratic chairman.
A showdown had been set for a vote at this morning's caucus meeting. But several Democrats said that Mr. McGreevey, in a first test of his leadership, had tried to broker a peace by proposing a compromise candidate, Assemblyman Albio Sires, a freshman lawmaker and the mayor of West New York.
Mr. McGreevey's proposal was rebuffed by both sides in the leadership fight, Democrats said. And as they caucused this morning, Mr. McGreevey appeared to ask them to postpone their decision. They agreed, by a vote of 23 to 21.
Both Mr. Doria's and Mr. Roberts's loyalists claimed that their man had enough votes to win the speaker's job today. But the delay left allies of Mr. Doria crying foul, accusing Mr. McGreevey of having gone back on a promise to support Mr. Doria for speaker, and suggesting that the narrow vote to grant the governor-elect his delay boded poorly for his abilities as a peacemaker.
In any case, Democrats on either side said it remained possible for another compromise candidate to be agreed upon. 
One such person whose name was mentioned by several officials today was Bonnie Watson Coleman of Ewing Township, who would be the first black woman to hold such a high office in New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Up From Seattle 

 BODY:
Trade ministers from 142 nations will meet in Doha, Qatar, today for a conference of the World Trade Organization. Their agenda is much the same as the ill-fated ministerial meeting in Seattle in 1999, when attempts to bridge the gap between poor and wealthy countries' priorities blew up in a cloud of tear gas. The whole world has an interest in seeing this gathering turn out better. With the world's terrorized economy stuck at a standstill, the time is ripe for a cooperative, international push for growth through trade. 
 The ministers' goal in Qatar is to launch a new set of comprehensive trade negotiations. During the original Uruguay Round, which led to the creation of the W.T.O., rich countries pledged to open their markets to textiles, crops and other basic exports from the developing world. There has been some progress in that area, but arcane customs rules, unnecessary red tape, stingy quotas and anti-dumping programs still keep poor nations' exports out of wealthy markets. Now protectionist politicians are trying to erect more barriers by exploiting concerns about border security and food safety. 
 Wealthy nations have their own set of favorite trade issues. The United States wants more protection against theft of intellectual property. American negotiators also want their trading partners to end protectionism in the sale of services, like long-distance phone calls and insurance policies. An increasingly powerful cadre of medium-size economies like those of Brazil, Egypt and Mexico are insisting that faster fulfillment of commitments from the Uruguay Round come first. Several nations also want concessions on drug patents. India, suddenly a critical ally for the West, has vowed to block a new round of talks unless they focus on helping poor countries.
There is a chance of progress this time around, since the W.T.O.'s members have agreed to a draft proposal that could lead to some smart compromises on key issues. The United States and the European Union appear willing to put aside their many trans-Atlantic trade spats to focus on broader topics. Though Japan has sandbagged on the crucial question of farm trade, this time the overall mood is optimistic.
Another failure would be disastrous. If these talks break up without starting a new round of trade negotiations, poor countries could, with some justification, give up their hopes that a global trading system will lead to open markets for their products. After just six years, the W.T.O. could find itself eclipsed by regional trading blocs in Asia, Europe and North and South America.
Failure in Qatar would harm more than just the prospects for freer trade. It would endanger the very existence of an inclusive, consensus-driven organization in which 142 countries have a meaningful stake. That would hurt international rapport when it is needed most. The United States must do everything it can to keep the world at the negotiating table.

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
It seemed impossible, at a time when fingernail clippers are being confiscated by the hundreds at American airports, that a man could slip past a checkpoint at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago with a bag of knives, Mace and other weapons.
 But security experts in the aviation industry were not surprised to learn that the workers running the scanners at that United Airlines terminal on Saturday were employed by Argenbright Security, the nation's largest and most frequently criticized airport-security company. The incident in Chicago only added to a long list of security lapses involving the company -- like hiring workers with criminal records and forging documents to cover up its failure to perform background checks. 
 Argenbright has come to dominate the industry in the last 20 years with a corps of 6,000 checkpoint screeners, almost all of whom make little more than minimum wage and receive no health benefits or sick days. Its security problems and high turnover have become the principal argument of those in Congress who want to federalize airport security. 
The company, which began as a small polygraph operation in 1979, has been an aggressive competitor in the battle to get contracts with major airlines and now has 40 percent of the nation's airport security business. Just today the company began handling Southwest Airlines flights at the Baltimore airport. 
But as the airlines sought to cut costs and award security contracts to the lowest bidder, screening companies began what many in the industry call a race to the bottom, hiring employees at the lowest possible wages and cutting corners to keep checkpoints manned, with turnover approaching 400 percent a year in some airports. 
Argenbright's rise has been accompanied by federal convictions on conspiracy to avoid performing background checks for employees in Philadelphia last year, a jail term for one company supervisor, and probation for the company in Pennsylvania and Illinois. A labor-law judge ruled the company illegally threatened to dismiss employees after they went on strike to protest low wages.
"The corporation couldn't have been blind to what was going on in places like Philadelphia," said Billie H. Vincent, the director of civil aviation security at the Federal Aviation Administration in the 1980's and now president of an airline consulting firm in Virginia. "The system in effect forced them into dishonest activity and made it impossible to do the job without cutting corners."
Bill Barbour, Argenbright's president, said in a conversation this morning that he would call back to discuss his company, but did not do so. In legal documents, however, company officials have said the Justice Department has exaggerated the extent of the background-check problem, although the company recently agreed to extend the length of its probation with the United States Attorney's office in Philadelphia. 
On Sept. 11, two teams of hijackers believed to be carrying box cutters passed through Argenbright checkpoints at airports in Washington and Newark, and at two other companies' checkpoints in Boston. 
The federal government said a few weeks ago that even after Argenbright agreed to conduct better background checks on its workers, it continued to hire them by the hundreds without adequately examining their pasts. Attorney General John Ashcroft accused the company of committing "an astonishing pattern of crimes that could have directly jeopardized public safety" at 13 of the nation's largest airports where it screens passengers.
"Argenbright Holdings continues to violate laws that protect the safety of Americans who travel by commercial airlines," Mr. Ashcroft said. "Our investigation shows Argenbright Holdings has hired predeparture screeners who have disqualifying criminal convictions, including convictions for theft, burglary and illegal drug possession, and that Argenbright Holdings made false statements about its employees' backgrounds."
Congressional supporters of federalizing airport security regularly use Argenbright as an example of why the system must be removed from the private sector.
The company, with 19,000 employees, says it is forced to hire large numbers of low-wage screeners quickly because of the high turnover and the cost strictures imposed upon by the airlines, which are responsible for security but hire contractors like Argenbright to do the work.
"A.S.I. faced certain challenges and had certain initial missteps in the implementation of the program" to correct its problems, wrote John C. Dodds, a lawyer for Argenbright Security Inc., in a letter to federal authorities in August. "However, over the past several months, the company has made substantial progress, which I expect will continue going forward."
Mr. Dodds said part of the reason for the company's problems was its acquisition last December by Securicor P.L.C., a British security company that paid $185 million for Argenbright. Mr. Dodds said the transfer temporarily slowed down its plans for improvement. Argenbright had been a division of AHL Services Inc., which continues as a marketing and customer-fulfillment company for other businesses. Its founder, Frank A. Argenbright Jr., was appointed chief executive of Securicor's American security operations, the offices of which remain in Atlanta.
A review of hundreds of pages of government documents on Argenbright demonstrates patterns of mismanagement that help explain why the industry has become such a target in Washington. 
As prosecutors revealed in last year's criminal case in Philadelphia, Argenbright for years had no internal controls or audit systems that would have detected its district manager's deliberate forging of workers' histories to hide criminal convictions and hire as many people as possible.
Prosecutors said many of the 1,300 Argenbright workers at the Philadelphia International Airport had been hired despite failing a test required by the aviation agency, or without taking the test at all. Dozens had criminal records, including felony convictions for forgery, aggravated robbery, narcotics possession and aggravated assault. One had been arrested for kidnapping. 
Instead of the required 40 hours of training, hundreds of workers were simply shown a 45-minute video and pronounced by Argenbright fit to begin X-raying carry-on baggage and running the metal detectors.
The Philadelphia district manager who changed the workers' histories, Steven E. Saffer, told his superiors of serious problems at the airport, but they did nothing about it, prosecutors said. Mr. Saffer is serving a 30-month federal prison sentence, and two of his colleagues at the airport received fines and probation. None of Argenbright's top officials were indicted, but the company pleaded guilty to two counts of making false statements to the agency and paid fines and penalties of $1.55 million.
Assistant United States Attorney John J. Pease, who prosecuted the case, said the penalties would have been far greater had the company not agreed a year ago to begin a program to prevent such problems from recurring.
"We could have charged them with 100 counts, or 1,000," Mr. Pease said, "but from our perspective it was much more important to get them to begin a program of compliance. We wanted to change their corporate culture."
That is why the Justice Department and the agency were so astonished to discover that Argenbright had not taken care of the problems after last year's plea agreement. 
In a series of spot checks over the last 12 months, those agencies found that the company continued to employ and hire departure screeners with criminal backgrounds, failed to have a program of independent verification of worker's backgrounds, and waited nine months to even have a meeting of its new compliance management committee.
The government found violations of aviation agency regulations by Argenbright at Dulles International Airport and Reagan National Airport outside Washington, La Guardia Airport in New York, and the major airports in Boston, Los Angeles, Detroit, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Dallas-Fort Worth, Seattle, Trenton, Columbus, Ohio, and Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
"This conduct is inexcusable and is a clear violation of the terms and conditions of its probation," prosecutors told a federal judge on Oct. 11. Although the company disputed several charges, court transcripts show that it acknowledged the overall lapses, and agreed on Oct. 23 to have its three-year probation extended by two years until October 2005. It agreed to submit compliance reports to the government and begin fingerprint background checks of workers once the agency makes available equipment for them. 
Argenbright pulled out of the Philadelphia airport last month, citing economic reasons. But its successor, Aviation Safeguards of New York, has also had problems. It was sentenced to two years of probation and fined $110,000 last year after a supervisor at Miami International Airport allowed 22 employees to work in secured areas without performing background checks and then lied about his actions to the F.A.A.
Argenbright's troubles in Philadelphia were not its first. In 1999, Northwest Airlines terminated its contract with the company at the Detroit airport after seven security breaches, including one in which a screener mixed up two women at a metal detector and failed to stop one who had set off the device. Five concourses were shut down as officials searched for the woman, who turned out not to be a threat.
In June, Argenbright had to pay a $10,000 fine to the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation, which found that the company had not filed registration forms for 97 employees. And after Saturday's incident at O'Hare, the company fired two of its workers who were caught on videotape stealing two of the knives that had been confiscated from the man who tried to take them aboard the aircraft.
Mr. Argenbright was a criminal justice major from Florida who became interested in polygraph machines after being required to take a lie-detector test when applying for a job in a camera store. 
He opened his own polygraph company and soon began doing other security work for his clients. The company prospered as it met the growing demand for airline security in the 1980's that followed deregulation, and by 1997 had become a diverse holding company with 60 offices and annual revenues of more than $200 million. 
Its strategy of hiring minimum-wage screeners and replacing them at a rapid clip ran into trouble in 1999, however, when its employees at Los Angeles International Airport walked off the job to protest their $5.75-an-hour wages and lack of health benefits and sick days.
Mr. Vincent, the former F.A.A. security director, said: "Argenbright was aggressive in getting its contracts, but they didn't do anything the others didn't do, either. These were terribly unattractive jobs, filled by people who were always looking for another job. To keep the jobs filled and meet the airlines' quota, they had to cheat, and I'm sure you could find exactly the same things at other airports if you looked hard enough."

HEADLINE: Republicans and Democrats Face New Reality in Nassau 

BYLINE:  By ELISSA GOOTMAN

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Nov. 8 

 BODY:
Not long ago, a Democratic takeover of Nassau County government would have been more than a disappointment for Republicans. It would have been unthinkable. 
 But this week, the Democrat running for county executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, defeated his Republican opponent by nearly 2 to 1. A Democrat unseated the incumbent county comptroller, and the Democrats retained their narrow majority in the County Legislature. 
 Many Nassau Republican officials have been saying they were relieved that they did not fare worse. 
Even as the storied Nassau County Republican organization adjusts to the new reality of being a party out of power, its supporters are beginning to plot and predict its resurrection. 
"I still think Nassau County is basically Republican and wants to go Republican, but we just didn't give them the chance to do it at a county level," said Representative Peter T. King, a Long Island Republican. "We have to start attracting candidates that stand for something, taking tough positions and being willing to make people angry in the short term, as long as you have an eye on the long term."
Republicans here point to two members of their own party to explain their losses on Tuesday: Thomas S. Gulotta, the present county executive, whose fiscal mismanagement brought the county to the verge of bankruptcy, and Bruce R. Bent, the multimillionaire financier whom the party chose as his successor but who ran a lackluster campaign.
Party leaders stress that they kept control of government in Hempstead, the most populous town in the nation and the core of the Nassau party's power. "They've lost the throne, but they've been able to maintain the kingdom," said Desmond M. Ryan, a Republican lobbyist. 
But with changing demographics, shifting suburban concerns and the decline of machine politics, the kind of control the Republicans once exercised in Nassau may be history. 
The party rose to prominence by courting Irish-American, Italian-American and Jewish families, many of them Democrats who moved into the suburbs from New York City after World War II. The Republicans promised excellent services and delivered, largely thanks to a patronage operation that got out the vote for elections. 
The party's grip was so firm that until Mr. Suozzi, only one Democrat had ever been elected county executive: Eugene H. Nickerson, who left office in 1970. The last time the Democrats controlled the Board of Supervisors, the predecessor to the County Legislature, was in 1917. 
This year's election was not a surprise for the Republicans, who lost control of the Legislature two years ago. Their power has been eroding for years, particularly as it became clear that Mr. Gulotta's formula of spending lavishly on high salaries and amenities like public parks while holding the line on taxes was creating a financial crisis. 
"You would give the voters all the services they wanted, maybe give them more than they wanted, but never raise taxes," Mr. King said. "It was like Never-Never Land." 
Mr. Bent said he believed he was stigmatized by being a Republican. "The fact that I was on the Republican line just became an insurmountable problem," he said. 
Still, he said he was impressed by the party's resources. "They have people in this organization and that organization and the other organization," he said. "They are very, very broad-based in what they have out there." 
The election losses end the party's hold on county patronage jobs, so the Republicans will be able to fall back on the strong and simple message of fiscal conservatism, some say. 
"Suozzi will either govern on economic issues as a Republican or be replaced by somebody who will," said Kieran V. Mahoney, a Republican strategist, "because the county's underlying fiscal conservatism remains totally intact."
Critics say the Republican county chairman, Joseph N. Mondello, should step down, because the party's decline took place during his tenure.
"When you have to rebuild, you have to start rebuilding at both ends, the top and the bottom," said Stanley B. Klein, a political science professor at the C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University and a Republican committee member in neighboring Suffolk County. 
Mr. Mondello intends to remain as chairman, said his spokesman, Anthony J. Santino, a Hempstead town councilman. "We re-elected all nine of our county legislators," Mr. Santino said. "We're in a strong position." 
Mr. Suozzi is not disputing that. "The Nassau County Republican Party is not going away," he said the day after his victory. "For once we're going to have a healthy two-party system, and that's a good thing."

HEADLINE: Exchange Considers Move to Trade Center Site 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Four days before the city was to vote on $920 million in bond financing for a trading complex and office tower on Wall Street, Richard A. Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, cast a cloud of doubt over the project yesterday when he said he would instead consider building a new home blocks away on the former site of the World Trade Center.
 The New York Stock Exchange has told the Giuliani administration that it will wait to see what the city's plans are for "rebuilding ground zero," Mr. Grasso said yesterday at the Securities Industry Association meeting in Boca Raton, Fla. 
 But, he added, if the city and the exchange do go forward with the original $1.1 billion plan to build a new trading complex across the street from the historic home of the New York Stock Exchange, the project will include a much shorter tower, "so it won't be the tallest building in Lower Manhattan." 
The three-year-old proposal entailed a 50-story office tower rising above a 10-story trading floor on a site bounded by Wall, Broad and William Streets and Exchange Place. 
"A 900-foot tower post Sept. 11 is not a salable transaction," Mr. Grasso said.
Government officials yesterday were fuming at Mr. Grasso's very public remarks about the exchange project. In discussions with the Giuliani administration recently, Mr. Grasso explained his misgivings about moving into what would be one of the city's tallest skyscrapers and a possible terrorist target. But they did not expect him to take his fears public, said one downtown executive, nor did they urge him to consider moving to a redeveloped complex on the site of the World Trade Center.
Neither Deputy Mayor Robert M. Harding nor Michael Carey, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, returned calls requesting comment. Ray Pellecchia, a spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange, said Mr. Grasso was unavailable for further comment.
The city's Industrial Development Agency is to vote on a proposal next Tuesday to issue $920 million in tax-free bonds to finance the project, which was first announced in December 1998. It is the largest bond issue ever proposed by the agency. Under the terms of the bond, the state and city's debt payments would be $52 million a year.
In addition to the $920 million in cash from the bond sale, the state and the city had agreed to provide the exchange with $160 million in tax breaks. The exchange, in turn, had agreed to invest about $400 million in new equipment and pay an annual rent of $10 million.
The deal has come under criticism as costs have soared and some analysts have questioned the need for an expanded trading floor.
In recent months, the city signed contracts to buy the office buildings and an apartment house on the site and to relocate the tenants, at an estimated cost of nearly $480 million.
The city is temporarily moving the Bank of New York, a tenant displaced by the Sept. 11 attack, into a 37-story building on the site, 15 Broad Street.
Some developers have suggested that the New York Stock Exchange and the Board of Trade, a commodities exchange that was at the trade center, would be ideal tenants in a development at ground zero.
But Mr. Grasso's decision to say publicly that the exchange would consider moving there has reopened a debate. More than three years ago, Mr. Grasso threatened to move the exchange to New Jersey because it had outgrown its quarters on Wall Street and could not find an alternate location in the financial district.
City officials scrambled to come up with a plan for a new trading complex. Landlords and city officials feared that the New York Stock Exchange's departure would ignite a real estate disaster if nearby investment banks followed suit. The Giuliani administration agreed to give the exchange the largest subsidy package in city history.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Lawyers Being Laid Off as Deals Drop 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS 

 BODY:
From her apartment in Forest Hills, Queens, M. Catherine LaTorre made her regular call to the unemployment office Monday morning, her 59th day as a lawyer without a job. Ms. LaTorre has been able to find one, and only one, headhunter to talk to her, but after the World Trade Center attacks the headhunter was laid off herself for lack of work.
 Last week, the San Francisco law firm of Pillsbury Winthrop, saying that "this is a difficult time for all who work in New York," told associates it would lay off 11 of the 109 lawyers in its Manhattan office. The move came a week after Shearman & Sterling, with 950 associates, announced layoffs of about 10 percent from its headquarters in New York and other offices. Even before Sept. 11, other New York law firms were lopping off associates by ones and twos, and in several big firms by 10 or 15 or 25. 
 These things add up. The legal services industry in New York City lost 4,200 jobs from June to September, according to the State Department of Labor. Although these numbers usually drop when the summer interns leave, the 5 percent decline over the summer was the biggest for that period in 25 years. Moreover, the latest figures do not reflect cuts made after Sept. 11.
"I wouldn't call it a groundswell, but there was so much more going on in the last three or four months than I've seen in years," said Andrea Eisenberg, the managing principal of the New York office of Right Management Consultants, who helps laid-off lawyers find jobs.
All New York is in the same recession, of course. But in law the turn is especially sharp. And it is sharpest in the legal culture that revolves around big Wall Street deals, a culture that in the last generation has grown riskier, richer and bigger by far.
A year ago, the big firms fed by financial work couldn't find enough legal talent, and as a result, it seemed that no one else could, either. Young lawyers were fending off headhunters and comparing "retention bonuses" while their firms tried to raid one another. But just when law firms caught up with the galloping economy of the 1990's, the economy was exiting the 1990's.
In June, legal services employment in the city reached an all-time high of 84,800 -- a figure that does not include partners, who are counted as employers, or corporations' in-house counsel. It does include secretaries, paralegals and other support staff workers, who hiring experts say are probably safer than lawyers but have also been hit by layoffs.
Lawyers who aid in financial transactions have been most affected. This year, and especially since Sept. 11, "people don't want to close deals, make investments, to commit to a transaction," said Laura Corrao, a legal recruiter in Manhattan. "You talk to people at some of these firms and they're doing nothing. There's nothing to bill on."
During the hiring binge, New York firms grew fatter faster than those in other cities, by hiring for the mergers, initial public offerings and other business generated by investment banks. Their associates' salaries grew fatter, too, as in 1999 and 2000 the elite firms bid up the price of new law graduates to the going rate of $125,000. (The leader, still standing alone, is Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, paying $140,000.)
Jon Lindsey, the managing partner of the New York office of the legal search and hiring firm of Major, Hagen & Africa, said that last year some firms heavily involved in technology ventures hired 30 or 40 associates. "Now they don't want any corporate associates," he said.
The $125,000-a-year 25-year-olds and their multimillion-dollar bosses are just a minority of the 71,000 lawyers in New York City. "The bread-and-butter guys are probably still doing well," said Jim Brown, a labor market analyst for the state. So are litigators and lawyers who handle smaller commercial transactions, recruiters said.
But big-firm associates and their salaries have a disproportionate influence on the New York lawyer mind-set. Their pay is charted by national publications, and their workload is legend. At least 2,000 billable hours a year is expected here, meaning a bare minimum of more than 40 hours a week chargeable to clients, and 60-hour workweeks are routine. 
Now, on the Greedy Associates Web site (www.greedyassociates .com), the forum of choice for those working at the firms that they collectively call Biglaw, crabbing about bonuses -- the standard last year was $40,000 -- has given way to mordant jokes about getting "Shearmanated." Shearman associates often refer to the partners' profits, which last year averaged about $1.2 million.
"I heard Shearman partners are sacrificing, in a bloody, gruesome manner, 1 of each 10 associates at midnight during the next full moon," one reported the day before Shearman & Sterling announced layoffs. "Nobody will be spared!"
Still, no one doubts that these lawyers will find new jobs. As they do, they will crowd out people in the middle of the market like Ms. LaTorre, who was paid $97,500 a year by a small Midtown firm and now collects $364.50 a week in unemployment insurance.
A 1998 graduate of St. John's University Law School, Ms. LaTorre handled a variety of corporate work, most of it international, that slowed ominously over the summer. Her last day of work was Sept. 7, she said; she got "a week's courtesy" and a severance package.
Ms. LaTorre, 34, speaks fluent French and Spanish and ran a translation service before law school. But as a lawyer, "I am not the best-credentialed person," she said. "I don't have an Ivy League degree, I didn't go to a top 10 or 20 law school, and I wasn't high in my class.
"I come from a small firm. That's my natural market, small firms, but that market is being flooded by these highly credentialed people who are being laid off."
A few years ago, while those people were being courted by elite firms, Ms. LaTorre was doing well, too. She easily found a job while still in law school -- "They called me," she said -- and landed her second job after interviews with two firms.
Now Ms. LaTorre's day starts with three or four hours online, checking Web sites for job postings. She goes to social, corporate and networking gatherings of all kinds, she said, and having kept a mental tally of people she meets, figures that about one in five is unemployed.
Her own search, at least 100 letters, Ms. LaTorre said, has yielded one phone call from a law firm, a few from placement agencies and no interviews. "I've done everything short of standing on a street corner handing out my resume," she said.
"Every day, I wake up thinking, 'This is going to be the day.' " she said. " 'I've invested more than $80,000 in this career. Today's the day I'm going to see a little bit of a return.' I'm one of the few attorneys who loves practicing. I love my career."

HEADLINE: Argentina's Leader Comes Begging, Burdened by More Bad News 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
President Fernando de la Rua's critical negotiations with opposition governors to curtail spending fell apart tonight, dealing him a severe setback just before he left for New York to seek emergency international help to avert a complete financial collapse.
 The failure of a month of intense negotiations over more than $4 billion in annual public spending was a major embarrassment for a government trying to recover from an overwhelming defeat in congressional elections three weeks ago and nearing political collapse. 
 But more immediately, the setback meant that Mr. de la Rua will not be able to offer a reliable accounting of his government's 2002 budget and lending needs when he meets with President Bush and international bankers and investors over the next three days.
Highlighting the problems, scores of Argentine truckers began blockading several crossing points today along the Brazilian, Paraguayan and Chilean borders in an effort to stop imports that they say take away Argentine jobs. There was no immediate police response despite strong protests from Chilean officials. 
President de la Rua had hoped to persuade President Bush to prompt the International Monetary Fund to speed up disbursements of more than $1 billion in financing already pledged. The money is to be used as a security guarantee for banks and pension funds that are being asked to swap up to $95 billion in bonds for securities at lower interest rates. 
The restructuring of the $132 billion public debt, which would save the government $4 billion in interest rates next year, is intended to avoid an outright halt on interest payments, which most economists believe would set off a run on the banks and a steep devaluation of the peso.
"If de la Rua comes to New York empty-handed, he'll leave empty-handed," said Arturo Porzecanski, chief economist of emerging markets at ABN Amro Securities, "and the chances are very high Argentina will not be able to meet its payments this year."
After providing two large emergency packages since December, I.M.F. officials have told Argentina that they cannot begin to consider fresh funds until the government and the country's 23 governors agree to sort out a complex revenue-sharing arrangement. The central government is already more than $500 million late in payments this year.
President de la Rua has offered to pay the governors in a combination of cash and bonds and cut future monthly financing by 13 percent, or $300 million a month. 
Governors belonging to the center-left Alianza coalition came to an agreement with the government on Wednesday. But the opposition Justicialist governors, who control 14 of the 23 provinces with 80 percent of the population, have balked, and it appeared highly unlikely that talks would suddenly succeed before President de la Rua's scheduled takeoff at 11:30 p.m. 
The governors threatened today to take the government to court to force it to comply with agreements made last year. "They are putting the responsibility for their own administrative failures on our shoulders," said Gov. Nestor Kirchner of Santa Cruz Province. 
Mr. de la Rua's spokesman, Juan Pablo Baylac, responded angrily to the opposition governors, saying they were irresponsibly jeopardizing the economy. "It's time to stop the cheap politics," he added.
Several of the provinces, which have combined debts of $22 billion, have already defaulted on their bonds and most are behind in paying their teachers and other public servants or are relying on scrip to meet their obligations.
Rising interest rates have slowed the economy and pushed unemployment to nearly 20 percent. Tax receipts have fallen by more than 10 percent in the last two months, and manufacturing and consumer sales have also fallen at quickening rates. 
Debt payments represent nearly a fifth of government expenditures and about four times its export earnings. Exports can rise only modestly as long as the value of the peso is pegged to the strong dollar, economists argue, but a devaluation would mean large-scale bankruptcies for the private sector, which has up to $30 billion in debts denominated in dollars.

HEADLINE: Democrats' Recovery Plan Moves Forward in Senate 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
Democrats pushed their economic recovery plan through the Senate Finance Committee tonight, setting out their negotiating position on an issue that has left the two parties bitterly divided and at risk of deadlock even as unemployment surges and business activity slows.
 The $66.4 billion plan, which includes an expansion of programs to help the unemployed, a tax rebate for low-income people and tax breaks for some businesses, was approved by the committee on a vote of 11 to 10. The swing vote came from Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont, whose departure from the Republican Party earlier this year to become an independent threw control of the Senate to the Democrats. 
 The bill now goes to the Senate floor, where it seems sure to set off a partisan free-for-all of amendments, delaying tactics and debate, with the outcome uncertain. Centrists in both parties said they would work on a compromise that would allow Congress to meet President Bush's request to complete work on the stimulus package by the end of the month. 
Both sides said they wanted to avoid an ideological standoff over how to combat a slowdown that began a year ago and intensified after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But neither showed signs of budging today, with exchanges of caustic criticism of each side's position.
Democrats said they intended the legislation to serve as a counterpoint to the $100 billion Republican stimulus bill, which was passed last month by the House and which focused mostly on tax cuts for business. 
The Senate bill would provide $14.3 billion this fiscal year to extend unemployment benefits and provide unemployment insurance coverage to some part-time workers. It would provide $12.3 billion this year to pay up to 75 percent of health insurance premiums for laid-off workers who qualify for a government program that lets them keep their employer-provided health plans after losing their jobs.
The legislation provides $19.4 billion in business tax breaks, including a provision that would give companies an incentive to accelerate plans to invest in new factories, machinery and other equipment. For low- and moderate-income workers who did not qualify for the rebate checks issued under Mr. Bush's tax cut, the plan would provide a one-time payment of up to $300 for single people and $600 for married couples.
It also contains $1.8 billion this year in tax breaks for New York and other regions affected by the terrorist attacks, with the amount rising to $5.3 billion over 10 years. It would exempt families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks from federal income tax liability this year and limit their estate tax liability. And it extends a series of small-scale existing tax breaks for a wide variety of industries and social needs, at a cost of $628 million this year.
Democrats said the plan would put money quickly into the hands of people who need it most and would give the economy an immediate kick without undermining the government's long-term fiscal health.
"It provides a strong, balanced stimulus for economic recovery," said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, the committee's chairman. "It provides important assistance to workers who've lost their jobs. And the long-term cost is low."
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, said he would bring the bill to a vote on the floor next week, and would attach to it a $20 billion package of spending on what he called domestic security needs. 
The package includes $3.1 billion for bioterrorism prevention and food safety programs; $1 billion for local police and fire departments; $1.6 billion for border security; $1 billion for airport security; and $2.5 billion for highway construction and improvements.
Republicans said the Democratic approach would do little or nothing for the economy, create expensive new entitlement and spending programs and dole out money to interest groups. They said they would do whatever was needed to kill it.
Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, called the plan "pitiful" and "insulting." Senator Fred Thompson, Republican of Tennessee, called it a "grab bag of partisan spending proposals."
It is unclear whether Democrats can muster 51 votes for the bill, much less the 60 they would need to end debate and overcome procedural hurdles to its passage.
Just to get the bill through the committee, Mr. Baucus had to add a variety of special-interest provisions. They included $10 million in tax breaks for citrus growers, $3 million in tax breaks for crop-dusters, $4.4 billion of tax breaks in the next decade for Amtrak and $5.5 billion over 10 years to subsidize a variety of farm products.
"I admit it: I like pork," said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the minority leader. "But in a stimulus package? I don't see how spending money on watermelons and bison meat will help the economy."
Much of the debate on the Senate floor is likely to center on how to make sure people can get health care even if they lose their jobs. The approach favored by Democrats would subsidize health insurance premiums by providing money to individuals. Republicans support a proposal put forth by Mr. Bush to have Washington provide $3 billion to the states for them to use as they wish on health-insurance programs.
The health care debate is likely to be complicated by the decline in states' revenues. The National Governors' Association said today that more federal financing of Medicaid, the state-administered health insurance program for the poor, was an essential part of any package. The Senate bill would add $1.4 billion this year in matching funds for the states to help deal with the issue.
"States cannot provide services for new people coming onto the Medicaid rolls in their current financial situation," said Gov. Paul E. Patton of Kentucky, a Democrat who is vice chairman of the governors group.

HEADLINE: A Homeland Pep Talk 

 BODY:
President Bush sought last night to bolster the confidence of Americans in his administration's efforts to protect their safety at home. It was a rather muted performance, less inspiring than his address to Congress in September. But his call on the nation to "live in a spirit of courage and optimism" was well taken.
 Mr. Bush had undoubtedly hoped by this point to have some positive news to convey about the war on terrorism, at home or abroad. But instead he had to acknowledge that the government has no idea yet who is responsible for the bioterrorism at home, and to repeat his previous assertion that the American cause in Afghanistan is righteous. It was a more difficult message to deliver than his original declaration of war against the terrorists. The president stressed his own optimism not only that America would prevail, but that the events of "two of the most difficult and most inspiring months in our nation's history" had made the nation stronger and better. 
 One of Mr. Bush's major points was that Americans could help win the war against terrorism by volunteering for community service at home. The public has shown itself eager to do something positive in the wake of Sept. 11, and Mr. Bush is right in trying to help channel that desire.
The president would have been more reassuring if he had offered new evidence of concrete steps being taken to keep the nation safe, including greater powers for Tom Ridge's homeland security office and more spending to help hospitals, health departments and public safety agencies cope with the new and uneasy world he described.
Mr. Bush's address, to cheering firefighters, police and postal workers in Atlanta, was part of a series of appearances that the White House has designed to provide coherence to the confused messages relating to homeland defense in the last several weeks. On that front he was less successful. He called on Congress to pass legislation on airport security and economic stimulation. But he gave no indication that he was prepared to help break the partisan impasse on Capitol Hill.
This week, for instance, the president told a closed-door meeting of Republican leaders that he would veto any attempt to spend more than the $7.7 billion that his budget aides say has been set aside for homeland security. He reportedly cited budgetary constraints. But Democrats have won some Republican support in Congress for worthy spending programs to increase production of vaccinations for smallpox, help local public safety agencies and improve security at borders, transit systems, nuclear facilities, dams and other sensitive parts of the infrastructure. Unfortunately, they have also loaded up their "emergency" spending with pork-barrel items like crop subsidies for apples, blueberries and pumpkins. That only makes it possible for the White House to ridicule what otherwise should be taken seriously as genuine efforts to strengthen the fight against terrorism. Mr. Bush should be using his prestige to push for a pork-free spending plan and an airport security bill that mirrors the bipartisan Senate approach rather than the more ideological Republican House version.
Mr. Bush did display the sense of positive determination that has become the hallmark of his approach to the war on terrorism. A primary responsibility of a president in a time of crisis is to give Americans confidence in themselves and their ability to defeat the enemy. So far Mr. Bush has performed that job well, and the nation has responded by giving him overwhelming support for the fight both at home and abroad. But Americans would have more reason to be sanguine if there were more of an aggressive effort to bring coherence to the management of homeland issues and not just to the discussion of them.

HEADLINE: BLOOMBERG VISITS HEADS OF 2 UNIONS OVER FISCAL FEARS 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY and STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg paid visits to the leaders of two of New York's most powerful municipal unions yesterday, moving quickly to build ties with officials who will be key players in dealing with the city's mounting budget problems and offering an early and sharp stylistic difference with the man he is succeeding.
 "This should not be an adversarial relationship between the mayor and everyone else that works for the city," Mr. Bloomberg said, standing beside Lee Saunders, the administrator of District Council 37, the city's largest municipal union. Then, to underscore the point, the Republican mayor-elect slipped a green District Council 37 T-shirt Mr. Saunders had given him over his shirt and tie, then smiled in front of a mass of clicking cameras. 
 Mr. Bloomberg met for 20 minutes with Mr. Saunders and for 15 minutes with Randi Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers. Both unions had supported Mark Green, the Democrat, in the mayoral election that Mr. Bloomberg won Tuesday. Most unions did not back him, in part because his company, Bloomberg L.P., is nonunion.
His decision to meet with the union leaders -- and to visit their headquarters rather than summon them to his offices -- signaled the importance that the unions will play as Mr. Bloomberg confronts huge fiscal problems when he takes office.
Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday that he expected next year's budget deficit to be about $2.5 billion. But other fiscal experts said that the figure could be closer to $4 billion, the result of an economy that was already sliding downward before the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.
Mr. Bloomberg declined to get drawn into contract negotiations yesterday, noting that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was still involved in them.
"At the moment, we have a mayor who's in office till Dec. 31, and Ms. Weingarten has to negotiate with Mayor Giuliani," Mr. Bloomberg said. "I'm not going to get in the way of those two -- hopefully they'll come to a resolution."
But unless Mr. Giuliani reaches last-minute agreements in the next seven weeks on some seemingly intractable issues, Mr. Bloomberg will assume office immediately facing complicated contractual disputes with unions that are no strangers to dramatizing their demands with street demonstrations. Mr. Bloomberg might have to bargain with unions representing 80,000 public schoolteachers, 28,000 police officers and 9,000 firefighters, all whose contracts expired last year.
The teachers and the police officers, seeking parity with surrounding suburbs, have pushed for raises of more than 20 percent, and were looking to whoever was elected to be more generous than Mr. Giuliani.
Beyond the potential pressure of negotiating a contract, if the fiscal situation becomes as bad as many experts think it will, Mr. Bloomberg may find himself returning to these unions to push for cost-cutting concessions that could help him balance New York's books.
The mere fact that the visits took place -- and Mr. Bloomberg's easy-going banter with two labor leaders who just three days ago were working against his election -- suggests, at least for now, a considerable change in tone in the way City Hall will be dealing with unions. Mr. Giuliani's relations with municipal unions, particularly with Ms. Weingarten, were often rocky. 
Mr. Bloomberg steered clear of a question about whether his visit meant that he might have a lighter touch than Mr. Giuliani, the Republican mayor whose support helped lead to the mayor-elect's victory. 
"I think he's been a very good mayor, and he's governed for the last eight years," the mayor-elect said of Mr. Giuliani. "But I'm governing in the future, and my style is my style. And I would hope that I have access to the people that represent the municipal workers, namely the labor leaders. And I want them to make sure that they understand they will always have access to me."
With Mr. Saunders looking on, Mr. Bloomberg continued: "They may not get the answer they want, but I'm a believer in dialoguing. I'm a believer in inclusiveness. I'm a believer in being open."
At that, Mr. Saunders stepped in with warm words for the mayor-elect.
"Don't underestimate this: This is an extremely important signal that the mayor-elect is sending to us, in reaching out with us and sitting down and talking with us," Mr. Saunders said.
Ms. Weingarten, in an interview after Mr. Bloomberg left, said: "The real breath of fresh air is, he is talking about working with, not working against, the people who work for the city and work for the schools."
Mr. Bloomberg made the visit on what was his second day as New York's mayor-elect. From the union headquarters, he went downtown to tour the 14th-floor transition offices set up by Mr. Giuliani across Broadway from City Hall.
The sweeping offices, filled with desks and computers, offered an enviable view of City Hall and the Brooklyn Bridge. But they are decorated in an austere municipal style quite unlike Mr. Bloomberg's campaign and corporate offices. Mr. Bloomberg seemed somewhat hesitant when asked if he planned to spend much time there.
"We'll use it for something," he promised. "There are plenty of things to do." An aide later said that Mr. Bloomberg might find it easier to work out of his opulent campaign headquarters off Park Avenue.
Still, Mr. Bloomberg enjoyed the moment, standing at the entrance and jingling a key ring for the photographers, including his daughter, Emma, who was on hand to record this step in her father's life.
As he left, Mr. Bloomberg and his aides took note of the new sign over the door that announced it as the offices of "Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg."
Mr. Bloomberg's press secretary, Edward Skyler, sighed as he took it in. "After all the press releases I sent out that said 'Mike, Mike, Mike,' they do this?" he said with a laugh.
Last night, Mr. Bloomberg attended a dinner of 100 Black Men, where he shook hands with the Rev. Al Sharpton. Mr. Sharpton declined to endorse Mr. Green in the election.
Mr. Bloomberg is facing conflicting pressures as he seeks to deal with labor demands and a potential budgetary crisis next year. As Mr. Bloomberg has repeatedly noted, personnel costs represent the largest area of discretionary spending -- in other words, spending a mayor can cut -- in the budget, and thus he will be looking to reduce labor costs as a way to balance the budget.
But Mr. Bloomberg will also be under pressure to provide teachers and police officers sufficiently large raises to deal with the problems the city faces in retaining and recruiting teachers and police officers, who have been tempted to leave by larger salaries outside New York.
During the campaign, Mr. Bloomberg said he would prefer to increase salaries for teachers, rather than hire more teachers, as a means of retaining experienced teachers in school.

HEADLINE: A Trade Agenda Tempts Murphy's Law; 
U.S. Sees Talks as a Test of Leadership, But the Road to Qatar Was Rocky

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: DOHA, Qatar, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
Just about everything that could go wrong has gone wrong in the prelude to the global trade talks that begin on Friday in this Persian Gulf nation.
 So now, the ministers from some 140 countries gathering here in what the Bush administration considers a test of Washington's leadership in the war on terrorism risk failing a second time to agree on an agenda for writing new rules governing global trade. 
 Success at the talks "is within our grasp," said Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, who has made this meeting the focus of his first 10 months in office. "But," he said, "there's lots of hard work to do if we're going to get there."
A setback could send shock waves through the recessionary global economy and imperil the umbrella World Trade Organization, which was created six years ago to expand trade and regulate conflicts. 
With five days of bargaining scheduled, trade officials are still deadlocked on several core issues -- farm trade, antidumping rules and textiles -- that top the agenda for the poorest countries and split the industrialized nations.
Negotiators also have to resolve a few new and highly politicized disputes, like whether patent rules deny affordable medicine to nations facing health crises.
Murphy's Law seems to have plagued the trade talks in recent years. Two years ago in Seattle -- the last time officials tried to initiate what they refer to as a new round of trade negotiations -- the attempt failed in spectacular fashion. It was a showcase not for free trade but for groups protesting globalization.
Protesters are few in this tiny, oil-rich emirate, the only nation to offer itself as a host after downtown Seattle was ransacked during the 1999 gathering. But after Sept. 11, a painful security headache arose as the threat of terrorism against a conspicuous gathering in the Middle East forced the United States and most other nations to send only skeleton negotiating teams. Hotels here are swarming with security agents carrying walkie-talkies.
On Wednesday, before most delegates had arrived, a gunman was killed after he opened fire on troops guarding an air base about 20 miles southwest of here. Officials said there was no evidence connecting the attack to the meeting and called it an isolated incident.
Despite or perhaps even because of the terrorist threat, President Bush and Mr. Zoellick made the talks a test of leadership. They say a successful outcome would show that Osama bin Laden had not succeeded in disrupting an open and interconnected world. Mr. Zoellick called the talks a mission to "counter the revulsive destructionism of terrorism."
The stakes are also high because all the world's major economies are experiencing a downturn this year, the first time they have retreated in tandem since the oil shocks of the mid-1970's.
The World Bank predicts that trade among nations will increase at an anemic rate of 1 percent this year after soaring 12 percent in 2000.
Yet while the need to stimulate overall trade is pressing, major industrialized and poor nations are trying to dictate the terms of these talks in ways that suit their individual interests. Even the strongest supporters of a new round, the United States and the European Union, are prepared to walk away if the agenda impinges too much on powerful domestic groups.
After repeated rounds of trade liberalization since World War II, industrial tariffs have fallen to an average of 4 percent worldwide. That has left more contentious issues on the table, including several protectionist measures in the richest countries that mock those countries' rhetorical support for free trade.
The talks will put pressure on the United States to loosen quotas and reduce high tariffs on textiles and clothing, for example, while agreeing to discuss its use of antidumping measures to protect against imports of steel and other goods that it contends are priced below production costs.
At the same time, the talks will collapse unless Europe and Japan are willing to discuss dismantling the elaborate protection they have long provided for their inefficient farming sectors.
"The issues are set up in such a way that all the key players can walk away from Doha with a trophy," said Jeffrey Schott, a trade expert at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "But they are also set up so that everyone will have to be willing to give up something that's important to people back home."
All the major members among the 142 nations that make up the Geneva-based World Trade Organization will attend the session, which will also feature the formal entry of China into the W.T.O. No member is publicly opposing the idea of beginning broad trade negotiations, which would last at least three years and aim to liberalize and standardize the cross-border sale of anything from mangoes to mutual funds.
Most participants say they are cautiously optimistic that the ministers will endorse at least a modest agenda for negotiations. Determined to avoid the unscripted clashes at the bargaining table that doomed the Seattle talks, W.T.O. officials have drafted a carefully worded 11-page text that they hope can form the basis of an agreement.
The impetus to conclude some agreement is strong because the implications of failure seem so great. Mr. Zoellick and other trade officials speak of the "bicycle theory" of trade -- the need to move forward to keep from falling down. That is especially relevant during economic malaise, when the political pressure to shield domestic industries increases. 
But when trade experts argue that nations have a collective interest in backing a trade round, it is a little like saying that both the Yankees and the Diamondbacks want to do good things for baseball. They do, but they are better known for competing on the field.
The most divisive contest this time concerns issues that divide some rich and poor nations. Led by Brazil, Egypt, India and Malaysia, many of the developing countries argue that the trading system and the world trade group itself are slanted to advance the interests of the industrialized countries. They say that any new round of talks should be a "development round" that is focused mainly on the poor.
The World Bank supports the notion that trading rights are skewed toward the rich. It argued in a report released last week that a new deal could raise incomes in developing countries by $1.3 trillion over 10 years, but only if the Doha talks focused on agriculture, textiles and clothing, the main exports of the poor.
Murasoli Maran, India's trade minister, arrived in Doha on Wednesday pledging to block a new round unless the draft text was rewritten to address what he called the current imbalances in trade. Because the W.T.O. operates by consensus, any member can veto an agreement.
India and Brazil, with support from some African nations, have also insisted on rewriting patent rules to allow a broad "public health" exception. They contend that existing protections benefit multinational drug companies by blocking cheaper generic versions of drugs to combat illnesses like AIDS and malaria.
The issue turned red hot after the Bush administration forced Bayer to lower the price of its anthrax drug, Cipro. Health ministers in developing countries accused Washington of hypocrisy for insisting that poor nations honor patents while it bent the rules at home.
The Bush administration calls that nonsense. W.T.O. regulations already allow nations to seize patents in times of crisis, officials in Washington say. But along with Japan, Canada and Switzerland, the administration is fighting the idea of allowing a public health exception to patents, saying that any country could casually claim public health reasons for copying anything from cold medicine to dialysis machines.
They argue that India and Brazil are using the issue for mercantilist ends: both countries have large generic drug industries that want to export more medicines.
In an attempt to defuse the dispute, Mr. Zoellick has offered to exempt the poorest of the poor countries from patent rules on medicine.
North-south tensions are behind other sensitive issues in Doha, though most of the others also split the interests of the European Union, Japan and the United States.
By far the biggest benefit to the poor would come from loosening protections for farmers. World Bank officials estimate that Europe, Japan and the United States together spend about $1 billion a day subsidizing farmers, six times the total foreign aid to poor countries from all sources.
Though the United States is a culprit -- its farmers get billions of dollars in annual subsidies and it restricts imports of sugar, peanuts and lemons -- it sides with developing countries against Europe and Japan, which protect their own farmers even more extensively.
The second-biggest benefit to poor countries would come from easier market access for low-end manufactured goods, notably textiles and clothing. Here, the United States is in the weakest position because it unabashedly shields its ailing but politically influential textile industry through quotas and tariffs.
Europe, which does less to protect such industries, has championed the push by developing countries for more market access. So far, the United States has resisted.
Europe has also called for negotiations on environmental rules. It wants the W.T.O. to allow it to ban imports -- like genetically modified foods -- if it fears environmental damage. It is largely alone in making that case.
Japan, under siege because of its towering 1,000 percent tariffs on rice, has lined up developing countries for an assault on antidumping rules, which it says are routinely abused by the United States to shelter steel makers and other industries.
The Bush administration is under heavy pressure not to compromise on this front. Seventy-five senators, led by Max Baucus of Montana, the chairman of the Senate Finance committee, wrote a letter to Mr. Zoellick defending antidumping measures as a vital tool to protect American workers against unfair trading practices. 
Conflicts with Japan prompted Mr. Zoellick to lash out at Tokyo recently, saying that "the Japanese have just said no to everything in the process, and that just won't work."
Japanese officials seethed, responding that Mr. Zoellick was setting them up as fall guys if the Doha talks failed. As one Japanese trade officials commented, "We're his excuse."

C1) Chart: "Tangled Trade Talks"Major issues confronting the delegates at the World Trade Organization's conference in Doha, Qatar, which begins today. AGRICULTURE -- Reducing barriers to farm trade is a top priority for the United States, other major food exporters and most developing nations. But Japan and Europe are reluctant to limit support for their heavily subsidized farmers. TEXTILES -- Many poor countries want richer nations to allow more imports of clothing and textiles so they can industrialize faster. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY -- Poorer countries want access to cheaper medicines to fight AIDS and other public health crises, but the United States and other nations with leading drug companies are reluctant to relax patent rights. DUMPING -- Japan and many developing countries want to limit the use of antidumping laws, which have been invoked by the United States to protect its steel industry.(pg. C1)

HEADLINE: Panel Approves Plan of $5 Billion for New York 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
Efforts to help Lower Manhattan rebuild from the recent terror attack moved forward today when the Senate Finance Committee approved a $5 billion economic stimulus package for the area.
 The package was tucked into a $66.4 billion bill that the committee offered as a way to bolster the national economy. 
The two senators from New York, Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, pushed to have the economic package for New York included in the larger bill. 
 The entire package needs approval of the full Senate, where its future is uncertain.
Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Clinton introduced their proposal late last month, saying it would spur the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan by offering $5 billion in tax breaks and other incentives for businesses.
Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that their plan faced an uphill battle. But they were heartened that the finance committee included it in the larger package. 
"This is a powerful message from Washington," Mr. Schumer said. 
Mrs. Clinton added, "It's a real lifeline for New York." 
The plan calls for giving a $4,800 tax credit per employee to any business that agrees to return to Lower Manhattan or set up shop there for the first time.
The cost of the tax credit is expected to be about $2 billion.
The Clinton-Schumer plan also calls for tax-exempt financing to help developers undertake reconstruction of buildings destroyed by the World Trade Center attack. 
In all, this program is expected to cost about $2.5 billion.
Finally, the plan allows businesses to deduct part of the costs they incur replacing equipment destroyed in the attack. The plan allows deductions for the portion of the expenses not covered by insurance.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: NEWS COVERAGE -- CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
British Take Blunter Approach to War Reporting

BYLINE:  By CARYN JAMES 

 BODY:
After taking a Taliban-guided tour into southern Afghanistan last week, along with other Western journalists, Simon Ingram wrapped up his four-day experience for "BBC World News." The cameras showed a crowd of village men in turbans, their fists raised in anger as soldiers looked on. 
 "Within the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar, evidence of the challenge Washington is facing," Mr. Ingram said. He described the men chanting their allegiance to the Taliban and death to America and added, "No sign here that the intensifying American bombardment is achieving its goal." 
 ABC's Dan Harris, who was also on the tour, summed up his experience for "Good Morning America." He, too, said the villagers were angry at America but emphasized how friendly they were to him. "It's not that they're not bitter about the almost daily U.S. bombings," Mr. Harris said, in a warm and fuzzy tone. "They simply don't blame individual Americans." 
A Taliban spokesman said Osama bin Laden should not be turned over "to Americans who are killing our innocent people," but Mr. Harris ended the report by saying: "Most people, however, preferred more pleasant conversation. Before we left, one Taliban soldier smiled and said he wanted to leave with us and go to America." 
The soft American and the stern British tone is typical of these reports, and the difference highlights the value of seeing the world from a broader perspective. If a priority of America's war on terror is holding a global coalition together, it helps to know, without sugar-coating, what the rest of the globe is thinking.
"BBC World News" is the best of several foreign-based, English-language programs available to American viewers, all with a wider scope and a blunter attitude than American networks and cable channels. These are programs from friendly nations, not from places spouting anti-American propaganda. In fact, Mr. Ingram included his own country in one of his harshest assessments about the difficulty of defeating the Taliban. "If the U.S. and Britain were hoping that this unusual regime was about to crumble, they may well be disappointed," he said. 
But the range of issues and less defensive tone are wildly different from what American viewers get on network or cable news programs, which share a myopic view and a tone that says, "They'd love us if only they understood us." 
From the time the antiterror coalition was formed, the BBC has offered a stark view of its fragility, something the American media have just begun to focus on (a valuable "Nightline" segment addressed the issue with European journalists on Tuesday). And in the midst of covering anthrax, foreign-based programs have continued to report regularly from Jerusalem and the West Bank, offering a sense of how volatile the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has become. For American television, with its relentless focus on a single issue, covering anthrax and the Middle East at the same time is the news equivalent of walking and chewing gum.
The differences are not only war-related. When President Bush spoke about the economic downturn last Friday, American networks assumed a tone of cautious pessimism while a BBC reporter said, "even the president is forced to admit" that the economic future looks "very grim." 
The increase in ratings for foreign-based news since Sept. 11 suggests a hunger for what is not being offered by American reporting, and alternatives are increasingly easy to find. 
The half-hour "BBC World News" program is updated and broadcast live 24 hours a day to countries outside Britain. The program can be seen five times a day on BBC America, a channel available mostly on digital cable and satellite services, but it reaches viewers most easily on public television. In New York City, "BBC World News" is on several times a day on Channel 21. Since Sept. 11, two dozen more public television stations have picked up the program, so it now reaches 160 of them, covering about 70 percent of the country. 
Also since Sept. 11, ratings have gone up 50 percent for ITN's "World News for Public Television," a daily half-hour produced in England for American audiences and carried on 92 stations, including Channel 13 in New York. Like "BBC World News," it offers a range of international stories. ITN's reporting is more perfunctory, but some of its stronger segments are included on the PBS "Newshour." 
Viewers willing to do a little searching have a wealth of other options. C-SPAN's three channels often carry foreign news and public affairs programs late at night on a random schedule. 
For years, of course, American television has been criticized for paying too little attention to foreign news, and the consequences are freshly obvious. After the terror attacks, stunned and baffled "Why do they hate us?" articles flooded the news media, addressing a public that had been blinkered to what other parts of the world were thinking. And a homebound point of view persists, even though plenty of American journalists are in Pakistan and northern Afghanistan. 
The Fox News Channel anchors are still wearing flag lapel pins identical to those worn by the Bush administration, a signal of their allegiance. (On local news, red-white-and-blue ribbons are common.) But usually the signs are more subtle. On a recent edition of the CNN call-in program "Talk Back Live," the question of the day was a loaded one: "Is it unpatriotic to speak out against the war?" And on ABC's "This Week," Sam Donaldson reminded a representative of Al Jazeera, the Arab-language television station that has been a conduit for videos from Osama bin Laden, "A lot of people in the U.S. don't like the idea that Al Jazeera broadcasts Osama's messages to the Arab world." 
Some of the American skittishness and us-against-them attitude is understandable. The attacks did happen here and created a war mentality. But after two months, American television's cautious approach has turned into knee-jerk pandering to the public, reflecting a mood of patriotism rather than informing viewers of the complex, sometimes harsh realities they need to know. Even as American reporters are expressing frustration at how fiercely the Pentagon is controlling information, the emphasis is not on getting better answers but on covering "the propaganda war" in the shallow, horse-race way elections usually are -- who's winning?
"BBC World News" and other foreign-based programs offer an essential supplement to this tunnel vision. In one of his reports from Kandahar, Mr. Ingram was skeptical of a villager's angry claim that Americans wanted only to stop him from feeding his family, as the camera showed a Taliban ministry building that had been destroyed nearby.
"Evidence like this could be less than wholly convincing, and the Americans could well dismiss it as propaganda," Mr. Ingram said of what the Taliban led him to see. "What's harder to deny is that the anger felt by the people here seems to be directed not at the Taliban but at the United States." 
That may not be pleasant to hear, but it does something American television usually does not: it assumes that the public is smart and grown-up enough to handle what the rest of the world thinks.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE PRESIDENT; 
Bush Seeks New Volunteer Force for Civil Defense

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
President Bush called tonight for the creation of a volunteer civil defense service and told the American people that the specter of a long war against terrorism within the United States would force the country to confront "new responsibilities, both for the government and for our people." 
 In a speech here before an invited crowd of police officers, firefighters and postal workers and many of his political supporters. Mr. Bush tried for the first time to describe at length how he believes ordinary life must change in a country that is not accustomed to facing a serious threat of foreign-sponsored violence on its shores. Excerpts, Page B6. 
 He said the volunteer civil defense service would help police and fire departments, as well as public health agencies, in times of emergency. Mr. Bush said participants in AmeriCorps, a national service program created by the Clinton administration, and the Senior Corps, would be asked to participate. The White House said it envisioned using 20,000 or more volunteers next year, to perform routine tasks so that emergency workers can pursue more urgent duties. 
A similar proposal was introduced this week by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana. 
On Friday, Mr. Bush is expected to ask governors to call up more members of the National Guard to help with airport security in the holiday season. He also created a task force to examine ways citizens could better prepare for terrorism and asked it to report back in 40 days.
Tonight, the president drew a picture of a country that must keep going to soccer and baseball games, to churches, mosques and synagogues but that must also put citizens on the street, much as Londoners stepped out of their homes in World War II to stand up against nightly bombing. But he also called for Americans to trust that their government was up to the task of protecting them and was expanding its legal powers to do just that.
Those words contrasted sharply with the ones Mr. Bush used a year ago, when in the last days of his presidential campaign he complained that his opponent, Al Gore, "trusts government, which stands in stark contrast to our view."
But most of Mr. Bush's talk tonight was meant to be inspirational and help Americans adjust to a new era when normal life goes on against a background of the threat of catastrophic terrorism.
"Life in America is going forward," he said, calling that "the ultimate repudiation of terrorism."
After two weeks of debate in Washington over when and how the government should declare special alerts, Mr. Bush tried to end the argument with a call for vigilant normalcy.
"A terrorism alert is not a signal to stop your life," he said in a large auditorium in the heart of Atlanta, the South's most economically vibrant city. "It is a call to be vigilant, to know that your government is on high alert and to add your eyes and ears to our efforts to find and stop those who want to do us harm."
But Mr. Bush also warned, "There is a difference between being alert and being intimidated, and this nation will not be intimidated." 
Speaking before a giant screen that carried the words "United We Stand" and images of police officers and rescue workers, Mr. Bush concluded by invoking the last known words of Todd Beamer, one of the passengers who is believed to have moved against the hijackers on the flight that crashed in Pennsylvania on the morning of Sept. 11. "My fellow Americans," Mr. Bush said, "Let's roll!" 
Mr. Bush faced a difficult political task tonight, because he had to argue that the United States was winning the war at home, even while acknowledging that investigators were no closer to solving the mystery of who sent at least three envelopes of anthrax through the postal system. 
So far, 4 people have died and 13 others are known to have contracted the disease. And the Bush administration has been forced to fend off criticism that the government's initial response was disorganized, particularly the miscalculations by the Postal Service and health officials about how easily the anthrax could seep out of sealed envelopes.
In private, White House officials have conceded that they sent out contradictory, and sometimes wrong, messages about the precautions Americans should take, and Mr. Bush's talk tonight was partly intended to soothe a nervous country, while urging Americans to keep up their guard.
Mr. Bush did not offer the kind of stark warning his vice president, Dick Cheney, gave two weeks ago when he said that this might be the first foreign war in American history in which casualties at home outnumber those abroad. But the president did liken the battle to World War II, saying, "We are the target of enemies who boast they want to kill all Americans, kill all Jews, and kill all Christians."
He noted, "We have seen that type of hate before."
Recounting his recent visit to a high school in Maryland, the president said he "realized that for the first time ever, these seniors will graduate in the midst of a war in our own country."
He stopped well short of making the kinds of claims of early victories in the war against terror that some cabinet members had made in recent days. 
Just today, for example, Attorney General John Ashcroft said the United States had "emerged victorious in the opening battle in the war against terrorism" because "two periods of extremely high threat have passed" without additional attacks. That was the first indication from an American official that the high alert declared last week, amid considerable debate about whether the evidence warranted it, has now been dialed down. 
Mr. Ashcroft also said Americans had "endured the videotaped tauntings of Osama bin Laden," a name Mr. Bush never mentioned tonight, and he celebrated the fact that "we have not suffered another major terrorist attack."
Earlier this afternoon, touring the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention here, Mr. Bush said for the first time that he was "looking at different options" about how to protect Americans against an outbreak of smallpox. Terrorism experts have warned that it is possible for that disease to be spread through American cities.
But Mr. Bush said he was hesitant to back universal vaccination of the American public because of the likelihood that a small percentage of those receiving the vaccine would die.
"I would be deeply concerned about a vaccination program that would cause people to lose their life," he said.
While estimates of mortality from the vaccine vary, roughly one in a million people inoculated could die from the vaccine. 
That would mean about 280 deaths in the United States or 70 times more than the four deaths attributed so far to the anthrax attacks. An additional 1,500 could suffer brain damage. 
Some of what Mr. Bush said in his speech tonight he has said before, in bits and pieces, as the White House has moved to a war footing. He urged Congress to end a deadlock and send him legislation on airport security and an economic stimulus.
But some was new. The president acknowledged that the image America has abroad needs a lot of improvement.
"Too many have the wrong idea of Americans as shallow, materialistic consumers who care only about getting rich and getting ahead," Mr. Bush said. "But this isn't the America that I know."
He recounted the acts of kindness and faith he has witnessed around the nation in the last two months and argued that from the tragedy of Sept. 11, a better country was emerging. 
"The moment the second plane hit the second building, when we knew it was a terrorist attack, many felt that our lives would never be the same," said Mr. Bush, whose own realization came as he was informed of the attack in a second-grade classroom in Sarasota, Fla. 
"What we couldn't be sure of then and what the terrorists never expected," Mr. Bush said, "was that America would emerge stronger, with a renewed spirit of pride and patriotism."

HEADLINE: European Central Bank Cuts Key Interest Rate 0.5% 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
With European nations slipping closer to recession, both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England reduced their benchmark interest rates by half a percentage point today, following the Federal Reserve's action by 48 hours.
 The rate cuts were deeper than many analysts had expected, and they were greeted with relief by investors. But they did not defuse criticism that the European bank had been too slow and too rigid in responding to deepening signs of economic distress in Europe. 
 While the Federal Reserve has steadily flooded American markets with money, cutting rates to their lowest levels in 40 years, the European Central Bank has been reluctant to change course from inflation fighting, and its pronouncements have seemed confusing. 
Today's decision came as something of a surprise, because central bankers were sending mixed signals even this week. The political pressure from leaders of European governments, worried that economic growth had nearly stopped, has been intense. Still, until today, bank officials insisted that they were more worried about restraining inflation.
The European Central Bank, which sets monetary policy for the 12 nations adopting the euro as a common currency, reduced its main refinancing rate to 3.25 percent today from 3.75 percent. The Bank of England cut its key rate to 4 percent from 4.5 percent. Switzerland's central bank left rates unchanged. 
Wim Duisenberg, the president of the European Central Bank, said its decision was not part of a coordinated move with the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England, despite the timing. Rather, he said, the bank saw evidence that inflation had markedly slowed. Mr. Duisenberg acknowledged that European economies had been hurt by the slowdown in the United States, and that the impact had proved worse than first thought in the weeks immediately after the terrorist attacks. 
"Our assessment of economic developments, especially after Sept. 11," he said today, "is that confidence has been harder hit than we thought it would be a few weeks ago. It also means it will take longer to recover than we thought earlier."
The deepening gloom is widely apparent. Business confidence in Europe was lower in October than it has been in five years. Industrial production and orders for manufactured goods plunged last month in Germany, the biggest European economy. In recent months, European corporations have announced plans to eliminate more than 400,000 jobs. 
Electronics companies like Siemens of Germany and Ericsson of Sweden are eliminating jobs by the thousands. Airlines are in trouble, and weaker carriers like Sabena of Belgium and Swissair have collapsed. Even Lufthansa, one of the strongest carriers, is pressing employees to accept a four-day workweek with corresponding cuts in pay. 
Unlike the Federal Reserve, which has come to regard promoting economic growth as part of its mandate, the European Central Bank is bound by the Maastricht treaty to focus primarily on fighting inflation. Because the bank has been in existence for just three years, officials have been preoccupied with establishing its credibility as a tough-minded and politically independent institution.
But many economists argue that its credibility has been diminished, not enhanced, because it has seemed slow moving and because its direction has been unclear.
Referring to the European Central Bank's governing board, Raymond van der Putten, an economist at BNP Paribas, said: "They lack an economist or a president who can lead the decision-making. Mr. Duisenberg does not have the same prestige in the council that Mr. Greenspan has in the Fed. They can only agree on very small steps."
The council, which includes the presidents of the 12 nations' central banks, has been hard to read. For example, when Ernst Welteke, president of the German bank, said on Monday that too-zealous rate cuts could lead to higher inflation, some analysts began to wonder whether any cut at all would come this week. As events turned out, the European bankers reduced rates more than expected. 
"This renewed volte-face has left financial markets even more puzzled about what the bank will do in the future," Michael Schubert of Commerzbank wrote in a report. 
The Bank of England has cut interest rates seven times this year, to the lowest levels since 1964. The European Central Bank, by contrast, has made three cuts this year.
To be sure, Europe's economic situation differs from that in the United States. Nico Mensink, an ABN Amro economist in Amsterdam, noted that European corporations do not have as much excess capacity as their American competitors. European factories were running at 81.9 percent of capacity in the third quarter; the figure for American factories was 75.5 percent.
And both European consumers and corporations tend to shoulder less debt than their American counterparts. "The fundamentals are worse in the U.S. than they are in Europe," said Ralph Solveen, a Commerzbank economist here.

HEADLINE: Zero Percent: The Fine Print Counts 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN 

 BODY:
BY promising to shave hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest over the span of a car loan, zero percent financing deals have made auto sales one of the economy's few bright spots since Sept. 11. Cars and trucks sold at an annual rate of 21.3 million in October, the industry's strongest month ever. But many of those buyers ended up with loans that charged interest, and some may have agreed to higher prices than they would have under other buyer-incentive plans.
 General Motors kicked off the free-financing bonanza in September, a move that was quickly matched by Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler. Several other companies subsequently announced interest-free or reduced-rate financing, at least for a few models. Some deals have expired, but many have been extended through mid- or late November. Toyota said yesterday that it planned to stop offering free financing at the end of the month. 
 For consumers, the challenge is figuring out which models are covered, and whether the deals apply to leftover 2001 models, to new 2002 models, or to both.
And would-be buyers should heed the fine print, especially the stipulation that only "qualified buyers" are eligible for zero-percent deals. For instance, the little type at the bottom of Toyota's television ads says that only buyers with Tier 1 and Tier 2 credit ratings qualify for the best rate.
Even those who qualify -- generally buyers with pristine credit -- may find that the offers are restricted to loans of 12 to 36 months. In the fine print of G.M. advertisements, the key language is "length of contract limited." With short loans, the monthly payments may be more than a consumer can handle, which is why many buyers like to stretch payments over 48 or 60 months.
And if a buyer has a trade-in or wants to make a big down payment, it may be wiser to take a cash rebate and pay a slightly higher interest rate.
"Zero percent actually makes it more complicated" to buy a car, said Jeremy P. Anwyl, president of Edmunds.com, a Web site that provides information to car buyers. "Everybody is wheeling and dealing. It's a bizarre market."
While it would also seem to be a buyer's market, it is not yet clear whether customers are getting good prices as well as favorable financing. It will not be known for another month whether average selling prices have gone down or up -- whether cars are actually selling for less or for more than would have been expected if the special financing deals had not been offered.
If a customer is mesmerized with a zero-percent offer, he or she may be willing to pay a higher price. "If the percentage of folks qualifying for zero is lower than the percentage qualifying for low rates in previous incentive plans, that would be outrageous," said Jack Gillis, author of a buyers guide, "The Ultimate Car Book."
While some lawyers and consumer advocates say the climate is right for abuses of consumers, there appear to have been few complaints to consumer advocates or state attorneys general.
Dealers say they are trying to move metal at competitive prices. "You have to remember that we're not the only Chevy dealer in our town," said Bob Serpentini, who owns five Chevrolet dealerships in the Cleveland area. "People still shop. You still have to be competitive in the marketplace." His dealerships sold 850 vehicles last month, compared with an average of 400 in previous Octobers.
It is not clear how many buyers are getting zero percent; some dealers say it is only a quarter of the people walking in the door, and neither G.M. nor Ford would disclose what percentage of their recent sales were financed interest-free.
Consumers have some tools to navigate the complexities of zero-percent financing. A first step may be to figure out your credit rating. You can contact credit agencies like Equifax and TRW, or you can fill out an online questionnaire at Edmunds.com that can help you determine whether you rate as platinium, gold, silver or bronze, depending on your use of credit and your history of late payments.
Automakers' credit arms use slightly different terms and metholodogies -- G.M.'s financing unit, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, gives rankings of 1 through 5 to an individual's credit. But the concept is the same: there are tiers of creditworthiness that determine who gets the best deals. Manufacturers are loath to discuss credit policies, but some offer zero percent to the top two tiers; others like Mitsubishi restrict deals to only the top tier.
Cars.com offers another handy tool for shoppers. If you click the zero-percent icon on that Web site, up pops a list of which manufacturers are offering deals on which vehicles. The list is updated daily.
Then there is the challenge of pricing. Even before the sales frenzy of October, it was hard to pin down a fair price for a car. Mary Butler, senior editor at cars.com in Chicago, said consumers should start negotiating from the dealer's invoice -- not from the suggested price on the window sticker -- information that is readily available on her Web site, at Kelley Blue Book (www.kbb.com) and many others.
She urges buyers to keep a rational eye focused on the actual purchase price rather than being swept up in the emotion of zero percent. "You may be gaining in one area like financing, but losing by having your trade-in depreciated," she said. "Keep your eye on the ball, which is the final price when all is said and done."
For manufacturers, the big question is whether the burst of interest-free financing has permanently altered the marketplace. Gary Flom, president and chief executive of the Manhattan Auto Group, which sells various car lines owned by Ford, including Jaguar and Mazda, says he thinks the October frenzy "borrowed" some sales from September, when the market was ice cold, but not from future sales. "I do not think we have significantly changed the psychology of the shopper," he said.
Others are not so sure. Mr. Anwyl of Edmunds.com said there had been huge swings in sales numbers, on a daily basis, depending on whether the zero-percent deals were in place. "Without that sweetener in the marketplace, demand dries up," he said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 12, 2001

 CORRECTION:
A table in the Automobiles section on Friday showing the costs of financing new cars misstated the amount a buyer with the best credit rating would pay on a 48-month loan for a $30,000 vehicle. Based on an interest rate of 6.53 percent (the going rate for Manhattan), the payments would be $688.13 a month, not $604.17; the total cost would be $34,030.24, not $30,000.16.

To the Editor:
As you observe in "Living in a World Without Women" (Week in Review, Nov. 4), "everything the world has learned in the last decade about why some countries develop and others stay mired in poverty shows that women can make all the difference."
 Countries with higher population growth rates have tended to see less economic growth. 
Nations like Bangladesh, Tunisia and Jordan, which have invested in improving women's status, primary education and health services, have created a "virtuous circle," economically surpassing nations that ignored such investment. 
 Nations that consistently deny women rights and fail to invest in their well-being condemn themselves to an unending cycle of poverty and violence. To the extent that economic development takes root, the allure of radical fundamentalism withers.

HEADLINE: Wholesale Prices Posted Record Drop In October 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
Wholesale prices posted their biggest decline on record last month as energy costs fell by the largest amount since 1989 and automakers turned to cut-rate financing to lure buyers, a government report showed today.
 The report from the Labor Department showed that its Producer Price Index, which measures costs at factories and farms, fell 1.6 percent, the biggest decline since records were started in 1947. 
 The October decline was about four times what had been forecast and it more than reversed back-to-back gains of 0.4 percent registered in August and September. 
A weakening global economy and the effort by automakers to clear out inventories by offering price and financing incentives both played a role in driving prices down.
Analysts said it was too soon to start speculating that there might be a sustained period of price declines, but clearly inflation was not a worry for Federal Reserve policy makers, who lowered interest rates earlier this week.
Prices for finished energy products fell 7.7 percent, the biggest decline since a 7.8 percent drop in August 1989, after rising 0.9 percent in September.
Gasoline prices dropped 21.2 percent in October after rising 6.3 percent in September and 8.7 percent in August.
Excluding food and energy products, the so-called core rate of wholesale prices declined 0.5 percent in October, the sharpest drop since a 1.2 percent decline in August 1993, after a 0.3 percent increase in September.
Financial markets appeared uncertain what to make of the data, especially after a subsequent report showed an apparent brightening in consumers' moods in November. The University of Michigan index of expectations and current conditions rose to 83.5 from 82.7 in October. Stocks ended the day with slight gains, while bond prices were off.
The Fed has cut interest rates 10 times this year in the face of slowing business and rising unemployment, though the University of Michigan data appeared to imply that consumers were weathering the storm.
New-car prices fell 4.7 percent in October after rising 1.3 percent in September. It was the biggest price decline since a 5.2 percent fall in October 1972 as cheap financing and sales incentives took effect. 
"Whether consumers respond to these incentives will play an important part in determining not so much the duration but the depth of the recession," Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said.

HEADLINE: Promised Land No Longer; 
Dot-Commers Who Once Flocked to San Francisco Are Turning Elsewhere

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
Michelle A. Lemire, 28, moved here from Denver 18 months ago to join the dot-com revolution. She remained enthusiastic when her first employer went bankrupt. She was undeterred when she was laid off from a second job, and even when told by her third company that she could stay -- though it had gone broke -- if she agreed not to be paid.
 Her fourth experience ended practically before it began. Netcentives, an ailing Internet advertising company, hired her this summer and laid her off a week later. Ms. Lemire, a technical writer, was shaken, but still hoped that she would see the revival of the dot-com dream, defined by fat salaries or enticing options packages, and promises that its denizens could change the world. 
 Then came Sept. 11. Even Ms. Lemire has admitted to herself that it is time to give the dream its last rites. "It seems so long ago," she said of the explosion of Internet start-ups. Now, she will take just about any job. "I don't care if it is technology related. Just give me something to be part of," she said. 
As summer ended, laid-off dot-commers, some of whom had taken time off to play and reassess, reinvested themselves in job searches, insisting in the face of doubters that their niche would rise again. But even these stalwarts, many of them 20-somethings who formed the backbone of thousands of Internet start-ups, are finally admitting that the highflying era has come to rest.
Some say they are reluctantly pursuing positions in fields not related to technology. Many others are leaving Northern California altogether, as mounting anecdotal evidence suggests an exodus is afoot among former dot-commers -- a departure that appears to have gathered steam since the terrorist attacks.
Truck-rental companies report being inundated with requests for one-way trucks out of San Francisco. The Valencia Street U-Haul, one of the company's main branches in the city, is getting requests for 15 one-way trucks a day, up from around 6 before Sept. 11. Bonnie Parks, the acting branch manager, said the renters, typically 20 to 32 years old, expressed angst about the high cost of living, an inability to get jobs, and living in a city where terror could strike.
On Craig's List, a Bay Area Internet site (www.craigslist.org) especially popular among the dot-com crowd, listings for available apartments have risen to 5,500 from 3,500 in the eight weeks since the attacks, after climbing steadily but slowly for a year. "It has exploded since Sept. 11," said Craig Newmark, the founder of the site.
Among those who have left are Sean C. Downey, 32; his girlfriend, Jessica Myer, 23; and Phoebe, their dog, who packed into a 17-foot Penske truck in late September and headed for Washington, D.C. Mr. Downey said it was almost comical how many other people they ran across on their drive, all packed into trailers, "all going the same direction."
But Mr. Downey said the couple had little choice. They had been laid off in February from T3 Magazine, which focused on consumer technology and ceased operating six months after it was started. Mr. Downey had been executive editor and Ms. Myer a features editor. He said they spent six frustrating months unable to find work, before concluding not only that they would find no jobs in their field, but that it might be hard finding any job at all in the Bay Area.
Even for Mr. Downey and his peers, the dot-com era "seems kind of forgotten," he said.
"We've become part of the recession," he said. "Now we're just normal people out of work." 
Last month, the unemployment rate in San Francisco hit 6 percent, up from 2.8 percent a year ago. Just south of San Francisco, in Santa Clara County, the heart of Silicon Valley, the rate was 6.4 percent, up from 1.6 percent a year earlier. But the downturn is not limited to Internet companies; it has also slammed the technology economy in general, with layoffs and other work-force reductions hitting heavyweights like Hewlett-Packard, Cisco and 3Com.
Stephen Levy, director of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy, based in Palo Alto, said former dot-commers were experiencing a "double whammy." "Their niche failed at the same time the broader tech industry was entering into a huge decline," he said. 
Mr. Levy said he did not expect the downturn to be as marked or long-lasting as the aerospace collapse in Southern California in the early 1990's, when a million people left the area. But he did say that Sept. 11 "does sort of delay the recovery" in Silicon Valley and that former dot-commers face a "tough short-term outlook."
This is not to say there are no dot-com companies left. Many Internet companies and software start-ups continue to operate, having cut back their budgets to try to survive. A few are even thriving. And no one here disputes that the Internet is here to stay, or that it has contributed to fundamental shifts in lifestyle and business practices.
Besides, Silicon Valley has always been cyclical, as different technologies emerge and inspire great bubbles of enthusiasm; indeed, there are those who say a biotechnology boom is just around the corner.
But it is a far cry from the heyday of the dot-com bubble. When venture capitalists were pouring billions of dollars into start-ups, the companies could not hire quickly enough. People in their 20's and 30's who flocked to the San Francisco area to join the fray talked of being swamped with job offers; it was not uncommon to hear of people putting a resume on an Internet job site in the morning and having multiple job interviews by day's end. They often worked long, exhausting hours, but they enjoyed perks like free food at work and casual dress, to say nothing of inflated salaries and potentially lucrative stock options. 
One former dot-commer sticking it out in the Bay Area is Rob Devereaux, 26, a 1999 graduate of Eastern Michigan University who found a $1,200-a-week contracting job for Quokka Sports, a Web site that transmitted sporting events live over the Internet. He was laid off last October, and the company later went out of business.
At first, he was so optimistic that work would turn up that he devoted some of his free time to developing his own Web site, intended to build a sense of community in the area. But it soon became clear that jobs would not be as plentiful as he expected, and the freelance work he relied on started "drying up and drying up."
In June, he said, "I finally swallowed my pride and went on unemployment."
Lately, he has been doing some gratis Web site design for Zeplin Media, a company starting a dating site. He had been aggressively pursuing other work, while watching his bank account shrink daily, forcing him to cut back so much that he bought his clothes at second-hand stores and fixed his own car.
Then last week he finally landed a contracting job to design Web sites. The job will last only two to three months, but still, he said, it has left him feeling "stoked."
He remains uncertain about the future, though, particularly in light of the Sept. 11 attacks, which left him glued to the television. More recently, he has tried to keep the TV turned off, not just because the news is generally depressing, but also because it keeps reminding him that the decade-long era of unbounded optimism -- the only setting many young adults have known -- is not going to return anytime soon.
"The boom we had was built on everybody being excited about stuff and living life," he said. Now, he said, when he watches the news, "it feels like the world is going to hell, like nothing is going to get better."

HEADLINE: U.N. Will Send Food to Zimbabwe's Hungry 

BYLINE:  By HENRI E. CAUVIN 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
The World Food Program has announced that it will begin providing emergency food aid to more than half a million Zimbabweans, a stark indication of a deepening hunger crisis in a country that has traditionally been one of Africa's most self-sufficient. 
 Relief agencies had hoped to head off the food shortage, which has been slowly building for months even as the government refused to acknowledge the severity of the crisis. 
 But after a three-week tour of Zimbabwe last month, a team of monitors from the World Food Program, a United Nations agency, concluded that they could no longer wait before providing direct aid, which will begin next month. 
The food shortage stems from an untimely convergence of political and natural problems. 
Many parts of the country have suffered from drought, while others have yet to recover fully from severe flooding early last year. 
Additionally, sometimes violent land occupations, driven by a government plan to redistribute much of the land owned by the country's small white minority, have disrupted food production and generally discouraged investment in agriculture. 
The economy has been crumbling and is expected to shrink by 7.3 percent next year. 
Taken together, the problems mean that many Zimbabweans have a lot less to eat. 
The government has tried to halt the surging costs of staples like bread with price controls. But the main effect has been a decline in supply from producers unwilling to settle for below-market prices.
While such problems may well spawn an even bigger crisis next year, the immediate concern of World Food Program officials is the hunger now affecting more and more of Zimbabwe's 11.3 million people.
"We think right now people are managing to cope, but we think in the next three or four months it could become very difficult," Judith Lewis, the World Food Program's regional director, said in an interview from Kampala, Uganda.
Grain reserves are at their lowest in two years, according to the Famine Early Warning System Network, an arm of the United States Agency for International Development. 
Those stocks, which are projected to run out by the end of January, would ordinarily be replenished with imports, but the country's economic crisis has left the government desperately short of cash.
The next harvest will not be on the market until May or June. But even that may not bring relief because farmers who should be starting their planting this month are finding it harder to buy supplies as inflation approaches triple digits. Fertilizer, for example, has more than doubled in price since last year. 
It is an unusual predicament for a fertile country that has in past years often recorded surpluses, and readily imported food when its harvests fell short.
For months, the government denied that any serious shortage was on the horizon, even as evidence mounted. Finally, a few months ago, the finance minister, Simba Makoni, publicly acknowledged the looming crisis and began laying the groundwork for an appeal for aid. 
But the bureaucracy was slow to move, perhaps encumbered by the pronouncements of some ministers who continued to insist that everyone would be fed without any aid. 
Zimbabwe's own request for aid, outlined in a petition last month to the United Nations Development Program, makes it clear that outside help is essential. 
In the letter, which asks for more than $360 million in international aid, the government details the huge food demands facing the country along with a host of other needs, like rebuilding damaged roads and bridges and repairing breaches in the water and sanitation systems. 
The need is greater than the resources available, Mr. Makoni wrote to the United Nations.
The World Food Program is starting almost from scratch as it lays the groundwork for the operation in Zimbabwe. "We're sort of fighting against time to get our operation up and running," Ms. Lewis said.

Oil Prices Soar on Confusing Report About Russia's Output

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
On the surface, it looked like big news: the Russian news service Interfax quoted Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov today as saying that a group of Russian oil companies might agree next week to reduce oil exports in support of the efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise oil prices. 
 Western news agencies picked up the report, and traders started bidding crude prices up sharply. At one point they had risen 6 percent, the biggest move in more than a year, but they closed at a 5 percent rise, at $22.22 a barrel, up $1.05. 
 There was, however, less to the development than met the eye. In the original Russian, the prime minister's language was much more equivocal than the news headlines suggested, and industry analysts and some of the oil companies themselves said an agreement to cut exports was very unlikely.
Russia has been the fastest-growing oil producer among non-OPEC countries this year. Its rising exports have complicated OPEC's attempts to restrict global supply and prop up prices, a task that has become more difficult since the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11. Crude prices have fallen by more than one-third since then.
Seeking closer cooperation, the Saudi Arabian oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, is scheduled to visit Moscow on Sunday, in advance of an OPEC meeting next week. 
Speaking on condition that they not be named, executives at several of the biggest Russian oil companies said in separate interviews that they had no plans to cut production, and had not agreed to join a cartel within Russia.
"To limit exports means limiting production, and no one will go for that now," one oil company representative said. Referring to the prime minister's remarks, he said, "This looks like a good-will gesture for OPEC."
Dmitry Avdeev, oil analyst at the United Financial Group, an investment bank in Moscow, said, "There are a lot of questions about how this would actually work -- the government doesn't have any real ways of forcing private companies to cut."
Russia's oil industry, cash-rich from high oil prices and a currency devaluation that slashed production costs, has been stepping up output, and greater production is already built into their strategies and forecasts for next year. For example, Sibneft, Russia's sixth-largest producer, plans to pump about one-third more oil in 2002 than in 2001.
Mr. Avdeev estimated that oil exports from Russia would rise 7 percent to 8 percent next year. Crude-oil exports from Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union account for about one-tenth of world exports.

A military campaign, the calls for caution and some complex roots in Christian thought.

BYLINE:  By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
The American government is understandably concerned about convincing Muslims around the world that the war against Al Qaeda and the Taliban is justified. Washington officials might do well also to worry about another religious group: Christians. 
 On the face of it, that proposition seems preposterous. Sept. 11 was a direct attack on a nation where almost 9 of 10 citizens call themselves Christians. Since that day, there has been no absence of flags in American churches and no sparing of prayers for the families of victims, for the safety of American forces or for the wisdom of national leaders. 
 While dissent has come from a few traditionally pacifist Christian groups, most other church authorities have upheld a need to bring the terrorists to justice, even if it means war.
But many of the statements from Christian authorities also include reservations, with much talk of limits, restraints, sparing civilians and getting at "ultimate causes." Indeed, two bodies of President Bush's own denomination, the United Methodist Church, have issued statements in the last three weeks, one of them only yesterday, that come close to an outright condemnation of the campaign in Afghanistan.
Seasoned politicians, then, might be excused if they viewed official Christian support for the war in terms of the old cliche: a mile wide and an inch deep.
To many people, that is the way it should be. Wasn't Christianity's founder a victim of state power? Didn't his followers record in the Gospels that he refused to defend himself or usher in the kingdom of God by violent means? 
For Christianity's first three centuries, Christians stood apart from state power and military force, partly because of their founder's example, partly because Roman soldiering was permeated by pagan practices. That changed in the fourth century with Constantine and the coming of the Christian empire; now Christianity was stuck with political responsibilities. Soon, Augustine, arguing that taking up arms in defense of the innocent could be a moral duty, began devising criteria for distinguishing between just wars and unjust ones.
So for most of its history, Christianity has hardly been a nonviolent religion. But for many Christians, those earlier centuries remain a touchstone of the true, uncorrupted faith. 
In modern times, of course, Christianity was nudged away from state power. War became the extension of politics -- secular politics -- by other means and not of missionary work. Still, the habit of blessing arms and invoking God for national purposes continued until the slaughters of the last century rendered such gestures increasingly scandalous. 
In the United States, disillusionment with World War I combined with the Gospel renunciations of violence to produce a quasi pacifism among many Protestant leaders in the 1920's and 30's, often married to a belief that the world could be reformed without conflict. 
As an advocate of intervention against Hitler, Reinhold Niebuhr, the most prominent American theologian of the 20th century, rejected that view. What he called "Christian realism" held sway through World War II and the first dozen years of the cold war, only to give way again to antimilitary sentiments during the Vietnam War.
Today it is noteworthy that the two unofficial contemporary "saints" most frequently mentioned in Protestant and Catholic services -- Martin Luther King Jr. and Dorothy Day -- both advocated nonviolence. Some of the most creative contemporary moral theologians -- Stanley Hauerwas of Duke University, for instance -- are pacifists, while those who remain adherents of just-war theory are highly sensitive to its misuses and therefore typically emphasize the tight constraints it puts on the use of military force.
Moreover, the Christian voices that count in supporting or criticizing the war against terrorism are no longer limited to American and European sources. The extraordinary courage and vision of church leaders in places like South Africa, Central America, India, the Philippines, China, East Timor, the Middle East and Eastern Europe demand that their views get a hearing. Inevitably these views reflect a perspective different from those in America. 
So when the recent synod of Catholic bishops from around the world condemned terrorism and the "perversion of religion for violent purposes," it was not surprising that the denunciation appeared within a larger appeal to "remember those corners of the world which receive no media coverage and where our brothers and sisters are dying from famine and lack of medicine." 
In a world where 1.2 billion people exist on less than $1 a day each, those leaders were implicitly suggesting that countering terrorism, especially by arms, could not be Christians' single, all-consuming priority. And while they and other Christian leaders around the world are not beyond conventional anti-Americanism, they also need look no further than what their Scriptures say about rich and poor, the powerful and the lowly, to have doubts about the United States and its purposes. 
None of this means that American Christians will ever turn radically pacifist. They are likely to support the war against terrorism, perhaps more as Americans than as Christians. But their faith may produce a degree of moral uneasiness that could reinforce political doubts if things go badly.
American policy -- at least so far, and so far as is known -- has been consistent with one of the greatest concerns of church leaders: limiting civilian casualties. But perhaps the critical difference for affecting Christian opinion will be made not by anything done by arms in Afghanistan but rather by what is done -- or not done -- to address suffering there and elsewhere by other means. 
Will worldwide questions of humanitarian aid, economic development, debt forgiveness, prevention and treatment of AIDS, and advocacy of human rights, and even equality and justice domestically, be put on the back burner while resources flow freely to military efforts? The resulting message about the richest and most powerful nation could transform already guarded Christian approval into serious reappraisal.

A Banker Leaving Seoul Warns Against Bailouts

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
Wilfred Horie, lured to Korea nearly two years ago to run a troubled bank, has a word of advice for investors who are thinking about bankrolling large companies on the brink of failure: follow his example and do not do it.
 In his office in Korea First Bank, Mr. Horie talked recently about what he had done since becoming president of the bank in January 2000 and what he plans when he returns to Hawaii after retiring this month. 
 As he looked back on his record as the first president of the bank since Newbridge Capital bought 51 percent of it from the government in late 1999, he said his most significant accomplishment was refusing to participate in schemes to provide more credit to companies that should have simply died. 
Mr. Horie, who spent 17 years establishing the Japanese franchise for Associates First Capital and then built its operation in Dallas before coming to Seoul, avoided accusations of impropriety in the extension of fresh credit and rolled-over loans for Korean companies.
Implicit in his remarks, however, was the sense that the Korean governing establishment had indirectly influenced government-owned banks to extend loans to failing companies when all his analysis and instincts told him that was not the way to go.
"If you ask the regulators of the Ministry of Finance and Economy, their position is they have significant shares in the banks, but they are allowing the banks to operate on their own," Mr. Horie said. "My guess is there was quite a lot of pressure. There's probably indirect pressure."
It was that kind of pressure, he said, that led the creditors of Hynix Semiconductor, one of Korea's most troubled entities, to agree to a plan for providing about $500 million in fresh credit along with a debt-for-equity swap of about $3 billion.
"We don't want any part of Hynix," Mr. Horie said, talking about the decision of his bank to refuse to participate in the plan. He says he hopes the government-controlled banks responsible for the bailout plan for Hynix will buy Korea First Bank's loans for more than 25 percent of their face value. But he clearly prefers to write off the rest rather than risk more on a doomed operation.
The acceptance of the need to get rid of loans and write off losses is a concept that Mr. Horie says other banks should emulate more freely.
He said the government had helped pump about 150 trillion won, or nearly $120 billion, of private funds into tottering companies since the economic crisis of 1997 and 1998.
"There's more to go," Mr. Horie said. "The sooner they recognize that some of these nonperforming loans need to be written off, and they need to get on with life, the better off they'll be. Some of these companies need to go."
He spoke of the need to recognize failure with an urgency that is missing in the remarks of Korean officials, who talk abstractly of short-term fixes but do not give the impression that much is going to change when it comes to supporting industries.
Hwang Doo Yun, the trade minister, said that when the United States raised the issue of whether Hynix Semiconductor was in effect subsidized by the government, "We explained that underwriting was a temporary means, for one year."
As for why the government controlled some of Korea's biggest banks, Mr. Hwang said the government "had to assume the shares of financial institutions in the restructuring process in the economic crisis of 1997." The government, he said, "does not influence the institution's handling of economic loans."
Korea First Bank, in fact, was one of the first institutions taken over by the government. Burdened with loans to Daewoo group companies and others on the brink of bankruptcy, the bank was one of two that the International Monetary Fund insisted should be sold as a condition for the $58 billion bailout package that the I.M.F. put together in late 1997.
Since Mr. Horie took command, Korea First Bank has shed most of the loans to Daewoo and other troubled companies and reduced the corporate portfolio from 70 percent to 40 percent of total loans.
One of his proudest decisions came last January, when, he said, "we put our foot down on participating in the fast-track bond rollover, a scheme that required banks to participate in rolling over loans to a number of companies that we were not happy to participate in."
Mr. Horie recalled that an official at the Financial Supervisory Service, the government agency with responsibility for the banks, "got very upset and made comments to the local media." Then, he said, "the next morning he said it was all media hype," all part of the game here of testing public opinion and pulling back if the comments are not well received.
Against this background, Mr. Horie denied speculation in Korean newspapers that he had been forced out of his post after approving excessive loans to Hynix and others.
"This is my decision," he said. "Transformation of the bank has been ahead of schedule. Now I'm going to take it easy."
At the top of his agenda is charitable work in Honolulu, where he grew up. "The Honolulu Y.M.C.A. was very important to me in high school," he said. "Now I would like to give back."

Mortgage rates dropped this week to the lowest level in 30 years of record keeping, helping to spur a further boom in mortgage refinancing.
 Rates for 30-year mortgages dropped to 6.45 percent, down from 6.56 percent the previous week, according to a nationwide survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac. 
 The mortgage company said the latest decline pushed 30-year mortgages to their lowest level since it began conducting its nationwide survey in 1971. It was the 13th consecutive week that 30-year mortgages have been less than 7 percent.
A number of forces are behind the drop in long-term rates, economists said, including the sinking economy, which many say they believe is in a recession, and the indirect impact of the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts. The most recent reduction, a half-point cut, came on Tuesday.

Dynegy Plans to Acquire Enron for $9 Billion in Stock
The Enron Corporation agreed to be acquired by rival Dynegy for about $9 billion in stock and the assumption of $13 billion in debt.
 The deal is an extraordinary turnabout for Enron, a Houston-based company that had been a driving force behind electricity deregulation nationwide. Its chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, a major contributor to the Republican Party, provided political influence, while its former chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, helped create financial markets for the trading of electricity and natural gas. But last winter, when California's effort to deregulate the electricity market led to soaring power prices and rolling blackouts, Enron was the subject of much criticism and political anger.

Dow at Highest Point Since Attacks
Stocks rose modestly, with the Dow Jones industrial average posting its highest close since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. The Dow closed up 20.48 points, or 0.2 percent, at 9,608. It was the highest close for the industrial average since Sept. 10, when it ended at 9.605.51. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.77 points, or nearly 0.2 percent, to 1,120.31. The Nasdaq composite index gained 0.71 points, to 1,828.48. C4.

Wall Street Hears Argentina's Case
Argentine President Fernando de la Rua went before Wall Street investors to defend his rescue plan for the country's weakening economy, saying a debt swap, is the best way to keep Argentina solvent. C3.

Japan Lowers Its Economic Outlook
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's Japanese government reduced its economic forecast for the fiscal year and expects its economy to contract at its fastest pace in more than two decades. The outlook is the government's bleakest since the second oil crisis in 1980 and follows similar reductions in estimates by private economists and the Bank of Japan. C3.

No Apologies From a Korean Banker
Wilfred Horie, lured to Korea to run one of Korea's troubled banks, Korea First Bank, has a word of advice for investors who are thinking about bankrolling large companies on the brink of failure: don't do it. Mr. Horie didn't and as he prepares for retirement, he leaves the bank First in good shape. C3.

Oil Prices Rise on Russian Rumor
Oil prices surged in response to reports that Russia might agree to restrict production, but after further reflection, analysts decided that the statement that led to the rally was more equivocal than it had appeared and prices retreated. C4.

Trade Representative on the Spot

HEADLINE: Office Vacancy Rate Climbs in New York 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
New York's office vacancy rate rose to 9.9 percent in October, the highest since 1998, as Merrill Lynch, Salomon Smith Barney and other financial firms shed workers and excess space.
 Lower Manhattan led the rise, where about 3.75 million square feet was put up for lease, an amount equal to more than one-third of the destroyed World Trade Center complex, according to the property brokerage firm Insignia/ESG. 
The city's vacancy rate is more than double what it was a year ago. 
 The data showed that the effects of a contracting economy outweighed the rush for space by companies displaced by September's terrorist attacks. In Lower Manhattan alone, the amount of space given up was nine times the amount leased, a condition known as negative absorption.
"There's not sufficient demand to stem the deterioration in occupancy due to the economy," said Bruce Surry, Insignia/ESG's executive managing director. "This negative absorption is greater in proportion than we've seen for many, many years."
The rise in vacancy rates, especially downtown, highlights the need to expedite government subsidies and benefits to encourage businesses to return downtown, Mr. Surry said. 
Average rents across the city fell to $50.06 a square foot from $50.75 in September, and $52.01 in August, the company said. The last time average rents in Manhattan were below $50 was in June 2000.
The economy contracted for the first since 1993 in the third quarter, and the jobless rate rose to a five-year high in October. Wall Street has eliminated about 18,500 jobs through Sept. 11, the biggest round of job cuts since 1987.

HEADLINE: Hollywood's Newest Star Is a Mall, And More 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA WHITAKER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
Hollywood today greeted what it hopes will be its newest star: a $615 million development that includes stores, a hotel, restaurants, cinemas and a new home for the Academy Awards.
 Developers along with the city -- which put some $90 million into the venture -- hope that it can do for Hollywood what the Walt Disney Company and others did for a seedy Times Square in the mid-90's. 
 "Hollywood has gone through a lot of changes," Rob Reiner, the actor and director, said at the grand opening. "We've seen it go up and down. I'm announcing here today Hollywood is back." 
In recent years, several efforts have been made to revitalize Hollywood, which like many other urban areas had fallen into decline, becoming a home to drug addicts and the homeless. Although 10 million tourists are said to visit the area each year, there has been little to hold them after they have photographed Grauman's Chinese Theater and checked out its entryway with the handprints and footprints of celebrities.
"We've had a lot of false starts," said Jackie Goldberg, a state assemblywoman and a former Los Angeles City Council member who has been involved in the revitalization effort. "Anything smaller than this probably wouldn't be noticeable."
Anchoring the project is the 3,650-seat Kodak Theater, which was built with the Oscars in mind (the awards program will be held here in March) and was designed to resemble a 1920's movie palace. 
The retail shops surround Babylon Court, modeled after a set from D. W. Griffith's 1916 epic movie "Intolerance." Two 33-foot-high elephants, weighing 13,500 pounds each, flank the courtyard, and at one end an arch with Egyptian carvings frames the Hollywood sign in the distance. The complex is known as Hollywood and Highland, for the intersection at its eastern edge.
As part of the project, Grauman's Chinese Theater has been restored, and six screens have been added. The Renaissance Hollywood Hotel also got a face lift, including a $4,000-a-night rooftop suite. The open-air mall has more than 70 shops and a variety of restaurants.
"It should have been like this 40 years ago," said Ron Woods, a former resident, as he took in the courtyard. "We used to have people come out from back East. We'd bring them to Hollywood and they were disappointed. This is something you can show out-of-towners and be very proud of."
But a handful of protesters across the street were not so enthusiastic. 
"This is supposed to be the new Hollywood," said John Walsh, a resident who said he opposed the use of public money for the project and criticized the authorities as failing to rid his neighborhood of crime and gangs. "Hollywood is Raymond Chandler. It's not a Las Vegas mall."
Assemblywoman Goldberg said the Hollywood and Highland project by the TrizecHahn Corporation had served as a catalyst for other developments in the area.
But small-business owners in the area have a wait-and-see attitude.
"We hope it's going to bring us a lot of business, " said Emanuel Cohen, owner of J. M. Electronic , opposite the project on Hollywood Boulevard. Mr. Cohen added, however, his business had fallen 75 percent since Sept. 11, and questions have been raised about whether this is the best time to be opening such a project.
At least for today's celebration, any such possibility was brushed aside.
"Here is a place where dreams are made," said Chief William R. Bamattre of the Los Angeles Fire Department. "I think this is a kind of in-your-face response that Hollywood can show the world."

HEADLINE: U.N. 'Dialogue' Focuses on Sept. 11 Terror Attacks and U.S. Bombing of Afghanistan 

BYLINE:  By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
From the sand-filled trucks on First Avenue to most every speech in a warm-up debate on "Dialogue Among Civilizations," the General Assembly has left no doubt of the centrality of the terror attacks on Sept. 11 in its delayed annual gathering.
 The "general debate" starts on Saturday, when President Bush -- preceded by a large truck parked outside marked "United States Secret Service" -- will address the Assembly. But already for the last two days, the "Dialogue Among Civilizations" has set the tone with a mantra of denunciations of the attacks and newly relevant calls for tolerance. 
 The strongest attack came not from the United States or Europe, but from President Mohammad Khatami of Iran, the initiator of the "dialogue" and its godfather. 
He declared the Sept. 11 attacks as "horrific" and said that they were "perpetrated by cult of fanatics who had self-mutilated their ears and tongues, and could only communicate with perceived opponents through carnage and devastation."
After that, the condemnation of the attacks as "indiscriminate brutality" and "the antithesis of all that we would hope to achieve in a dialogue of civilizations" by the American representative, Ambassador John D. Negroponte, sounded almost mild.
Mr. Khatami also issued an indirect and relatively moderate warning to the United States that "the perception of a need for revenge coupled with a misplaced sense of might could lead to failure to hear the calls of people of good will or the cries of children."
But the theme was set. Mr. Khatami had originally invoked a "dialogue among civilizations" as a code phrase for building contacts between Islamic governments like his and secular countries, but it gained new importance when it was adopted as the theme of the year by the United Nations. Now, after terror attacks by Islamic militants against Western symbols, it was the theme of the moment.
"If anyone had ever doubted the need for a dialogue among civilizations, let them doubt no more," said Secretary General Kofi Annan.
Not every speaker took as stern a line as Mr. Khatami. Some balanced a condemnation of the Sept. 11 attacks against an indictment of the American bombing campaign in Afghanistan. 
"Of course, the perpetrators of those crimes needed to be brought to justice and punished," said Kamal Aboulmagd of Egypt, a judge of the World Bank Administrative Tribunal who was among several "eminent persons" invited to speak. "However, wise people were starting to fear that the focus on reprisals might trigger a catastrophe."
Cuba's deputy foreign minister, Abelardo Marino, went further, assailing the United States for "bombing defenseless people" and more generally for undermining dialogue by seeking to impose its own ideological and cultural values.
There were others, like Prime Minister Zlatko Lagumdzija of Bosnia, who drew on the theme of the moment to recall his country's own grievances. These, he said, made him "especially sensitive to terrorism which misused religious feeling," and he said he was here "not to say, not to ask, but to scream and beg for the multiplication of efforts to speed help to innocent people who were the victims of their own leadership."
Hans Kung, a prominent theologian from Switzerland and president of the Foundation for a Global Ethic, who was another of the "eminent persons," elevated the theme to a new paradigm for international relations, guided by a "globalization of ethics."
So it went, with many of the speakers addressing an increasingly empty hall. Though it was tempting to see that as a reflection of the actual state of "dialogue," it was more closely related to the intensity of preparations for the parade of speakers next week. As in Congress, many of the speeches at the United Nations are made more for the record, or for a domestic audience, than for the enlightenment of other delegates.
In any case, it was a foretaste of the discussion to come, in which the terror attacks and the bombing campaign in Afghanistan will dominate innumerable speeches, meetings and back-room conversations. All the while, the severest security anyone could remember was there to remind delegates that the dialogue and speechifying were no longer theoretical.

HEADLINE: Security Tight for Start of United Nations Meeting in New York 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

 BODY:
Keenly aware that the United Nations General Assembly is a potential terrorist target, federal and New York City law enforcement officials are on the highest security alert for a week of meetings among world leaders scheduled to begin today.
 The convergence of so many leaders on a city still stunned by the Sept. 11 terrorist attack has provoked such deep concerns that the annual gathering has been designated a national special security event, said Brian Marr, a special agent with the Secret Service. 
 Military personnel and equipment will be at the ready. The East River will be closed during the day. Attendees will be screened by metal detectors on their way in and out of the 39-story United Nations building. Other security measures include sharpshooters on rooftops and sweeps for explosives in some areas. 
Some busy city streets will be shut down, especially today, when President Bush will be among more than 100 foreign leaders and ministers expected to attend.
"Basically, we emphasize the importance of prevention and deterrence," Mr. Marr said. "But also, the Secret Service is prepared to respond tactically to a threat, if the situation dictates."
With security increased for other recent city events, like the World Series, federal, state and city officials are already highly prepared.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that officials believed that this was a good time to hold the United Nations event and that it would help the economy.
Since Sept. 11, a stretch of First Avenue outside the United Nations complex has been barred to all vehicle traffic, said Farhan A. Haq, a United Nations spokesman.
Federal officials have familiarized themselves with the ID verification system the United Nations has in place for the more than 3,000 employees who work in the building.
In the air, private airplanes will be banned from a radius of 2.5 nautical miles from the United Nations building, up to an altitude of 18,000 feet, said Arlene Salac, a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman.
On the waters, teams of armed Coast Guard officers will patrol in cutters, along with harbor launches from the Police Department.
Officials are particularly focused on the East River and the coastal areas around the United Nations building, said Cmdr. Daniel A. Ronan, the chief of the waterways management division for the Coast Guard in New York.
Today and tomorrow, the entire East River, from bank to bank, will be closed to vessel traffic between the Queensboro Bridge and East 35th Street in Manhattan, from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., he said.
On the roads, motorists can expect traffic delays and road closures on Second Avenue, between 42nd and 57th Streets, during the morning and afternoon today and tomorrow, the police said.
In addition, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive will be closed in both directions from 1 to 3 p.m., and motorists can also expect delays and possible closures in the areas of Madison Avenue between 44th and 46th Streets and between 49th and 51st Streets.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS; 
On High Wire at a 5-Ring Circus

BYLINE:  By SELENA ROBERTS 

 BODY:
In the first pew of a tidy brick church, Lloyd Ward, his mother and four siblings would sit as tight as piano keys while Rubert Ward soothed the 40 or so souls seated in front of him each Sunday.
 During the week, Lloyd Ward's father worked two other jobs to provide for a family that was shoehorned into a 20-foot-by-20-foot house that had an outhouse and a coal-fire stove as amenities. If he was weary, Rubert Ward never revealed it during services that lasted longer than daylight on some Sundays. 
 People lifted him, and he lifted the people. But while Lloyd Ward's father could deliver a sermon fit for a revival tent, he would also step down from his pulpit. Cloaked in a black robe with burgundy trim, Rubert Ward would glide down the aisle in the Church Temple of Science, seeking out the disaffected, the troubled or anyone with threadbare faith. 
He would stop, look into their eyes, let his hand fall firmly on their shoulders and speak in a voice soft enough to be personal, but loud enough to reach every corner of his Baptist church in Detroit. 
"It was powerful," Lloyd Ward said. "When he would touch you, he'd have a way of making everyone in the congregation feel like he was preaching to them personally. He wasn't preaching to the congregation, he was preaching to me."
In 1967, Rubert Ward died at age 47 from a heart attack. Lloyd Ward was only 18, but a childhood of Sunday memories helped spirit him through a remarkable business career and ultimately to a meeting room at a Chicago hotel on Oct. 21. 
In front of some wary executives of the United States Olympic Committee, Ward presented himself as a finalist for chief executive officer. Stepping from behind his laptop, wearing a lapel mike for optimum mobility, Ward swept around the room, making eye contact with each member, connecting his vision for the organization to theirs.
He preached the value of sports, about fair play and the importance of a drug-free Olympics, reminding each member why he or she had joined the Olympic movement in the first place. The witnesses were moved, enough to sway the vote in his direction. That day, Lloyd Ward was announced as the chief executive of the U.S.O.C.
"He was powerful," said the former U.S.O.C. president Robert Helmick, who, as a board member, saw an identical presentation from Ward when he addressed the U.S.O.C last week as the new chief executive. "Something like that could have been viewed as contrived, but it wasn't. It was completely sincere."
There is little doubt that Ward's charisma -- along with his star power as the former chief executive of Maytag -- helped seduce the U.S.O.C. into electing him to fill the position, which pays $500,000 a year.
But who needs whom the most? Some members of the U.S.O.C. wonder if Ward is making only a cameo with the organization to raise his profile after his inelegant departure from Maytag in November 2000. After four chief executives in two years, the chronically unstable U.S.O.C. would suffer another blow if Ward departed in the months after the Salt Lake Games in February.
"Certainly, continuity would benefit the U.S.O.C.," said Paul George, a member of the executive committee. "I think for Lloyd Ward this job offers benefits and meaning you can only receive by working with a nonprofit organization. There are different rewards. I think he's at that place in his career where that is valuable to him."
At 52, Ward insists he is ready to make a difference, not more money. He wears an expensive gold watch with a single diamond marking its face, and he has a taste for nice houses, clothes and cars. But Ward comes across as unaffected.
"I'm here because I've chosen to be here," Ward said last week as he sat in a leather chair inside his neat corner office at the U.S.O.C. training center in Colorado Springs. "It's about being part of something significant." 
If he can build a consensus inside an unwieldy organization that has been torn apart by self-interest, Ward could provide the committee with a needed morale boost and image makeover. If he can wield his marketing experience, he could polish up the Olympic brand name and court sponsors when contracts come up for renewal at the end of 2002. If he succeeds, Ward could make a difference in reviving the American Olympic movement.
It is a daunting job, but Ward has a background in working wonders. In a childhood home he said was about the size of his master bedroom today, Ward grew up thinking about what was possible, not impossible. His surroundings did not hold him back; they made him quicker and smarter, even as it related to the strategy behind an outhouse run. 
"In my mind, I was always making this tradeoff on how I was going to dress to how quick I could be," Ward said. "So you play this game in your mind. It toughens you up. As a kid, you do crazy things. You run out there in the snow with no shoes and bare feet, just your underwear on. You get very efficient with it."
Ingenuity was important. Ward also leaned on this trait to find his way to an engineering degree. In grade school, he decided to focus on basketball as a means to get an education, not to become an athletic star. On scholarship at Michigan State, Ward played point guard. His shot was not always perfect, but he passed with an archer's aim.
This ability to connect has been a thread throughout his career, from the moment he started at Procter & Gamble to the day he arrived at Maytag in 1996. Almost instantly, Ward was credited with turning the $1,000 Neptune washer from an immovable object on the showroom floor into a mainstream phenomenon.
Instead of promoting the washer for its energy-saving, ecologically sound features, Ward uncovered a human angle to sell a machine that went for $600 more than others that did basically the same thing. 
"We asked consumers, 'How many gallons of water do you think you use in a typical load of laundry?' " Ward said. "Most consumers say 5 to 10, but the answer is 40. The Neptune uses 20. But is that an emotional connection? No, it's information. We did the math on this, and for the average family throughout the year, if you used a Neptune versus a conventional washer, every year you saved enough water to satisfy the thirst of a human being for a lifetime. That's making a human connection."
Ward is not infallible in his human judgment. Named chief executive of Maytag in August 1999, he was forced to resign 15 months later. There were public relations missteps along the way, including Ward's desire to move the company from its roots in Newton, Iowa. His idea was met with outrage.
It was also bad timing for Ward's innovative thinking. As the economy slowed and profits plummeted, Ward kept pushing idealism while the board demanded solidity. Eventually, Ward's great attribute, energy, became his undoing. Instead of being celebrated for his ambitious approach, Ward left labeled as impatient.
Impatience will not work in the slow-bake decision-making world of the U.S.O.C. Ward is the first to note this distinction.
"I've worked on my impatience," Ward said. "I know it's not my movement, it's everyone's movement. It's like a rubber band. If I get so out there, the rubber band breaks and there is a disconnect between me and those I want to inform."
Bonding is his strength, but can Ward convert those disaffected U.S.O.C. members who have seen smooth corporate wizards come and go in a matter of months?
"I believe that those who are in this movement, from the executive board on down, believe in it, want to contribute to it, want to make it better," Ward said. "I think I'm dealing with a congregation of believers. Are there skeptics? Yes. Is there a basis for skepticism? Yes. But the basis for skepticism is that expectations haven't been met, not yet."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE FAMILY CENTER; 
People in Need Criticize Plans to Close a Center of Help

BYLINE:  By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
The Family Assistance Center on Pier 94, set up by the city for people left jobless, homeless, bereaved or injured by the attack on the World Trade Center, is being dismantled, and the system replacing it is already generating complaints from volunteers and those seeking help.
 Last Monday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, at the city's request, took over half of the building used by the Family Assistance Center. The city-run side is closing in about two weeks, a city official said. 
 Social welfare advocates and those aided by the Family Assistance Center have praised it as a model of sensitivity, comfort and efficiency. City, state and federal agencies were there to help the needy get financial aid quickly, and other services were provided by the Red Cross, the Salvation Army and Safe Horizon. 
The center offered a full buffet, child care and free access to telephones and computers.
But the main purpose of the Family Assistance Center was to help the bereaved, not the jobless or homeless, said a city official who did not want to be named. Now that the number of bereaved people seeking help is dwindling, the city plans to close that part of the center in two weeks.
When FEMA arrived at Pier 94, between West 53rd and West 54th Streets, the city and the federal agency set up a new system for handling requests: those who were injured or lost relatives in the attack were to line up on the city-run side; those who lost jobs, homes or their businesses would line up on the FEMA-run side.
"The difference is vast," said Diane, 35, who lost her job as a saleswoman at the Marriott World Trade Center Hotel when it was destroyed on Sept. 11. She had sought help at Pier 94 last month and returned yesterday. "They fed us. They had a large TV and music and free phones. Now they give us a bottle of water and a cup of juice and make us wait and wait."
Those seeking help say the lines on the FEMA side are very long, with waits of three to four hours just to make an appointment for the next day. Instead of a full buffet, the Red Cross distributes water, coffee and sandwiches. The city-run side has indoor bathrooms; the FEMA side has outdoor toilets.
FEMA opened the center at Pier 94 because its downtown center, on Worth Street, could not handle the crowds, said Ron Sherman, a FEMA official. More than 600 people go to the Worth Street center every day, he said, and hundreds are turned away. 
Yesterday, more than 600 showed up at Pier 94, and he said he expected an equal number in the weeks to come as people use up their savings and lose jobs to a sinking economy.
Over the past two months, 229,000 people have sought help at the Family Assistance Center, a city official said yesterday. But the number of bereaved or injured people looking for government help is rapidly decreasing. At the same time, the number of displaced or jobless people needing money is high and is expected to remain that way.
The help offered before FEMA arrived at Pier 94 has not changed significantly, Mr. Sherman said. The Red Cross, the Salvation Army and Safe Horizons, the city's main emergency assistance groups, have booths inside, as does the Small Business Administration and employment organizations. Registering with FEMA will streamline the process of obtaining aid from other agencies and organizations, he said.
People can register for unemployment, housing and other emergency assistance on the phone, without waiting in line, Mr. Sherman said.
But people who sought help weeks ago and are still in need say the restrictions have tightened considerably. Right after the attacks, government and private agencies gave out money freely, they said. Now, the organizations are requiring people to fill out more forms, wait longer and provide more documentation, like utility and rent bills and paycheck stubs, to qualify for help, they said.
Most of the complaints, however, centered on discomfort and inconvenience rather than on the quality of help. Several expressed dismay with the spartan decor, the lack of amenities and the long, cold wait outside, with the wind whipping off the Hudson River. 
Some employees and volunteers are also dismayed by the new workplace. 
"The workers are in cramped quarters," one said. "No more breakfast or dinner, though many are working 12-hour shifts." The screening and security checks, she said, are unreasonably long.
Mr. Sherman said the security precautions were necessary and the quarters adequate. Providing comfort to shellshocked people was a prime concern immediately after the attack, he said. But most people now need practical help, like rent money and assistance finding jobs or apartments.
The federal government has extended the deadline for emergency aid to Jan. 10, he added, to accommodate hotel, restaurant, airline and tourism employees who were recently laid off or will be shortly.
He added that the comforts, like the generous meals and upholstered chairs, were pleasant but expensive to provide. "I don't like those lines any more than they do," he said.

HEADLINE: JOURNAL; 
War is Heck

BYLINE:  By Frank Rich

 BODY:
I was also at Chicago's O'Hare Airport last Saturday when Subash Gurung, an illegal immigrant with no fixed address, slipped seven knives, a can of Mace and a stun gun through the X-ray machine at a "security" checkpoint. Eager to honor our toughened airport protocols, I had my ticket and ID ready for examination, but at the penultimate juncture, a smile and a wave were enough. The "guard" smiled back, never bothering to read or match the ticket with the ID. It was all so convivial you'd never guess this is a nation at war. 
 Maybe it's not. What I witnessed at O'Hare -- and eight other major American airports I've been to since Sept. 11 -- suggests that two months after hijackers turned commercial passenger jets into weapons of mass destruction, there's no great hurry to standardize or enforce airline security far beyond the ruthless crackdown on manicure scissors. Yes, National Guard troops are on duty, but as easily distracted onlookers. In Washington, Congress is AWOL, trying to forge a mishmash "compromise" out of competing security bills that would take many months to institute anyway. Our secretary of transportation, Norman Mineta, hasn't exactly filled the gap. Outraged at the breach at O'Hare, Mr. Mineta swore stiff retribution -- a farcical threat given that the many past infractions of the offending rent-a-guard company, Argenbright, have already been punished, with no deterrent effect whatsoever, by a seven-figure fine and even a jail term for one of its supervisors. 
 Mr. Mineta is so overmatched by events that he makes Tommy Thompson look like Patton. In a letter to The Times 10 days ago the transportation secretary argued that private security companies should be kept on the job in airports in part because the State Department uses them to protect our embassies abroad. Hel-lo! It was private guards who were presiding when Osama bin Laden's operatives bombed our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, killing 224 and injuring more than 5,000. 
Perhaps Mr. Mineta and Congress are taking their sweet time on airline security because they buy the conventional wisdom that Al Qaeda won't repeat the same terrorist act again so soon. But isn't terrorism by definition dedicated to defying the conventional wisdom? Even so, the lack of urgency about airline security is more the rule than the exception in Washington as America's New War seems less and less new. Though the cable news channels use rubrics like "America Strikes Back," perhaps "What's the Rush?" would be more appropriate. 
Thus we learn in Senate testimony this week that, a month after the first anthrax case, the F.B.I. still hasn't located all the American labs that legally handle anthrax, let alone any suspects for its illegal dissemination. On Thursday John Ashcroft, who may be abridging more civil liberties while nabbing fewer criminals than any law enforcement official in American history, proudly announced that we have "emerged victorious in the opening battle in the war against terrorism." Thus he can turn his attention to hunting down doctors trying to ease the agony of the terminally ill in Oregon. 
The collateral damage to the economy can wait, too. Dick Armey promises that the House's stimulus bill "will create 170,000 jobs next year alone" -- even as 415,000 Americans lost jobs in October alone, bringing total unemployment to 7.7 million. The House's package also awards $5.7 billion in tax rebates to 13 Fortune 500 corporations while Congress earmarks at most $3 billion for fighting bioterrorism at a time when the American Hospital Association estimates that $11 billion is needed just to upgrade hospitals. But hey, what's the rush? As Tom DeLay said on Fox, "The American people need to learn that these terrorists are going after specific people, people that are symbols. . . . Somebody in Sugarland, Texas, shouldn't worry about anthrax."
"The new normal" is now the old normal. Before Sept. 11 the administration said we could have it all -- deep tax cuts, better schools, a surplus -- without paying any price. Now the tax cuts can be accelerated, and we can battle international evil too. Though President Bush talks repeatedly of sacrifice required by the war effort, so far any tough sacrifices have been mainly borne by those directly affected by the attacks and by our all-volunteer armed forces. No one is demanding that the rest of us pay for serious airline or bioterror security, or that we cut down on gas-guzzling to reduce our dependency on the oil of Saudi Arabia, whose other big export is terrorists. Instead we are told to go shopping, take in a show, go to Disneyland. On this war's home front, "sacrifice" is easy-to-crack code for "vacation." 
Nor does the administration want to let too much bad news dampen the fun, unless it's absolutely unavoidable. In a month we've gone from Mr. Thompson's sunny spin on the first anthrax death to Tom Ridge's declaration this week that he's "hopeful" the threat is over. (Given our poor bioterror defense capability, "prayerful" is the mot juste.) Such is these men's credibility that the president had to ride to the rescue with a prime-time pep talk on homeland security Thursday night, albeit one dumped by three of the four major networks, who reverted to the old normal of "Survivor 3," "Family Guy" and "Friends." (Karl Rove travels to Hollywood this weekend to enlist sacrifice from show-biz moguls -- but he better not ask for it during the Nielsen sweeps.)
Even before Mr. Bush's speech, the mixture of political dawdling and official happy-talk that have undermined confidence in the war's home-front battles had started to taint perceptions of the war in Afghanistan. Most Americans are still patient -- it's only been a month. But armchair hawks, most of them in Mr. Bush's own party and echoed by the allegedly liberal press, are turning against the president's military campaign, faulting it for being too "dainty" to send in ground troops, for failing to take on Iraq and for what one of the more articulate critics, Robert Kagan of the Carnegie Endowment, calls its "eerie similarities with the early stages of the Vietnam War." 
Because of one major dissimilarity with Vietnam -- journalists have far less access to what is happening in Afghanistan than they did to the incipient quagmire in Southeast Asia -- such conclusions are speculative. But it's easy to make the case that one similarity between Vietnam and the war on terrorism is already nailed down: the light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel syndrome. Much as Mr. Thompson defied scientific reality to portray the first skirmish with anthrax as an isolated incident, so the military seems inclined to sugar-coat the war against Al Qaeda -- even when what few facts we have stand in the way. 
The Taliban, whom officials initially predicted would implode or be overthrown once bombing began, have since been described as "eviscerated" (by Lt. Gen. Gregory Newbold, Oct. 16); "degraded and diminished" (Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Oct. 25); and "on their heels" (the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Richard Myers, last Sunday). Boy, that was easy -- the Taliban on the run, without a single American battle casualty, even before the battle of Mazar-i-Sharif. 
We're also repeatedly told that the vastly outnumbered Northern Alliance -- poorly equipped warriors "who farm or do odd jobs when not at the front," as The Los Angeles Times put it -- is an able proxy with or without shoes. Then there's that U.S. Special Operations raid on the lair of the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, which "went flawlessly" and "accomplished our objectives" (per General Myers) but was a "near disaster" (according to Seymour Hersh in The New Yorker) netting scant intelligence (according to The Times). 
Like politicians' assertions that terrorism at home can be deflected by cheap fixes and oratorical optimism, disingenuous official claims of our allies' strengths and our enemies' weaknesses will come back to haunt the administration if all does not go smoothly. Already a Newsweek poll shows that only 56 percent of the country believes "the war in Afghanistan is going as well as American officials say."
In a week in which Rudy Giuliani has begun to fade from the scene, it's worth remembering that his wartime leadership was matchless because he leveled with us as much as possible, even when he was the bearer of the darkest news. Most of the visiting dignitaries from Washington seem to have forgotten this lesson the moment they finished posing at Ground Zero.

Re "State Plans Rebuilding Agency, Perhaps Led by Giuliani" (news article, Nov. 3):
 The important value of preservation as a stabilizing force must be part of the discussion of redevelopment and growth. 
Preservation's track record for revving up the economic engine of rehabilitation through adaptive reuse of historic resources has given us SoHo and TriBeCa, two brilliantly successful Lower Manhattan neighborhoods. 
 Perhaps the agency's most crucial task is to recognize that architectural and cultural landmarks and the sense of place they create are the foundations upon which thriving cities are built. While we miss the towers, what we miss most is the sense of place they created, a thriving community that was a cultural and architectural landmark. 
To succeed, redevelopment must reweave the damaged threads of fabric that terrorism sought to tear apart, and create a sense of place that fills the void and honors the losses of Sept. 11.

 Rebuilding New York poses enormous challenges and creates an unprecedented opportunity to revitalize the economy and to make our community stronger and better than ever. 
But for that vision to be realized, we must use 100 percent of the creativity, skills and knowledge available. 
 This means that the proposed Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Corporation must include women: experts from every field and leaders from our diverse communities. Too often, "business as usual" has meant that too many people are left out. Women must be included in the initial development of the project; in the well-paying, nontraditional jobs that will be created and in the business opportunities that will become available.

HEADLINE: Despite Mail Tumult, Pitney Bowes's Long-Term Outlook Is Strong 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Logically speaking, this should be a perilous time for Pitney Bowes. The combination of a recessionary economy and bioterrorism has caused mail volume to plummet. Postal rates are almost certain to rise, which will probably prod many businesses to switch even more of their mailings to the Internet or to private deliverers like Federal Express. Since Pitney makes most of its money from renting out postage meters and running mailrooms, Michael J. Critelli, Pitney's chief executive, should be sweating badly.
 He's not. 
 "The short-term downside of the tumult is fewer pieces of mail and fewer copies made," Mr. Critelli acknowledged. "But the upside is more interest in mailroom management and postage meters." 
Wall Street seems to agree. "There's been a near-term hit to mail volumes, but it'll be a temporary hit," predicted Benjamin A. Reitzes, a UBS Warburg analyst.
In October, Pitney told analysts that it would probably earn $2.35 to $2.40 a share this year, well below the $2.60 it had been predicting. Pitney's shares closed yesterday at $38.41 -- nowhere near the $44.70 they hit in August, but well above the $28 they sold at a year ago. Most analysts maintain a solid buy recommendation on the stock. 
"They seem to be viewing the anthrax scares as a nonissue," said Charles L. Hill, director of research at Thomson Financial/First Call.
Terrorism is not Pitney's only challenge, of course. The company, which is based in Stamford, Conn., commands 85 percent of the American postage meter market and 61 percent of the global market. But competition is heating up. 
Neopost Inc., the French company that is Pitney's main competitor overseas, just bought Ascom Hasler, a Swiss company, and together they command 25 percent of the global postage meter market. Francotyp-Postalia, a German company, is also nipping away at market share.
But Pitney is bulking up, too. It recently bought the French postage meter company Secap.
"Neopost is a strong competitor, but Pitney is making progress in profitability and share in Europe," said Deane M. Dray of Goldman, Sachs. 
Pitney can expect to have resources soon to expand overseas even more. Much of its debt carries variable interest rates, so it will be helped by recent cuts in rates. And it is about to spin its fax and copier business off to shareholders, leaving Pitney free to concentrate still more capital on overseas markets. Nor has postal chaos appreciably stymied Pitney's domestic prospects. Every time postal rates go up, Pitney's meter customers must pay the company to have meters recalibrated. And because customers rent the equipment on long-term contracts, Pitney has a protected stream of recurring revenues. 
But mainly, Mr. Critelli is not panicking because he has been preparing for a drop in mail revenue for quite some time. Many companies already use e-mail for routine correspondence and customer promotions, and many have switched to a distribute-and-print model -- e-mail a document, and let recipients print it out themselves -- for handbooks, contracts and other papers that formerly would have been sent by mail. 
Many banks and utilities already have systems in place giving customers access to their bills online, and enabling them to pay those bills either online, via telephone or through direct debits of their checking accounts. Some 5 million of American Express's 30 million cards, for example, are registered with the company's online site, giving cardholders the option of paying bills electronically. 
Earlier this month, Verizon unveiled a newly designed Web page that will make it easier for phone customers to pay bills online. 
"The timing was absolutely fortuitous, but this is the way the world was heading anyway," said James Smith, a Verizon spokesman. 
Pitney is heading that way, too. It already derives more than a quarter of its approximately $4 billion in annual revenue from nonmail-related services, and it expects that to hit 35 percent next year. One example is the online bill-paying system Pitney now administers for several customers. And the company recently acquired Alysis, which specializes in electronic payment systems. 
"Our new products have a very different value-add from the old ones," Mr. Critelli said. 
For now, though, mail-related products are still the revenue leaders for Pitney and its competitors. Not everyone has a home computer, and most people who do still use the postal system to pay bills. And catalog companies say that customers who order from their Web sites usually make their selections first from a paper catalog received in the mail. 
"The feedback we're getting from customers is that moving away from the mails is simply not an option," said Larry Turner, president of Francotyp-Postalia.
More episodes of mail-carried anthrax or other diseases could change that. But Pitney and its competitors may find business opportunities in the postal fears, too. 
Most report a much larger volume of queries from corporations looking to farm out the management of their mailrooms, or to have their mail processed off site. Many are pushing equipment that opens letters automatically and lets handlers see the contents without touching them. 
Francotyp-Postalia is working with several European companies to find ways to build biosensors and decontamination technology into equipment that sorts and opens mail. 
Xerox Business Services is working on a technology that would enable post offices to receive mail electronically and print it out on site. "The carrier and the recipient would have the comfort of knowing the letter was generated in a secure environment," said Richard J. Leo, the Xerox unit's vice president.
Pitney, Neopost and Franco-Postalia are all offering digital meters that include information about the sender along with postage, as well as using codes that enable mail to be tracked and located at any time. Such monitoring capabilities may provide a comfort level that could increase the use of metered mail. 
"There's a tug of war between two dynamics -- potentially lower mail volumes, and a shift to metered mail and mailroom management," said Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. "The short-term implications for Pitney are negative, but long term, they're positive."

HEADLINE: Regulators Struggle With a Marketplace Created by Enron 

BYLINE:  By JEFF GERTH with RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
For years, the Enron Corporation used its political muscle to build the markets in which it thrived, pushing relentlessly on Capitol Hill and in bureaucratic backwaters to deregulate the nation's natural gas and electricity businesses.
 Its achievement, as one Enron executive said today, in creating a "regulatory black hole" fit nicely with what he called the company's "core management philosophy, which was to be the first mover into a market and to make money in the initial chaos and lack of transparency." 
 Now, Wall Street's dissatisfaction with Enron's secretive ways has delivered the company into the arms of its much smaller Houston rival, Dynegy Inc., in a deal worth about $9 billion in stock and the assumption of $13 billion in debt. The combination of the two companies, energy experts and lawmakers said today, poses a novel set of challenges for regulators still struggling to grasp the complexities of the marketplace that Enron invented.
"We're in a supersonic-speed era of electronic trading with a horse-and-buggy-era regulatory system to protect consumers," said Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who has devised legislation to close the regulatory gap. 
Dynegy's acquisition of Enron is expected to be reviewed by numerous state and federal agencies, led by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Analysts said today that sharp scrutiny would be given to the combined companies' holdings in California, where Dynegy owns generating plants and Enron controls a large part of the market for trading natural gas -- the fuel for a big share of the state's electric power plants.
"Dynegy would now have a greater ability to take the dominant position in gas and raise the price of electricity," said Frank Wolak, a professor of economics at Stanford University.
Mr. Wolak, a consultant to the Justice Department on a 1999 antitrust case that led to limits on another merger of electricity and natural gas companies in Southern California, said he was skeptical that regulators were up to the task of reviewing today's deal.
The transaction "is something the Department of Justice needs to look at, and they are going to have a hard time looking at," Mr. Wolak said. "And it's beyond the ability of the F.E.R.C. to look at."
Pat Wood -- named chairman of the federal energy commission earlier this year with the backing of Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman of Enron -- acknowledged in an interview today that the agency had "a long way to go" in matching the sophistication of the companies it regulates.
But he said that the commission had made great strides in grappling with the new risk management techniques pioneered by Enron, Dynegy and other energy companies. It is hiring more experts, he said, adopting more restrictive rules on how much "market power" one party can control and requiring more disclosure of certain energy transactions.
In an interview this evening, Charles L. Watson, the chairman of Dynegy, said he did not believe that regulators reviewing the deal with Enron would require the sale of any assets. "We haven't really identified any pitfalls that require any sort of asset divestiture," he said. "There's not really any overlap." 
A senior executive at one of Enron's largest energy-trading rivals disagreed. "I don't think this deal gets through unscathed," he said today. "I'm sure the Justice Department and the F.T.C. will look closely at the pretty substantial concentration of market power these companies will have in the energy-trading area." 
Enron is mainly a trader of natural gas and electricity -- indeed, the biggest player in both those markets -- and it also owns a network of gas pipelines. Dynegy processes and sells natural gas and generates and sells electricity. Each company owns a local electric utility, too: Dynegy owns Illinois Power in Decatur, Ill., while Enron owns Portland General Electric in Portland, Ore., but last month announced plans to sell it to another Oregon utility.
For a decade, as it transformed itself from a gas pipeline operator into the nation's biggest energy trader, Enron enjoyed unalloyed lobbying success in Washington and the enthusiastic backing of Wall Street. 
In the early months of the Bush administration, Mr. Lay -- whose company was one of the biggest financial backers of George W. Bush's presidential campaign -- played a prominent, and some said unusual, role in helping the White House pick nominees to the federal energy commission. Enron executives met with Vice President Dick Cheney, whose energy task force backed many of the deregulatory initiatives pushed by Mr. Lay.
Now, "the company has become a pariah," an Enron executive said today. "The Bush administration doesn't want to have anything to do with us."
The problems began with the energy crisis in California, where Enron's outspoken defense of deregulation, even more than its electricity trading activities, made the company a favorite whipping boy of politicians and consumer advocates. In the financial markets, meanwhile, Enron's confusing disclosures, tolerated when its stock was soaring, drew disdain as the calming of the energy storms in California and other parts of the country beat the shares down, starting last spring.
"Enron fell victim to their own inconsistencies on transparency," Mr. Wolak said. As California officials sought to understand why energy prices had soared out of control, he said, Enron's "view was that we want everybody's data, but if you want ours, get a subpoena."
Energy executives and regulators said that sort of arrogance had long marked Enron's attitude about government oversight.
Electricity sales had for decades been the job of local utility companies, operating as monopolies and selling power at regulated rates within their service areas. A few entrepreneurs, led by Mr. Lay, conceived a different model in which power could be sold by generators or middlemen to big corporate users or utilities in faraway regions, at whatever price the market would bear.
In the early 1990's, Congress -- under heavy lobbying by Enron -- passed legislation that began to open up electricity sales to marketers. Before long, Enron became one of the first companies to receive government approval to sell electricity at market rates. The market for interstate sales of natural gas had been freed up a few years earlier, and critics complained that traders like Enron were gleaning their profits by stoking volatility in gas prices.
In the mid-1990's, independent gas producers backed legislation in Congress to allow the creation of a co-operative marketing organization, which, they hoped, would have helped stabilize prices.
Raymond Plank, the chairman of the Apache Corporation, a gas producer based in Houston, said that the big gas marketing and trading companies, including Enron, successfully lobbied to kill the plan, leaving prices as volatile as ever. 
"It was a great concept," Mr. Plank said. "We could have headed off the problems we have today."
Enron's final lobbying success came last year. With a strong push from the company's lobbyists, Congress passed futures trading legislation that exempted Internet energy trading platforms like EnronOnline, the industry leader, from oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Enron takes the other side of trades on its exchange. In traditional markets like the New York Mercantile Exchange, which remain subject to oversight, the exchange acts as a middleman between buyers and sellers.
Under Mr. Watson, Dynegy has been less of a pathbreaker than Enron, and though California politicians denounced it, too, as a profiteer during the energy crisis, most analysts say it has been less aggressive than Enron in both its business practices and its lobbying.
Indeed, the rival energy-trading executive today predicted "a huge culture clash" as the Houston neighbors merge. "Blood will flow in Houston over the integration of the trading operation," he said.
But regulators may find Dynegy easier to deal with.
Earlier this year, the federal energy commission asked for comments on whether it should tighten scrutiny of dealings between natural gas pipelines and energy-trading shops owned by the same company.
Enron wondered what all the bother was. "Would stricter rules prevent real affiliate abuse that current rules do not," it wrote in a regulatory filing, "or would they instead merely restrict the activities of some of the more successful participants in the marketplace?"
Dynegy, by contrast, painted a grim picture and invited regulators to crack down. "Abuses abound," it said, "because of financial windfalls, difficulty of detection, lengthy investigations and increased complexity of the market."

Argentine Chief Tells Wall St. That Debt Swap Is Best Course

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
President Fernando de la Rua of Argentina went before Wall Street investors yesterday to defend his plan for rescuing the country's weakening economy, saying a debt swap was the best way to keep Argentina solvent.
 Although critics see the move as a sign that a default is imminent, Mr. de la Rua pledged that Argentina would find a way to pay off its staggering debt load and emerge from recession. 
 "Argentina has always honored and will continue to honor its obligations," he said in a speech to about 300 investors and analysts. 
Mr. de la Rua, who had met earlier with William J. McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said he was not in the United States to ask for money.
"We have come to explain the situation," he said.
The debt swap, which calls on investors to accept lower interest payments and postpones full payment by three years, would be the largest such restructuring.
Mr. de la Rua said devaluing Argentina's currency would be disastrous to the economy. He also said he would overcome opposition by powerful governors to a domestic plan to balance the country's budget.
On Thursday, the governors of the opposition Peronist Party refused to accept less money from the national government as part of the cost-cutting program. Without offering details, Mr. de la Rua predicted that the governors would change their minds.
The standoff over billions of dollars in tax revenue threatens the government's access to a $22 billion international rescue package.
Only eight governors from Mr. de la Rua's ruling coalition, along with one independent, have signed on to the plan. That is far short of the unanimous bipartisan support he will need to convince the International Monetary Fund and international lenders that Argentina is serious about deficit reduction.
In trading yesterday in Buenos Aires, the Merval index of leading shares fell 2.6 percent, to 228.36. Since July 1, the index has fallen 44 percent.
On Sunday, Mr. de la Rua and President Bush are scheduled to discuss the plan to reorganize Argentina's $132 billion debt. Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, has said that Argentina must carry out plans to end deficit spending and that Mr. Bush will probably tell Mr. de la Rua that.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home; 
Ideology As Usual

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY LEWIS

 BODY:
George W. Bush has focused effectively on the need for an international alliance against terrorism. But he has not yet understood what a wartime president has to do at home: Put aside ideological politics so he can be president of all the people. 
 With his evident approval, the ideologues in his administration are riding their conservative hobbyhorses as if the country did not have a higher purpose now. They, and the president, seem oblivious to the way those actions threaten national unity. 
 A striking example is the decision by Attorney General John Ashcroft this week to try to overrule the voters of Oregon and undo that state's assisted-suicide law. He said he would move to revoke the drug prescription license of any Oregon doctor who used drugs to help someone who wanted to die. 
Mr. Ashcroft is a fervent opponent of abortion and, like many social and religious conservatives, sees any state sanction of suicide in the same light. His decision this week was praised by the National Right to Life Committee. 
In terms of states' rights, which conservatives say they support, the Ashcroft decision was rank hypocrisy. He asserted federal power in an area that has always been pre-eminently a matter for state law, the regulation of medical practice. Oregonians approved the assisted-suicide law narrowly in a referendum in 1994 and reaffirmed it in 1996 by a 60-to-40 margin. Even some who had opposed the law reacted bitterly to Mr. Ashcroft's intrusion on Oregon territory. 
In another strange example of his priorities, Mr. Ashcroft last month sent federal agents to raid a Los Angeles center that supplied marijuana to desperately ill people under a state law allowing medical use. Does a wartime Justice Department really have nothing better to do than deprive cancer and AIDS patients of relief from their pain? 
Two weeks ago the British government decided to stop arresting marijuana users, adopting the policy now followed by most European governments. The U.S. law against users has not changed, but Mr. Ashcroft has discretion to use Justice Department resources where they are most urgently needed -- especially in a war situation.
The attorney general has heavy responsibilities on the domestic side of the fight against terrorism. He is in charge of the hunt for supporters of the Sept. 11 terrorists, and for the spreaders of anthrax. Pursuing his ideological desires can only divide the public and weaken respect for the administration's antiterrorist effort. 
Mr. Ashcroft is the most egregious example of an official unable or unwilling to curb his ideological zealotry at this time. But he is not the only one. 
The environment is another area where the Bush administration is pursuing highly controversial policies despite the country's preoccupation with the terrorist threat. Indeed, Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton and Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman are taking advantage of that preoccupation to push through ripper measures while no one is paying attention. 
The device being used is an ingenious one: caving in to lawsuits by interests that object to restraints on environmental damage. One such suit asks the courts to block a Clinton administration regulation that would stop further road-building in 60 million pristine acres of the national forests. The Bush administration has simply put up no defense of the regulation in court. 
The administration is also trying to scuttle a Clinton regulation that would gradually end the use of snowmobiles in Yellowstone National Park: a rule that the public overwhelmingly approves. When snowmobile manufacturers sued, the Bush people agreed to "reconsider" the regulation. 
Finally, there is the reeking scandal of the so-called economic stimulus bill passed by the House. It would give some of the largest corporations refunds for taxes paid over many years in the past: $671 million to General Electric, according to Citizens for Tax Justice, and $1.4 billion to I.B.M. Making the rich richer will do little to stimulate the economy, and less to stimulate our patriotism. 
During World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt publicly put aside his domestic objectives for the sake of the war. Dr. New Deal, he said, had to give way to Dr. Win-the-War. It is time for President Bush to curb his zealots and focus us all on the struggle against terrorism.

HEADLINE: Upstate Republicans in House Join Democrats in Fight for More Money for New York 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
New York Republicans appear headed toward a showdown with the Bush administration and Republican leaders in the House, demanding billions of dollars in additional federal aid to help New York rebuild from the terrorist attack.
 In a rare alliance, New York Republicans are siding with their Democratic colleagues in the House, potentially provoking a confrontation that could force Republican leaders on the Hill and the Bush administration to support added spending for New York. 
 The fight is over the $20 billion that President Bush promised to give New York in the days after the attack. The administration and its Republican allies in Congress have been disbursing the money in installments, saying that New York will get the money as it is needed. 
But for several weeks now, many House Democrats from New York have been questioning whether the administration and Congressional leaders can be trusted to follow through on the president's commitment without public pressure.
Now, these Democrats are being joined by leading New York Republicans, who are not hurling accusations the way Democrats have but who are bent on achieving the same goal: getting New York the money it was promised.
The bipartisan effort took shape when Democrats secured the support of two upstate New York Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee: Representatives James Walsh and John Sweeney.
The two say they are prepared to join Democrats on the Appropriations Committee to push through a measure that would provide $9 billion to $11 billion in additional aid for New York next week.
At the same time, members of New York's Congressional delegation are hoping to enlist Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, both Republicans, to lobby the president directly when he visits New York this weekend.
To date, New York has been given about $9.2 billion of the $20 billion that President Bush promised. But New York lawmakers are worried that the White House and Congress will stall on the rest, particularly because Washington suddenly has to pay for antiterrorism measures and a war in Afghanistan, as the national economy begins to slump.
In an interview this afternoon, Mr. Walsh made it clear that he wanted more than just words of reassurance that New York would get the whole $20 billion.
Mr. Walsh noted that the money was supposed to come out of a $40 billion package that the president and Congress approved immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks in New York and Washington to help pay for disaster relief, military actions and counterterrorism measures.
Mr. Walsh said he decided to force the issue after it became clear to him that New York would get no more than the $9.2 billion that it had already received. "What we're saying is, 'Mr. President, here are the funds you need to keep your commitment to New York,' " he said. "We have to do this."
The developments provided a rare display of unity for New York's delegation, whose members have been on different, if not competing, tracks in the effort to extract additional aid from Washington. In particular, New York lawmakers have been at odds over whether to take the White House to task publicly for not delivering the entire $20 billion.
One faction of the delegation -- primarily the state's two Democratic senators, Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton -- had taken a more conciliatory approach in dealing with the White House, believing that words of encouragement, not criticism, would do more good to move the administration in New York's direction, particularly in this time of national mourning.
But today, both senators threw their support behind the bipartisan effort that their New York colleagues were undertaking in the House. "We have always argued that we should get as much of the $20 billion" as New York needs, Mrs. Clinton said.
Mr. Schumer said, "I think it's great that they are doing this."
The move by Mr. Sweeney and Mr. Walsh came after mounting frustration among some New York Republicans in the House. Privately, they had been arguing that they had helped deliver a crucial victory for Mr. Bush when the House narrowly rejected a Democratic bill to turn 28,000 baggage handlers and passenger screeners into federal workers. Some were hoping their loyalty would be rewarded.
Mr. Sweeney and Mr. Walsh plan to introduce their measure as an amendment to a $20 billion antiterrorism package that the Appropriations Committee is expected to take up next week. President Bush has threatened to veto such a measure.
The amendment includes $9 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to pay for reconstruction efforts in Lower Manhattan, among other things. The amendment also provides another $2 billion in mandatory spending for unemployment insurance, workers compensation and the extension of so-called Cobra health insurance benefits.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE HOME FRONT; 
After Asking for Volunteers, Government Tries to Determine What They Will Do

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
A day after President Bush asked Americans to respond to the war on terror with an outpouring of volunteerism, his administration began trying to figure out how to mobilize a vast force of Americans for a still sketchy role on the home front battlefield.
 Mr. Bush gave a task force on citizen preparedness, run by his homeland security and domestic policy advisers, 40 days to recommend ways for Americans to help with civilian tasks. 
 Tom Ridge, the director of homeland security, said today at a White House briefing, "There is an inventory of things we believe we can give America to choose from to help us in this battle against terrorism." 
In an interview, Mr. Ridge said some of his ideas included drawing on the expertise of retired police officers and asking retired physicians to train disaster personnel and retired nurse practitioners to learn new emergency skills.
"We just have to identify those who have the greatest potential for service and go recruit," Mr. Ridge said.
He said he was also talking to the national Ad Council about helping to "inform and inspire" people to join such efforts.
In World War II, it was clear how Americans would wage the war at home: through gasoline and food rationing, tin foil drives, victory gardens and buying war bonds. Women entered the industrial work force, and all the steps made a crucial difference. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a fireside chat called such efforts "the privilege of making whatever self-denial is necessary."
Now a debate has been rising over exactly how much sacrifice is really needed and how those at home should respond to what Mr. Bush calls "a different kind of conflict."
Mr. Bush can easily explain what that means in military terms: "It's a war that matches high-technology weapons with people on horseback," he said today. But many officials say it is less clear how people can respond at home to a conflict that may be more akin to the cold war.
Some commentators are even arguing for national conscription for the military and for homeland defense efforts like border patrol. Others by contrast say that a wartime mentality of sacrifice and a radical change in the way Americans live would mean that terrorists had won. Mr. Bush himself said much the same thing on Thursday night.
Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, expressed that view this way: "There are certain sacrifices we have to be prepared to make, but it's not like we need to be given something to do. Au contraire. The best thing you can do to defeat this enemy is live your normal life, because it will do two important things: keep the economic train running and it will demoralize the enemy more than the enemy would demoralize you."
Mr. Ridge said today that it was "a little bit misleading" to look to World War II as a model for today's homeland security effort.
"We had an economy, a country that was struggling economically, on its way out of depression," he said, "and we didn't have surplus resources so there was the need to ration meat and sugar. It's a little bit different today."
He said that Americans willing to volunteer now were, in fact, making a sacrifice. 
"They are taking time away from their family and their profession," he said. "That's a significant contribution."
Some of the impulse for the volunteer effort is to keep national spirit up and provide a role for Americans who want to do more than display their patriotism by flying and shopping again. Mr. Bush's advisers said it would be demoralizing if they could not find a way to harness the energies of Americans who want to help. Other political figures say it could also undermine the war effort if Americans become disengaged.
"People are going to have to get involved in this," said George Christian, who was President Lyndon B. Johnson's press secretary at the end of his term in some of the bitterest days of the Vietnam War. "So far it's a government effort, as it should be, but people aren't engaged."
Part of the federal government's task if it is to mobilize a vast homeland volunteer effort is to find ways to train people for their roles and to create an emergency structure for them to report to. New York City eventually had to send all but the most skilled and essential volunteers away from ground zero.
Stephen Goldsmith, the chairman of the Corporation for National and Community Service, which oversees the AmeriCorps and Senior Corps programs, said today that training, recruiting and managing volunteers was difficult to do well. Mr. Bush asked the corporation to start homeland security efforts in public safety, public health and disaster preparedness.
Mr. Goldsmith said the expansion in the ranks of the national service programs proposed by Mr. Bush might allow the corporation to use its enlistees in national service to manage other volunteers for public health and security efforts. "The goal here would be to leverage numbers," he said.
But others say volunteerism is insufficient for the times. "We're in a war," said Charles Moskos, a sociology professor at Northwestern University, "and this is the first time in American history that we have a serious war going on without a draft." Dr. Moskos dismissed Mr. Bush's call for volunteerism as "patriotism on the cheap."
In a recent article in The Washington Monthly, Mr. Moskos and a co-author, Paul Glastris, contended that a new draft would focus less on raising conscripts for the military than on enlisting men and women for such tasks as border patrol, tracking immigrants and guarding dams, nuclear power plants and sports complexes.
But many officials believe a draft would be too unpopular and that it would bring in more people than needed.
Representative Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut, who has long been a proponent of national service programs, said, "I believe the government needs to provide opportunities for people who want to be of service, but I'm not at the point where I think that should be mandatory."
Asked about mandatory national service, Mr. Ridge said: "You just don't put a volunteer out on the border. There are certain levels of law enforcement where you really want professionals involved."

HEADLINE: Negotiators Push to Settle World Treaty On Warming 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
With momentum building for a treaty curbing global warming, delegates from 164 countries, cloistered in a convention center in Morocco, negotiated late into the night yesterday to resolve several lingering disputes. 
 If completed and enacted, the treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, would set the first firm restrictions on the amount of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases released by industrialized countries. 
 "We're in a state of hard negotiations, with everyone delivering a huge effort to find an agreement," said Vincent Georis, a spokesman for Olivier DeLeuze, the head of the European Union delegation, in a telephone interview from Marrakech.
The outlook for the treaty was substantially dimmed in March when President Bush rejected it, reversing the position taken by President Bill Clinton, whose administration negotiated the outlines of the accord in Japan in 1997. The United States, with 5 percent of the world's population, accounts for a fourth of all emissions of the so-called greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide. 
Still, climate experts and government officials said that even without participation from the United States, adoption of the treaty would be a small but significant first step toward limiting the human impact on the atmosphere. 
"If this holds together, it is a piece of architecture in place and it is quite an achievement to get this far," said Dr. Henry D. Jacoby, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Most climate scientists say that a buildup of greenhouse gases in recent decades has contributed to a worldwide warming trend that could lead to droughts, floods and agricultural disruption, particularly in developing countries.
The treaty aims to introduce the first global trading system for greenhouse gas credits. The system would allow countries that surpassed targets for reducing emissions to sell extra credits to countries that lagged, creating an incentive to make the deepest cuts wherever they could be done at the lowest cost.
But big issues remain, Dr. Jacoby said, especially the challenge of fostering international environmental and economic cooperation without the United States -- the biggest economy and polluter. 
"How will we proceed when we have a fragmented system with us and perhaps others on the outside?" he said. "How does that evolve?"
A series of compromises, particularly between the European Union on the one hand and Russia, Japan, Canada and Australia on the other, cleared the way for a final push last night, according to some environmental experts. 
Remaining issues included how much credit Russia should get toward its emissions goals for the role its vast forests play in absorbing carbon dioxide.
Europe, the bloc most firmly fighting for the treaty, still differed with Japan over whether countries should first be required to accept the treaty as legally binding before they could buy and sell emissions credits.
Another issue involves Saudi Arabia and other oil exporting countries that want compensation for any lost revenue should countries reduce their use of fossil fuels.
Even with this workload, many delegates and observers said last night that they felt confident they would find agreement by today. 
The goal of many negotiators was to settle on language that satisfied enough countries to enact the treaty next year, the 10th anniversary of the Rio Earth Summit, where the first climate treaty was forged. To gain legal force, it must be ratified by at least 55 countries, including a group responsible for at least 55 percent of the heat-trapping emissions from industrialized countries in 1990. 
If that happens, the treaty will require by 2012 that participating industrialized countries cut emissions of carbon dioxide and similar warming gases about 5 percent below their levels in 1990.
With the United States on the sidelines, the support of Japan and Russia is crucial for ratification.
The Kyoto Protocol was framed as a successor to a 1992 climate treaty -- signed by Mr. Bush's father and approved unanimously by the Senate -- that set voluntary goals for greenhouse-gas reductions by industrial powers, but failed to come close to its target.
The Clinton administration sought to complete the treaty last year, but talks at the Hague last November fell apart. The issue then fell to Mr. Bush, who had long questioned the science pointing to human-caused global warming and was heavily lobbied by energy companies to reject it outright. 
When he did reject it, he said the pact could harm the economy and was unfair because the required emissions cuts applied only to industrial powers and not to fast-growing developing countries.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: DIPLOMACY; 
PAKISTANI LEADER SEEKS 'GESTURES' FOR BACKING U.S.

BYLINE:  By SERGE SCHMEMANN and PATRICK E. TYLER 

 BODY:
President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan said yesterday that he has come to the United States in search of major gestures from the Bush administration, including the release of American F-16 fighters sold to Pakistan when it was an ally against the Soviet Union and then withheld because of the country's development of nuclear weapons.
 In an interview with The New York Times, General Musharraf, who is in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, said he would be asking President Bush at their meeting on Saturday for concrete "gestures" in response to Pakistan's strong support in the campaign against terrorism. 
 The general said he could not predict how long the bombing campaign could continue before the opposition within Pakistan became a threat to his government. He said he felt the intensity of demonstrations was actually diminishing. 
But he said "visible gestures" of gratitude from the United States would help blunt public criticism of his decision to ally his country strongly with Washington. He placed special emphasis on the F-16's, because their arrival would be the most visible sign that the United States was restoring Pakistan to the stature of a genuine ally. 
Pakistan purchased 28 F-16's in the 1980's, but their delivery was blocked when Congress cut off all aid and military sales in 1990, citing Pakistan's secret nuclear-weapons development.
General Musharraf noted that the planes were paid for, and Pakistan was even sent a bill for their storages in Arizona. 
General Musharraf took power in a coup two years ago and had until Sept. 11 been kept at an icy distance by Washington as both the Clinton and Bush administrations tilted toward a strategic relationship with Pakistan's neighbor and longtime rival, India
The general was not reticent in voicing his grievance with this treatment. "Pakistan certainly desires a longstanding and sustainable relationship with the United States," he said, adding that "trust has to be built." 
Asked whose fault it was, he said, "as a Pakistani, I have to say the fault lies with the United States."
General Musharraf said there was a widespread sense that Washington abandoned Pakistan as soon as the Soviet Union pulled out of Afghanistan in 1989, and then applied economic sanctions when Pakistan developed nuclear weapons in response to India's nuclear program and both countries tested them in May 1998.
"The main issue is we were part of a coalition," he said. "We fought a war together and evicted the Soviet Union from Afghanistan."
The country's previous experience with the United States as an ally in the cold war, he said, had left the public "not very happy" and needing to "wash off their previous attitudes."
Asked whether he felt slighted by Washington and by the Indian prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, he hesitated and said, "Well, sometimes, yes." He said this was understandable because he was a military man who had seized power.
The gestures that would reverse these wrongs, he said, should include major debt relief, military assistance, and more understanding for the sensitivity of the Pakistani public on the issue of its nuclear weapons.
"The opinion of the people of Pakistan has to be molded, and it can be done through gestures," he said.
The general spoke as reports came that Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan had fallen to the Northern Alliance. He commended the victory and said he had no reservations if the American-led coalition decided to set up a forward air base at the airfield near the town.
But he added that he was worried that the military victory had come when there still no broad-based coalition in the making to replace the Taliban if their grip on power dissolves. That problem would become more acute, he suggested, if and when the Northern Alliance began moving into Pashtun territory, where the Taliban has its strength, and especially into the capital, Kabul. Mazar-i-Sharif's population is predominantly Uzbek.
"I'm worried that Kabul should not be militarized because of the atrocities committed in the city," he said, alluding to the last time the Northern Alliance was in control of the city in 1996.
General Musharraf acknowledged that Pakistan bore a major responsibility in the efforts to forge a military alternative to the Taliban, but that this was still a work in progress. He said Afghans had been meeting in Islamabad and Peshawar to try to try to find some formula for a broad-based ethnic administration.
"There's no alternative on the Pashtun side," he said, referring to the dominant ethnic group in Afghanistan. "The ideal situation," he said, would be the creation of a Pashtun-dominated southern alliance that could displace the Taliban and counterbalance the Northern Alliance.
The search for such a coalition has been a major preoccupation of the United States and its allies, and of the special United Nations representative for Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, who returned yesterday from a fact-finding tour of the region.
Mr. Brahimi will be meeting with American and other leaders at the United Nations over the next week, and is expected to get a strong endorsement of his efforts from the Security Council.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is expected to meet on Monday morning with Mr. Brahimi and representatives of the states on Afghanistan's borders.
The formation of a post-Taliban administration has become a central goal of the Bush administration and the United Nations as the bombing campaign increasingly clears the way for a push on Kabul.
In an unusual and forthright appeal, General Musharraf said Pakistan is more than willing to accept assistance from the United States to render Pakistan's nuclear arsenal more secure. But he added that reports emanating from the United States that the Pentagon may have plans to "pinch" or "neutralize" Pakistan's nuclear weapons to prevent them from falling into the hands of Islamic extremists "has a very negative impact on the public mind."
He reaffirmed that Pakistan's nuclear weapons are under "very strong custodial control."
The Bush administration has been debating how it could offer such assistance without passing on information that might improve the design or reliability of Pakistan's small arsenal.
A number of specialists favor offering "personnel reliability" programs to Pakistan nuclear commanders along with high technology security systems to physically guard the weapons and the highly enriched uranium that forms their cores.

HEADLINE: Trade Talks Hinge on Finesse of U.S. 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: DOHA, Qatar, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
With one of his first decisions as President Bush's chief trade negotiator, Robert B. Zoellick last spring quickly set himself apart from colleagues in the Bush cabinet who were eagerly overturning Clinton administration policies on everything from arsenic levels in drinking water to mining on public lands.
 When American pharmaceutical companies pressured Mr. Zoellick to do something about African nations' practice of buying generic knockoffs of popular AIDS drugs, he stood firm. Bush administration officials, he told them, had no intention of pursuing a trade policy that was "out of touch with our values." 
 Mr. Zoellick was convinced that such a policy change could lead to trouble, and it turns out he was right. A dispute over patent enforcement, dividing the richer North and the poorer South, is dominating world trade talks this weekend. Mr. Zoellick's diplomatic efforts at the sessions, held in this Persian Gulf emirate, are viewed by many as vital to preventing the issue from halting the negotiations completely.
The 48-year-old trade representative is trying simultaneously to assert firm American leadership -- President Bush said a successful conclusion here would foster more openness and strike a blow against terrorism -- while pursuing narrower American interests.
A key American goal is to persuade nations to agree to talk about freeing up cross-border sales of farm goods and services, including everything from mutual funds to environmental engineering. At the same time, Mr. Zoellick will be trying to repel a campaign by poor countries to pry open the American textile market and a Japan-led effort to review the use of antidumping rules to fend off low-priced imports.
"We are expected to be the leader, and the leader sometimes has to be tough," Mr. Zoellick (pronounced ZELL-ik) said in an interview. "But you are almost always more effective if you use your strength with discretion and grace."
It is too soon to tell if Mr. Zoellick will prevail here; the talks are scheduled to run through Tuesday and the outcome remains uncertain. But if the talks fail, few will blame Mr. Zoellick for lacking zeal -- or for not doing his homework.
To prepare for the meetings here, Mr. Zoellick dissected what went wrong in Seattle two years ago, when trade talks collapsed. He recently took home a RAND Corporation study of how negotiating styles vary across cultures. The secret, he suggests, is knowing when to cajole and when to harangue. One American trade official calls the strategy "an iron fist in a velvet glove."
Mr. Zoellick also worked to build a strong alliance with the European trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, while mending strained relations with leaders of the developing world, including Malaysia, Indonesia, India and several African countries. He has courted the trade minister of Kenya in Swahili; he has badgered Japan to play a more cooperative role with the unusually blunt demand that the country practice "respectful followership."
The intensity that Mr. Zoellick has brought to these tasks is reminiscent of his work in helping to broker German reunification and the North American Free Trade Agreement a decade ago as a member of the first Bush administration. Though he is known for having a temper, Mr. Zoellick has begun to develop the political ear he needs to complement the skills he honed as a behind-the-scenes tactician for former Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
That political touch has perhaps served him well in dealing with the drug patents issue, his toughest test so far. India and Brazil have led the charge to insert a public health exemption in patent rules, a concept that appeals to African leaders who struggle to pay for Western drugs.
The United States and other industrialized countries fear that the exemption could undermine the whole patent system, but their case was perceived as having been harmed when American and Canadian officials last month pressured Bayer to reduce the price of the suddenly popular anti-anthrax drug Cipro.
Having already staked out an accommodating stance on African nations buying cheaper AIDS drugs, Mr. Zoellick worked quickly to defuse the issue. He offered to make the least developed African countries exempt from patent rules as they apply to pandemic diseases until they become much wealthier. He has also spent hours consulting African ministers on all issues under discussion in Doha, talking to people, as one trade official put it, "who hadn't heard from an American cabinet secretary in a decade."
The idea was to drive a wedge between them and India and Brazil, two countries that American trade officials say have a commercial, rather than moral, reason for wanting to weaken protections for patents. They have big generic drug industries that would like to be able to sell more goods abroad.
The overall message: this is not a unified South against an unrelenting North.
"This idea of the South does not show the vast diversity of the developing world," Mr. Zoellick said. "When you listen, be respectful, put yourself in their shoes, you can solve a lot of problems."
While trying to divide the membership of the South, he is also working to unify the North. The two biggest trading powers, the United States and Europe, did not cooperate much leading up to the Seattle talks. Now, Mr. Zoellick and Mr. Lamy, his European counterpart, act like best friends.
The two have spent a weekend discussing trade at Mr. Zoellick's home on the Potomac River near Washington. Leading up to the Doha meeting, they spoke on the telephone nearly every day, sometimes for up to three hours. Both runners, they swap tips on marathon training.
The Atlantic powers are still on opposite sides on agricultural trade, with Europe fighting to maintain an elaborate support network for farmers. And the United States has remained agnostic on Europe's push to get the World Trade Organization to consider imposing standards on investment and competition.
Yet in contrast to the ideological grandstanding in Seattle, the United States and Europe appear to have settled most of their differences privately. It is no magic formula, but Mr. Zoellick is betting that a subtle change in the "tone of trade" can provide the lift needed to get global negotiations off the ground.

HEADLINE: Benefits Panel Plans Array Of Choices For Solvency 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
The co-chairmen of President Bush's Social Security commission said today that they intended to set out a number of alternative plans for achieving the administration's goal of creating personal investment accounts within the retirement system rather than present a single proposal.
 The co-chairmen, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the former Democratic senator from New York, and Richard D. Parsons, co-chief operating officer of AOL Time Warner, said that offering multiple ideas would allow the administration and the public a chance to study the pros and cons of different approaches. 
 The commission is scheduled to complete its work next month.
Critics of the administration's push to create private accounts said the decision on multiple approaches appeared to reflect wariness on the part of the White House about embracing the details of any particular proposal less than a year from the midterm Congressional elections. Nearly all plans to shore up Social Security include benefit cuts and other politically unpopular steps that could put Mr. Bush and his fellow Republicans on the defensive. 
Until the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, Mr. Bush had planned to make overhauling Social Security a top priority. He had suggested that he wanted the commission to come up with a detailed plan that he could use to sell Congress and voters on the merits of allowing workers to invest part of their Social Security payroll taxes in stocks and bonds.
But with the country at war, the economy deteriorating and Washington working at bipartisanship, members of the commission acknowledged that Mr. Bush was unlikely to wage an aggressive campaign in the coming year to win legislative approval for private accounts. 
Social Security will come under increasing financial pressure in coming decades as the baby boom generation retires and life expectancies continue to rise. Without any changes, the system will need to start redeeming the government bonds it holds in 2016 and will run short of cash to pay full benefits starting in 2037.
Mr. Moynihan said the decision to propose multiple ways of creating private accounts was not dictated by the White House, and primarily reflected a recognition within the committee that different approaches had different strengths and weaknesses.
"There are perfectly reasonable views that are not quite the same," Mr. Moynihan said. 
Mr. Parsons said the commission would come up with "a set of recommendations, each of which raises different policy issues but any of which enhance the fiscal soundness of the system."
Liberal groups that have been fighting the idea of personal investment accounts said the commission's decision not to put its weight behind a single, detailed proposal reflected a fundamental problem with Social Security privatization: it sounds good in general terms but requires such painful cuts in benefits to make the numbers add up that its proponents are forced to obscure the trade-offs.
Only when the administration embraces a specific plan will people be able to judge what they would be asked to give up in the way of guaranteed old-age benefits in return for the right to invest some of their taxes on Wall Street. The liberal groups say cuts in guaranteed benefits could be as high as 40 percent.
"Issuing a menu of options rather than a specific plan is an attempt to muddy the waters so that the public does not have a clear position to accept or reject," said Hans Riemer of the Institute for America's Future, an advocacy group that opposes personal accounts.
Advocates of personal accounts said their approach would leave retirees better off than under any other option, including doing nothing. 
Commission members did not specify which proposals they would back. But it was clear that they had differences of opinion over how to proceed.
One example is the issue of whether retirees should be free to use the proceeds of their investment accounts as they wish or whether the government should require that some or all of the savings go to buying an annuity that would provide guaranteed payments for life.
One camp within the panel said it would be wrong to tell people that the money was theirs to invest but then require them to do with it what the government dictated. Another camp said that allowing unrestricted use of the money in retirement could leave some at risk of poverty.

HEADLINE: The Return Of New York 

BYLINE:  By Jacob Weisberg; Jacob Weisberg, chief political correspondent for Slate, is a frequent contributor to the magazine.

 BODY:
Dealing with what happened to our city on Sept. 11 has involved a kind of progression, and for many of us, the initial phase included some level of incomprehension. One of the stranger images left in my head from that terrible morning is of a woman standing on my corner in TriBeCa, laughing into her cellphone. Survivors, many of them coated head to foot with ash, were processing mutely up Church Street. My wife and I had run outside to determine whether we should evacuate the children from our apartment. And this nicely dressed woman was chatting with a friend as if New York were the same city it had been an hour earlier. Perhaps this was simply some kind of hysterical reaction. But I think that on that day, and for days afterward, all of us faced in varying degrees the difficulty of wrapping our minds around the magnitude of the murderous destruction visited on the place we live. 
 For New York as a whole, disbelief and denial soon gave way to comprehension and grief. The uncountable dead were enumerated. Their killers acquired an identity. And in our public and personal ways, we mourned our losses. Some of us went to funerals and memorial services. Others joined impromptu wakes at firehouses around the city. Some just watched CNN and wept. 
 The mourning continues, punctuated by recurrent bouts of anxiety and fear. Even now, no one can say whether we are past the purely destructive phase of this calamity. But at the same time, another feeling has emerged: the need to turn from our losses to something positive, productive, redemptive. Rebuilding New York the way it was on Sept. 10 and continuing as before would not be an appealing option, even if such a thing were possible. This is a different city now. But we can, as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has suggested, make New York into an even better city than it was. To do that, I think, we have to think about the work of "reconstruction" in slightly less literal terms. We must do something that New Yorkers were once famous for the world over but have in recent decades grown unused to: we have to think big about problems, solutions and possibilities. 
While the twin towers stood, many thought of New York as a place that could no longer be changed in large or dramatic ways. The character of the city and its citizens seemed fixed. In physical terms, we were halfway to Hong Kong: there was hardly any buildable land left on the island of Manhattan. The cost of constructing anything was high and the availability of public funds severely constrained. In political terms, the entrenchment of interests and the diffusion of power made significant changes in public policy difficult even to contemplate. But on Sept. 11, all of our old assumptions were suspended. The impossible became possible and the unthinkable thinkable, in the hopeful sense as well as the tragic.
Rebuilding New York, the topic of this special issue of the magazine, remains first and foremost a physical endeavor. At the center of the bittersweet opportunity we now face is the 16-acre chasm where the World Trade Center used to be, a hole in the heart of the city. But the World Trade Center, while a city unto itself, was also a part of the much larger organism that is New York. It makes no sense to think about the disaster site in isolation, without reference to its neighborhood, municipality, metropolitan region, nation and civilization. In deciding what to put there, we have to think about New York as a whole, about its needs, its feelings and its still great potential. Thus does what begins as a material and political task raise questions that are in the broadest sense social, cultural, even spiritual. 
There is ample precedent: the connection between catastrophe and progress is essential to the city's history. Many, if not most, of New York's great achievements and institutions, the infrastructural, political and social advances that made its continued growth possible, were responses to disaster or urgent need. When westward expansion threatened New York's status as the nation's leading commercial port at the beginning of the 19th century, the city's merchants supported Gov. DeWitt Clinton's visionary plan to build the Erie Canal. It was the cholera epidemic of 1832 that led to the creation of the Croton system, an extraordinary feat of sanitary engineering that gave the city a limitless supply of fresh water. In looking at such episodes, a pattern emerges: New York responded to challenge in ways that went beyond addressing the crisis at hand and prepared the city for the future.
Perhaps the most direct precedent for our current predicament is what happened after the Great Fire of 1835. Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace tell the story in "Gotham," their magisterial history of the city before the 20th century. Although the fire killed only a few people, it largely destroyed New York's financial district, wrecking 674 buildings, putting thousands out of work and bankrupting 23 of the city's 26 fire-insurance companies. But after just four days, the New York Stock and Exchange Board managed to reopen. The city appealed for federal aid and got only a shadow of what it wanted. Nonetheless, within a year it had built a new financial district with wider, drier streets, lighted by gas lamps and lined with handsome fire-resistant Greek Revival buildings. This reconstruction kicked off a metropolitanwide economic boom. In short order, rubble-strewn lots in the fire zone were worth more than built-up land had been. 
After the fire, New York retained the habit of solving problems with public works of grandeur and foresight. The most famous examples of this are its physical graces still: the 843-acre public works project known as Central Park, the Brooklyn Bridge and the construction, in just four years, of the world's finest subway system. But its less tangible accomplishments were no less crucial. The commissioners' grid plan of 1811, the consolidation of the five boroughs in 1897 and compulsory education for a vast immigrant population, which became law in 1901, were all forward-looking responses to necessity that enabled the city to keep growing. 
To some extent, New York City's eventual loss of faith in the radiant future was the result of catastrophic overreaching by one man. Recognizing the need for open space, Robert Moses in the 1920's built a grand network of parks and recreation facilities. With prescient understanding of the significance of the automobile, he began constructing the bridges and tunnels that connected Manhattan to the world beyond, and vice versa, as well as the nation's first system of expressways. But by the 1950's, Moses' vision had turned from farsighted to backward-looking. After the great builder displaced thousands of residents to build the Cross Bronx Expressway, an attempt to redevelop a 14-block chunk of West Village "slum" (west of Hudson Street from Morton to West 11th) collided into Jane Jacobs and the community-based movement she spawned. In her famous 1961 book, "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," Jacobs contended that what appeared to the apostles of urban renewal as blight were actually the things that made communities livable and appealing. The real assets of neighborhoods, Jacobs argued, were diversity of use, human scale and an active, pedestrian street life.
Though tragedy has conferred posthumous nobility on it, the World Trade Center was a prime example of what Jacobs and her disciples rightly objected to in New York's taste for greatness. A venture by the Port of New York Authority, a politically insulated government body that had no business speculating in real estate, the project displaced a whole functioning business district in favor of ugly towers of fearsome size. Nor was the project successful financially. It meant tens of millions in lost tax revenues for the city and took decades to fill with private-sector tenants.
You can actually date the end of New York's romance with bigness to the completion of the trade towers in 1972. In his book "Divided We Stand," Eric Darton argues that the project simply could not have been built a few years later because of the shift in public attitudes. Local interests became far more devoted to protecting what they had than in dividing up new spoils. The new tools of regulation and legal activism let community groups tie projects up and kill them through attrition. As a result, no Robert Moses or Nelson Rockefeller would again have the kind of clout needed to push such a massive redevelopment scheme through. And then came the final blow to grand planning: the fiscal crisis of 1975. The bankrupt city of the 1970's lacked not only the will but also the wallet to do great things. 
Jane Jacobs was largely right, just as Moses had been in his prime. Her ideas were responsible not only for preventing some terrible things, like the leveling of SoHo, but also for the bottom-up revival of what are now among the city's most appealing neighborhoods: the Village, the Upper West Side, as well as various sections of Brooklyn and the Bronx. But Jacobs's philosophy also produced its own excesses, and these were excesses of smallness. After the World Trade Center was finished, hopes for doing anything big to improve New York City became pie-in-the-sky dreaming. Fiscal pressure and community-board power prevented any meaningful response to emerging systemic problems: the lack of affordable housing, the crying need for Manhattan office space, the absence of crucial transportation links, the deteriorating condition of our schools, the worsening of noise, traffic and congestion and so on. 
Any major change in the city's hardscape, like the redevelopment of Columbus Circle, was now a 20-year project -- and that was if you got lucky. Eternal time frames eliminated most of the incentive for credit-seeking politicians to push projects forward; they knew someone else would be cutting the ribbon. Neighborhoods from the East Village to Fort Greene to the South Bronx could, and did, revive in the 1980's and 90's. But the city could not build, plan or invest its formidable resources in ways that addressed its needs and aspirations as a whole. 
High on many people's list of things that should have happened in those years but did not is Westway, the plan to submerge two miles of the West Side Highway and build a glorious downtown park and beach. After a 15-year struggle, environmentalists killed the plan in 1985, on the basis that the Army Corps of Engineers had not sufficiently proved the project harmless to striped bass -- a far-from-endangered species that spawns in the Hudson. Unlike the enormities of Robert Moses' baroque phase, Westway would have displaced no apartment dwellers, businesses or charming old rows. It was a federally financed gift that the city rejected because of an attitude that nothing big done by government can be any good. 
In the last few decades, New York's important public projects have fallen into two categories: largely invisible infrastructural upgrades or high-profile restorations of beloved spaces like Bryant Park, Grand Central Terminal, Times Square and Union Square. In other words, they improved what was already here. The chief political achievement of the last decade has been making the city reasonably safe and clean. I don't mean to slight these accomplishments, which have made New York a lovable, visitor-friendly place once again. But preservationism alone does justice neither to the city's potential nor to its very great problems. 
It is understandable, of course, that economically vulnerable cities cling tenaciously to what assets they still have. That is how our politicians fell into the dubious habit of doling out tax incentives to keep employers from moving out. Since Sept. 11, New York's elected leaders have essentially proposed redoubling this costly rearguard action. They are seeking billions in federal aid to replace lost office space and bribe companies and residents to stay put downtown.
What might make more sense is focusing on making New York as a whole a more inherently supportive place for businesses and residents. Thanks to electronic communication, financial industries no longer need to be situated one on top of another. They have been diversifying away from downtown for decades, a trend now accelerated by security concerns and a poor economy. As a result, most of the office space lost on Sept. 11 is no longer needed. Nor is that necessarily bad news: while remaining the financial capital of the world is central to the city's economic health and global status, it doesn't matter whether financial jobs are on Wall Street, Park Avenue or Queens Boulevard. We can use the World Trade Center site for something creative instead -- a memorial, certainly, and perhaps a mixed-use neighborhood on the fantastically pleasant model of Battery Park City. 
New York remains a magnet for the region, the country and the world, even in dark times. The way the city reacted to catastrophe only intensified many people's pride in this place and our determination to be a part of it. That civic patriotism should also intensify our desire to make the city the best that it can be -- to address long-ignored livability issues, augment its functionality and enhance its cultural appeal. Those things, more than any tax incentives, will ensure that companies stay in town and that people continue to think of New York as a wonderful place to live and work despite the intrinsic difficulties. 
In the broadest sense, I think our goal ought to be restoring a sense of opportunity for the poor. Half a century ago, working people could expect that their children would find a better life here. That prospect depends more on education than on anything else; if a neighborhood's schools can be successful, everything else will follow.
At the level of functionality, transportation, so crucial to a densely populated metropolis, also needs a boost. Unlike education, transportation has not got drastically worse in New York over the past half century. But it has conspicuously failed to get better. It has failed to integrate in obvious ways: we still lack viable public transportation to the city's airports, and links between the major commuter lines (the Long Island Rail Road, the PATH trains and Metro-North). Increasing the ease of public transportation would relieve overcrowding on existing routes, diminish above-ground traffic and enhance the city's competitive position within the metropolitan region. 
And then there are all the amenities that make New York a global cultural attraction. This is the time to move some of the truly imaginative ideas currently on the boards -- Frank Gehry's design for a bigger-than-Bilbao Guggenheim Museum near South Street, say, or the plan to restore a semblance of the old Penn Station in the Central Post Office or a new West Side stadium for the Yankees -- onto the streets. We should aggressively campaign for the 2012 Olympics. The best of these plans have the potential to add to the city's functionality and its luster, its appeal to residents and to visitors at the same time.
And we can think bigger still. The largest continuing abdication, it seems to me, has been failing to reimagine New York City's 578 miles of waterfront -- a mostly wasted coastline with a few underwhelming improvements. When the city was built, people aspired to live as far from its industrialized shore as possible; hence the social status of Fifth Avenue. In the postindustrial city, our port facilities, the original source of the city's greatness, remain mostly derelict and inaccessible. They offer unlimited potential in terms of new housing, recreation and commercial uses. 
Each project and idea necessarily raises controversies. Each faces technical, bureaucratic and economic hurdles. Trade-offs and choices are unavoidable. But in some cases, the tragedy of Sept. 11 lowers barriers. Consider something relatively simple, the long-suffering notion of a link from the Long Island Railroad to Lower Manhattan, which would invigorate downtown, ease countless commutes and relieve congestion in midtown. A continuation of the railroad tunnel from the Atlantic Avenue stop in Brooklyn to the financial district could probably be built for less than $2 billion, a thinkable sum even without the promise of major new federal aid. It is what the Port Authority should have built instead of the World Trade Center three decades ago. Unfortunately, engineers have not been able to find a practicable way for the trains to turn around at the end of the line; there was simply no space left below Wall Street. That problem has now been horribly solved.
But even for projects that lack a direct physical relationship to Lower Manhattan, new possibilities are appearing. Everyone agrees that we must prevent whatever plan we settle on for the World Trade Center site from taking 20 years to finish. To avoid this familiar fate, officials and agencies at various levels of government are going to have to clear a path through the regulatory and legal thickets that hamper large-scale projects. In fact, we have already glimpsed what becomes possible when government agencies work together in a spirit of urgent, creative improvisation. Within days of the attack, city, state and federal bodies that were in many cases crippled themselves set up a one-stop shopping center for victims' families and affected businesses on a West Side pier. Now what would happen if we applied that same attitude and willingness to flex rules to, say, getting the city's average classroom size down to 22 students or doing something delightful with Governors Island?
Just as important as this new government attitude is the public spirit of Sept. 11. On that day, we New Yorkers lived through a horror beyond our previous imagining. But we also discovered assets in our city that we had never fully recognized: depths of courage, sacrifice, generosity, kindness, compassion, defiance, determination and resilience. Those qualities instantaneously created a new civic personality for New York, a stereotype at last worth living up to. In a strange way, it made us once again the envy of the world. That collective spirit now exists as a civic resource. We can call on it not just to recreate what we had but also to build the New York of tomorrow. And building, I think we will find, is good for us -- emotionally as a way of channeling grief, socially as a way of binding our community together and spiritually as a response to our encounter with profound evil. In this sense, bettering New York City is a means by which New Yorkers can restore themselves as well.
None of this is to deny that New York faces daunting obstacles to its revival. Over the near term, we face painful cuts in the city and state budgets. Our newly elected mayor lacks the political capital to bulldoze impediments. He also lacks longstanding relationships with the governor, New York's Congressional delegation, the White House and business leaders, without whom full recovery will not be possible. At the same time, he faces an unprecedented task in terms of reassuring an anxious city and capitalizing on the good will of the rest of the country. There are only two precursors I can think of for this task: Fiorello La Guardia in the 1930's and Rudolph Giuliani in September 2001. 
But regardless of how powerfully the new mayor is able to lead, constraints are surmountable in a city ready to think again in terms of its great possibilities. And whether the grandest aspirations can ever be realized, the very ability to entertain such ideas points to the next stage in the collective process of dealing with what happened on Sept. 11. For the wounded, hope for the future may be the truest sign of healing.

HEADLINE: Forecast: An Uncertain Climate 

BYLINE:  By JOE CUTTS; JOE CUTTS is a senior editor at Ski magazine.

 BODY:
IN recent years, the Gruskin family of Ossining, N.Y., has headed west each December. This year, they had Utah in mind. But while Stuart Gruskin is still ready to go, his wife, Adrienne, has been considering a car trip to Vermont, or perhaps not traveling at all.
 Mrs. Gruskin admits she is reluctant to fly, and not only out of fear. "I also wonder if, with all the new security and longer waits at airports, maybe it's more hassle than it's worth, especially during Christmas season," she said. "So maybe we'll go during February vacation instead, when we have a better sense of what the political climate is." 
 Travelers like Mrs. Gruskin may make their absence felt this winter, especially at ski resorts that depend on visitors who fly. In addition to safety concerns, there's the recent softness of the economy, which could also hurt business. Yet over all, resorts say they haven't seen vast numbers of cancellations. 
So far, it seems, while there is some nervousness, resorts aren't panicking, and hardy skiers and snowboarders hoping for fire-sale pricing at high-end destinations might be disappointed -- airlines and resorts are generally holding the line. Those with the most to lose, it would seem, are the so-called destination resorts, which rely heavily on fly-in visitors and which don't have significant numbers of customers who arrive by car. 
At Sun Valley, Idaho, for instance, "We're down 10 to 15 percent this year in destination bookings," said Jack Sibbach, marketing director. Jackson Hole, Wyo., -- equally isolated -- is off 8 to 10 percent, said Kari Cooper, vice president for marketing. But it's early, both added; individual reservations could still recover, barring any more catastrophes. What has hurt Sun Valley more, Mr. Sibbach said, was the loss of about 10 big-spending corporate groups.
At Telluride, Colo., however, preseason bookings are actually quite healthy this year, despite that resort's dependence on fly-in visitors. "We're up double over last year," said Matt McClain, director of sales. He attributed the rise to better publicity, interest in the recent expansion of Telluride's ski slopes (from about 1,000 acres to more than 1,700) and the fact that the resort is now easier to get to, with direct flights from Newark, Chicago and key Texas markets.
Mr. McClain also pointed to recent industry statistics on sales of ski and snowboard equipment and clothing showing an increase of 6.1 percent over last year, according to Snowsports Industries America. Skiers appear ready to ski, as is typical after an abundantly snowy season like last winter in the populous East.
But for the most part, calls to reservations centers virtually ceased in the days following the attacks, and are just beginning to pick up again.
"We saw our phones simply stop ringing," said Kip Pitou, president of Ski Utah, a marketing arm of Utah resorts. "Interestingly, though, the Web activity was about the same." He and others in the business, who noticed the same phenomenon, attributed that to Web surfers seeking bargains.
Sept. 11 was relatively early in the ski resorts' booking cycle, "because the trend of the past few years has been for consumers to make later and later reservations via the Internet," said Pat O'Donnell, president of Aspen. 
Around mid-October, he said, "we started to see a spike in calls from people looking for deals."
And in some cases, said Bill Tomcich, president of Aspen's central reservations agency, Stay Aspen Snowmass, prices are falling, as inventory remains. "I wouldn't call them fire sales, certainly not during Christmas, but some properties are getting nervous," he said. Premium holiday rates have been lowered to normal high-season rates and in a few cases even low-season rates, Mr. Tomcich said.
But it may be a matter of time before considerable discounts materialize at Western resorts, according to one tour operator. "There will be tremendous deals this winter," said Lance Cygielman, president of Ski Vacation Planners, in Jackson, Wyo., where bookings are down 35 to 45 percent from the same time last year. "But we're not seeing them yet." That may change in early December, Mr. Cygielman said.
Eastern resorts have reason to think they might fare better than those in the Rockies. Skiers wary of flying will instead get into their cars and stay closer to home, the thinking goes, choosing high-amenity resorts such as Stowe, Vt.; Bretton Woods, N.H.; or Whiteface near Lake Placid, N.Y.
Preseason bookings at Stowe are normal, said Hank Lunde, president of Stowe Mountain Resort, though he added "it still might be too early to get a good read."
Besides proximity to huge drive-in markets and inexpensive air fares from East Coast cities to Burlington, Vt., on JetBlue, Eastern resorts have another factor in their favor: snow. Last season was phenomenally snowy, with Jay Peak, Vt., reporting 571 inches. There's reason to believe that this winter will be abundantly white, too, said Jim Roemer, a meteorologist and avid skier whose company, Weatherrisk, provides long-range forecasts for resorts and commodities companies. 
"I looked back at all the years in which we had more than 300 inches -- going back to 1955 -- and 70 percent of the time the following winter we had at least 250 to 300 inches," Mr. Roemer said.
The West, meanwhile, would like more snow than it got last winter, especially in Utah, which will be the focus of the world when the Olympic Games begin Feb. 8. If sales of Olympic tickets (available online at www.saltlake2002.com) are an indication, travelers are not going to let fear keep them away. 
"We continue to have very robust ticket sales," said Mitt Romney, president and chief operating officer of the Salt Lake Games, where security spending was increased by almost $25 million to a total of $300 million in the wake of the attacks. "All indications are that sport continues to be a part of people's lives."
Concerned that the Winter Games would discourage ordinary travelers, as they and other big events have been known to do, Utah resorts are offering $20.02 off on each day's lift tickets to anyone staying three nights or more at participating lodging establishments (about 130 inns and hotels statewide, Mr. Pitou said).
Meanwhile, Utah has other enticements. "Interconnect" is the new buzzword among the tightly clustered resorts of the Wasatch Mountains. Alta and Snowbird can now be enjoyed on the same, slightly more expensive lift ticket, provided one is a skier (Alta still bans snowboarders). Solitude and Brighton have also hooked up, and the three areas just over the ridge in Park City -- Deer Valley, the Canyons and Park City Mountain Resort -- might not be far behind. (They're already accessible for backcountry skiers.) 
Also this year, Alta has one less comrade among resorts that forbid snowboarding. Aspen dropped the rope in April on its core terrain at Ajax Mountain. Now only Alta and Deer Valley, Utah; Mad River Glen, Vt.; and Taos, N.M., remain off limits to snowboarders.
Another trend -- everywhere in ski country -- is the concept of the dense, lively slopeside village, which has proved popular with skiers tired of being marooned in far-flung condos and lodges. Whistler-Blackcomb, British Columbia, and Tremblant, Quebec -- both owned by Intrawest Corporation -- are held up as the new ideal. Among the resorts that are building slopeside villages or planning to are Squaw Valley, Mammoth Mountain, Northstar-at-Tahoe and Kirkwood, Calif.; Aspen Highlands, Copper Mountain and Snowmass, Colo.; and Stowe and Killington, Vt. 
But no amount of snow or amenities will matter if another calamity occurs. Still, resorts are confident their customers aren't easily deterred. "Our experience is that skiers tend to be resilient," Mr. Pitou said. "It's the nature of skiers, given the sport they choose."

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 11-11-01: Sightlines; 
The View From Out Here

BYLINE:  By Vince Passaro; Vince Passaro is a novelist living in New York City.

 BODY:
We have a tendency to measure the life of New York by the habits and welfare of the upper-middle classes, which is rather like taking all your weather reports from 25,000 feet in the air. The vast majority of New Yorkers make less than $40,000 per year. This is their city too, though that version of New York doesn't have a series yet on HBO.
 Recently, I was talking with one of the doormen on my block, a Polish emigre studying business at CUNY during the day and working overnights in one of the buildings that make up West 110th Street. These are, for the most part, good-but-not-great buildings that have been tarted up over the last decade to look far more luxurious than they are. I asked him where he lived. 
 "Brooklyn," he said. "Park Slope."
"Where in Park Slope?" 
"Fourth Avenue and 23rd Street," he said.
"That's not Park Slope. That's Sunset Park."
"No," he said. "They call it Park Slope now." 
I was amused to hear that Realtors had so fancifully extended the boundaries of that adamantly rehabbed neighborhood. "My mother grew up on Fourth Avenue and 23rd," I said, "in a big building that takes up the whole block." 
"That's my building," he said.
The last time I saw it, more than 10 years ago, the building was rundown and heavily graffitied. In the 30's, the neighborhood was poor Irish and Italian and Polish. By the 50's it was equally poor or poorer Puerto Ricans and then, later, other Latinos. Now they are joined by a new group of immigrants, Poles and Russians and, the young doorman told me, Indians and East Asians. 
Stirred by the coincidence, I went out to Fourth Avenue on a warm October Saturday with a pale blue sky. At the moment, Brooklyn is New York's most fashionable borough -- the place where young people find affordable housing, fill a neighborhood with attitude, bring on good retail and then get driven out by the prices they help to create. 
But Fourth Avenue and 23rd remains pretty much out of Brooklyn's grooviness range. My mother's building, a block long and six stories high, looks enormous in this landscape of sagging three-story houses. Its ornate size testifies to a forgotten and misplaced ambition. The graffiti is gone but the building is still something of a wreck, with many clotheslines strung across the front facade. It has three arched, locked entryways. Inside, some boys were running around shouting in the courtyard; I stared in through the ugly gates. There were apple cores and large hunks of fried chicken on the sidewalk near my feet.
This autumn, the weather has been so lovely and soft, the universe's small mercy in a time of man-made afflictions. I had forgotten about the sky on Fourth Avenue -- a domed, 360-degree kind of sky. Almost every neighborhood in New York where you can see that much sky is poor, as if, when you're poor, New York will show you in the air what it so rarely yields to you on the ground: beauty and freedom.
Around here, all the signs are in English and Spanish, except when they are just in Spanish, or in Chinese, or in Polish. Across from my mother's building there is L&H Auto Services, a Chinese shop where the mechanics lean against doorways in the manner of profound boredom that mechanics everywhere display when they're not working on cars. The Alma Driving School. The Frank J. Dombrowski Memorial Association American Legion Hall. On 24th Street, there is the magnificent-looking Our Lady of Czenstochowa church, its spire the only interruption of the western sky. An elegant rectory and former school (used for karate and jujitsu classes now, "contact Sensei George Cermak") are behind it, taking up most of 25th Street. On Fourth Avenue is the Polska Agencja, where you can go for legal help, notary services, and travel assistance, not to mention Polish videos and greeting cards. 
A few blocks up Fourth Avenue, you can find the al-Joor health center and school in a building that looks like an out-of-place California-style motor lodge. A few more blocks away stands the Seafarers International Union of North America, A.F.L.-C.I.O., which rents space, apparently, to the Pomoc Inc. Human Service Agency. My sense that day was, if you were to find yourself needing to go to the Pomoc Inc. Human Service Agency, that wouldn't be a good thing. 
After that there was a small-scale construction site where, judging by the signage, some sort of chain Laundromat is coming in. Hanging slightly crooked on the fence was an unelaborate and slightly mysterious hand-painted wood sign: "Ask for Sadek." It seemed like an idea. I went up to the gated fence and looked in. There was a large man outside the long, low building. 
"Hey," I said. I was trying to sound friendly. "Is Sadek here?" 
"Sadek's not here," he said.
"Is this going to be a Laundromat or what?"
"You got to ask Sadek." 
Gates are not readily opened in this part of Brooklyn, to let people in or out. There is a dream at work here, certainly, just as there was a dream in my mother's day; people don't come all this way, to this hard, less-than-ideal place, for no reason. My young Polish friend, the doorman, clearly has money in mind, far more so than the Irish of my mother's generation did. Perhaps his own children will one day visit Fourth Avenue and 23rd, pilgrims to an obscure commencement. How will it be then? Well, it'll be Brooklyn. 
I walked that day north along Fourth Avenue, then down the hill into the old warehouse district, across the Gowanus Canal, and into Carroll Gardens and Cobble Hill. Carroll Gardens is an old Italian neighborhood that looks to be perhaps a third Italian, even now. Mixed in are second- and third-generation Latinos and newly arrived Manhattanites. This means the neighborhood is predominantly white, and vastly more prosperous than Fourth Avenue, though not prosperous enough for the rents.
As I walked farther north, the shops started to get fashionable, and suddenly I was back in familiar territory, the land of restaurants, bars, high-end dress shops and cafes with attitude. I saw three or four arty-looking young women who were pregnant, and I thought there was something noticeably grim in their faces. Who knows, it could have been anything -- it is hard enough on its own being pregnant -- but I imagined in those faces an anxiety that many of their generation, and mine, have had to face as we grow older in New York: their apartments are too small and already too expensive, their responsibilities are growing visibly by the day and they are confronting the unfailing economic laws of this city with a frightening new clarity. 
There is still money around in New York, but listen for the sucking sound -- it's draining away. The World Trade Center tragedy made desperate a financial decline that had already become palpable. On the phone booths outside my office building a few weeks after the attack, I saw a flier: "available immediately, gorgeous 3BR in GP, enormous rooms, sharing O.K., $2,800, call Kevin, broker." "GP" means Gramercy Park, a name that gets exaggerated wildly by Realtors, in much the same way that "Park Slope" has now come to extend from Prospect Park, as a friend of mine says, "all the way to Egypt." If it's true, the rent seems awfully low. The common denominator of all the hand-posted signs is "available immediately." We're hearing stories this fall of newly graduated business recruits who arrive for their first hours of work and are sent packing on the same day. My wife asks the guys at the coffee shop she frequents in Rockefeller Center how business is. Not good, they tell her. A man was in this morning, a regular, the owner said, and the man told them that 500 people were being laid off that day in his company. Not only that, but a few days ago, the shop went to deliver a lunch for a group at another company, and when they arrived there was no one to take the lunch. The woman who'd put in the order called the next day to apologize: they'd all been laid off that morning. So we can't complain, the owner said. 
Whole lives are suddenly "available immediately." 
We're coming to the end of something and starting something else, a fact that was plain even before the 11th of September. The near-present already feels like distant history: the Belgian-beer period, the Low Country-vodka period, the period of explicit cash and affectless public sexuality. Many of the new people won't stay here; the place relentlessly weeds out those who can't take it. 
Similarly, the money comes, the money goes, the money comes back again, but the money never makes it out to Fourth Avenue in any case. The whole idea of it lies in its restricted range. Those of us who are rarely touched by its ebb and flow might feel its absence from the tax base in services reduced, in streets less clean, in parks less green, in a grimmer set to people's faces and perhaps in a diminishing graciousness. The streets around Fourth Avenue, though, have been dirty for 40 years, and its graciousness resides in going on, in managing to get along and in not giving in to despair, despair being the route along which the gates are always open. 
Jimmy Breslin once said that nature's finest sight is a crowded street; my own nomination is also purely a human creation: the eastern face of Manhattan as seen from the Triborough Bridge, stretching from Harlem to the Lower East Side. This is a panorama that at its boundaries is poor, while the middle is rich, thus making it a face of New York that belongs to all of us. Some favorite buildings are very painfully missing now, but it is still a monumental facade, a five-mile textured surface of astonishing density and depth. Like the Black Mountains of Arizona, it changes with every shift in the light, every movement of cloud before the sun. At night, it sparkles like an immensity of haphazard jewels, diamonds and jagged heaps of coal. 
After the pain of terrible and sudden death has begun to fade, after all the rubble and steel and glass is hauled away, after the sense of our deep wound has slowly subsided, New York City will still have, we trust, its essential, ever-changing and thus inalterable soul -- its mad ambition and stolid cynicism about the fruits of ambition; its vulgarity and elegance; its muscular sexuality and physical ambiguity; its eight million faces, passing through the daily zones of nervousness, amusement and fatigue. We'll pray that nothing else awful happens, and we'll wait for the next phase in our history to make itself clear. It will take a long time. Perhaps, though, we'll be lucky. Perhaps we'll feel, as tends to happen in New York, as if it really seemed like no time at all.

HEADLINE: Theater; 
London Theater And the Cloud of War

BYLINE:  By BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE; Benedict Nightingale is the chief theater critic of The Times of London.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
IN times of public anxiety in Britain, it has fallen to the royal family to stand up, be counted, show the flag and do the other things expected of national symbols. The obvious case is George VI, who refused to escape the blitz by fleeing to Canada with his wife and daughters. And in the anxious London of late 2001 it seems to have fallen to "The Royal Family" to perform a similar if smaller function.
 Peter Hall's revival of George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber's classic comedy is one of several plays helping to prove that Britain's theaterland won't be terrorized out of business. Not only is the piece bringing an impressive cast, led by Judi Dench, to the Haymarket but also advance ticket sales amounted to $1.2 million before it opened for a 14-week run on Nov. 1. 
 What is the general feel of the West End since Sept. 11? Contradictory. The lobbies at first nights are as jampacked as they always were, the streets outside still teem with gawkers and autograph-hounds, and getting a taxi after a show is just as difficult and just as likely to lead to a vendetta on the sidewalk. Yet restaurants and pubs seem less busy in the early evening, meaning you can actually get a drink without breaking Britain's unwritten law against queue-jumping. I can't say I notice many more police in the West End; but severe gentlemen in black suits now regularly unpack my briefcase for inspection when I enter the theater, which is both comforting and embarrassing. It doesn't contain anything toxic, unless you count the decaying sandwich one heavy extracted and held up to general view; but, with old papers and pens tumbling out, it provides distressing evidence of untidy habits. 
Since London producers differ from their Broadway counterparts by keeping their audience figures secret, the economic picture is not wholly clear either. Outside the Lyceum, I've seen a long line desperate for returns for "The Lion King"; yet the forlorn little phalanx of tourists that has gathered every night for years outside Her Majesty's in hopes of getting standby tickets for "The Phantom of the Opera" seems to have dematerialized. And a phone call to Drury Lane for a reputedly unobtainable seat for Trevor Nunn's revival of "My Fair Lady" revealed that on many evenings seats are perfectly obtainable. 
The Society of London Theater, the producers' organization, concedes that in the last few weeks ticket sales have been between 9 and 15 percent lower than they were in the same period last year. The reason must be that out-of-towners and foreign visitors are staying clear of London, fearful that the capital would be a logical target for anybody seeking reprisals for Britain's participation in the war on terrorism. But present-day Londoners, long accustomed to I.R.A. bombs, have come to share the view of their forebears when they were menaced by Hitler's doodlebugs: if disaster suddenly strikes, so be it.
This means that it's tougher than usual for musicals, especially long-running musicals, and for plays that don't fall into the must-see category. The critics didn't much like Ronald Harwood's worthy but stolid "Mahler's Conversion," and, even though Antony Sher excelled as the composer who self-servingly rejected Judaism, the play closed on Nov. 3 after just a month's run. But most reviewers were delighted by Alan Rickman and Lindsay Duncan in Noel Coward's "Private Lives" at the Albery, and Londoners are packing the theater. The revival of Tennessee Williams's "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" at the Gielgud, which was equally well received, is doing almost as well. The prospects for "The Royal Family" are clearly excellent, too. 
That is largely because Judi Dench has a big following, and, on the evidence of her performance here, deserves it. She plays Fanny Cavendish, the oldest surviving member of an acting dynasty based on the Barrymores, and she uses the occasion to suggest a commitment to the theater as strong and pure as that of the Pilgrim Fathers to their Bibles. Other members of the family have doubts, show off, play skittish games with their lives: she sits in their gorgous Manhattan townhouse determinedly planning a road tour to Tulsa and Oklahoma City that is all too likely to ruin her already failing health. 
Sir Peter's production is brisk and lively, yet the play hasn't the tension one might wish. We never seriously doubt that, despite the lure of love or the distraction of scandal, the Cavendishes will continue to feel about their greasepaint the way some of the O'Neills did about their bottles. Nevertheless, it's amusing to watch Harriet Walter's Julie (the Ethel Barrymore character) wearily throwing life belts to Peter Bowles's Uncle Herbert and Julia McKenzie's Aunt Kitty, who are obsessed with refloating their becalmed careers, or helping Toby Stephens's wild, womanizing Tony flee from his latest breach-of-promise action. "I'm a madwoman in a family of maniacs," wails Ms. Walter. And when Mr. Stephens's glittering John Barrymore clone is narcissistically bounding around in his Cyrano costume, sword in hand, cigarette holder between his teeth, you see what she means. 
For all its mocking moments, "The Royal Family" is a bit too incestuously in love with the mystique of Dame Theater. Yet, at least for me, its fascination is precisely that it celebrates a period, namely 1927, when Broadway was confident and creative and its leading players as famous as any Manhattan model or Hollywood star now. And they weren't famous just because they were glamorous. Listen to Dame Judi's gloriously acerbic Fanny when she talks her rebellious family through the austere excitement of preparing for an evening's performance: "Fifteen minutes, Miss Cavendish! My costume, more rouge. How's the house tonight? Props, cue, enter." It's a defiant artistic credo: moving testimony to the power of the theater and to the hardy professionalism of people like Judi Dench herself. 
The financial success of this production and the probability of a longer than planned run for Howard Davies's elegiac revival of "Private Lives" (in my dissenting view, Mr. Rickman's doleful divorce displays more menopausal gloom than erotic glee at discovering his ex-wife in the slinky form of Ms. Duncan), has led some to conclude that escapist comedy is what London audiences currently crave. But "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," at the Lyric Theater, is a hot enough ticket to contradict that. True, Williams's Deep South saga has its comic moments, especially when the dramatist brings onstage caricatures of inheritance-hunters and their awful children; but neither the impending death of the object of their greed, Big Daddy Pollitt, nor the despair of the old man's favorite son seems particularly hilarious.
Death and despair do, however, seem particularly real: testimony not only to Anthony Page's meticulous production but to the quality of the performers he has persuaded to take a break from their movie careers. Frances O'Connor is Maggie, the precariously placed feline female of the play's title. Brendan Fraser is her husband, Brick, a boy-man for whom bourbon is the main escape both from his own repressed homosexuality and from Maggie's nagging attempts to stop his ostentatiously sober brother from inheriting the family plantation. And Ned Beatty is Big Daddy, the patriarch who is brutally informed by Brick that the pain in his guts comes from cancer, not a spastic colon. 
Ms. O'Connor doesn't flaunt her sensuality, as Elizabeth Taylor did in the film of the play, but you don't doubt the intensity of a frustration that is sexual as well as practical. Neither her charm, which is great, nor her intelligence, which is greater, can bounce her neglectful husband out of the emotional magnolias. You can see why she and her father-in-law like each other. They are two survivors who have known poverty and have got where they are now through the mental toughness so maddeningly missing in Brick. Indeed, what is refreshing about Mr. Beatty's performance is that he isn't content to show us the mythic cotton-king, the Mississipi minotaur or Delta titan. His Big Daddy is the one-time overseer who wangled his way to riches and power: a shrewd, practical, even sensitive man who may bully his wife and talk coarsely yet strains to understand his son and woo him from his bottle.
As a result, the climactic encounter between Mr. Beatty and Mr. Fraser's Brick, a defeated hulk adrift in a sea of booze, is as compelling as anything now in the London theater. The father's dogged prodding penetrates the son's imperturbability, some inner fuse ignites, the wreck turns wrecker, and all the suppressed anger and self-hatred explodes in a display of frantic vindictiveness. Williams once said that of all his plays "Cat" was his favorite and that of all his scenes this was the one in which he had most "reached beyond myself." After seeing Mr. Beatty and Mr. Fraser's intimate stag-battle, I believe him. 
America is richly represented in the West End this fall. Another Deep South play, Lillian Hellman's melodramatic "Little Foxes," is getting a decent showing at the Donmar. Michael Blakemore, whose revival of "Kiss Me, Kate" was a success on Broadway, has restaged the same musical at the Victoria Palace with Marin Mazzie and Michael Beresse as holdovers and a swaggering Brent Barrett joining them as Cole Porter's version of Petruchio. And Rodgers and Hammerstein's "South Pacific" begins previews at the National on Dec. 3, soon after the all-black cast that has brought August Wilson's fine "Jitney" to the same theater has put its props back in their hampers and returned to New York. 
But there is British work worth attention, too, notably a play at the National, expected to transfer to the West End soon. If I describe Charlotte Jones's "Humble Boy" as "Hamlet" as it might have been rewritten by Alan Ayckbourn and Tom Stoppard, it makes it sound less fresh than it is. But there is plenty to encourage the comparison, beginning with Simon Russell Beale, who recently played Shakespeare's prince to great acclaim at the same address, as well as at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York, and is now reborn as the Hamlet of Moreton-in-the-Mud: an overage research student who has returned from Cambridge to the country to cause embarrassment at and after his father's funeral. 
Mr. Russell Beale's Felix Humble dresses badly, behaves madly, combines a sharp wit with suicidal thoughts, and loathes his mother's lover, a cheerfully coarse businessman played by Denis Quilley. But when his mother tells him, "You're determined to turn this into a tragedy and you can't," we believe her, largely because she is played by Diana Rigg as the sort of exquisite ogre nobody can resist. So the result is a gently debunking variation on "Hamlet." The dead father, a dedicated beekeeper, was stung to death by his own swarm and reappears as a kindly, healing ghost. A surprisingly sturdy Ophelia-figure materializes, complete with the child Felix unknowingly sired ages ago. There is even a happy ending -- though the idea of Dame Diana's cool, ruthless Gertrude self-sacrificially rejecting her small-time Claudius smacks of a sentimentality Ms. Jones has hitherto avoided. 
Felicity Kendal will replace Dame Diana when John Caird's production transfers, but all else should remain intact, including the young author's humor and intelligence. Many critics think Ms. Jones should have won a most-promising-dramatist award with her "In Flame," her play about three generations of women, which was performed in the West End last year. And most agree that she'll soon be getting most-accomplished-dramatist awards if she can curb a tendency to ladle her work with self-conscious significance. In "Humble Boy," bees are a metaphor for everything from emotional orderliness to mental turbulence, and Felix's hopes of reconciling Einsteinian physics with quantum theory resonates rather too obviously in a village where issues big and little constantly collide. But Ms. Jones can write super scenes and roles, not least for the brilliant Mr. Russell Beale, at once as ungainly as a bumblebee and, intellectually, as agile as a wasp. 
ALSO doing well at the National is the latest, raunchiest and, for those of tender or homophobic disposition, most defiantly offensive play by Mark Ravenhill, best known for a piece whose unprintable title was pared to "Shopping and . . ." in some publications when it reached New York. His "Mother Clap's Molly House" again involves the transformation of sex into a consumer product. It opens in an 18th-century "molly house," meaning a place where men come to cross-dress and couple, and in the second half switches between there and modern London, where the same cast is holding what is clearly supposed to be a glum, pleasureless orgy, complete with cocaine, leather, chains, prying video cameras and desultory fellatio. 
Nicholas Hytner, the National Theater's artistic-director-elect, stages the earlier encounters with an exuberance that suggests his regime won't be timorous. But with Eros and even a character called God appearing to give their blessings to some graphically portrayed sodomy, and the cast occasionally breaking into "Beggar's Opera"-style choruses, the piece feels cluttered. Nor does Mr. Ravenhill bring much conviction to his attempts to indict that old villain Modern Capitalism. The 18th-century cavortings, though maybe more innocent and less businesslike, don't seem much more fun than their 21st-century counterparts. Both left me wanting a nice cup of tea.

Fireman and His Family Find an East Side Condo

BYLINE:  By TRISH HALL 

 BODY:
MANY firefighters who work in New York City live in the suburbs, in houses with several bedrooms and grassy yards for their children. The suburbs are very practical for firefighters because they work two shifts a week of 24 hours each, making commuting far less frequent and onerous.
 So when Terrence McGann told his fellow firemen at Engine Company 42 in the Bronx that he and his wife, Karen Jones-McGann, were buying an apartment in Manhattan, they thought he was crazy. Why spend so much for so little? 
 But from the moment he met his future wife four years ago, living in Manhattan was a nonnegotiable part of their relationship. Stricken at age 24 with a brain aneurysm and left with no peripheral vision, she cannot drive. During her first marriage, she lived in New Jersey, and the isolation she experienced as a carless person left her determined never to make the same mistake again. "You lose your independence," she said.
Buying an appealing apartment in Manhattan is sometimes difficult even for people with quite a bit of money. Mrs. Jones-McGann, 36, works as an executive assistant for the president of Port Parties, which runs trade shows on the piers, and two middle-class salaries don't go far. Making matters even worse, Mr. McGann, also 36, had filed for bankruptcy after getting divorced from his first wife and finding himself unable to pay off the credit card bills they had accumulated.
But they had the assistance of Mary Beth Waite of the Halstead Property Company, a broker they describe as indispensable, and Mark Wenitzky of Chase, a banker who went out of his way to help. So they and their 3-month-old daughter, Samantha, are now ensconced in a cozy, light-filled one-bedroom condo on the top floor of a sixth-floor walkup on 89th Street between First and Second Avenues.
The couple bought it a year ago for $225,000, and then two weeks ago, with interest rates declining and Mr. McGann's credit improving, they refinanced.
The previous mortgage payment was $1,857; their new one is $1,600 a month, which includes taxes but not the common charge of $324 a month.
Mr. McGann was surprised that Chase would take them on. At first, he said, they had gone to "fly-by-night" operations looking for a mortgage, but Chase ended up being more helpful, initially charging an interest rate of 8.5 percent because of his bad credit history. "I was bankrupt," he said. "For me to even be considered was huge."
"He married me for my money," his wife teased.
"No," he countered. "I married her for her credit."
Their new loan rate is 7 percent, and their total monthly cost is substantially less than the $2,500 in rent they were paying for their apartment in the East 80's near First Avenue.
Not that finding their new home was easy. Mrs. McGann said she wanted a condo, not a co-op. "I said to Mary Beth, I don't want anybody telling me when I can and cannot run my washer," she said. Co-ops may be less expensive, but they have more rules. She said she liked the broker because Ms. Waite listened to what she wanted and didn't try to show her things that didn't match her interests, or apartments that were too expensive, and because "she's very aggressive but not annoying."
There were only six condos available in their price range on the Upper East Side when they were looking last year, and so they picked the largest one. It was hardly dazzling. "It was the middle of summer," Mr. McGann said. "There was no air-conditioning, and no fans. It was a sweatbox."
THEY bought it and immediately renovated, hiring firemen to do construction: new kitchen cabinets, air-conditioners, ceiling fans and better closets. 
As before, she walks to her job at 44th Street and 12th Avenue, an hour and a half trip, and he drives to the firehouse at 175th Street and Monroe Avenue, off the Grand Concourse, a drive of no more than 10 minutes when he leaves for work at 7 a.m. At home, he likes to sit on the stoop outside their new home. 
"We know everyone in the building," he said. "I sit on the stoop. They have to get past me." Since the World Trade Center disaster, where he worked the night of Sept. 11 on rescue operations, people on the street have been noticeably more interested and supportive. "They stop and say hello and ask how I'm doing," he said.
He grew up in Inwood, where he and his friends played ball against the stoop, and his wife was raised just 20 blocks away, also in Inwood. They met four years ago at a party in Riverdale.
They're beginning to think about getting a larger apartment, one with a bedroom for Samantha, who looks like a doll lying against the couch cushion.
"No matter what, we stay in the city," Mrs. Jones-McGann said. Another walkup would be fine with her, and her husband agrees. "They're more personable," he said. "People who are in doorman buildings have money."
The firefighters in his company, meanwhile, are amazed that one of their own is in Manhattan. "They get a charge out of me living down here," he said.

HEADLINE: REBUILDING; 
An Open Door

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Power, Imagination and New York's Future" by Herbert Muschamp Oct. 28 : 
 The New York City Infrastructure Task Force is not the effort of four architectural firms. 
It is a coalition of several hundred architects, planners, urban designers, members of the City Planning Commission, civic activists, representatives of government, real estate consultants, engineers, business leaders, artists, environmentalists and so forth. The door is open to anyone who has an interest in participating.
The coalition has divided itself into seven primary groups that are dealing with wider regional issues as well as the downtown area and the World Trade Center site itself. These include transportation connections, uses, growth strategies, quality of life and sustainability, the memorial process, cultural and historic resources, liaison and communication.
Our motivation is not to serve the interests of developer clients. Rather, our goal is to establish principles and guidelines that will ensure that the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site will be done in a manner that will: help sustain a vital urban center in downtown Manhattan; reflect the long-term interests of the city and region; create a place that responds to the emotional needs of the public; and cultivate a process that promotes the highest achievable quality of responsible architecture and urban design.

Times Square : Bring Back New Yorkers -- and Sex

BYLINE:  By Frank Rich; Frank Rich is an Op-Ed columnist for The Times and a senior writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
Labor Day brought the romance it always does to Broadway: the whiff of a new season. In the Times Square that Disney helped build in the late 1990's, you could squint your eyes and imagine that the crossroads of the world was as vital as ever. The blazing lights, after all, seemed even brighter than those of "42nd Street" lore, and foot traffic had become so dense that Broadway sidewalks had just been widened to accommodate it. 
 So the shock was real when the attack on the World Trade Center claimed Times Square's economy and optimism as collateral damage. As tourists fled, four Broadway shows folded. Others, playing to audiences of 300 or less in 1,500-seat houses, were placed in cost-cutting triage. Hotels, restaurants and sidewalks emptied out, unemployment spiraled and fear supplanted "The Producers" as the street's No. 1 topic of conversation. It wasn't idle talk when Rudolph Giuliani and even Colin Powell, another native New Yorker, urged Americans to partake of an activity as seemingly frivolous as seeing a play. Broadway's survival was at stake. Though a modest bounce followed, decimated advance sales suggest it will be short-lived. 
 Many of the gains of the area's redevelopment, led by the decline in crime, are undiminished, but the cataclysm of Sept. 11 revealed starkly what's missing when the office workers go home each night: New Yorkers. It's the paradox of the Times Square comeback in the late 1990's that the neighborhood that epitomizes New York to the world is no longer on the map of many of its own residents. According to one good barometer -- the League of American Theaters and Producers' surveys of Broadway ticket buyers -- the overwhelming majority of Broadway's customers were metropolitan-area residents through the 1980's. Now far fewer than half are, with less than a fifth of Broadway audiences coming from the city itself. The confirmation of these statistics could be found in the post-Sept. 11 ruins. It was the spectacles pitched at out-of-towners -- typified by "Les Miserables" and "The Phantom of the Opera" -- that were hardest hit. 
If Times Square is going to be revived at full throttle, it won't be enough to trot out a revised "I Love New York" campaign to get the tourists to return. To be truly disaster-proof, Times Square, we now know, needs the New Yorkers to come back and love it too.
This cannot be done by turning the clock back to some halcyon antique Broadway. The Automat is not going to be revived, and neither are Loew's Capitol, Orange Julius stands or Walter Winchell. But it is possible to retrieve for the new new Times Square some of what's been unnecessarily lost from its past without indulging in nostalgic fantasies or sacrificing the gains of the late 90's. 
Clearly Broadway will have to be made safe once again for plays, which New Yorkers favor over musicals. The only way more plays will be produced is if they are cheaper to put on and cheaper to see. (At a typical drama this season, "Dance of Death," even the back of the balcony goes for $50.) Already the Theater Development Fund, which runs the half-price ticket booth, is at work on a Theater Relief Fund to subsidize and discount tickets on a larger scale than ever tried before. 
But maybe even a more radical scheme is needed. A pathway is opened up by the post-Sept. 11 stunt of "The Producers" -- raising the $100 top to $480 for prime seats, so the excess can accrue to its producers rather than to some scalper in Jersey. This idea should be expanded industrywide -- but with a big hitch. Let all Broadway ticket prices float to their true market value -- which in the case of "The Producers" may in fact be closer to $1,000 -- but require the top draws to underwrite cheaper tickets to the same hits ($10 for all balcony seats) and maybe $35 orchestra seats at a drama that has overlapping management (as, say, "Proof" has with "The Producers"). Let the in-demand weekend orchestra seats of second-rung hits rise, too -- to $150, $300, whatever -- to underwrite a midweek top of one-fifth that amount. And why not conduct this rough-and-tumble market in public view? In the 1920's, a nightly bidding for unsold Broadway tickets took place at Gray's Drugstore at the Times Square subway entrance, where, in the words of Brooks Atkinson, "pitchmen barked the various attractions as if the shop were a midway." Maybe it's time to move TKTS indoors and expand it to the size of a trading pit at the stock exchange so that each rise or fall of day-of-performance Broadway ticket prices could be a pre-performance show on its own, more entertaining than eBay.
But the theater isn't the whole Times Square story and never has been. The beauty of the district has always been its rude amalgam of high and low, class and crass. The street's late-20th-century decline was in a symbolic way sealed when, in the period from 1966 to 1972, it lost its last old-time freak show (Ripley's Believe It or Not "Odditorium") and its last old-style showgirl cabaret (Lou Walters's Latin Quarter) as well as its last high-culture institution (the Metropolitan Opera House). 
That crazy-quilt hodgepodge is missing in the new Times Square, where the nontheater entertainments and services tend to be neither high nor low, but part of the bland middle of national chains. This familiarity may make out-of-towners feel as if they never left home, but in New Yorkers it can breed contempt. As an economic miracle is needed to restore plays to Times Square, so a similar one is needed to inject indigenous local businesses, whether bowling alleys or boutiques, into the faceless lineup of the Gap, Chevy's, ESPN Zone and the other cookie-cutter franchises. And why not restore the cultural high end too? Lure one of the feuding opera companies at Lincoln Center, City Opera or the Met, to an opulent new opera house in Times Square. 
Sex must also be in the mix. It has always been part of the neighborhood's DNA. Even before The New York Times moved into Longacre Square in 1904, prompting its name change, the West 40's were overrun by "parlor houses." In 1913, the New Amsterdam's roof theater -- right above the stage where "The Lion King" prowls now -- featured Ziegfeld's "Midnight Frolic," where a trick of lighting on a "see-through runway" displayed the pulchritude of chorus girls. A decade later the Shubert Theater housed "Artists and Models," a revue featuring female frontal nudity. Fiorello La Guardia stamped out the "incorporated filth" of burlesque in the 1930's, and his successor in spirit, Rudolph Giuliani, tried to do the same with porn. But there must be a way to get sensible adult sexuality back into Times Square entertainment. It wouldn't mean importing prostitution, 10-cents-a-dance halls or wretched XXX emporiums, but perhaps at least a touch of Vegas (which also tried to stamp out sex revues in favor of family entertainment in the 1990's but this year reversed course). 
At the very least, maybe the Shuberts should consider reviving "Artists and Models" alongside "Dance of Death." Tourists, no less than locals, know that sex is the dance of life, and its defiant spirit, now more than ever, is intrinsic to the next comeback of Times Square.

Boroughs : Put a Piece of Downtown in Flushing

BYLINE:  By Michael Sorkin; Michael Sorkin is the director of the graduate program in urban design at City College.

 BODY:
The radical act of the terrorists opens a space for us to think radically as well. While many of the billions that will be available for rebuilding -- from insurance, from federal aid, from city coffers, from developers -- are surely needed to restore the health and character of Lower Manhattan, it seems reasonable to question whether such massive expenditure should be focused exclusively downtown rather than throughout the city at sites of need and opportunity.
 Although many think of Manhattan and New York City as one and the same, the majority of the city's population and geography do not lie on the island: Manhattan holds only 6.8 percent of the city's land area and 19 percent of its inhabitants. It is, however, our economic motor, accounting for two-thirds of New York City's jobs and almost half its retail sales. The great infusions of capital and the artificial fortunes of the last decade have propelled the price of real estate in much of Manhattan to stratospheric heights, accelerating the flight of the middle class and the poor and making Manhattan increasingly monochrome, the differences among its neighborhoods merely physical. While our ethnic and cultural quarters solidify and thrive outside the borough -- in Flushing, Astoria, the new bohemias of Dumbo, Williamsburg and Long Island City, and along Atlantic Avenue -- Manhattan becomes a place of privilege, inhospitible to striving, less and less like New York. 
 But these big changes also suggest an opportunity for transforming the city, making it more sustainable, more livable and more likely to benefit those neighborhoods struggling to find form or merely to keep up. Because of its dynamic population and superb movement infrastructure, New York City can become a model of a new kind of many-centered metropolis, with Manhattan -- the world capital -- remaining its center of all centers. The 10 million square feet of office space that were lost to terror could be reconstituted in 1-million- or 2-million-square-foot increments in neighborhoods around the city that already house large populations ready to work.
Such a plan would capture jobs that might head out of town otherwise, reinforce the centrality of New York as a whole and take advantage of the downscaling of individual locations that is becoming corporate writ. Manhattan itself is already polycentric: the easy movement of financial services from downtown to Midtown in recent years suggests that convenient movement and strong local character can substitute for immediate adjacency. The point is not to make New York more like Phoenix or Los Angeles, but to make the city as a whole more like New York, restoring a network of semiautonomous "villages" within an overall context of density.
Building on New York City's natural polycentricity would multiply opportunities for more self-sufficient "green" neighborhoods in which people might walk to work, to school, to recreation and to culture, pushing the city in the direction of greater sustainability by reducing commuting, taking fuller advantage of mass transit and introducing green architectural technologies. 
The expressive singularity of each of these neighborhoods -- the Asian flavor of Flushing or the Latin American atmosphere of the Bronx Hub -- would reinforce New York's blessed diversity. Imagine a day at a riverside office overlooking Yankee Stadium, a night spent clubbing in the Hub and a leisurely stroll back home to the Concourse.
The mixed-use character of these neighborhoods would be assured by including residential construction matched to the numbers of new workplaces, a pattern that had already begun downtown, where substantial office space had been eliminated by conversion of "obsolete" buildings to residential use.
This sense of self-contained locality would also be reinforced by the decentralization of cultural growth (the City Opera, the Guggenheim, the Whitney and the Met are all seeking new or additional space) and by encouraging the development of new cultural, educational and commercial institutions to enhance the variety and life of these neighborhood centers.
To create this energetic mix, these centers must be envisioned and planned as autonomous, not simply ancillary. Downtown Brooklyn is already one of the largest "central places" in America but continues to be thought of as a back office for Manhattan, Jersey City with a sales tax. Zoning and design for new centers must reinforce difference, not simply create a series of mini-Manhattans. Although the skyscraper is a pre-eminent symbol of 20th-century technology and of the culture of the corporation, other greener paradigms must now emerge that modulate the machismo of height and foreground strong environmental values.
A comprehensive re-examination of transportation is crucial to this transformation. Movement must be facilitated not simply in and out of Manhattan but between the developing centers of lived life. Our waterways, in particular, offer a tremendous opportunity for creating such links with great economy. In addition, the city's large areas of public green space and municipally owned property can be used to begin to create a third transport net -- for pedestrians, bikers and nonaggressive zero-emissions vehicles -- to supplement the street grid and the subway. This is simply leveraging the city's existing advantages. With the city having just spent over a billion dollars on a rail link from Kennedy Airport to Jamaica, doesn't it make sense to enhance this new, incredibly well-serviced node with careful development? 
Rushing headlong back to the status quo without thinking deeply about the future of the city does no honor to the victims or ourselves: we need now consider the widest range of possibilities, not the narrowest. Reflecting on the future of the city in this irrevocably changed environment, it is urgent to remember that business-as-usual in New York is more than the compulsion to repeat patterns of the past: our greatest talent is creating the new. Perhaps we can reply to the terror by showing that evil acts can have unintended positive consequences.

HEADLINE: RETHINK : Manifestoes For the Next New York; 
Mass Transit : Connect the Connectors

BYLINE:  By Alex Marshall; Alex Marshall is the author of "How Cities Work: Suburbs, Sprawl and the Roads Not Taken."

 BODY:
When the World Trade Center fell to the ground, it knocked out train and subway lines and in doing so made the public aware of the incredible machinery that pumps people into our streets and buildings. We saw one thing very clearly: this machinery is ancient. The subway line that ran directly under the fallen towers, for example, began service in 1918.
 The New York City Transit Authority has spent $30 billion in the last 20 years to improve the subways and commuter trains. Nearly all the money went to make amends for decades of neglect. Very little went to build new lines and connections. We are now entering a period of fiscal austerity in which it will be especially difficult to make such massive infrastructural investments. But it is essential, all the same, to look ahead to economic recovery, and to understand that the most effective means of creating jobs and improving the city's economy is through transportation. We are already pitifully behind cities like London, Tokyo, Shanghai and Paris, which have each spent heavily on ultramodern subways and high-speed trains that will support and enrich those cities for decades to come. 
 Even in times of economic prosperity, New York City cannot pay for new mass-transit systems by itself, any more than London or Paris could have paid for theirs alone, or cities in the Sun Belt could have built their own Interstate highways. So our task will be twofold: we will have to decide exactly what we want, and we will have to build a political case for getting Washington to help us pay for it.
Let's start with what we want, beginning in Lower Manhattan where, sadly, the terrorists have already done much of the demolition work. The Regional Plan Association, a public-interest planning group, has proposals for a beautiful series of new stations in the financial district that seamlessly connect ferries, subways and train lines. These would include a magnificent central subway station at Fulton Street, where 13 subway lines, a commuter train and ferries from Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and New Jersey all converge, opening up the hideous rat's nest that's there now with skylights and gleaming concourses. 
We should also build the long-awaited Second Avenue subway. Right now, the single East Side subway line is so congested that, among other things, Metro-North commuters coming into Grand Central Terminal look for any excuse to avoid it. If it were easier for them, and everyone else, to get downtown, Lower Manhattan would be more attractive to businesses that now cluster tightly around Midtown. The commuter trains that come into Penn Station and Grand Central still aren't connected because, a lifetime ago, they used to be operated by rival firms. Now that they are both managed by the public sector, this anachronism ought to be corrected. 
Intercity train travel is also vital to New York. In the best of times, the airports are crowded and inconvenient. We can improve connections in and out of town by insisting that Amtrak receive a fairer share of federal subsidies. Last year, Washington lavished $12.5 billion on air travel, $33.4 billion on highways and a mere $520 million on Amtrak. This is a ridiculous imbalance, all the more so when you factor in the $15 billion that went to prop up the airlines after Sept. 11. It's also dangerous. Relying so much on air travel is what military planners call a lack of necessary redundancy.
How do we pay for it? Paris recently financed part of its $35 billion subway renovation (the national government paid most of it) with a regional payroll tax, a hard sell in New York. But our private sector could do its part by not demanding the tax breaks and other bribes they often get for merely not leaving the city. These public resources could better be spent on transit, a true form of economic development.
Another idea is to create tax-increment finance zones along a new Second Avenue subway line. When property values rise, as they inevitably would when the subway is put in, property tax receipts would rise, too, and this extra money could be used to pay off the construction bonds.
No matter what, though, we will need the federal government on our side, in a way it never really has been. We must convince legislators that helping New York doesn't mean just subsidizing the parochial interests that have long controlled the city. Part of this will certainly mean working with the trade unions to lower costs and show that public-works projects need not be mere boondoggles.
But the larger argument is this: New York is the country's only truly global financial center, a status that is by no means guaranteed. When the Sept. 11 attack paralyzed many New York firms, it wasn't just New Jersey, Connnecticut, Chicago and San Francisco that picked up the slack. It was also London, the natural place for global finance to migrate should New York falter. That would leave a gaping hole in the American economy, not to mention the federal budget. Last year, New York City produced federal tax receipts of $49billion and received roughly $41 billion back in federal spending. Just making up half this annual difference would pay for roughly four miles of the eight-mile Second Avenue subway.
New Yorkers must resist the urge to adopt a survivalist mentality and scale back our ambitions. Mass transit produced this city -- its unique scale, its marvelously high density and all the good things that entails -- and mass transit can revive it in a way that no other single thing can. The best part is that if New York improves its subways, trains and ferries, it becomes not only a better place, but more like itself, more New Yorkish.

HEADLINE: RETHINK : Manifestoes For the Next New York; 
Labor : Capitalize on Blue-Collar Heroism

BYLINE:  By Sara Mosle; Sara Mosle is writing a book about East Texas in the 1930's.

 BODY:
For the first time in decades, America's heroes are everyday working people: firemen, postal workers, E.M.S. technicians, police officers, soldiers. In celebrity magazines, iron welders appear, in their beefy union T-shirts, like movie stars, and outside the city's firehouses, crowds continue to linger -- the buckets of flowers still fresh, the candles still lighted. As David Letterman said, summing up the nation's sense of gratitude: "I hope we never, ever take these people for granted."
 If ever there was a moment for the revival of organized labor, it is now. Yet Congress and corporate America seem shockingly unattuned to this extraordinary shift in the national mood. Of the government's $15 billion bailout of the airlines, not one cent went to laid-off workers. Only 2.3 percent of the House of Representatives' $100 billion "stimulus" package went to extending unemployment and health insurance to the more than half a million newly unemployed. And because the rules governing such programs have not kept pace with the changing face of labor, vast sectors of working-class Americans -- especially the immigrants and single working parents in part-time, seasonal and minimum-wage service jobs -- won't qualify for even this meager aid. In many states, even legal immigrants are denied assistance, and welfare caps are kicking in at just the wrong moment. 
 This neglect creates enormous challenges -- and opportunities -- for labor. The most visible heroes of Sept. 11 belong to the city's municipal unions, who put a heartbreakingly human face on the values labor has historically embraced: sacrifice, solidarity, brotherhood. Yet they will have a hard time capitalizing on this overdue recognition in a city facing a huge budget deficit. New York's private-sector unions will be even harder-pressed. The city estimates that by the end of the year more than 100,000 New Yorkers will have lost their jobs because of the attacks, many of them low-wage, immigrant service employees.
The first job of organized labor has been to help these workers, and the families of those who died, get the benefits they need. Now labor needs to argue vociferously for changing the immigration laws, joining forces with those Republicans who, before Sept. 11, supported extending the benefits and protections Americans enjoy to all immigrants. No city is better poised than New York to show the country how vital immigrants are to our economy. They are equally vital to labor's future. Service jobs, by definition, can't be shipped overseas, which means low-wage, immigrant service employees are ripe for unionization. "Our mission," says Bill Granfield, president of New York City's Local 100 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International union (HERE), "is to organize the unorganized."
This won't happen on a large scale without reform of our labor laws. In the past, that prospect seemed like a pipe dream, but now that the nation is re-evaluating the importance of some of its humblest workers, it's time to put it on the agenda. The present rules are so wildly skewed to favor employers -- who can subject employees to antiunion propaganda meetings while denying unions any access whatsoever and firing workers illegally for union activity -- it's a miracle if a union ever wins an organizing drive. We should end all that and instead follow the lead of Canada, which allows workers to indicate their preference by simply signing a card, a process known as "card checks." And once the cards are tallied, we should prevent the loser from litigating the results for years on end. New York can lead the way by requiring all rebuilding be done with union labor and all businesses that are restored with government money to agree to card checks for employees pursuing union representation. 
While it's important to acknowledge labor's past failings -- mismanagement, fraud and a few former associates swimming with the fishes -- few other institutions can do as much for the city's economy. By putting money into the pockets of average Americans, a union can be a surprisingly effective stimulus program. In New York, for example, where labor represents 95 percent of the city's maids, they can earn upward of $15 an hour, with benefits. And their salaries exert an upward pressure on those even in nonunion shops. HERE Local 100, however, represents just 10 percent of the city's dishwashers, who make $8 and $9 an hour -- better than the minimum wage, but not enough to escape poverty. And as for the charge that unions are bad for business, has anyone noticed that Southwest, one of the few airlines still making money, without layoffs, is also the airline with such famously good management-labor relations? 
"We helped propel the recovery of many cities in the 1990's," says John Wilhelm, the president of HERE. In Las Vegas, home to HERE's largest local, its 50,000 members helped make the city the fastest-growing in the country, partly because they had decent wages to spend. "We employ the largest number of immigrants, the largest number of welfare-to-work people, the largest number of single mothers," says Wilhelm. How they fare will shape society's fortunes. The World Trade Center attack taught us how interconnected we all are: the dishwasher at Windows on the World, the bus driver at Port Authority, the security guard at Morgan Stanley.
Labor has always relied on public opinion, and during the 1930's, through the worst possible economic times, unions made their greatest gains because their message of sacrifice and solidarity resonated with all Americans. It is now up to the city's labor leaders to make the connection between the heroes of Sept. 11 and the organizations that can best represent them.

HEADLINE: RETHINK : Manifestoes For the Next New York; 
Economy : Bring Back the MAC

BYLINE:  By Felix G. Rohatyn; Felix G. Rohatyn, ambassador to France from 1997 to 2000, was chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation from 1975 to 1993.

 BODY:
There is no question that New York City and New York State are facing not only a serious financial crisis, but an economic crisis as well. The crisis of 1975 was essentially financial: with a $1.5 billion deficit on a budget of about $15 billion and $6 billion of short-term debt coming due, the city was unable to finance itself in the marketplace. However, the city's economy was turning around, and once the debt was refinanced and the budget was brought under control, the economy recovered strongly.
 This is not the situation we now face. The city is not facing bankruptcy, the debt structure is leveled out, the accounting is transparent and up to now the budget has been under control. The total debt, however, is almost $35 billion (or about $4,000 per capita), and as a result of the terrorist attack and an already weak economy, the city's financial situation is deteriorating markedly. This is leading to big budget deficits -- already over $4 billion for the city and what may grow to $6 billion for the state -- that cannot be closed in short order without permanently damaging the city's social and economic structure. 
 The trauma of the attack and the fear of future incidents, together with the city's uncertain financial posture, are causing a number of businesses to rethink their future here. Some, wary of service cutbacks and tax increases, are considering relocating. Others, directly affected by the disaster, are facing bankruptcy. The city's restaurant-industry leaders warn that their sector alone could lose 150,000 jobs if credit assistance is not available soon. 
Counteracting this alarming trend will require inspired leadership on the part of Governor Pataki and the mayor. A number of the mechanisms that were set up during the crisis of 1975 are still in place, and politicians might wish to use them. Furthermore, the alliance among business, labor, city and state should be reconstituted and should put out a sustained call for business to stay in New York. The mayor and the governor must be the cheerleaders of this effort. 
In the light of the city's looming deficits, the Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC) and the Financial Control Board, whose deficit financing and budget control returned the city to the financial markets in the 1970's, could be reactivated. MAC is an existing structure, presided over by the former state comptroller Edward V. Regan, with an independent board, investment-grade credit ratings and transparent public accounts. MAC issued $10 billion in bonds between 1975 and 1985, of which all but $3 billion have been repaid. The balance will be paid back by 2008. MAC's free cash flow is $3.4 billion annually. With renewed borrowing authority it could significantly assist a plan to bridge four to five years of deficit financing. The Financial Control Board, consisting of the governor, the mayor, the city and state comptrollers and three private citizens, is useful not only in assisting the mayor on difficult choices but also in reassuring the agencies that rate city and MAC bonds. 
Other agencies, like the New York City Transitional Finance Authority and the Industrial Development Authority, are also able to participate in this effort. 
However, to obtain additional federal assistance, we will need to show a significant local effort. In the 1970's we did this, with the cooperation of the unions and of the banks, by freezing expenses, increasing certain taxes, restructuring debt and handing some city functions over to the state. In this case, those particular taxes would be counterproductive, but the commuter tax is a different matter. There was never a valid economic reason for repealing it, since it requires commuters to share some of the costs for city services that they enjoy, and in this period of emergency it should be reinstated promptly. It would provide $400 million annually to the city.
But local strategies alone won't solve the problem. In contrast to the late 1970's, today the national economy is heading into a recession and aggravating the city's problems. The first national relief effort we should pursue is an alliance of mayors and governors to promote a national revenue-sharing program, which would offset the harsh fiscal contractions that practically every state will require. A five-year plan that would return $100 billion to state and local governments could provide nearly $20billion of budgetary assistance to New York under the sharing formulas presently used in federal transportation bills. This was a program that was begun by President Nixon in 1972 and that functioned very successfully until 1981, providing grants to 50 states and 37,000 localities.
Second, we need a plan to encourage infrastructure investment. Public pension funds that currently manage almost $500 billion of assets could invest in special state and city bonds to finance projects like transportation, schools, roads, buildings and many others, making our public facilities safer and more modern. A national program of $25 billion annually would create nearly one million jobs per year and significantly improve the country's productivity and quality of life. New York's share of such a program could be as much as $5 billion annually. The bonds would have to be guaranteed by the federal government to meet the fiduciary obligations of the pension-fund trustees, but they would ultimately be paid off by the revenues generated at the state and local levels. (The city's pre-Sept. 11 needs for normal capital projects total nearly $20 billion.)
The Bush administration's refusal to consider Governor Pataki's request for $54 billion of assistance is not surprising, given our history with Congress. "I Love New York" does not necessarily translate into open-ended federal assistance. So it's clear that solving the current crisis will require different approaches, some old, some new. But whatever they may be, some fundamentals cannot be allowed to change: the city must continue to be a magnet for people and for ideas, for culture and for commerce, for science and for technology. New York is an irreplaceable national asset; our governor and our mayor must see to it that it is treated as such. They must set a clear objective for the New York of tomorrow.

HEADLINE: REWRITE; 
Post-9/11: The Series

BYLINE:  By Lynn Hirschberg; Lynn Hirschberg is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
 LYNN HIRSCHBERG: Television shows from "N.Y.P.D. Blue" to "Seinfeld" and "Sex and the City" have projected an image of New York City to the world. Now that we've entered into a new moment in the city's history, is it up to television to help re-establish that image. And how do you, as television producers, go about doing that?
PAUL SIMMS: It might be too soon to say. I was thinking about this last night -- if I were doing a show about New York right now, what would be a safe avenue for comedy that could reflect how people are feeling in this changed city. And I thought, Well, you know, you could do a silly story about gas-mask hysteria. All your characters are desperate to get a gas mask. And then 10 minutes later I turn on the Internet and a 7-month-old baby has anthrax, and suddenly that joke isn't so funny. One of the problems with being overly topical on a sitcom is you have at least a one-month lead time. And these days, things are changing very quickly.

DARREN STAR: There has also been a powerful shift in the country's perception of New York City. Suddenly New York isn't perceived as "over there," a separate entity from the rest of the country, a place where people are somehow different. The country really has embraced New York. And there's a flip side to that: people have always come to New York to be the outsiders and the radicals and a little apart from everything. And now we're being embraced, and I'm not so sure how everyone feels about it.
SIDNEY LUMET: I don't think we like it.
SIMMS: There's always been a disjunction between the general notion of how the country perceives New York -- as this strange, crazy place -- and how much they identify with shows set in New York. People who watch "Seinfeld" and "Friends," and probably going back as far as "The Honeymooners" and "All in the Family," they think, Oh, those characters are just like my buddies whom I hang out with. There's something generically cosmopolitan about those shows. Probably when people watch "Sex and the City," they see New York and feel like they're in a specific place. But I don't get the sense that they do that with "Friends" or "Will and Grace."
STAR: In "Sex and the City" I think we try to make New York look specifically glamorous and exotic.
SIMMS: And "Sex and the City" is the one comedy that is probably most affected by what happened.
STAR: I agree. We have a real challenge because we film in New York, and it's not a traditional sitcom. We don't have a laugh track.
SIMMS: I also think "Sex and the City" is the sitcom best equipped to deal with the city's changed mood.
STAR: "Sex and the City" always took as its core material this great frisson of silliness and fashion and an enormous amount of money and superficiality. We had fun with it, we celebrated it, we did a lot of things with it. And now there is a shifting mood. But luckily, the characters were heading in that direction anyway. This past season the show took a more dramatic turn, a more thoughtful turn. Still, I think it would be a mistake to make a direct correlation in the show between the trade center catastrophe and how the characters are feeling.
SIMMS: No matter how well it's done, when a sitcom tries to tackle a serious issue, it always reminds me of the episode of "Mr. Belvedere" about AIDS. It was a noble attempt, I guess, but it's like listening to someone play "Ave Maria" on a kazoo. As well as they might be able to play, and as much as it touches you, it's still a kazoo. And there's nothing wrong with kazoos, and there's nothing wrong with a sitcom, but it's a fantasy world -- and I mean that in an absolutely positive sense. It resembles reality, but you know no one's going to die. No one's going to be the victim of a violent crime. No one's going to have a terminal illness. And I like it that way.
 I mean, the first non-news thing I watched after all this happened was the season premiere of "Friends." Until then I'd been thinking, Who cares about make-believe TV? But then "Friends" was funny, and it made me laugh -- partly because I knew nothing terrible was going to happen to these people.
HIRSCHBERG to LUMET : You do a show set in New York. Are you planning to incorporate anything about Sept. 11 into "100 Centre Street"?
LUMET: No. I don't think we should touch it.
HIRSCHBERG: Why not?
LUMET: It was a cataclysm. The worst that I know of in 50 years. Anything you might try to do would turn out sentimental. It's the very definition of sentimentality -- you're not creating the emotion; the emotion is happening because of an echo that has nothing to do with the work you're doing. So right away, that's exploitative.
 Also, no matter what you say about television -- good, bad or indifferent -- it exists for only one reason. It exists to sell something. And I don't think it's right to use subject matter like this to sell something. 
SIMMS: Even if you don't want to deal with the actual event, Sidney, is there a way in a drama show like yours that the difference between before and after can be reflected?
LUMET: I think it'll happen automatically. It'll happen in the writing; it'll happen in the performances; it'll happen through the direction. Assuming that you're functioning well, which to me means that you're pouring yourself into your work, whatever you are at that moment is going to show up on the screen. I don't want to go searching for the way to do it. I'm just going to assume it's going to show up.
STAR: Don't you also think it's only with hindsight that you can see the effect certain events have on television? I think if you look at television in the 60's, you saw a very specific reaction to the Vietnam War, which was, Let's ignore it and pretend that everything's right with this country.
HIRSCHBERG: Isn't there such a thing, though, as entertainment that consciously reflects social issues and moments in history? Is it possible to turn those moments into entertainment that's meaningful to people, that helps people understand what's happening in their world?
SIMMS: I guess so. Shows like "All in the Family" and "M*A*S*H" were designed to do that from the STARt, and they did make it work. But when you take regular sitcoms, which are like Broadway musicals without the music, and you try to graft social commentary onto it, that's when you end up with the most useless, embarrassing stuff.
STAR: Right. Which is why I don't know if on "Sex and the City" we're going to do a gas-mask episode anytime soon.
SIMMS: Topical material on sitcoms, when you see it a few years later in reruns, you feel so embarrassed. Even with "M*A*S*H," the more serious episodes are the ones that when I turn on the rerun and see it I go, "Ugh." They don't age well. And the topical stuff I did on "News Radio" -- an episode about controversial hip-hop lyrics or a reference to Joey Buttafuoco -- at the time those seemed funny as hell, but a few years later they just make me cringe.
HIRSCHBERG: Do you feel like the era of "M*A*S*H" and "All in the Family" was one where television was allowed to be more socially conscious?
STAR: Sure. We've just been through a long sustained period of prosperity, and we haven't been provoked into thinking very much.
SIMMS: Two and a half years ago I did a pilot about a bunch of young American kids in the Peace Corps, set in a fictional country that was supposed to be somewhere between Pakistan and India. I thought, It's an isolated location, it's young kids away from America, it's the clash of cultures, it'll be great.
HIRSCHBERG: What kind of reaction did you get?
SIMMS: It was a miserable failure. The network did audience research, and on a scale of 1 to 100, we got like a 5 or a 6. They said, The audience is actively rejecting this concept.
LUMET: The interesting thing about both "M*A*S*H" and "All in the Family" is that they were created -- I'm not bragging, gang -- but they were created by producers from my generation. Larry Gelbart and Norman Lear are from my time. They came out of the same experience that I did.
STAR: I agree. Paul and I were both born in the 60's, and our generation really didn't have a lot to challenge us. And a lot of the product we're creating reflects that. It's not a coincidence that in the fairly cushy period that we've just lived through, a lot of the shows that have been successful have relied on the comedy of self-involvement.
SIMMS: When everything else is going so well, you can focus on the little things that aren't.
STAR: And that does come out of a certain experience -- in the same way that once you've been through a war, as Sidney has, it changes you, and you write from that point of view.
HIRSCHBERG: If you were STARting from scratch to create a show to reflect the new New York, what kind of setting would you think about?
SIMMS: On the nuts-and-bolts level the first thing I would say, and this is partly selfish, is you have to shoot it in New York. Put the money into the local economy and use all the resources and all the tremendous actors and writers that are here. The idea of doing a show about New York from Los Angeles right now just doesn't feel right. As far as the concept, you can make anything work. I mean, firefighters -- women love firefighters, and firefighters know that women love them, so that could be funny.
STAR: I think this is like before-and-after New York. I think people are just staggered, they're kind of reassessing everything and really thinking about life.
SIMMS: There probably could be a good drama about soldiering on. Though to be honest, I don't know if I would watch it. The show I'd like to see is a "Law and Order"/type show about all the investigative work that's being done right now to piece all this together. But I don't want to see it now; I want to see it in five years.
HIRSCHBERG: Why don't you want to see it now?
SIMMS: Because now it would be all make-believe and made up.
STAR: You can watch the news every day.
SIMMS: Although, I have to say, I watched that new C.I.A. show. What was it called? Silence. Come on, you guys. Am I the only person here who actually watches TV? All right, I remember now -- it was called "The Agency." Before I watched it I thought, How can this beat the news? Then I watched it, and I have to say there was some appeal in seeing competent intelligence agents anticipating problems and solving them.
HIRSCHBERG to STAR : All the way back to "Beverly Hills, 90210," your shows have been peace-and-prosperity shows -- with the emphasis on prosperity. If the city and the country are changing economically, does that worry you? Does that mean your sort of show is harder to do?
STAR: Actually, "90210" was really popular during a big recession and the gulf war. That's when it became a hit. It created a comforting fantasy of wealth and family and a tight-knit group of friends. It was a world that you fantasized about but weren't really experiencing.
HIRSCHBERG: So would you still go for glamour and fashion now?
STAR: Glamour and fashion without characters doesn't mean anything.
SIMMS: But it can be the hook that, at least initially, gets people to try a show out.
STAR: It can be, yeah. But I'd love to write a show about my family's experience of growing up in the 1920's as the only Jewish family in Gettysburg, Pa.
SIMMS: I love it. Give me 22 episodes.
STAR: I'd call it "The Valtons." I think that would work now.
HIRSCHBERG: Have any of you ever heard from a network that a show is "too New York"?
LUMET: Oh, yeah. You hear that all the time.
SIMMS: Didn't they say that about "Seinfeld"?
HIRSCHBERG: Yeah, it was code for "It's too Jewish."
LUMET: Back in my live television days -- and this was a long time ago -- there were only so many times you could use the guy in the cardigan before you'd get a word from the advertising agency. Cardigans and diamond bathrobes.
STAR: I'm not quite sure what that represents.
LUMET: It represents old Jews.
STAR: Coming to New York as a kid, I found a Jewishness to New York. But now I think that New York has been embraced by so many other people that have come here in the past 20 years. To me, the city has evolved. Now I think of it as Jewish plus everything else.
SIMMS: If there's a pejorative image people have of New York now, it's probably gone from being the Jewish thing to the John Rocker image of a place full of immigrants and weirdos. Which is of course exactly what makes the city great.
LUMET: It's one of the joys, by the way, of shooting in Astoria. It's the most integrated place I've ever been in the United States. And beautiful. It's right out of a Norman Rockwell drawing. When you pass a school at 3 o'clock and those mothers are waiting for the kids to come out -- Pakistani, Korean, Chinese -- I mean, it's extraordinary.
HIRSCHBERG: And is that something you try to reflect through TV?
LUMET: On our show we do. I think whites are in the minority on the show.
SIMMS: But when we talk about all of these New York shows, that multicultural idea really hasn't been reflected very often. I mean, the show that probably came closest to reflecting it successfully was "All in the Family." And even that wasn't particularly multicultural unless Sammy Davis Jr. stopped by for a guest appearance. But it was dealing with all those -- I hate to say dealing with issues, because it did much more than that -- but it tried at least to acknowledge the reality of the city.
HIRSCHBERG: Sidney, would you have an Arab character on "100 Centre Street" as a way to comment on anti-Arab racism?
LUMET: It wouldn't bother me.
HIRSCHBERG: But would you intentionally introduce a character to do that?
LUMET: No. If it's not organic, it'll stand out.
HIRSCHBERG: But isn't that one way that TV really does have power? Like the coming-out episode in "Ellen," it can open up a public conversation.
SIMMS: I know what you're saying, but I think it would feel weird to inject an Arab or Arab-American character onto a show in hopes of changing people's attitudes. It's going to be the AIDS episode of "Mr. Belvedere" all over again, except with a Lebanese guy.
HIRSCHBERG: What about class? The city's heroes now are very working class: firemen, policemen, construction workers. Their status in the city has been elevated vastly and the rich and famous suddenly don't seem quite as heroic. Is that something you'd want to reflect in a show?
SIMMS: Sure, but I don't know if people -- at least with comedy -- are really looking for a show about their heroes. That's the problem right now. If someone twisted your arm and said, all right, you have to do a sitcom about firemen because everyone loves firemen now, it would be a nightmare to try to do. To make the characters real they would need to have flaws. And I don't know if the network would want to see firemen depicted right now with any kind of flaw.
STAR: I was thinking the other day, if my show "The Street" were still on the air, it would be the only show -- because it was about Wall Street -- that would have to deal directly with the World Trade Center. We would have had no choice.
HIRSCHBERG: If you were pitching "The Street" now, what would you do?
STAR: Not pitch it, I'm guessing. It'd be a very tough sell: Wall Streeters picking up the pieces of their lives.
HIRSCHBERG: But you could argue the opposite too. CBS is doing a pilot in which a widow falls in love with a widower and they both lost spouses in the World Trade Center.
SIMMS: Yeah, but I read on the Internet last night that the widower and the widow was a pre-existing concept that CBS was already developing. And then Les Moonves, the president of CBS, said, "Let's raise the stakes."
HIRSCHBERG: "Let's raise the stakes"?
SIMMS: You guys have probably heard that a few thousand times.
STAR: Yeah, of course. You always hear "Let's raise the stakes."
LUMET: What's that?
STAR: You've never heard "Let's raise the stakes"?
LUMET: Pardon my ignorance.
SIMMS: It's not ignorance, Sidney, it's the fact they respect you. They wouldn't dare say to you, "Let's raise the stakes."
LUMET: What does it mean?
SIMMS: Make it more dramatic or --.
STAR: Put more at jeopardy.
LUMET: They certainly don't mean, "Let's take a bigger chance."
SIMMS: No, it doesn't mean take a bigger chance. Just create more jeopardy for your characters.
HIRSCHBERG: Speaking of jeopardy, we haven't talked yet about reality TV. Is there still an audience for it?
SIMMS: Everyone's theory right now is, Who's going to care about a bunch of survivor people playing make-believe, having their mettle tested in a make-believe world? But the thing people forget about reality TV is that it's as much a fantasy as scripted TV. You know, you're not watching eight people living in the desert. You're watching eight people who want desperately to be famous living in the desert, knowing that there are cameras all around them. Which is much more entertaining. "Fear Factor" was the other big show of the summer, and people are saying, Who's going to care now about that? But right now I'd be fascinated to see people confronting their own fears. It's what we're all doing.
HIRSCHBERG: But there's lying in a tub of sheep eyes, and then there's anthrax.
SIMMS: That's true. But when you see a reality show, the fascination is watching how it plays out. You're dealing with some seriously damaged personalities who desperately want to get on the lowest rung of fame. You don't care whether they get more drinking water or someone wins a can of beans. You want to watch them compete for camera time and to be the most interesting one.
STAR: I've never been a big reality TV fan, but you're making it sound really good.
SIMMS: Just watch the season finale of "Love Cruise," and I guarantee you'll be calling someone at the studio to get the tapes of the rest of the episodes. There is another kind of reality TV right now, though, which is "20/20" and "48 Hours" and "Dateline." I've found those very compelling recently. The half-hour episode one of those shows did about rescue dogs was great. Even at its most sensationalistic, it's a return to straightforward documentary storytelling. And I love documentaries.
HIRSCHBERG: Would it be safe to say that you guys basically think that New York doesn't need rebuilding through television?
SIMMS: No, television isn't going to rebuild anything or heal anything. I think it affects people profoundly, but I'm skeptical of its ability to change the world or even people's attitudes. TV's transformative power is an idea that TV people repeat over and over. It's artistically self-congratulatory, but I don't know if it's actually true.
STAR: Yeah, but TV does shape people's image of New York to a degree. And I think in that sense, it's important not to recoil from New York as a place to set stories. I think that the character of the people that has been on display here the past couple of months is just so demonstrative of the city.
HIRSCHBERG: As a kid growing up in L.A., I thought television was a window onto the glamorous world of New York City. Letterman, especially. I just thought he was the coolest thing in the universe. And his was such a New York world. Did you guys feel that?
SIMMS: Writing for Letterman was the only job I ever wanted, and for exactly those reasons.
STAR: Yeah, Letterman and "Saturday Night Live" defined a certain comedic sensibility that was very New York.
SIMMS: And whatever happens, I don't think that's going anywhere.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/The Federal Reserve Bank of New York; 
Mix of Limestone and Sandstone, in Florentine Style

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
BUILT in 1924, the Florentine-style Federal Reserve Bank at 33 Liberty Street had long ago acquired an ancient-looking patina of black crust on its noble stones. When a yearlong facade cleaning was completed late this summer, it revealed a fascinating variety of coloration and pattern in the huge blocks of stone. In the last few weeks, after the attack of Sept. 11, the stones have had to be dusted off again.
 The Federal Reserve Bank, with its 12 regional divisions, was established in 1913 by a Congress wary of the growing concentration of giant banking interests and weary of the repeated bank panics of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which severely disrupted the economy. Benjamin Strong, who became the dominant force behind the Federal Reserve, originally opposed the regional system; he had favored a strong central bank. 
 Born in 1866, Strong had left school at 18. He worked as a clerk in finance in the 1890's and then moved to Bankers Trust Company after 1900. There he advised the financial titans George F. Baker and J. P. Morgan on which banks to save in the Panic of 1907. 
Strong was selected to head the new Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which because of geography already held a leadership role in the system. And Strong's effective, aggressive leadership on bank issues made him the de facto leader of the Federal Reserve System.
World War I increased the United States role in international finance, and by 1919 The New York Times reported that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had doubled its staff in the last year, to 2000. 
The bank had been using rented quarters, but in 1919 it held a competition for a new 14-story headquarters on the block bounded by Maiden Lane and Nassau, Liberty and William Streets. The Real Estate Record and Guide said that "no sensational type of building would be entertained by the bank." The submission by the firm of York & Sawyer took the prize. 
Starting in 1899, Edward York and Philip Sawyer had become the Northeast's specialists in bank design by infusing a sensuous quality into what are normally considered simply impressive buildings. Their design for the new Federal Reserve Bank of New York recalled the fortified Florentine palazzi of the Medici period in the Renaissance, with a deeply rusticated stone base banded by barred windows within pointed Florentine arches.
In 1929 the magazine Architecture quoted a young American who had come back from Europe marveling at everything he had seen except for one city. "Well, Florence didn't astound me so much," the anonymous American said jokingly. "Everywhere I looked I saw a building by York & Sawyer."
York & Sawyer also carefully mixed the stone on the facade, using both the traditional Indiana limestone and a richly mottled Ohio sandstone. The walls' meeting point with the sidewalk rises and falls on the irregular, hilly site like a ship on a pitching ocean. It is quite different from the usual rectilinear bank site, because each wall is alive with texture and movement. 
On the interior, the three-level gold vault was cut into raw stone, which itself was below the waterline, making a robbery attempt by tunneling unlikely; the vault doors each weighed 230 tons. The $500 million in gold then on deposit was also protected with listening devices to detect any drilling or cutting. Peter Bakstansky, a spokesman for the bank, said that the building now stores $63 billion in gold, almost all of it the reserves of foreign countries. 
In 1929 a writer for The Saturday Evening Post asked a guard outside the building what time it was; the guard grabbed the handle of his gun, directed the writer to a nearby sidewalk clock and instructed him to move on. 
THE Federal Reserve Bank could not at first gain control of the William Street end of the block, and bank construction went ahead without that portion, leaving an observable seam between the two sections when it was filled out in the mid-1920's.
In 1927 the critic Margaret Law, writing in the magazine Architecture, said the building had "a quality which, for lack of a better word, I can best describe as epic." The dignity of the building is enhanced with extensive ironwork, designed by Samuel Yellin.
Strong died in 1928, leaving a power vacuum at the Federal Reserve; although President Herbert Hoover blamed the severity of the Depression in part on Strong's aggressive efforts for European recovery in the 1920's, some analysts say that the Depression would not have lasted as long had Strong been alive to direct Federal Reserve efforts.
By the 1960's, airborne soil had given the building a striking checkerboard look. The Ohio sandstone, more porous than the limestone, became blackened, making the building appear almost black and white. Last year the Federal Reserve began a cleaning campaign, overseen by the architects Beyer Blinder Belle and the Turner Construction Company. 
Peter Mead, project superintendent for Turner, said that the cleaning had addressed both aesthetic and repair issues: with the soil off, the individual stones could be surveyed for damage. The work was finished this summer, and now the intermittent Ohio stone is freed of its black shroud, displaying exuberant whorls and eddies in the stone, swirling lines of whiskey brown in a matrix the color of heavy cream, as sensual as some exotic cheese or pate.
The only effect on the building since the destruction of the World Trade Center has been the continuing deposit of dust on ledges and stonework -- a filmy, stringy coating remains, although a fire hose has been used to clean some of it off.
The architectural pilgrim should not tarry too long: a recent admirer closely inspecting the newly cleaned stone was politely but firmly challenged by a guard, told to move along and to appreciate the facade from across the street.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Westchester; 
Office Vacancy Rate in County Continues to Climb

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
UNCERTAIN" is a word heard often these days in Westchester when real-estate professionals discuss the commercial real estate market.
 Brokers are trying to fathom whether the current office market is experiencing a downturn or a full-blown recession -- and whatever they call it, how long the market will continue to slide. Also, they are asking: is there any relief in sight? 
 "We're trying to figure out what's real and what's not real in terms of the market," said James C. Fagan, a senior managing director for the regional office in Stamford of CB Richard Ellis, the real estate services company. "And we're trying to decide where we go from here. How does one make logical plans for the future in an illogical world? It's not an easy thing to do." 
A hoped-for bump in Westchester's struggling office market -- from displaced companies relocating from New York City after Sept. 11 -- has not yet materialized, Salvatore J. Carrera, director of economic development and real estate for the county, said.
So far, just a few companies have leased space in Westchester since the attack on the World Trade Center. Among them is RBC Dominion Securities, the investment banking division of RBC Financial Group, formerly Royal Bank of Canada, which rented space in RiverView at Purchase. Mr. Carrera would not identify the others.
Most companies forced to relocate did so within New York City. "It's unpatriotic -- they can't just leave New York behind," Mr. Fagan said.
THE vacancy rate for Class A office space rose in the most recent quarter, both in the county as a whole and in the biggest commercial area, the White Plains central business district.
In the county, the vacancy rose to 14.6 percent at the end of the third quarter, from 13.1 percent the previous quarter and 12 percent at the end of the third quarter a year ago, according to figures from Insignia/ESG, another commercial real-estate services company. 
In downtown White Plains at the end of the third quarter, the vacancy rate was 21.1 percent, up from 18.9 percent at the end of the previous quarter and up from 15.6 at the end of the third quarter of 2000.
Westchester, which already has a number of vacant buildings waiting for tenants, was further burdened this fall with Texaco's addition to the market of its 775,000-square-foot headquarters on Westchester Avenue in White Plains, referred to as the county's "Platinum Mile" corridor. The strip earned that appellation in the 1980's when many Fortune 500 companies were located there.
Texaco put its 24-year-old, four-story glass and travertine marble headquarters -- along with 107 acres of land and a two-tiered underground parking garage for 1,400 cars -- up for sale as a result of its merger with Chevron. The new company, ChevronTexaco, is based in San Francisco. 
The large chunk of Texaco's space is not reflected in the third-quarter vacancy rate because the merger did not take place until October, and the company is still vacating the building. It is expected that the already increasing vacancy rate will spike when Texaco's departure is reflected in the end-of-the-year figures, said Kenneth Krasnow, regional managing director in Connecticut and Westchester for Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate services concern. 
"It means yet more space that needs to be absorbed in this market," Mr. Krasnow said.
In another troublesome sign, the amount of sublease space on the market has increased, reported Richard Rakow, owner of Rakow Commercial Realty Group in White Plains, which represents tenants. He said there is 7.3 million square feet of sublease space -- about 15 percent of all available office space -- on the market now. Last year at this time, there was 6.3 million square feet on the market, about 13.1 percent of all space available, Mr. Rakow said. 
SEVERAL years ago when leases came due, "tenants not only renewed them but grabbed whatever contiguous space they could," Mr. Rakow said. 
"Then, everyone was always thinking in terms of expansion," he explained. "Now, we're seeing tenants who aren't even using the space they have. Instead of looking for more space, they're seeking smaller quarters."
Reviewing the past 18 months, Mr. Krasnow of Cushman & Wakefield described the office market as "very active" in 2000, in large part from business generated by dot-coms and "coming back to earth" during the first part of this year.
"Then Sept. 11 changed the landscape dramatically," he said. "Companies that were in an uncertain position before then, like telecommunications firms, are even more uncertain now, although the bread-and-butter market is still doing fine."
The latter, he explained, are service-oriented enterprises, like marketing companies, law firms and accountants. Those small and midsized businesses are considered by most brokers to be the mainstay of Westchester's office market, fueling the growth from within.
Mr. Carrera said the county could no longer rely solely on the types of large companies that populated the Platinum Mile and other top corporate addresses in Westchester during the 1980's and early 1990's to support the office market, because if they downsize, it sends severe shock waves through the economy. He said Westchester's future economic health depended on a diversified base.
Looking ahead, Mr. Krasnow observed that even if some growth comes to Westchester from large New York City companies, it will probably be in the form of regional offices.
Judging from inquiries he has been receiving from Manhattan-based companies, Mr. Carrera said: "Westchester is high on the radar screen for satellite offices. I expect we'll see some definite activity later this year or early next year."
At Insignia/ESG, Dean J. Shapiro, the executive director of the company's Westchester-Fairfield office, said some satellite offices may take the shape of disaster recovery centers -- empty of people but equipped with phones and computers for emergencies.
"There is a fear among a number of companies of overcentralization and of not having backup resources," Mr. Shapiro explained.
For now, the market seems to be in a pause, he said, adding, "There's a lot of confusion and apprehension, and when we see that, we also often see a lack of decision-making."
IF companies from New York City decide to relocate at least some of their resources to Westchester, the following are some larger properties that brokers are showing them in addition to Texaco's building:
*Westchester One: a 850,000-square-foot building at 44 South Broadway in White Plains with 450,000 square feet available. The 30-year-old black glass structure currently houses Oxford Health and I.B.M.
*445 Hamilton Avenue, White Plains: a 320,000-square-foot building owned and partially occupied by MetLife, the giant insurer. Built in the late 1960's and occupied from mid 1980's until the late 1990's by Prodigy, it has 260,000 square feet available.
*333 Westchester Avenue, White Plains: There is 500,000 square feet in four connected buildings available in the former Kraft General Foods Building. The complex at North Street and Westchester Avenue became empty in July 1997 and has since started to add tenants. 
*900 King Street, Rye Brook, a former I.B.M. building that has been empty since the early 1990's. It is a three-story, 201,460-square-foot structure on a 17-acre campus.
*The Mount Pleasant Executive Center, a 383,000-square-foot building that was a former I.B.M. data center.

For Some Companies, a Post-Sept. 11 Surge

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
THE terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 took thousands of American lives and helped push the economy toward a recession, bringing a number of companies to the brink of bankruptcy. At the same time, the attacks have provided an economic opportunity for others by creating a sense of urgency for products and services that could reassure a public suddenly preoccupied with bioterrorism, information security and personal safety.
 Some companies found that the attacks primed demand for products and services that had long been available. Others hastened to introduce new products and new services or reposition what they have always made or done in a new post-Sept. 11 light. 
 Among the businesses that have benefited in this new security-conscious environment are aviation engineering companies, disaster recovery concerns, industrial filtration manufacturers, security-system designers, wireless technology companies, biotechnologists, information technology experts and a host of others. 
Tom Roslak, the senior director of what Symbol Technologies of Holtsville calls its Security Initiative, said that Symbol, the wireless technology company best known for its hand-held bar-code scanners, had been upgrading wireless systems already in place to bolster security in airports, hospitals, schools and post offices. 
Two airlines, American and Delta, are currently testing a Symbol system that stores an encrypted photograph of a passenger's face in what the company calls a portable data file, essentially a series of different-sized bars. Advocates of wireless technology contend that the system is less vulnerable to disruption than wired systems dependent on pipes or cables and less a threat to personal liberties than systems that accumulate information about an individual in a centralized location. 
As is ever the case, marketers on Long Island and elsewhere are aggressively touting the benefits of using their products, but they are moving forward cautiously lest they be accused of exploiting a tragedy. 
But moving forward they are.
Last month, Michael O'Reilly, an environmental disaster specialist, sent a cleanup crew to decontaminate Governor Pataki's office in Midtown Manhattan after a room there tested positive for anthrax. It was the third anthrax job his company, Trade-Winds Environmental Restoration of Bay Shore, handled that week.
The company, which in normal times does routine chemical cleanups, was already in "disaster response" mode when the anthrax scare hit. Mr. O'Reilly had tripled his work force to 600 people on Sept. 11, responding to calls from clients, and kept on many of the new workers to respond to the subsequent anthrax threats. Sure, he's making money, but Mr. O'Reilly is hardly crowing about it. 
"I'm nearly exhausted," he said.
Brian Gertler, an information systems specialist at Leslie Digital Imaging's office in Hauppauge, said the anthrax scare had heightened interest in his scanners. Mail can be opened at a safe, remote location and digitally scanned; clients can then read it on their computer screens. 
"Now," he said, "I'm getting three times the number of call-backs I was before," Mr. Gertler said. 
Law firms, too, have gotten into the act. Ruskin, Moscou, Evans & Faltischek in Uniondale is now developing a security audit service aimed at the corporate and municipal markets. Wayne Kaplan, the lawyer there who is spearheading the project, said the service would help clients determine exactly how vulnerable their businesses are, whether the threat comes from natural disaster or human attack. A price for the service has not yet been determined.
Dr. Yacov Shamash, the dean of College of Engineering and Applied Sciences and of the Harriman School for Management and Policy at the State University at Stony Brook, said that a number of the Island's high-technology companies have already introduced products and that more will do so in the weeks and months to come.
Successful ventures will, in many cases, be the results of collaboration, Dr. Shamash said, reflecting partnerships that local business leaders are encouraging between companies and institutions. 
"Long Island isn't going to produce the tanks and airplanes to fight this war," he said. "We are going to produce the sensors, the avionics and the wireless telecommunications products that will be needed to fight it. There is no region in the country better suited to doing this than we are."
Peter D. Rettaliata, an aviation executive in Bay Shore, predicted that many Long Island companies would be bidding for military contracts in the fight against terrorism, reversing a pattern that has existed for a generation.
"Long Island aerospace companies grew up at a time when they could depend on local contractors like Grumman and Republic, and they did very well servicing these companies," said Mr. Rettaliata, the president of the Air Industries Machining Corporation and the chairman of the Aerospace & Defense Diversification Alliance in Peacetime Transition, an industry group known as Addapt. The alliance, he said, has helped more than 100 Long Island aviation companies, many of them dependent on military orders, to succeed in the commercial aviation market.
Now, he said, the financial crisis that currently grips the nation's commercial aviation industry means that local companies will need to replace revenues from that sector. He anticipates that the region will lose about a quarter of its revenues from commercial aviation but that it will make up the deficit through new military contracts.
"What has changed since Sept. 11 is that the focus of our members will probably be more toward defense because of the budget increases that seem to be occurring," Mr. Rettaliata said.
Already, shifts in aviation spending are reverberating on Long Island. Scott Abrams, the president of the Omnicon Group in Hauppauge, an engineering company specializing in aviation, said that the current national preoccupation with security systems for airplane cockpits has turned into a sudden source of new business.
"People would like to put in a cockpit door that stays locked, but you just can't do that," Mr. Abrams said. "If there's an incident in the passenger compartment, the plane instantly depressurizes and the cockpit door has to pop open," he said, to prevent an implosion. 
"There are real problems if that doesn't happen," he said. "So the solution has to be more sophisticated than some people realize."
Along with this new business, he said that he was also getting calls from customers who say they are now short-handed. "Everybody in aviation is cutting back," he said, "and they no longer have the manpower or resources to complete the design process of the projects they've got on the table. So they call us and see if we can act as their SWAT team."
Last month, the Long Island Association convened the first meeting of the Defense Industry Council, some 35 military contractors handpicked by the association's president, Matthew L. Crosson. At the council's first meeting, executives from such companies as BAE Systems, EDO, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Telephonics, GSE Dynamics and IMS sat down for a face-to-face session with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the chairman of the Senate's Armed Services Committee, has agreed to meet with the group, but no date has been set. 
The purpose is to connect the region's leading defense contractors with the people in Congress who make, or who influence, procurement decisions. 
"On the positive side, there is some possibility that certain companies in defense may benefit" from the post-Sept. 11 environment, Mr. Crosson said.
"Beyond that," he added, "it is highly speculative to say that specific areas of Long Island's economy will benefit from the new circumstances."

HEADLINE: For Latin Dancing, Follow the Beat and the Crowd 

BYLINE:  By MARC FERRIS 

 BODY:
FIVE years ago, Eddie Perez moved from the Bronx to Stamford and was surprised to find such a pronounced Hispanic presence in his new neighborhood.
 "In the Bronx, people think that Connecticut is a whole other country," he said. "They think it is the country. I never realized that there were so many Latinos up here until I moved here. I said, 'Wait a minute, there's something happening up here.' " 
 Census figures support his perception. In the last decade, the Hispanic population almost doubled in Stamford (to more than 19,000) and in Norwalk (nearly 13,000). Danbury's Hispanic population more than doubled (11,000-plus).
In New Haven, 21 percent of the residents are Hispanic, as is almost a third of Bridgeport's population. Those figures do not factor in the numbers of Brazilians, who speak Portuguese but whose cultural traditions are counted as Latino.
The population rise, added to the success of pop stars like Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez, has helped increase interest in Latin dancing in local night spots.
That phenomenon has enabled Mr. Perez to quit his job in publishing and work full time at his first love, salsa dancing, which he teaches in several clubs.
"My students come from all walks of life," he said. "I've got Russians, Romanians, Hungarians and Jewish students, who range from age 12 to 70. It's all about fun. It's not like ballroom, which is all serious.
"It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or a professional. All levels dance with each other. You never stop learning new moves."
One of the most elegant places to dance to a Latin groove is at the Terrace Club in Stamford, which has held a Latin night for two years.
"At first we drew 100 people, now we get four or five times that many," said Chris Donahue, a co-owner, who contends the club has the biggest dance floor between New York and Boston. "There are a lot of little cafes, but none of the big clubs cater to Latinos. People who come in appreciate the place and respect it. We've definitely found our niche for Saturday night."
Before the crowds show up around 11 p.m., Mr. Perez teaches a beginner salsa class. After his lesson, he holds court at a prominently placed table between dances.
Several of Mr. Perez's students first dabbled with ballroom styles.
"My wife and I took six or seven ballroom lessons that covered several different dances, but we didn't learn anything," Michael Saunders of Westport said. "With salsa, we concentrate on one dance and you really feel the beat in your gut. It's more sensual.
"It brings couples together, and also crosses a lot of social and economic boundaries. We've taken lessons with rich, poor, black, white, Chinese, young, old and all different types in between. You don't get that with ballroom."
Initially, Andrew Ilowitz, a Weston doctor, was cool to salsa steps. Now he is a self-proclaimed "salsa Jew" and is conducting beginner classes under the auspices of Mr. Perez.
"I like to do things well and I wasn't good when I started, but over a period of time, I surrendered and began to focus on the beat," he said. "Then it just clicked and I realized I could do it."
For Mr. Ilowitz, who enjoys skiing, rock climbing and mountain biking, salsa dancing is more than just a night out.
"When I hear that beat, it makes me nuts," he said. "I can't sit still. It's infectious. It offers a lot of sensory stimuli that's pretty potent. The nonverbal communication is so outrageous.
"Some people have problems articulating through words, but when you're out on the floor you could be with a perfect stranger from a different part of the world, yet you can come together through a certain set of rhythms and notes. It fits well with my other interests. I've got an adrenaline jones."
The Latin theme is so popular at the Terrace Club that it began to offer Brazilian nights on Fridays. The club's smaller sibling, the Next Door Cafe, which caters to a younger, less formal crowd, offers Latin night on Fridays and Brazilian night on Saturdays.
Other spots that move to a Latin groove include El Dorado in Norwalk and Mambo Cafe in Danbury. 
In New Haven, VanDome is a sophisticated place that has attracted a diverse crowd for six years. It focuses on the four most popular styles of Latin club music: salsa, merengue, bachata and cumbia.
"They play great music and try to capture the elegance of a supper club," said Cynthia Richtman, who teaches Latin steps at Dance Dimensions in Norwalk and often visits VanDome with her students.
In the cozy main room, spectators sit at tables or stand around the worn wooden dance floor. Since it is in an industrial area, and traffic on I-91 thrums just outside the back door, the club has an outdoor area with a separate disc jockey and offers Latin barbecue.
"We've always been Latin, we're not jumping on any bandwagon," said Nando Colon, the club's general manager. "When we started we had 10 people show up, and then the word got out. There's been quite a craze lately, though, after Ricky Martin brought it out, but not so much with the Latin market as with the American market. We get about 60 percent Latinos in here and the rest is mixed."
Coupled with the rising number of Latinos, salsa's crossover appeal suggests that the broad appeal of Latin music and dance is more than just a fad.
Janice Mahinka, who lives in Danbury and got her introduction to salsa dancing at the Mambo Cafe two and a half years ago, now teaches salsa steps in adult education programs and studies the music's history.
"Latin dancing gives you a chance to be one with your body," she said. "You can make mistakes; it's no big deal. You get to sweat and that's good. It's about being human in the purest sense."
A Latin beat can be heard at: The Terrace Club, 1938 West Main Street, Stamford, (203) 961-9770; Next Door Cafe, 1990 West Main Street, Stamford, (203) 316-8101; El Dorado, 24 Isaacs Street, Norwalk, (203) 299-0083; Mambo Cafe, 40 Elm Street, Danbury, (203) 790-1766; VanDome, 102 Hamilton Street, New Haven, (203) 789-2066.

HEADLINE: Islip Puts Huge Fee on Late-Night Flights 

BYLINE:  By PETER BOODY 

DATELINE: ISLIP 

 BODY:
AS air travel boomed in recent years, Islip's Town Board welcomed increased jet service at the town-owned Long Island MacArthur Airport as an economic boon and a convenience for most residents. When Southwest Airlines arrived in 1998 and steadily expanded service, neighbors who complained about all the noise got something close to a cold shoulder in Town Hall.
 So pilots, airport operators and the Federal Aviation Administration were astonished in September when the Town Board voted to impose a huge fee -- $50,000 -- on any plane landing at or taking off from MacArthur after 11 p.m. and before 6:30 a.m. 
 "It's as if they had no idea what the rules are," said Jeffrey Gilley, who oversees airport issues for the National Business Aviation Association, which lobbies for corporate operators. He said the fee violated federal rules requiring extensive cost-benefit studies before municipalities can restrict access to airports. 
"It's ridiculous," said John Fiore, a captain with AOL-Time Warner's three-jet corporate fleet based at the airport. Mr. Fiore said AOL-Time Warner had been juggling crews, airplanes and passengers ever since the fee was imposed to avoid it.
The $50,000 charge was unanimously adopted Sept. 10 and was supposed to go into effect in a matter of days. It's probably the highest fee ever legislated for any airport in the country, according to the business aviation group's Mr. Gilley.
"There are a number of airports that have imposed fees in the $500, even $1,000 range, and some operators might be able to absorb that," he said. "But I think the Town of Islip wanted to make it so onerous that it would scare off everybody" who wanted to use the airport at night.
Until the new measure, there was never a charge for light single- or twin-engine private planes landing or taking off from MacArthur, and commercial flights were charged according to weight -- about $130 for a Boeing 737, the kind of plane Southwest flies.
"I think the F.A.A.'s concern," he added, "is that Islip is attempting to make an end run around the federal requirements," which also mandate "fair and reasonable terms without unjust discrimination against users" of airports supported by F.A.A. grants, as MacArthur has been. 
Despite all the sound and fury, the fee so far is not being enforced, according to Trish Pasciutti, a spokeswoman for the town, and won't be "until we feel it's appropriate to do so." She referred further questions to the town supervisor, Peter McGowan, who did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Residents of nearby communities who have been complaining about the increased noise emanating from the airport might be expected to applaud the new fee. But last week, Deborah Slinkosky of the Committee for the Enforcement of MacArthur Airport Control, a civic group that fights airport noise, said the fee was just a political prop signifying nothing more than pre-Election Day saber-rattling and posturing.
Mrs. Slinkosky said the town had had an ordinance on the books for years that bars noisy arrivals and departures, but has never enforced it. She asserted that the new fee was just for show to make the Republican-controlled Town Board look responsive as two Republican councilmen sought re-election. The councilmen, Christopher Bodkin and Brian Ferrugiari, won easily on Tuesday.
Mrs. Slinkosky complained that until the slump in air travel after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, Islip area residents had been suffering with increased jet noise as airlines boosted service at Islip to meet rising demand. But she blamed noisy off-hour departures on "Learjets leaving at 4 a.m. so they could tee off down in Florida at 6 a.m."
Told of Mrs. Slinkosky's remarks about boorish high rollers, Mr. Fiore of AOL-Time Warner said: "We don't do that. These airplanes are used for business. They are people being moved for meetings and doing business all over the world."
Small single-engine and twin-engine prop airplanes, which keep Islip busy even when there's a lull in jet traffic, don't bother her at all, Mrs. Slinkosky said. The $50,000 surcharge fee applies to all aircraft, however, even a two-seat Cessna, so the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the national organization of general aviation, is aggressively pushing the F.A.A. to crack down on the town.
"At our end of aviation there's usually not a noise problem," said Warren Morningstar, a spokesman for the group. "With a typical general aviation airplane, it's making less noise than the neighbor's lawn mower once it's climbing above the airport fence." Even most modern jets conform to the town's ordinance on aircraft noise, he added.
Less than a year ago Mr. McGowan rejected Ms. Slinkosky's demand that the town adopt a "homeowner's bill of rights" that would include a night curfew on airport takeoffs and landings, although he did agree then to talk to the F.A.A. about halting private flights late at night.
Mr. McGowan considers the airport "Islip's crown jewel," Ms. Slinkosky said. Operations there have soared during his term and he favors its continuing expansion, she said.
There are no scheduled airline flights at MacArthur between 11 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. A spokeswoman for Southwest Airlines said the surcharge had no effect on the airline's operations. Even if a flight arrives after 11 p.m., the ordinance imposing the $50,000 fee includes an exemption for late arrivals due to traffic and weather delays, she noted.
The business aviation lobby and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association have asked the F.A.A. to investigate the legality of Islip's $50,000 surcharge. In early October, the F.A.A.'s deputy associate administrator of airports, Paul Galis, wrote Mr. McGowan warning that the fee violates the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 by restricting access to the airport for all airplanes, "regardless of their noise emissions." Mr. Galis asked the town to send him a written promise that it would either rescind the fee or agree never to enforce it.
The town attorney, Vincent J. Messina Jr., answered with a letter on Oct. 12 pointing out technical errors he had found in Mr. Galis's letter and demanding "a clear, unequivocal determination of the F.A.A.'s position."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Manhattan; 
Amid Uncertainty, Few Office Buildings Are for Sale

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
OWNERS of office buildings think their properties are still worth what they were before the attack on the World Trade Center, many real estate executives say. But prospective buyers think that a slowing economy and the aftereffects of Sept. 11 have reduced those values. The resulting disconnect means that few properties in New York are changing hands or are even for sale.
 "Nobody knows what's going on; there is a lot of confusion out there," said Scott R. Latham, a senior vice president at CB Richard Ellis, the brokerage and services company. Nevertheless, he said, there has been a great deal of interest in one of the few properties on the market, the 1 million square foot building at 450 Lexington Avenue at 45th Street. He said buyers are interested despite the building's having a large Post Office branch, and its location adjacent to the landmark Grand Central Terminal, both seen as drawbacks since the attack. 
 The marketplace uncertainties have multiple sources. Office rental rates are the economic underpinning of the sale prices of buildings, but the outlook for rental rates is unclear, the executives say. The attack removed 13.5 million square feet of space from the market, but 6 million square feet of sublet space became available within weeks of the event, leading some to wonder if the space needs of companies displaced from downtown have been satisfied, particularly since many have relocated at least parts of their operations to New Jersey and other suburban markets.
"There is a lot of concern about rents relaxing, but with very little leasing velocity it is hard to tell where rents are going," said Warren M. Heller, a managing director at Jones Lang LaSalle, the brokerage and services company.
Interest rates are down to near record lows, which would seem to promote sales, since borrowers have to pay less for money to make an acquisition. But those same low interest rates give owners an incentive to hold out for a top price, since they have the option of pulling cash out of a property by refinancing. This strategy allows an owner to liquidate much of the gain in the value of a building in a tax-free manner while still retaining the property.
Another uncertainty involves possible incentives that the city and state governments may devise to repair the damage downtown and to lure tenants back to the area. According to a recent report by Williams Real Estate, officials are "considering a package of incentives that will bridge the gap between the approximately $30 to $50 a square foot rental rate tenants were paying before the attack and the $70 to $80 a square foot developers will need to cover the cost of construction in Manhattan."
Since Sept. 11, "it has become more complicated to buy office buildings," said Adam I. Popper, an executive of Tishman Speyer Properties, an investment and management company. "There is a big spread between the bid and asked price, and we are not seeing many transactions."
Despite the current lack of willing sellers, he said, Tishman Speyer expects to find investment opportunities in the United States as conditions become clearer. He said the company is raising a fifth investment fund of $600 million for use in acquisitions over the next several years. The original intent was to balance the investments evenly between domestic and international properties, he said, but now the balance is likely to be $400 million in the United States and $200 million internationally.
A lot of property changed hands or was financially restructured before Sept 11, noted Darcy Stacom, an executive vice president at Cushman & Wakefield, the brokerage and services company. "In a typical year there is about $6 billion in sales volume," she said. "We had already done $9 billion this year, although that comes down if you take out Rockefeller Center and the World Trade Center."
Rockefeller Center was sold to a group led by Jerry I. Speyer for $1.85 billion, and Larry A. Silverstein and a group of investors paid $3.2 billion for a 99-year lease on the twin towers. 
One reason for the current lack of sales is that owners are not sure what to do with the proceeds of a sale, Ms. Stacom said. "People do not know what to buy, even if it is a tax-free exchange."
THE continuing decline in interest rates -- the Federal Reserve cut its federal funds rate to 2 percent last week, a level not seen since the early 1960's -- may induce banks to lower their rates and prompt more refinancings, she said. "A lot of lenders have had interest rate floors -- they would not go below 7 percent," Ms. Stacom said. "Now they may go to 6.5 or 6 percent.
"But we may see a tightening of underwriting standards at the same time, with lenders projecting only flat rents," she added, noting that lowered rent assumptions would tend to reduce the value of buildings. 
The issue of the real post-Sept. 11 value of properties has become so uncertain that professional appraisers are being urged by their trade association, the Appraisal Institute, to attach a note to their reports saying the numbers do not include the effects of the attack.
"The appraisal process is retroactive," said Kevin Nunnink, chairman of Integra Realty Resources, a company specializing in appraisals. "Until we have enough post 9-11 data, nobody knows what the impact was."
He described the current period as "a temporary lull, with the bid and asked prices still apart." He said, "The lowest interest rates in 50 years" will trigger a buying boom starting early next year that will close the gap as buyers use cheap money to pay full price.
"There has not been an opportunity like this since the R.T.C.," he said, referring to the Resolution Trust Corporation, which disposed of properties controlled by failed thrift institutions at what are now thought to be low prices.
In the meantime, many building owners are reluctant to offer their properties for sale out of a concern that low bids in the current environment will depress the value in the future, said Peter Hauspurg, chairman of Eastern Consolidated Properties, a sales and financing company. "The office category is not trading," he said. "There are only eight buildings on the market in Manhattan."
That helps to explain the interest in buildings like 450 Lexington, said Ron Cohen, an executive managing director of Insignia/ESG, the brokerage and services company. "There is so little on the market that whatever becomes available attracts a lot of interest," he said. But banks have become more conservative in the post-attack environment, making it difficult to conclude sales, said Richard Baxter, also an executive managing director at Insignia. "Lenders that would do 75 to 80 percent loan-to-value deals formerly are now at 65 to 70 percent," he said. 
Mr. Hauspurg said there is a "general perception" on the part of buyers that there should be a discount on pre-Sept. 11 prices, but prospective sellers have not been willing to offer their buildings to bidding by multiple prospective buyers at this time. "Rather than go out into the market, some owners are trying to do private transactions, which we love to arrange," he said.
Prospective buyers and sellers are also waiting to see what kind of government incentive package will be offered for downtown, said Dov Hertz, a vice president of Lawrence Group, a brokerage and management company. 
"Everyone is waiting to see what the incentives will be," he said. "That's why buyers are not buying. They want to see the upside."
"Public-private partnerships will be important to the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan," said Norman Livingston, an executive vice president of Grubb & Ellis, a brokerage and services company.
He said that many usual investors in real estate have paused in making purchases until incentives are in place and the trend of the market is clearer. "Pension funds are on the sidelines now, and opportunity funds are finding less compelling opportunities," he said.
But he said gyrations in the stock market may prompt a wave of selling next year as the funds seek to rebalance their portfolios. "Because of the decline in some stock prices, funds that allocated 10 percent to real estate may now have 15 percent," Mr. Livingston said. "We can look for them to start selling next year because they need to monetize those properties."

HEADLINE: Postings: 1920's Building Between 43rd and 44th to Be Filled In; 
Facelift for Madison Ave. Block

BYLINE:  By Rachelle Garbarine 

 BODY:
The owner of a mostly vacant beige brick 1920's office building on Madison Avenue near Grand Central Terminal is planning a renovation that will give it a blocklong glass facade and add 50,000 square feet to the 650,000-square-foot E-shaped structure.
 Interior demolition recently started on portions of the 22-story building, which has a midblock section that stretches from 43rd to 44th Streets. As part of the $50 million renovation, the building will change its address to 340 Madison Avenue, from 342. The existing 25 tenants have been relocated to 75,000 square feet on the tower's top floors. 
 The reconstruction, expected to take 13 months, is subject to approvals from the City Planning Commission and the Board of Standards and Appeals because it involves the transfer of development rights from several low buildings on 43rd and 44th Streets, according to Macklowe Properties of Manhattan, the developer. 
William S. Macklowe, the company's executive vice president, said he was hoping to get the necessary approvals by the end of the year.
When Macklowe Properties bought the Madison Avenue building in late 1998 the structure was 60 percent occupied, mainly by small tenants because of its irregularly shaped floors of 23,000 to 30,000 square feet each.
Mr. Macklowe said he never wavered from turning it "into a modern building with big efficient floors" because there was and still is a demand for such space.
Asking rents are to be about $65 a square foot.
Mary Ann Tighe, vice chairwoman of Insignia/ESG, the building's leasing agent, said the additional space "is what Midtown needs because of the rapid absorption of space by downtown tenants displaced by the Sept. 11 attack." 
The developer has secured financing from Deutsche Bank, bought out some leases and let others run out. Leases for the 25 remaining tenants expire in three to four years. 
The developer plans to use the development rights, or air rights, to fill in the hollow portion of the E-shaped building formed by the pair of two- and three-story structures -- holdouts from the time the surrounding edifice was built in the 1920's. Filling in that space to the 17th floor, where the tower sets back, would create the 50,000 square feet of new space as well as larger floors of 28,000 to 39,000 square feet each. 
The architects for the renovation are Gensler and Moed de Armas & Shannon. RACHELLE GARBARINE

HEADLINE: MY MONEY, MY LIFE; 
Goodat Her Job, She Walked Away

 BODY:
HELLO?" A tentative voice answered the phone. 
 "Good morning, ma'am," I said. "This is Michelle from the bank, and I'm just calling to find out why you decided to give up your platinum card." 
 "Well," the voice stammered, "you charged me late fees when I was only late once in 10 years, and then you all were rude to me on the phone."
"Did we do that?" my voice sounded shocked, although I was not in the slightest. I proceeded to clean up the damage. 
"Oh my goodness," I continued, "the computer says that we did do that, and I am just so sorry. Let me fix that for you, and tell you what, between you and me, I'll drop your interest rate to 2.9 percent. Would that help you decide to take the card back?"
Got her! I checked her off my list and signed her up.
You bet I could do that. I could do just about anything if it meant the person on the other end of the phone would take back the credit card. 
All day long, I would talk to people who had given up their credit cards in a noble effort to whittle down their debt or because they were angered by customer service or just had enough cards already. They were people with medical bills or with college tuition payments, but none of this mattered to me because I had one goal in mind: to sign them back up. That was my sole duty. I was a customer retentionist.
Of course, I didn't start out wanting to sell people things they had already given up, but after a long stint of bartending and cleaning houses, a "corporate job" seemed like a good idea. There were benefits for me and my children -- steady hours and steady paychecks.
Since college, I had more or less subscribed to the if-it's-not-fun-don't-do-it school of job placement. In an effort to find that one true calling, I had held many jobs: nursing assistant, Ben & Jerry's tour guide, weed puller, baby sitter, restaurant owner. I even attended nursing school briefly. Through every single job, one thought stood out in my mind: How can I do this every day for the next 30 years? I could never resolve that part in my head. 
In fact, reading the Sunday newspaper has become a fantastic experience for me. It not only gives me a look into the world, it allows me to envision whole new lives for myself. Flipping through the help-wanted ads, I can see the choices: marine biologist, teacher, bartender, computer specialist, waitress, engineer. And while it does occur to me that I am only qualified for a couple of these positions, the possibilities seem endless. 
So the possibilities seemed very real a few years ago when I read: "Wanted: friendly people to help large credit card company. Excellent pay and benefits." I got the job, and unfortunately for debt-ridden Americans, I became quite good at it. 
Then came that particularly ruthless call involving a woman who had given up her card because of her medical bills. After a nice conversation during which I was only half listening because I was waiting for my opening to sell her back her card, she told me that ever since she had been found to have inoperable cancer she had been trying to reduce the debt she would leave behind. 
I was about to regale this poor woman with a tale of a lower interest rate intended to make her debt load easier when I caught myself. I told her that she certainly didn't need this card or any other. I also confided that I didn't even have a credit card, and then we spent much of the rest of my shift talking about the evils of credit card companies. 
Big Brother taped every call, so I was sure that this one was on the top of the agenda for the next staff meeting. But it didn't matter; I called in sick the next day and never went back. 
Corporations are funny. Even though I had been promoted three times in as many months, no one seemed to notice that I was gone. How do I know? They kept paying me three months after I left. Every other week another paycheck would be deposited in my bank account. I called and told the people at the credit card company, but they told me I was wrong, that that couldn't possibly be happening. So I kept the money and was blissfully jobless for a few months. 
Then I was at my parents' house reading the Sunday paper when I saw it: "Looking for an exciting career?"
Always!

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
One View Of Fallout Over Ending Long Bonds

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
THANKS to the Federal Reserve, since January, the cost of servicing short-term debt has been dropping.
 On Halloween, the Treasury Department unexpectedly got into the act when it said that it would discontinue sales of its benchmark 30-year bonds. Long-term interest rates, which had been on the sticky side all year, fell sharply after the announcement. 
 John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's, spoke about the implications of the Treasury's action. Following are excerpts: 

Q. Why were financial markets surprised by the Treasury's decision to eliminate the 30-year bond?

A. There had been an expectation the Treasury would stick to plans to cut back on the supply of 30-year bonds, but investors had all but given up on that because expectations of federal budget deficits had supplanted earlier expectations of budget surpluses.

Q. Was the Treasury's decision a smart thing to do in a longer-term sense?

A. This is going to make it more difficult for investors who want some certainty, looking ahead 10 years to 20 years to find a low-risk, long-duration investment.
Insurance companies will have a more difficult time matching their long-term liabilities with risk-free bonds. And getting rid of the 30-year bond makes the capital markets less efficient at longer maturity levels. For example, we have seen few if any new 20-year to 30-year corporate bonds since this was announced. Going forward, what is the representative benchmark going to be? 
Finally, it could well be the government is not minimizing interest costs over time by doing this, especially if current dosages of monetary and fiscal stimulus rouse the economy from its current slump. It may well be, for instance, that a year from now yields on 10-year Treasuries, currently at 4.25 percent, will be higher than the 4.85 percent 30-year bond yield. 

Q. The credit markets did pretty well before 1977 when the Treasury Department began issuing 30-year bonds. What is different now?

A. Prior to 1977, we had a good deal of long-term corporate bond issuance. At that point you could use long-term corporates as a proxy for very low-risk instruments. But since then we have lost so many AAA-rated corporate bonds, and debt protection measures are not as strong as they were in the 1950's and 1960's.

Q. The Fed, and now the Treasury, are trying to stimulate the economy by driving down borrowing costs. Is it working?

A. Corporate bond issuance will be a record this year. In October, $74 billion of investment grade bonds were issued, as well as $5 billion in high-yield debt. In September, the total was $43 billion in investment grade debt, and $1.5 billion in high-yield debt. But remember the markets were closed for a week.
The Treasury made its announcement on Oct. 31, and through Nov. 7, $13.85 billion of investment grade debt had been issued, and another $1.2 billion in high-yield debt. 
The large majority of this activity is refinancing. In addition, year to date we have had a better than 200 percent increase in early redemptions of outstanding corporate bonds.

Q. Have lower rates affected households?

A. The decline in mortgage rates has been incredible. Year to date, applications for mortgage refinancings are up more than 500 percent.
The last time we had mortgage refinancings jump like this was in 1998, and consumer spending in 1999 and 2000 was very strong. In late 1998, you might recall, there was a lot of worry about what would happen to the economy in 1999. As it turned out, the economy grew at nearly twice the rate that was anticipated. In part, that was due to the delayed benefits from what was a record pace of mortgage refinancings. 
I'm not saying we are going to have a replay in 2002, but it could provide valuable support for consumer spending next year and help bring about a better than anticipated showing by the economy over all. 

Q. Is there a danger that Congress will produce a fiscal package that overheats the economy?

A. With unemployment rising and the capacity utilization rate at 75 percent and falling, it is hard to fear overheating. But I would be willing to bet a year from now we will be talking about a tightening of monetary policy as opposed to an easing or neutral monetary policy.

Q. What are the odds that the Treasury will be back in the 30-year bond business within the next three to five years?

A. I think there is a 60 percent chance the Treasury will be back issuing 30-year bonds in that time frame. But faces change quite frequently in Washington, so I don't know if that would have a long-term impact on the credibility of those who manage the funding of United States government debt.

HEADLINE: Tested 

BYLINE:  By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
ADRIAN BRIDGES was frowning.
 Even though Adrian, a Harlem eighth grader, sat in the social studies class of his favorite teacher, Mr. Crump, everyone saw that he wasn't happy. At the start of class, Mr. Crump, a fast-talking disciplinarian, stood at the front of a classroom whose blue walls glowed as bright as some of his students' faces and announced that everyone had a clean slate. 
 Some of the students at Roberto Clemente Intermediate School smiled. But Adrian sat silent in the front row, staring straight ahead, refusing to raise his hand. Despite his resolve to study three hours a night, he had found out that he had flunked a quiz on the Fourth Amendment.
But it wasn't just failing the quiz that bothered him, Adrian, a slim 14-year-old with corn-rowed braids, said later. Part of it was the intense pressure he feels each day in this, his last year before high school. He knows that every grade, every test score, will help decide whether he is admitted to the city high school he wants to go to. Roberto Clemente, also known as I.S. 195, in Community School District 5, is one of the lowest-performing districts in the city. 
This spring, like most of the 69,000 other eighth graders in the city, Adrian will take exams in social studies, math, reading and science that will significantly shape his future. The stakes are high. Like thousands of other students across the city, he did not do well on the sixth-grade math and reading exams at his former school, P.S. 125. Then last year he failed both his math and reading exams at Clemente, which landed him in summer school.
"It's pressure," Adrian said in a low voice after Mr. Crump's class. "I want to work hard. I just want to have money. Money and a good job. After that, a couple of kids."
For parents negotiating the New York school system, one of the hardest things to face is the possibility that their children will never learn to read or do math well enough to succeed in school or in life. By the time their children are in eighth grade, poised to enter high school, perhaps just four years away from college, they know that trouble reading, especially, can mean a limited life.
But test scores released last month showed that last spring, for the third straight year since state and city school officials set tougher standards, most of the city's eighth graders failed the annual math and reading exams. Broadly, the tests are scored from 1 to 4; state education officials consider 3 and 4 passing. Fully 77 percent of the city's eighth graders failed to meet math standards, and 67 percent didn't meet reading standards. At Roberto Clemente, the figures were much bleaker: only 9.8 percent of the 405 eighth graders who took the state reading test passed. Other schools had a lower percentage of students, but Clemente had the largest number of students scoring so low. Just 5.3 percent of the school's eighth graders passed the math test.
It's easy in this city to consider education solely in terms of numbers -- the state exams encourage that -- but there are human faces behind every test score: faces of students, teachers, administrators. Students like Adrian Bridges.
One recent night, Adrian, collar loose and cuffs unbuttoned, sat hunched in a wooden chair in his family's tidy, modest apartment that is home to eight children, his notebook balanced on his knees. He looked grim and focused as he did his homework, even with a television murmuring barely a foot away.
Adrian's mother, Brenda Reddick, admitted that it was hard for him to share a bedroom with three brothers, and that the apartment could be noisy. Adrian is the second oldest of the brothers and sisters, who are 2 to 19 years old. But she doesn't want to make excuses for her son.
"It scares me," said Ms. Reddick, 41, her braided hair pulled into a ponytail, as she sat in her living room a few blocks from her son's school. "If he gets held back, he's going to lose interest. If he goes to a school he doesn't want to go to, he may drop out. I tell all my kids, as long as they live here they have to at least finish high school.
"I'm really hoping he pulls up his grade-point average and goes to a good school. Once they get discouraged, the streets start calling them."
In District 5, the wild streets are never far away. Adrian says crack addicts approach him for drugs. At night, he hears gunshots.
The school itself, in classic red bricks, sits at 625 West 133rd Street between Broadway and Riverside Drive on a quiet block near the uptown Fairway, in a neighborhood of big housing projects and little stores that sell doughnuts and chicken. Less than 20 blocks away, at 116th Street, soar the arched gates of Columbia University.
The average household income in the school district is $28,000. Only 29 percent of those over 25 have graduated from high school. The unemployment rate for those over 16 is 16 percent.
Adrian's parents do the best they can. Ms. Reddick looks after the household and the children. Adrian's father, John Bridges, earns $500 a week loading trucks at K&B Furniture's warehouse in the South Bronx. He gets up at 5 each morning and doesn't get home until after 8 at night. Referring to Adrian, Mr. Bridges said, "I said to him, 'Look, man, you finish high school, you won't have to do this.' "
The father added: "I want to get him a computer. I just don't have the money."

A Stacked Deck
It would probably be more of a surprise if the students at Roberto Clemente didn't struggle. Of this year's 350 eighth graders and 580 sixth and seventh graders, about 90 percent are so poor they qualify for a free lunch. Some 135 students are in special education classes. Half the students are African-American and 48 percent are Latino, mostly Dominican. Many come from single-parent homes or are in foster care or living with grandparents. Many students speak Spanish better than English. Others come from places like Haiti, Nigeria or El Salvador, where they had little or no formal education. 
Mostly, the students come to sixth or seventh grade from floundering neighborhood schools plagued by urban woes: poverty, drug abuse, fractured families. 
Ramon Abreu, 34, has a better than average understanding of Clemente's students. A social studies teacher in the bilingual program, Mr. Abreu grew up in the neighborhood and graduated from Clemente in 1980. "We have kids 13 or 14 who can't write their names," said Mr. Abreu, whose family came to Harlem from the Dominican Republic in 1975. "They were in the fields, or they were in a war. I'm working in small groups, almost at the first-grade level. We have kids who think doing the homework means copying the board.
"Someone has to adopt these kids and work with them on their own. It's so many things. It's the kids, the teachers, the parents. A lot of the parents are so preoccupied with their financial needs, the rent, the food, the clothing." 
One afternoon a few days ago, Mr. Abreu used The Daily News to discuss current events with sixth graders. Most of the students were Dominican. Few knew much about the world outside their neighborhood. They were surprised to learn that the Bronx woman who died from inhalation anthrax was Vietnamese, not Chinese.
They read aloud haltingly, stumbling over words like "Vietnamese," "fatalities" and "authorities."
To keep them hooked, Mr. Abreu turned the news back on their own lives:
"O.K., how many of you went trick-or-treating last year?" All hands shot up.
"How many went this year?" No hands.
"That's terrorism. When you become afraid to do things in your daily life."
Despite the emphasis on the state test, Mr. Abreu said that it would be a disservice to his students if he were simply to teach the test.
Still, "a lot of them survive," Mr. Abreu said of the students. "They mature, they go on to college. They come back to say hello."

Trying to Close the Gap
As Mr. Abreu says, they survive. Last school year, 85 percent of the incoming students at Clemente, which has 930 students in grades six through eight, had Level 1 reading and math scores, said Clemente's principal, Aura Rivera. That means the school has three years at best to close the gap. Or, in the case of Adrian, who had Level 1 scores, two years. The eighth graders who did not test well last spring are gone, most to neighborhood high schools that must take them, as opposed to the city schools that have rigorous admissions standards.
Last year the state told Clemente administrators that they had three years to do better. Most Clemente eighth graders had not met the new state targets for reading and math three years in a row, and scores for each eighth-grade class had dropped in each of the three years.
Being on the state's list of failing schools means Ms. Rivera could lose the job she has held for 10 years, she said. Or the school could be closed, like two other middle schools in District 5.
But even in a school struggling as hard as Clemente, even in halls that burst with jostling students trying to heed repeated warnings from teachers to pull up their pants, to straighten their ties, there's room for dreams.
Adrian is part of that dreamy adolescent herd sprinting through the halls. He talks about being a lawyer ("to help people"), a rapper, about playing football at Michigan State. But, like any teenager, Adrian needs reminders. "I have to emphasize to him that without an education he won't go far," Ms. Reddick said. "I tell Adrian, if you want to be like Puff Daddy, he went to college." 
Adrian's courses this fall are Spanish, technology, science, math and social studies. The five high schools he wants to attend all have law programs: Washington Irving, Bronx School of Law, Thurgood Marshall, Roosevelt High School and Monroe Academy. Brandeis on the Upper West Side is his fallback. It is the school that takes students from the district, in contrast to the other schools, which are more competitive. 
Adrian sees himself as an average student, but he is trying to raise his C average. He goes to a three-hour after-school tutorial program four days a week, including Saturdays. He is also finding his way to the neighborhood library more often. 
Adrian remembers elementary school as a blur of unruly classes. "In third grade, everything went berserk," he said. "People ran up to the chalkboard and started erasing it. The teacher would scream at the kids. I felt like walking out, but you'd get in more trouble. Then you'd get your report card, and see you were failing."
Adrian thinks tests have not fairly reflected his abilities. 
"The state gives kids questions they know they can't answer," he insisted. "You get confused, and time is running out."

Average Is Better
Adrian says he wants to do well. But dressed in his school uniform of tie, crisp white shirt and baggy black pants, he does waver. He is surrounded by too many students who do not stand out academically and who are suspicious of those who do. "People kill smart people over nothing," he said. "My brother said that most smart kids, they call them nerds and stuff, they get picked on. If you're smart, you have to pretend you're an average student."
In Adrian's social studies class the other day, a new student complained that students teased her for "talking like a white girl," using proper grammar and pronunciation.
Or there is Adrian, who likes the look of the nearby Columbia campus but had never heard the phrase Ivy League. Adrian, who, at an age when suburban teenagers are learning to unlock the mysteries of Shakespeare, says his favorite books are R. L. Stine's "Goosebumps" series.
Even though Ms. Rivera, the principal, said that being put on the state's list of failing schools felt like "a sock in the face, " not everything is hopeless at the Clemente school. Test scores can't reflect the school's lively spirit. Attendance is strong. Discipline is rarely a problem. Some students play squash and the violin. Students move on and do well in high school and college.
Still, when one looks hard into the faces of many of the students, parents and guardians who come into to Ms. Rivera's office as late as November to enroll, one sees deep sadness, years of frustration. Ms. Rivera understands.
A daughter of the Lower East Side and of Puerto Rican parents who never finished high school, Ms. Rivera became fluent in English only in third grade. But she went on to Barnard and Teachers College at Columbia. Clemente was her first school out of college; she taught seventh- and eighth-grade English.
One imagines that she sees something of herself in her school's children. "It's heartbreaking," said Ms. Rivera, who worries the halls, walkie-talkie in hand. She picks up trash, asks students how they're feeling. "These kids want what all kids want."
She constantly pops her head into classrooms. Once, she pointed to a teacher behind a desk and said: "I don't like that. She should be interacting with the students." Another time, in a special education class, a student used a common epithet for African-Americans while discussing the Civil War, and Ms. Rivera said she would tell the teacher later that she had missed a chance to talk about such terms. 
Ms. Rivera is often seen huddling with students or strolling with them down the hall. "I smell their hands," she said. "I can tell if they have been smoking marijuana."
Like most of the city's teachers and administrators, Ms. Rivera can probably recite in her sleep the ingredients needed to help students like hers: more time, more money, smaller classes. She is making progress. She has gotten approval to cut classes from 30 students to 25 students and to double the 45-minute class periods for math and reading for students who need it.
But as she stared into her school's courtyard, she grew a bit somber, let the truth sneak up on her, and said: "I don't know the answer."
What about Adrian? 
He'll be one to make it, Ms. Rivera says. "I think we'll put enough in him," she said. "Enough skills, enough values." 
Adrian does want to make it. "My moms, she was sad about the tests, because she never got the chance to go to college," he said one day recently as he sat in Ms. Rivera's office. "She promised me some sneakers if I went to summer school, but I would have gone anyway. My Dad, he is always after me to do better, to not follow the crowd."
Mr. Bridges believes in his son, too. "Call back in June," he said, "and you'll see that he passed." 
Adrian, quiet as usual, his voice gentle as a 14-year-old boy's dream, added, "The only way to deal with pressure is to work hard."

To the Editor:
Your Nov. 5 editorial "Harnessing the Spirit of Sept. 11," encouraging New Yorkers who are eager to do something in response to the terrorist attack to donate money or services to needy charities, could not have come at a better time. 
 The nonprofit community faces a fund-raising crisis of immense proportions, especially with a bleak economic outlook. 
Health organizations need to finance research; the homeless need hot meals and a place to stay; and children need safe after-school activities. 
 The generous contributions to the relief efforts are to be applauded. What better way to cope with the tragedy and channel our concerns than to carry on the distinctly American tradition of giving and volunteering?

HEADLINE: On the Road Again, Bound for a State of Mind 

BYLINE:  By JULIA CHAPLIN 

 BODY:
IT was not exactly "Easy Rider," that classic of the American road trip as a journey by outlaws with scruffy sideburns on chopper bikes. Instead, when Philip Greenspun and Kyle Nich olls decided to drop out of their daily lives for a month and take to the highway, they drove a pristine Winnebago stocked with laptop computers, cases of Perrier and Kiehl's beauty products. 
 "We listened to the Clash when we were driving through Connecticut last week," Ms. Nicholls, 31, said on a recent autumn day, flipping through an issue of The Economist as the R.V. rolled along Interstate 66 toward Shenandoah National Park in northwestern Virginia. "But it was giving Philip a headache so we turned it off." 
 For years now, the pleasures of the road trip have palled. Driving long distances became a time-guzzling burden, and Interstates seemed more often linked with road rage and bad French fries. But then came an overnight fear of air travel and a yearning for escape from new urban anxieties, especially in New York. Suddenly, the open road holds a fresh appeal for those who have single-mindedly pursued big-city lives and ambitions. 
"I've been working nonstop since I was 16," Ms. Nicholls said. "I always thought I'd decompose if I had more than a month off." But after she lost her job managing the Web site of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in mid-September, she wanted a break. "I'd look at job boards with nothing on them," she said. "I sent out resumes and got no responses. Meanwhile, I'd be glued to the news worrying about anthrax."
Mr. Greenspun, 38, bought the Winnebago last summer after selling his software company, ArsDigita, for a tidy sum. He had just returned from Nova Scotia and offered Ms. Nicholls a seat on his next trip. "I hadn't done anything outrageously impulsive in years," Ms. Nicholls said.
From Cambridge, Mass., they drove to ground zero in Manhattan, then to Washington and now were following an itinerary that is part hipster Americana, part plain old Americana: Shenandoah, the Shiloh Civil War memorial in Tennessee, Elvis's home in Memphis and, ultimately, the Donald Judd Foundation in Marfa, Tex.
Yes, a reluctance to board jetliners is expected to cause droves of travelers to scrub plans for flying this holiday season, and a greater percentage than last year will be driving to grandmother's house for Thanksgiving, according to a report last week by AAA, the automobile club. 
But those embarking on road trips like Mr. Greenspun and Ms. Nicholls aren't just motoring to point B. They're taking meandering journeys whose destination is a state of decompression and, just maybe, self-discovery. They have weeks to spare after losing a job or carving out the time for soul-searching. Naturally, they tend to be young and single and without the responsibilities of families and children. 
It's an impulse as deeply American as that raft trip down the Mississippi by Huckleberry Finn and Jim, who broke loose from the world when the pressure of civilization became too much. It's a tradition enshrined in American literature, movies and pop music, whether "The Grapes of Wrath," Jack Kerouac or "The Searchers." 
"It's the mythic impulse of the Western film genre," said David Thomson, a writer on film and the author of "In Nevada: The Land, the People, God and Chance." 
"It's like, wouldn't it be wonderful to keep driving toward the horizon and just see what I might find and wonder whether maybe I might find myself?" he said. "It's time for this idea to be re-explored."
Nancy Novogrod, editor in chief of Travel & Leisure magazine, is stepping up coverage of road trips, including a cross-country-driving article planned for an American travel issue next April. The January issue, usually a roundup of the latest travel trends, is dedicated instead to comfort zones, with the largest section on road trips. 
"There's a desire to return to a slower, easier time," Ms. Novogrod said. "People are taking comfort in driving around America to visit places that are reassuring and unchanged, that represent an enduring sense of place."
During the 1960's and 70's, the great American road trip had a countercultural ethos, when waves of young people set off in Volkswagen vans or on motorcycles to follow a rock band's tour or to drop out of college and careers. But today's road trippers have no grudge against their country. They're more likely to be laid-off urban professionals, not about to give up material comforts. 
"I don't feel like I'm dropping out," said Robert Wolf, 37, who zoomed off from New York on a five-week trip through the South last Wednesday in a red Mercedes-Benz convertible. 
Mr. Wolf was in his downtown apartment on a recent Saturday amid stacks of travel guides, a laptop computer and a sprawling map of the United States on the wall. He hadn't taken an extended vacation in 13 years, he said, but when his job as publicity director for the fashion label Luca Luca was cut three weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, he decided not to plunge into job hunting.
"It's so easy in New York City to get caught up on the treadmill of parties, work and networking," he said. "After everything that's happened in the world, I'm just not ready to jump back on. I need answers to hard questions that require mental and physical exploring." 
Mr. Wolf was headed to Alabama, where he grew up, to visit family and high school friends in Huntsville; to see Helen Keller's house in Tuscumbia; and to attend the big game this Saturday between Auburn University, his alma mater, and its archrival, the University of Alabama. 
"People aren't going to come to grips with how they're feeling by holding a Palm Pilot -- it's about getting your hands dirty and really experiencing life," he said. "I don't want to call old friends on a cellphone, I want to drive hundreds of miles to their house and spend a week hanging out in their living room playing hearts."
In Long Island City, Queens, Diana Stone was in her bedroom packing photos of her cats to make space for a friend who would be staying in the apartment while she took to the road.
"I'm re-evaluating what makes me happy," said Ms. Stone, 33, who plans to ride a black 1982 Suzuki motorcycle around the Northeast and then to the Florida Everglades, "to swim with the manatees." Ms. Stone has a degree in photography, and when her job in business development for a television graphics company was cut back to a freelance role last month, she decided to take to the road to mull her dream of documentary filmmaking. 
"I guess we can thank terrorism for waking people up and getting them to think about what their priorities are," she said. 
For River Lloyd, a hair stylist at the John Frieda Salon in Manhattan, the priorities have shifted from the party circuit he once pursued. "Going to Miami and sitting by the pool at some trendy hotel that you've been to a million times doesn't seem very interesting to me," he said. Last summer he went to Mikonos, Greece, but now he plans to see America first -- heading with a companion in an S.U.V. to explore truck stops, diners and thrift shops in the Northwest for 10 days in January. 
"I want to go to this kitschy little hotel in Casper, Wyoming, that has the most amazing shag carpeting on the walls and ceiling," Mr. Lloyd said. He looks forward to driving the long empty highways, watching the mile markers pass. "There's nothing like the feeling of driving through time zones," he said. "There's a certain Zen-ness and serenity to watching the miles tick away, like 150 miles to Des Moines." 
Larry McMurtry, the Texas novelist, said, "It's relaxing to get out of quasi-domestic and professional situations to hit the road for a bit." Mr. McMurtry is also the author of a travel memoir, "Roads: Driving America's Great Highways." 
"You can sort of mull without even being aware of it," he said. "I can be looking at the plains or the sky and get a great idea. Because driving only requires a reflexive concentration, it leaves your mind free to wander and gestate."
Nadine Brambilla, a college student and model, who grew up in TriBeCa, said that before Sept. 11 she would never have considered anything as boring as tooling around America by car. 
"It's like, what's in between New York City and Los Angeles?" she said. "Nothing that I know of. To me, it's always just been a six-hour stretch of airplane food." 
But after witnessing the twin towers crumble from her SoHo apartment, Ms. Brambilla would like to see the length and breadth of an America that seems to have gained a new glow in the upsurge of patriotism. She plans to drive a Jeep Cherokee this winter to Niagara Falls; to Michigan, where she will pick up a friend; to Idaho, where her aunt has an organic beef farm; to New Mexico, where another friend will join her; and on to Los Angeles.
"I always wanted to be this jet-set special person, and now I just want to blend in and be really normal," Ms. Brambilla said. "I want to go to little towns and sit at coffee shops for hours and meet people and read the local newspaper." 
Such an ambition might sound quaint, even naive -- Ms. Brambilla is just 22 and, after all, Manhattan-bred -- but it's a reminder that much of the American interest in lighting out for the territory is fed by the country's long tradition of road narratives, many of them highly romantic. Sixties vagabonds hit the road under the influence of "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Easy Rider," whose heroes were dashing outlaws. 
"Movies like 'Zabriskie Point' are very much about let's get out of this corrupt city, let's get back to a primitive natural existence," said Mr. Thomson, the writer on movies. "People are disturbed and afraid, and they're going to try to find the open space and the empty quarter they've seen in films and read about. I hope they know the food isn't very good out there."
Monica Kehrer, a graphic designer who took a two-week trip with her boyfriend from New York to Florida in a rented Buick last month, enjoyed the wind blowing her hair and the music blaring from the radio. But, she conceded, it didn't live up to expectations. 
"It was sort of boring," said Ms. Kehrer, 33. "When we got to Florida it was raining the whole time. It's really flat with tons of strip malls. We ended up shopping at Target a lot. I was glad to finally get home."
As road-tested travelers will attest, it's often the downtime that brings the meditative and most welcome moments. In their Winnebago, Ms. Nicholls and Mr. Greenspun pulled into Shenandoah National Park as the sun hung low in the sky. They walked toward the ranger station to ask about campgrounds, and Mr. Greenspun held up his cellphone to the sky to test its reception. 
"Someone should invent a cellphone application that tells you if there's someone else in the park who also has free time, wants to have coffee and talk about photography," he said.

Marketing Bonanzas, and Pitfalls, in a Disaster

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
SUNDAY LEWIS has had plenty of experience with fast-changing markets. 
 Before she became chief marketing officer six months ago at Identix, a company in Los Gatos, Calif., that provides security systems using fingerprints to establish identification, Ms. Lewis was a former chief marketing officer in the United States for a German software company. Later, she became an independent marketing strategist and brand consultant. She arrived at Identix with a Who's Who list of former clients including I.B.M., Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Intel. 
 But Ms. Lewis, 54, said she had never faced anything quite like the challenges that arose after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. 
"This changed everything in a day," she said. 
Like everyone else, marketing executives initially had to deal both with personal losses and shock -- heightened in Ms. Lewis's case by the memories of 13 years as a New York resident. Then they had to re-examine everything they had been planning. They knew there would be a pause in all marketing, but they also had to move quickly to ensure that nothing in their advertising and promotions, like violent imagery, would upset sensitivities created by the tragedy.
But for Ms. Lewis and many counterparts at other companies, particularly in the security and health industries, Sept. 11 also presented a challenge that could easily prove to be the pinnacle of their careers.
The disaster created previously undreamed-of chances to strengthen sales, attract investors and partners, and achieve recognition for products and services that no amount of advertising could buy.
Identix, whose systems are used to control access to areas or equipment, and the makers of other biometric identification systems, which measure distinctive attributes like facial features, retina patterns and voice inflections, were inundated with requests for information. Everyone wanted to know what their products could do and how soon they could be delivered.
CALLS also poured in to vendors of inspection equipment, suppliers of armed guards and other security services, detoxification companies and software developers with programs easily adaptable to tracking terrorists or outbreaks of disease.
"All of my old clients called and said, 'Aren't you lucky,' " Ms. Lewis said. 
Well, yes and no. Once-in-a-lifetime opportunities are inevitably accompanied by the possibility of highly visible failure. Move too timidly and opportunities are squandered. Move too aggressively or awkwardly and a company could be saddled with unsold products or a reputation for opportunism.
Such risks are always present to some degree in marketing, of course. And marketing experts note that many businesses instinctively become more cautious about promotions whenever accidents or natural disasters are disrupting customers or competitors. That is why airlines never run advertisements stressing their safety record when a rival's plane has crashed.
"The peculiar thing about this is the patriotism angle," said Erik Gordon, director of the Center for Technology and Science Commercialization Studies at the University of Florida's Warrington College of Business. "If you make a faux pas, it's a faux pas against America."
Stephen Greyser, a longtime marketing professor at Harvard Business School, said many marketers face a pressing need to find independent voices to validate their claims. "The public won't accept exploitation in either substance or style," he said.
Many marketers also raced to issue educational "white papers" on technology or social problems, get their chief executives treated as experts by the media or, best of all, secure invitations to testify before a Congressional committee -- all as an indirect way to attract recognition. "You don't get many opportunities for your ship to come in," Professor Greyser said.
At a few companies, Sept. 11 has put marketers in the odd position of reducing or at least delaying demand for their products. Raising prices is the Economics 101 prescription in normal times, but that option invites charges of profiteering.
Annin & Company, a flag manufacturer, is working on a new product catalog that will offer fewer choices. Wackenhut, the nation's second-largest provider of security guards and related services, has turned away all but a handful of companies that have sought to retain it in recent weeks, and it has converted its 25 sales representatives into consultants.
The standards of acceptable behavior can become particularly unforgiving for corporate giants positioned to profit from a disaster, as Bayer, the manufacturer of the antibiotic Cipro, has discovered. As the only treatment for inhaled anthrax approved by the Food and Drug Administration, Cipro became a national obsession after reports of anthrax infections and in some cases deaths among mail and clerical workers from contaminated letters and packages.
Karen Dawes, a senior vice president at Bayer who oversees sales and marketing in the United States, said the company's research had found "100 percent brand awareness of Cipro."
"That's something I've never heard of for a pharmaceutical product," she said.
In most circumstances, such awareness would be a marketer's dream. 
But news about Cipro has been dominated by coverage of shortages, unregulated Internet sales, speculation about Bayer's profits and the company's efforts to protect its patent. 
Fairly or not, in the end, Bayer's marketers and their allies in public relations have suffered repeated losses in the battle to be perceived as a public-spirited company. Ms. Dawes said that part of Bayer's response had been to modify its marketing of Cipro to emphasize its proper use. Bayer has also given its sales force a primer on bioterrorism, which the company has also posted on its Web site. But Bayer has instructed sales representatives to focus their conversations with health professionals on Avelox, a Bayer drug for treatment of respiratory infections.
Ms. Dawes said Bayer was still pondering how to talk to consumers about Cipro. Drug companies routinely advertise treatments for chronic conditions like depression or sexual dysfunction. But drugs like antibiotics or vaccines that are not intended for repeated use were not considered appropriate for marketing to consumers, at least until Sept. 11.
Bayer would like to get consumers to discuss Cipro with doctors whenever they have conditions like urinary infections, which had been Cipro's main use in recent years. But the company needs more market research to figure out the right strategy for such efforts, Ms. Dawes said.
Unlike Bayer, most companies with products that might find new markets in the post-Sept. 11 world must make decisions without the benefit of extensive market research.
Identix, for example, felt it had to postpone the mid-September introduction of Ms. Lewis's marketing showpiece, a made-for-Internet serial movie about Jack Banner, a fictional character who has lost his memory in a car crash that may or may not have been an accident. The movie shows 35 examples of fingerprint-based technology and other biometric products from Identix in various working environments -- the intended message being that such technology is unobtrusive, useful and reliable.
But some scenes show mysterious figures in an airplane and airport, creating the impression that Identix might be exploiting passenger fear of security breaches.
IDENTIX'S outside public relations firm advised waiting until January to release the marketing campaign. But Ms. Lewis, going on instinct, decided to start it at the end of October.
"There is a sense of urgency, a sense that the window for educating others about what you can do is short," said Steven Ehrlich, marketing chief at Nuance Communications, a supplier of voice recognition technology in Menlo Park, Calif. 
Before Sept. 11, Nuance had marketed its products to help businesses control access by workers and customers to data. Since then, it has raced to study the potential government uses of voice technology and the market for deploying voice authentication equipment to control access to buildings. Nuance is exploring who makes the buying decisions for such equipment and which of its larger partners might integrate Nuance's technology into their products.
"Opportunities we thought we'd be addressing five years from now," Mr. Ehrlich said, "are now much more near term."

HEADLINE: In the 'IdeaWars,' a Fight to Control a New Currency 

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
AS OFFICIALS from around the world gather to discuss global trade in Doha, Qatar, this weekend, many are challenging one of the towering achievements of American industry during its economic boom years: an unprecedented expansion of intellectual property rights.
 Brazil, India and other developing countries argue that America's devotion to the sanctity of patents puts drugs for AIDS and other diseases beyond the reach of the poor and costs millions of lives. And, they charge, Washington showed its hypocrisy last month when it considered revoking Bayer's patent on the anthrax-fighting drug Cipro because it was Americans who seemed at risk. Suddenly, the American stance, that without patent protection there would be no drugs, seemed hollow.
 But whether or not the two sides reach an accommodation -- the Bush administration wants the World Trade Organization meeting to serve as a display of global unity in the face of terrorism -- the dispute illuminates a broader battle over the ownership of innovation in an information economy. 
The questions on the table at Doha -- Should one corporation have control over a lifesaving innovation? Would anyone develop new products and technologies if he were not guaranteed a temporary monopoly on their use? Can strong protection actually inhibit innovation? -- are at the core of a debate roiling nearly every industry, encompassing areas from Internet services to scientific research to movie characters.
Call it the idea wars. At a time when information has emerged as the world's most valuable currency, owners are asserting, and winning, more control than ever over how ideas are used, sold and consumed.
Proponents hail the advent of an era of "intellectual capitalism," the latest stage in the evolution of the post-industrial economy. "In the knowledge economy, ideas become the product," said Kevin G. Rivette, author of "Rembrandts in the Attic" (Harvard Business School Press, 2000), which has become a textbook for would-be intellectual property owners.
But critics warn that, far from promoting innovation, America is in the midst of an information-age enclosure movement comparable to the fencing off of public grazing lands at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. Building on the ideas of others, a fundamental part of creativity, they say, is much harder when a license must be negotiated to use any existing sliver of innovation. And, they complain, intellectual property rights are regularly trumping social values like free speech or public health.
Throughout the 1990's, the drug, entertainment and technology industries lobbied hard to erect the strongest protections for intellectual property rights in American history. For drugs, the effective duration of patents has in some cases almost doubled, to 16 years. Copyrights on creative works can now stretch as long as 95 years, the result of lobbying by companies like Walt Disney, which wanted to keep the 73-year-old Mickey Mouse from slipping into the public domain alongside the works of Shakespeare and Victor Hugo.
A new copyright law made it a crime to distribute software or other tools that could allow people to make illegal copies of digital media like DVD's or electronic books. Although the tools may also have legitimate uses, companies say they need the extra protection because of the Internet-era ease of wide-scale copying.
Court cases established the right of companies like Bayer to extend their monopolies on patented drugs by keeping cheaper generic versions off the market. Drug, computer and software makers amassed extensive "thickets" of patents to discourage innovation by competitors. Even Bristol-Myers Squibb, a company that supports the Bush administration's efforts to extend drug patent protection in the developing world, has said its researchers cannot pursue at least 50 promising approaches to fighting cancer because of patents accumulated by others.
MEANWHILE, more than 26,000 scientists, including several Nobel laureates, have vowed to boycott major scientific publishers after they rejected a petition demanding that journal articles be turned over to a free, online archive within six months of publication. The scientists say the efforts of magazines like Science and Nature to control distribution of articles based on taxpayer-supported research is delaying scientific progress.
Even trademark holders are increasingly asserting ownership claims over their marks, based on laws originally intended to prevent consumer confusion. Several young Harry Potter fans took their Web sites down earlier this year after Warner Brothers threatened legal action, claiming that sites like www.harrypotterfan.co.uk were "likely to cause dilution" of its intellectual property rights to the film about the fictional boy wizard.
Proponents say that tighter protections on intellectual property have spurred creativity and innovation. Patents and copyrights certainly have boomed. The Patent and Trademark Office received a record 315,015 applications for patents last year, up from 176,264 a decade earlier. It issued 254,329, almost double the 1990 figure. The United States Copyright Office said that registrations totaled almost 600,000 in its last fiscal year, a 16 percent increase over the year before. 
AS the number of patents and copyrights has grown, so has the disagreements over them. Patent litigation alone cost American companies more than $4 billion last year. Many companies pay royalty fees to patent holders rather than risk an infringement case -- even if they do not infringe. New businesses divert scarce resources from generating innovations to paying lawyers to make sure someone else does not already own their ideas.
Increasingly, patents cover things that were rarely subject to anyone's ownership before, often lumped in a category called business methods. The floodgates opened in 1998, when a court decision upheld a patent on a bank's computerized method of managing a mutual fund, but the patent office has since been widely criticized for issuing patents on practices that are neither new nor novel. 
Patents have been issued on a method for producing a personal golf lesson video, computer software for privatizing socialist economies, even a process for filing patent applications. The Marine Corps has applied for a patent on the design of its new uniform, featuring a digitally generated camouflage pattern. "Microsoft Patents Ones, Zeros," read a recent headline on The Onion, a humorous Web site, satirizing the frenzy.
Indeed, whole new industries are springing up, from insurers offering hedges against litigation to patent bounty hunters and specialists in spotting patent infringement. Self-styled "I.P." consultants tout their ability to identify the stray innovations stored in a company's file cabinets, on its hard drives and in the heads of its employees.
But some analysts say it is lawyers and business executives skilled at writing patent applications -- not innovators -- who are being rewarded the most.
Civil liberties advocates are contending in several court cases that the assertion of property rights by copyright owners restricts the development of technologies. They also argue that copyright holders are using the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to restrict the free expression of computer programmers like Dmitry Sklyarov, a Russian who was arrested in the United States this summer, accused of illegally distributing software that can enable consumers to copy electronic books.
They say that the 1998 statute, by banning software tools used to circumvent the locks on digital material, prevents consumers from using copyrighted works in ways that have long been considered acceptable -- excerpts for criticism or teaching, say, or making a personal backup copy.
"The emergence of new technologies has called into question whether we might have gone too far in strengthening the rights of property holders against consumers," said Richard C. Levin, the president of Yale University, who is heading an investigation by the National Academy of Sciences into the nation's intellectual property policy. "The key question is, are we getting the balance right?"
It is a question that has long been relegated to lawyers and lobbyists. But the direction of intellectual property policy has gained urgency in recent weeks as the Bush administration has begun to view international development in terms of national security. Further complicating the debate, a growing contingent of economists suggests that more protection for intellectual property does not necessarily lead to more innovation.
"There's been a tendency on the part of policy makers in the United States to equate stronger intellectual property rights with more innovation in a very simplistic way," said Josh Lerner, an economist at Harvard Business School. "A more nuanced approach is much more appropriate." In a study of 150 years of patent policies in 60 countries, Mr. Lerner found that there was no evidence that increased patent protection in developing countries led to increased innovation among domestic companies. 
Some economists, legal scholars and entrepreneurs argue that patent protection should also be applied more sparingly in industries like computer technology where innovation is already taking place at a rapid rate. They point to the growth in a method of software development known as open source, in which programmers do not patent or copyright their work, as proof that innovation can occur without intellectual property protection.
"Patents are regulating a broader range of innovative activity than ever before," said Lawrence Lessig, a Stanford University law professor and author of a book, "The Future of Ideas" (Random House, 2001), that emphasized the importance of a healthy public domain to fuel innovation. "I believe we should be extremely skeptical about extending government-backed monopoly in the context of the Internet before we find out if it's doing any good."
At a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee earlier this year, Andrew Steinberg, vice president of the Internet travel site Travelocity.com, said a flood of patents on business practices was discouraging innovation in his industry and wasting resources on legal fees that ought to be spent on developing products.
TRAVELOCITY had to pay to use Priceline's system for selling name-your-own-price airline tickets over the Internet, for instance, even though, Mr. Steinberg says, the basic reverse-auction concept is not new. By contrast, since the concept of holding traditional auctions online was not patented, he said, eBay, Yahoo, Amazon and others have been free to innovate and compete in that business.
"We believe the proliferation of these patents is a serious threat to the growth of electronic commerce," Mr. Steinberg said. "No prudent business would allow its competitors to patent key business processes without attempting to obtain some patents of their own. And so we, and virtually every other large Internet company, must accept the law as it is and aggressively attempt to obtain patents wherever we can."
But Jay Walker, the founder of Priceline, said he could not have started the company without being able to assure investors that airlines would not be free to copy his idea.
"Strong property rights fairly applied build assets for society," Mr. Walker said. "Lack of property creates uncertainty, destroys investment and ultimately is worse for society. The only people who really dislike intellectual property are the people who don't have any."
That may well be true. Mr. Steinberg's testimony contained strong echoes of a public hearing in 1994, when patents on computer software were just beginning to be issued in large numbers. Then, most of the executives who testified at patent office hearings argued for limiting such patents, saying that novelty in the software business was fleeting at best. Now, most of their companies have large patent portfolios, and many bring in annual revenue.
"Companies found that software patents were very easy to get in very broad terms," said Matthew Powers, a managing partner at Weil, Gotshal & Manges, a law firm whose 20 or so software industry clients have all been involved in patent litigation in the last year. "The inherent power of a patent -- the power to force someone to stop selling a product -- is so much greater than any other form of protection. They started embracing patents with every arm they could find."
Rather than share patents, leading companies in the semiconductor industry today swap and shuffle licenses in what is widely viewed as a way to keep others out. Although large concerns like AT&T, I.B.M. and Texas Instruments have long held large portfolios of patents for trading purposes, other semiconductor manufacturers have radically expanded their portfolios since the 1980's, largely for defensive purposes. For example, LSI Logic, a chip maker in Milpitas, Calif., increased the size of its portfolio from 7 American patents in 1986 to more than 1,000 by last year, an increase that far outpaced its spending on research and development, according to a recent study in the RAND Journal of Economics.
"The main reason they've been patenting like crazy is either because they lost a lawsuit or they want to prevent one," said Rosemarie Ziedonis, an assistant professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who helped write the study. "That's not the same thing as saying, 'I spend more money developing innovative technologies because of patents.' "
Even some industry executives say the frenzy of cross-licensing may be anticompetitive. "Pretty soon, if it continues, you'll find that everyone's going to have rights to everyone else's technology, so there's not going to be any competition," said Julie Mar-Spinola, chief litigation and intellectual property counsel for the Atmel Corporation, a semiconductor maker in San Jose, Calif.
That may not sound much like Abraham Lincoln's famous description of the patent system "adding the fuel of interest to the fire of genius." Critics argue that the patent office, established in 1790, is tailored to the needs of industries whose products require years of work and large capital investment -- manufacturing in the 19th and 20th centuries, for instance, or the pharmaceutical industry today.
INDEED, drug makers justify their large profit margins on patented medications by pointing to the billions they invest each year in research and development, often in pursuit of drug targets that do not pan out. But even pharmaceutical giants, facing the specter of thousands of gene patents owned by universities and biotechnology companies, are now raising questions about the effectiveness of the system.
"If people have put effort into patentable material, they should expect a return," said Dr. William Koster, a former senior executive at Bristol-Myers Squibb. But what sort of return, and under what conditions? "What is intellectual property worth?" asked Dr. Koster, who recently left Bristol-Myers to become chief executive of a biotechnology company. "It's a debate, and its outcome is very significant."
Thomas Jefferson, who served as the nation's first patent examiner, wrote that the exclusive right to ideas is "given not of natural right, but for the benefit of society." The deliberate bargain is enshrined in Article 1 of the Constitution, which authorizes Congress to issue patents and copyrights "for limited times" in order to "promote the progress of science and the useful arts." Patents originally covered only inventions that could be demonstrated with working mechanical models. Copyrights could be held for only 28 years, and the law governing them evolved to allow for some public uses of copyrighted material without the owner's permission.
NOW, many legal scholars argue that major patent and copyright owners are trying to stretch their qualified grants into a more absolute form of control. The relatively new use of the term "intellectual property," they say, has skewed the original legal and cultural meaning of patents and copyrights.
Thinking of ideas as property creates "a very powerful metaphor that tips the scales in the direction of the person asserting their property rights have been violated," said Pam Samuelson, co-director of the Center for Law and Technology at the University of California at Berkeley. "When you're talking about real property you're not talking about people's ability to express themselves in a democratic society."
Some members of Congress want to shift the balance. Representative Rick Boucher, Democrat of Virginia, and Representative Howard Berman, Democrat of California, have introduced legislation that would establish higher standards for issuing patents on the rapidly growing category of business methods.
Mr. Boucher, the most outspoken critic of expanded intellectual property rights on Capitol Hill, also said he planned to propose softening the terms of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. "There has been an overreach at the expense of information users that needs to be corrected," he said.
But even as there are signs of a backlash against intellectual property expansion, from the coalition of developing nations making their case in Qatar to the scientists who are starting their own online repository for the free distribution of peer-reviewed articles, companies are striving harder than ever to lock up their valuable intellectual assets.
Consulting companies like InteCap Inc., which helps corporations develop intellectual property strategies, are in high demand. And entertainment companies are hiring technology firms to track people who are illegally trading copyrighted music and movies over the Internet.
Other companies are seeking to make money on the complaints that patents, by their volume and breadth, are stifling competition. Bountyquest, based in Boston, lets a customer offer a reward on its Web site in exchange for proof that an invention was publicly available before a patent was issued. Such information can be used to invalidate a patent in court. Several bounty hunters have collected as much as $10,000 since Bountyquest was started last year; the company has collected its commissions in turn.
IP.com, in Rochester, offers "defensive disclosure." For $109, inventors can publish on the company's Web site material they choose not to patent -- making it ineligible for patenting by anyone else.
"As we enter this patent race, and there's really no other name for it," the IP.com chief executive, Tom Colson, said, "you need a way to protect your freedom to practice innovation without patenting yourself out of business."

HEADLINE: Health Care As Main Engine: Is That So Bad? 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
WHENEVER the economy begins growing again -- be it early next year, if the recession is an average one, or many months later, if not -- the next expansion will probably have a character starkly different from those of the recent past.
 For the last few months, the business of keeping people healthy has been one of the only parts of the $10 trillion American economy that has remained healthy, and many economists now say that the sprawling health care industry may be the only driver of growth in the near term. Even when consumer spending and corporate investment pick up, the health care sector is likely to expand faster than most industries in the years ahead. 
 For the economy over all, that suggests a mixed prognosis. With health care as a growth leader, the next expansion may not be as robust as the boom of the late 1990's. Spending on health care does not ripple through an economy as forcefully as new purchases of technology, housing or factories. It also does relatively little to make an economy more efficient -- yet increases in efficiency improve material living standards by allowing more goods or services to be produced with the same amount of human effort. 
On the other hand, a health care expansion can bring benefits that new computers, houses and cars rarely do, economists say. By many standards for valuing human life, the medical spending of the last half-century has yielded enormous returns, primarily by cutting the death rate from heart disease, the nation's top killer. Future treatments may well reduce the rate further -- or extend the lives of people suffering from diseases like cancer.
"Think of the economy as a system that at the end of the day is supposed to make life nice," said Paul Romer, an economist at Stanford University who studies technological change. Computers, he said, "don't do all that much to make my life happier."
"What makes me happy," Mr. Romer said, "is good food, a nice house and, most of all, good health."
The $1.3 trillion health care industry -- including pharmaceutical companies, medical equipment makers, hospitals, nursing homes, assisted-living centers and insurers -- has boomed before, as far back as the 19th century. But the current expansion comes after a decade in which health care's share of the economy remained flat, largely because insurance companies and the government restrained spending. Now, widespread demand for more flexible health programs, the aging of the population and a spate of hospital mergers are pushing up both costs and investments in health care.
Research budgets at drug companies and the federal government are also rising, and scientists expect the recent mapping of the human genome and other advances to yield major new treatments in the next decade. As baby boomers near retirement and their golden years, they will further inflate the number of Americans who spend heavily on medical care.
In recent weeks, fears about bioterrorism have led the Bush administration to request $1.5 billion to fight germ attacks, and some members of Congress are arguing for as much as $7 billion in new spending. Policy makers are also considering a law that would require companies to offer more coverage of mental illnesses. 
By 2010, health care is expected to account for 16 percent of the nation's economic output, up from 13 percent today and 4 percent 50 years ago, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. In 2040, economists say the sector could exceed 20 percent, and David M. Cutler, a researcher at Harvard, has argued that even 30 percent would not be unlikely.
WHATEVER the specifics, executives and economists agree that health care will become a more important part of the economy. "We look at various scenarios, and the answer almost always is 8 percent" a year, said Henry A. McKinnell, the chief executive of Pfizer, the drug company, referring to the industry's expected growth rate. "I don't think the economy will grow that rapidly."
As a result, health care is likely to help determine just how rapidly the economy expands. Over the last half-century, a variety of sectors -- among them construction, transportation and, most recently, information technology -- have fueled economic booms.
Those other sectors have advantages that medical care does not. A new computer, a new highway and a new building not only provide employment, but they can also lift the productivity of the people using them. They are, in other words, investments. Some money spent on health care counts as an investment, but much is pure consumption.
Economists are debating whether the gains in efficiency, and therefore productivity, from the technology boom of the 1990's were large or small. However, most agree that the spending has helped the country emerge from the long productivity slump of the 1970's and 1980's that depressed economic growth. Increases in productivity allow companies to increase their profits without raising prices and setting off inflation.
Health care, by contrast, has little effect on the productivity in a wealthy country like the United States because the population is already healthy enough to perform its work, economists say.
The industry is not ideally suited to stimulating a weak economy because, compared with retail, restaurants, entertainment and many other services, a relatively large part of health care wages go to well-off workers like doctors, scientists and executives. "A dollar to the service sector is almost certainly a bigger stimulus than a dollar to the health care sector because it's more likely to go to a lower-income person who's more likely to consume," said Jonathan Gruber, an economist at M.I.T. 
"There is absolutely no credible evidence on the short-run impact of health spending on the economy," Professor Gruber said.
That does not mean that a society that spends more of its money on medical care is worse off. For starters, there are some straightforward economic benefits.
A healthier nation will have a larger work force because many of its citizens can work well into their 60's, 70's and 80's; the more labor a society has, the faster it can grow.
The nature of the industry also requires companies to keep most of their jobs within the United States. Unlike information technology, which is concentrated in a few cities, the health care sector is dispersed across the country and comes in many forms. In many cities, hospitals are the largest employers.
More important, however, are the benefits that simply do not show up in the nation's gross domestic product statistics, economists say. 
IN recent years, a handful of researchers have tried to quantify those benefits. Usually, they begin by examining the amount of money the country has spent on medical care. The researchers next study the extent to which medical treatment -- as opposed to diet or other factors -- has reduced death rates. Finally, they try to put a value on a year of human life by analyzing, for example, how much more people are paid to work in jobs with a higher risk of death.
In one finding, William D. Nordhaus, a professor at Yale University, calculated a value of the last century's improvements in health. That value, he said, slightly exceeded the enormous gain in monetary wealth that the United States has experienced since 1900. 
Professor Romer said, "The naive perspective is, 'Spending on health care has gone up; that's a bad thing.' " But, he added, "If the question is have we gotten big benefits from spending on health care, the answer is unambiguously yes."
Increased medical spending is not a new development. In the late 19th century, a typical family used almost all of its income for food, shelter and clothing and an extremely small amount for health care, said Robert William Fogel, a Nobel laureate in economics at the University of Chicago. In the 125 years since, spending on food, clothing and shelter has fallen to less than half of the family budget, and medical spending has risen rapidly.
As the nation has grown richer, more people have been able to afford not only basic necessities but also as many televisions and cars as they wanted. After that, they tend to choose to spend additional income on their physical well-being.
"A lot of people would rather have a new knee than a new Mercedes," Professor Fogel said.
THAT attitude becomes even more common in a downturn, because much medical spending is not discretionary, and health care is now one of the few areas cushioning the effects of recession for corporate America. General Electric, Marriott International, Tyco International and other big companies with health care divisions are suffering less than many rivals.
The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, based in St. Paul, is another example. Since the start of the year, it has laid off 5,000 of its 75,000 employees. In the third quarter, sales dropped 7 percent, compared with a year earlier, and operating profit fell 24 percent. 
But in a recent call with analysts, Robert J. Burgstahler, 3M's chief financial officer -- who had been describing the environment with words like "challenging," "difficult" and "weak" -- turned almost ebullient about the company's health care division. Sales at the unit, which makes stethoscopes, medical tape and other equipment and supplies, rose 9 percent in the third quarter and operating profits jumped 16 percent.
"Health care continues to be a great business," Mr. Burgstahler said. "We see solid and steady growth well into the future."
Wall Street has also caught health care fever. Since early 2000, when dot-coms began looking shaky, health care companies have accounted for 20 percent of all initial offerings, up from 5 percent in 1998 and 1999, according to Thomson Financial, a New York company that analyzes market data. The market for initial offerings was virtually closed from mid-August until early October, when some companies began to test the waters -- many in health care. The Amerigroup Corporation, a managed care company, was the latest to go public, and its shares closed at $18.95 on Friday, up from their $17 offering price on Wednesday.
Of course, a word of caution may be necessary. Recessions have often bred heady predictions for health care because it is a not particularly cyclical industry, and some of those predictions have not exactly come true.
In 1993, as the country was slowly emerging from recession, the government projected that health care would account for 20 percent of the nation's economic output by 2000. Instead, starting in the middle of the decade, health insurance companies were able to increase their profits by restraining medical spending, and Congress took a similar step in an effort to balance the federal budget. By the end of the 1990's, health care made up 13 percent of the nation's economy -- just as it did at the start of the decade.
Investors have become overly excited about the sector in the past. Many biotechnology companies first offered stock, with great fanfare, during the last recession. "If you go back to the early 90's, there were a whole slew of biotech deals that are trading at pennies on the dollar" now, Richard J. Peterson, the chief market strategist at Thomson Financial, said.
But analysts say that even if the most optimistic projections again prove unfounded this time, the forces propelling the sector's growth seem too strong to be fleeting. For example, most of the possible cost reductions imposed by managed care companies and the government have already happened, and any similar efforts are unlikely to succeed in the near future, analysts say. The earlier restraints lowered health care spending once but will not reduce future growth rates.
And while some predictions about the effect of mapping the human genome may also be grandiose, researchers agree that many new treatments will be possible in the decades ahead. "There's a whole new industrial revolution afoot," said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a Princeton economist who studies health care. "It will just take a little longer than people thought."
Unfortunately, many analysts say, the benefits of the health care boom will not flow evenly. In fact, some say, the very causes of the sector's growth -- the expensive new treatments science is discovering and the proven demand for them -- are also likely to widen the gap between Americans who can afford the world's best health care and the 40 million others who have no insurance to help them pay their bills.
ALREADY, with profits falling and premiums rising, companies are discussing shifting a greater share of health care costs to employees. And new medical clinics are popping up, promising to bypass the headaches of managed care in exchange for an annual fee of a few thousand dollars -- for starters.
"The health care sector will expand," said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a research group in Menlo Park, Calif. "The irony of that is that it will only make it harder to solve our long-term health problems."
Of course, the extent of those problems depends largely on the health of the economy, which itself is likely to depend even more on health care.

HEADLINE: The World: The Untold Story; 
Why They Don't Know Us

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN KINZER 

 BODY:
IN the 1980's, when Pakistan was considered a cold war battleground, American cultural centers were a focus of intellectual and social life in Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Hyderabad and Peshawar. Each offered well-stocked libraries, discussion groups led by visiting Americans and a stream of cultural programs. In Lahore, the country's most sophisticated city, singers from the Metropolitan Opera created a sensation, and there were long lines for a show of posters of American paintings. 
 But after Soviet troops withdrew from neighboring Afghanistan in 1989, the United States began losing interest in Pakistan. Following a series of budget cuts in Washington, five American cultural centers there were either closed or greatly reduced in scope. The ideals, history and cultural vibrancy of the United States were taken off display for millions of Pakistanis. Now, thousands of young people live at fundamentalist academies where they learn nothing but how to chant the Koran and hate the infidel. 
 Pakistan is only one of many countries where the United States cut its public diplomacy programs in the early and mid-1990's. In Turkey, another Muslim country on whose friendship the United States counts heavily, the American consulate and cultural center in Izmir were shut, and American libraries in Ankara and Istanbul gave away most of their books and closed their doors to the public. 
Across the Arab world, where anti-Western propaganda is a radio staple, Voice of America broadcasts are barely audible and reach less than 2 percent of the population in the 22 countries to which they are beamed. Security concerns contributed to the decline of exchange and information programs in a few countries, among them Egypt and Lebanon, but the key factor was Washington's loss of interest.
It would be naive to suggest that the United States just has a public-relations problem. Much anti-Americanism springs from grievances over issues of foreign and economic policy. Nonetheless, the United States has a story to tell, one that includes episodes of idealism, noble sacrifice and the nurturing of values integral to human freedom. 
But as the world population rose during the 1990's, especially in turbulent Muslim countries, America lost interest in telling that story.
During the cold war, much of Washington, from members of Congress to covert C.I.A. operatives, agreed on the need to promote American values abroad. But after the collapse of Soviet power, some Americans came to believe that serious ideological conflict had vanished from the world, and with it any need to address ordinary people in foreign countries. 
The current federal budget, which allots $370 billion for the military, gives $22 billion for all nonmilitary spending abroad, including foreign aid grants, radio projects like Voice of America, and the budgets of the State Department and United States Information Agency. 
Funding for foreign exchange programs, measured in constant dollars, fell by nearly one-third from 1993 to 2000, from $298 million to $211 million. This year it rose slightly, to $232 million. 
NOW, policy makers in Washington have begun listening again to advocates of cultural exchange and public diplomacy. Those advocates believe, in the words of Allan Goodman, president of the agency that administers Fulbright scholarships, that "the only way we're going to reduce hatred for America is by giving people some perception of our society, some opportunity to see who we really are."
Diplomats and other specialists have also been discussing ways the United States could gradually regain intellectual influence in places like Pakistan. Suggestions range from translating American books and magazines to designating a diplomat at every American embassy to work full-time with the local education ministry to assure that teachers and textbooks present a fair view of the United States. 
But many specialists say that the best chance for long-term impact lies with programs that are in place but poorly funded. Exchanges that link American students and mayors and entrepreneurs with counterparts abroad, for example, operate on budgets equivalent to those of 1968, when the world had 40 percent fewer people and dozens fewer nations. The State Department's visitors program is bringing fewer than 5,000 people to the United States this year. The Fulbright program, established in 1946 "to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries," has 4,500 slots. This year there are 56 available for exchanges with Egypt, 29 for Nigeria and 26 for Pakistan.
SOME of the most promising State Department exchange programs, like one aimed at high school students, are open only to citizens of formerly Communist countries. There is growing support for the idea of creating similar ones for Muslim countries. Michael McCarry, a former diplomat who now heads an alliance of exchange programs, is urging the State Department to spend $50 to $75 million on a new "exchange initiative for the Islamic world."
"These programs are essential to preventing future wars, particularly wars where the adversaries are not states but individuals who might participate in terror networks," said David L. Phillips, a former United Nations adviser who is now deputy director of the Center for Preventive Action, a conflict resolution group in New York. "Public diplomacy targets civil society and creates an environment where mutual understanding is possible. If there is a wall between you and your adversaries and there's no way to understand them, you're going to demonize them. Then it's easier to act aggressively."
"The alternative is a process that requires constant contact at all levels so people understand where we're coming from," he said. "It is very effective in reaching out not only to elites but to people who matter, people who if left alone might even become antagonists. Contact gives a basis for cooperation, and contact in sports, culture, among businessmen or anyone else breaks down negative stereotypes and ultimately works its way into the political domain."

HEADLINE: An Unchanging Need 

 BODY:
Few of us have ever seen anything like the outpouring of charity that has occurred since Sept. 11. There is simply no way to overstate the warmth behind that effusion of aid, which includes more than $45 million given to The New York Times 9/11 Neediest Fund, established in the days just after the World Trade Center attack.
 But as people have responded to the crisis in Lower Manhattan, they have given less to other charities and institutions. Nearly every nonprofit organization that relies on donations has felt the impact. Yet their missions have not changed, and the severity of need never lessens. Terrorism created a whole new rank of victims who require assistance. They join the already existing ranks of New Yorkers whose own chronic suffering -- from sickness, poverty, abuse and the downshifting of the economy -- formed a nearly invisible backdrop to the suffering caused by that terrible day. 
 Now and in the months ahead, it is critical that desperate New Yorkers who have traditionally been helped by seasonal contributions to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund do not become ancillary victims of Sept. 11. Their need is no less great for the sudden need of others, or because it evolved in ways that were unconnected with terrorism. Some people have talked about a kind of charitable fatigue resulting from the outpouring of money to victims of Sept. 11. With luck, what may really result is a charitable education, a better understanding of how significant a role public giving can really play. We take pride in the swiftness and magnitude of our response to the World Trade Center tragedy. We should take the same pride in our magnanimity to New Yorkers whose needs don't arise from a single day, whose need is always with us.
Last year, readers contributed a record $8 million to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, now in its 90th year. That money was used to assist the work of seven charitable organizations in New York, without any administrative costs to them. Those charities include the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service; the Children's Aid Society; the Community Service Society of New York; the Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens; the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York; the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies; and the UJA-Federation of New York. 
The Neediest Cases Fund welcomes your contribution, which can be sent directly to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, P.O. Box 5193, General Post Office, New York, N.Y. 10087, or made online at www.nytimesneediest.charitywave.com.

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
Troubled Times for the Whole World

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
FROM Washington to London to Frankfurt, the world's economic policy makers spoke with one voice last week, and their tone was not reassuring.
 On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate for the 10th time this year, to its lowest level in four decades, in yet another attempt to restart the American economy. On Thursday, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank cut their own rates more than expected. The only major central bank missing was the Bank of Japan, but its rate was already close to zero. 
 For the first time in more than 20 years, each of the world's largest economies appears to be in a recession or headed toward one. Unemployment is rising. Factory orders are falling. Both consumers and corporate managers are reluctant to spend money because they are uncertain about the future. Pick a country -- Taiwan or the United States, Argentina or France -- and the description is likely to fit.
This, it seems, will be one of the main legacies of the technology boom of the 1990's. Rather than repealing the business cycle, as its advocates suggested it could, the new economy -- with its various investment bubbles -- has done what only an oil shock had seemed capable of in recent times. "This is the giant tech wreck," said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company, an investment firm.
That wreck, aggravated by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, has ended two decades during which there has always an economy strong enough to give lagging nations a lift by buying their products. In the late 1990's, it was United States bolstering Asia; in 1990-91, it was Japan helping the United States.
This year, by contrast, "the whole house of cards fell at once," Lakshman R. Achuthan, the managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute in New York, said. As a result, he said, "the decline we've had so far will get worse before it gets better."
The fallout is likely to affect global politics over the next year in a way that is second only to the war on terrorism. It will shape much of the debate in the midterm elections in the United States, which will determine which party controls a narrowly divided Congress. The recession will also change the terms of the sometimes violent argument over globalization.
"People took a well-functioning global economy for granted in the last decade," said Daniel Yergin, an author and the chairman of an energy consulting firm. 
Now, governments will face conflicting calls to soften the downturn through new regulation and to restart growth by opening the world's borders further. Mr. Yergin noted the decades-long trend toward trade liberalization arguably had its roots in the Great Depression, and the global recession caused by the oil shock of the mid-1970's led to the creation of the industrial nations group known as the G-7.
Even before the latest round of global trade talks opened on Friday in Doha, Qatar, the leaders of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank argued for the removal of tariffs and quotas. "At this critical juncture for the world economy," the two said in a joint statement, "a strong commitment to continue opening world markets will provide a much-needed boost to confidence and global growth prospects."
The problem is that when the world's pie is not growing, debates over dividing it become fiercer. Poorer countries -- which now manufacture many of the world's goods -- are particularly wary of policies that could harm them in the short term. Manufacturing is usually the most volatile sector in a downturn, and those countries have been hit especially hard by the collapse of technology investment this year.
"The U.S., Europe and to some extent Japan can control their own destinies," Alan S. Blinder, the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, said. But smaller nations, like Argentina, cannot. "To some extent, they're innocent victims in all this," he said.
When the world's weaker economies are troubled, larger countries can often lead them out of it, much as the United States helped Asia recover from its late-1990's crisis by buying so many of its products. In fact, by 1999, nearly every region of the world was growing. 
But with no large struggling economies to keep prices down by selling cheap exports, Mr. Achuthan said, central banks began to worry that demand would overwhelm supply, setting off inflation. So the banks raised their rates, choking off growth by making debt payments more onerous and future loans more expensive. Oil prices began rising too, leaving businesses and consumers with less to spend on other goods.
Most important of all, though, people believed that technology -- in the form of global computer networks -- had changed the economic rules by making business endlessly more productive, and hence more profitable. Stock markets gained 20 percent, or more, a year, and companies spent billions on new equipment.
Then the reckoning came. Orders for Finland's cellphones and Singapore's circuit boards plummeted. Corporate profits began to fall, as did share prices, leaving investors with much less money to spend. Companies that had vastly increased their capacity could not profitably sell all their products.
On top of all that, the attacks of Sept. 11 brought the economy of the United States to a temporary standstill and continue to affect people's confidence, and willingness to spend money, even in Europe. New security measures have also slowed business.
This recession is young enough that broad measures of the global economy have not yet fallen as far as they did during some other recent downturns -- even regionalized ones, like the English-speaking recession of 1990-91, which afflicted Australia, England and the United States. But economists say they are on their way. 
WHEN the recession will end, and how bad it will eventually be, is difficult to predict because the world has not experienced something like this since at least the oil shock of 1979 and -- given that Japan continued to grow through most of it -- perhaps not since the energy crisis of 1973-75. Most forecasters and government officials believe the downturn will not be nearly as painful as the the one in the mid-1970's. Central banks are acting forcefully to lower interest rates, and many companies have reduced their stockpile of unsold goods.
For now, though, there are few signs of turnaround, especially in the country where the new-economy bubble popped the loudest. And until the United States economy begins growing again, analysts say, the rest of world will struggle as well.
"The recession started here and was exported elsewhere," Mr. Barbera said. "The recovery has to start here too."
